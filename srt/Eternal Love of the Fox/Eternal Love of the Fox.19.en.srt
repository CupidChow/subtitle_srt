1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,880
Gao Wei just received news

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,020
that Feng Mochen is leaving the palace
tomorrow on some business.

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,520
That's the perfect time for you to strike.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,200
If you miss out on that window,

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,780
there might not be

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,460
another opportunity.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,060
This operation

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,220
is in your father's best interests.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,920
You'd hate to see him being

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,820
taken down by Huo Xiangjiu one day, right?

11
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,940
I had a dream.

12
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,520
You were in it.

13
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,680
What was I doing

14
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
in your dream?

15
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,680
I dreamed...

16
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,860
that you were gazing at me amidst a crowd.

17
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,170
The look in your eyes...

18
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,490
seemed to be saying that we had been apart
for hundreds of years.

19
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,020
How did you react?

20
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,480
It appeared...

21
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,480
that I didn't know you at all.

22
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,820
Honey!

23
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,340
Yes!

24
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,060
Look.

25
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,020
It's pretty.

26
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,520
How much is it, sir?

27
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,200
He left so early.

28
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,700
Let go of me!

29
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,840
Lian!

30
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,340
Let go of me!

31
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,850
Brother Fuying!

32
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,080
Lian!

33
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,120
Gongsun Hao!

34
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,000
Gongsun Hao.

35
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Gongsun Hao, stay!

36
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,200
Listen to me, Gongsun Hao.

37
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,800
I used to be your superior, right?

38
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I need you to plead for mercy
from Brother Fuying for me.

39
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,280
Or...

40
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,360
arrange a meeting for me and my sister.

41
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,159
Don't go!

42
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,159
I treated you quite well,

43
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,760
didn't I?

44
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,840
You can't just ignore me.

45
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,040
You owe me gratitude!

46
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,500
How dare you, Gongsun Hao.

47
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,300
You...

48
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,720
Gongsun Hao,

49
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,600
you're coveting on my job
as head of all guards, right?

50
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,800
You're just taking this chance

51
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,640
to replace me!

52
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,080
People like you, who ride on

53
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,960
their families' coattails

54
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,000
and act all high and mighty,

55
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,200
are the kind I despise most!

56
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,960
You bastard!

57
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,840
Mr. Song,

58
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,960
I have to attend to a matter
for His Highness now.

59
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,220
If it's delayed by you,

60
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,640
expulsion won't be the only consequence
you'll have to bear.

61
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,460
I suggest you be more considerate
of your sister.

62
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,320
Try not to cause trouble for her again.

63
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,180
Tread lightly.

64
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,200
You will be the victim
of your own evildoing.

65
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,400
Who do you think you are

66
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,530
to tell me what to do?

67
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,260
Watch out,
for a carriage might run you over today!

68
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,960
Shame on you

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,940
for kicking me

70
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,940
when I'm down!

71
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,580
Even you have the gall to bully me!

72
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,700
Mao Jin,

73
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,800
why didn't you go with Old Fox?

74
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,000
Master ordered me

75
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,200
to guard you and stay close to you.

76
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,100
Don't be so tense.

77
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,800
The Crown Prince can't be so stupid

78
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,880
as to have me killed
in broad daylight, right?

79
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,000
Better safe than sorry.

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,280
We can never be too careful.

81
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,560
You're Master's most treasured person now.

82
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,320
If anything happens to you,

83
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,680
Master will have me...

84
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,480
Mao Jin!

85
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,580
Mao Jin!

86
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,200
Mao Jin!

87
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,020
Have you heard a sound?

88
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,480
No.

89
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,160
Mao Jin!

90
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,600
You wait here.

91
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,680
I'll be right back!

92
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,200
I heard from Lian

93
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,400
that you're devising

94
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,000
a plan to help her out of here.

95
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,280
That's right.

96
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,480
Thank you so much,

97
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,600
Miss Xiangjiu.

98
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,260
Don't mention it.

99
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm only doing Lian

100
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,760
a favor.

101
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,140
Soon, you won't be

102
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
bothered with her affairs anymore.

103
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,000
Gao Wei just received news

104
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,020
that Feng Mochen is leaving the palace
tomorrow on some business.

105
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,660
That's the perfect time for you to strike.

106
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,760
My son, why are you dressed
so formally today?

107
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,120
I heard Lord Feng went out
to seek medicine for you today, Father.

108
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,920
I really missed you, so I decided

109
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,260
to pay you a visit.

110
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,660
You're making it

111
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,060
sound like I've neglected you.

112
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,360
You're welcome

113
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,440
to my place anytime.

114
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,220
Sometimes I truly envy Lord Feng,

115
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,600
for being your go-to guy on every task

116
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,080
and for being the listener

117
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,680
of your innermost thoughts.

118
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,180
I really don't know

119
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,380
what I have to do

120
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,020
to earn the spot he holds in your heart.

121
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,360
In this world,

122
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,040
everyone is faced with two challenges.

123
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,600
One

124
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,480
is to know one's own place.

125
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,520
The other one

126
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,120
is to be content with what one has.

127
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,680
I...

128
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
get it.

129
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,900
No matter what I do,

130
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
I won't be able to replace Lord Feng.

131
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,620
Miss Xiangjiu,

132
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,080
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,200
Gongsun Hao!

134
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,760
Let go of me...

135
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,880
I have no choice.

136
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,080
Old Fox!

137
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,360
Help...

138
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,360
I'm sorry.

139
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Old Fox...

140
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
help me.

141
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,780
Old Fox!

142
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,460
Help me!

143
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,780
Old Fox...

144
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,800
Come help me...

145
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,520
Help me...

146
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,460
Demon!

147
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,760
There's a demon!

148
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,400
It's a demon!

149
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,900
There's a demon!

150
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,860
There's a demon!

151
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,020
Nothing...

152
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,980
but the cruel hand of fate is to blame.

153
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,760
Bad news!

154
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,880
Your Majesty!

155
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,880
There's bad news.

156
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,240
Princess Consort's brother

157
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,520
is yelling and screaming in the palace,

158
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,280
claiming to have seen

159
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,160
Lord Feng in Fucang Palace

160
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,960
in the form of a demon!

161
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,560
Old Fox!

162
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,460
Old Fox, what happened to you?

163
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,220
Turn around.

164
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,540
Recite a poem,

165
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,180
and I'll be fine.

166
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,700
What?

167
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,880
Recite a poem.

168
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,700
Got it.

169
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,180
Afield the creeping grass,

170
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,680
with crystal dew overspread.

171
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,840
There's a beautiful lass,

172
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,770
with clear eyes and fine forehead.

173
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,170
No, wrong order.

174
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,580
Afield the creeping grass,

175
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,240
with crystal dew overspread.

176
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,460
There's a beautiful lass,

177
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,390
with fine forehead and clear eyes.

178
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,990
When I meet the clear-eyed,

179
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,390
my desire is satisfied.

180
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,590
Afield the creeping grass,

181
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,060
with dewdrops overspread.

182
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,040
There's a beautiful lass,

183
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,380
with clear eyes and fine forehead.

184
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,960
When I meet the clear-eyed,

185
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,360
amid the grass let's hide.

186
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,630
Afield the creeping grass,

187
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,600
with crystal dew overspread.

188
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,520
There's a beautiful lass,

189
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,850
with fine forehead and clear eyes.

190
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,060
When I meet the clear-eyed,

191
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,500
my desire is satisfied.

192
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,490
Afield the creeping grass,

193
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,780
with dewdrops overspread.

194
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,640
There's a beautiful lass,

195
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,290
with clear eyes and fine forehead.

196
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,640
When I meet the clear-eyed,

197
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,540
amid the grass let's hide.

198
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,860
Sir,

199
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,660
how may I help you?

200
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,220
You must be thirsty.

201
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,960
Honey!

202
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,319
We have a guest!

203
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,640
Come on.

204
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,339
Come with me.

205
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,300
Forgo the formalities.

206
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,280
Come on.

207
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,140
Honey,

208
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,140
we have a guest.

209
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,600
Make yourself at home.

210
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,760
Please have a seat.

211
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,260
Be seated.

212
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,460
Just relax.

213
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,720
Have some water.

214
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,920
Sorry we can't offer much.

215
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,960
Have some persimmons.

216
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,740
Thank you.

217
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,770
Wipe your sweat.

218
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,320
How may we call you?

219
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,980
In Chinese,

220
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,880
my surname means wind,

221
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,780
and my given name means ink and dust.

222
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,860
What a good name.

223
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,220
Mr. Wind.

224
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,580
Is your name...

225
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,980
Feng Mochen?

226
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,080
Mr. Feng,

227
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,500
my surname is Cao,

228
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,980
and my given name is Yuan.

229
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,660
This is my wife, Yaoqing.

230
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,260
Yaoqing?

231
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,100
Sounds lovely.

232
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,540
You must be kidding, Mr. Feng.

233
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,660
People residing in mountains

234
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,390
like us rarely have nice names.

235
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,580
Mr. Feng, may I ask

236
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,780
what brings you here?

237
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,220
Judging from how you're dressed...

238
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,750
Are you here to do business?

239
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,860
No, I'm looking for someone.

240
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,860
A missing person?

241
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,360
My husband is straightforward.

242
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,860
Hope you won't take offense.

243
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,660
Yes.

244
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,820
Forgive me, Mr. Feng.

245
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,620
It's alright.

246
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,060
You're actually correct, Mr. Cao.

247
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,900
I'm looking for a missing person.

248
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,460
Who in your family got lost?

249
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,710
The woman I love.

250
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,960
Did she run away with another man?

251
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,040
Stop it.

252
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,980
Mr. Cao...

253
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,900
you're correct again.

254
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,380
Honey,

255
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,100
I'm smart, aren't I?

256
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,600
Mr. Feng,

257
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,620
don't...

258
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,820
don't be disheartened.

259
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,280
I believe you'll find her.

260
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,340
I've already seen her again.

261
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,580
You have?

262
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,220
Well,

263
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,900
will she go home with you?

264
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,660
I don't know.

265
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,180
She and that other man...

266
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,120
are leading a happy life.

267
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,240
I chose not to intrude.

268
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,220
Mr. Feng,

269
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,500
harsh though it may sound,

270
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,940
I must say you're being silly.

271
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,580
Who cares if they are happy or not?

272
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,820
If you truly love that woman,

273
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,480
then be brave and win her over.

274
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,320
Happiness...

275
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,460
is earned.

276
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,550
Waiting won't work.

277
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,960
Mr. Cao,

278
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,560
do you really think that way?

279
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,980
Of course!

280
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
In that case,

281
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,740
I will...

282
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,260
I beg to differ.

283
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,980
If that woman you love

284
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,160
is living happily with someone else,

285
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,160
then it means

286
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,920
she's not in love with you.

287
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,800
Suppose

288
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,260
you did get her back,

289
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,760
she wouldn't be happy.

290
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,000
Neither would you.

291
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,200
Rather than make you both miserable,

292
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,740
why not let her go with your blessing?

293
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,340
That's a good point, honey.

294
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,500
Mr. Feng,

295
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,420
don't be upset.

296
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,340
As the saying goes,

297
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,020
there are plenty of other "dishes"
in the sea.

298
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,820
It's "fish."

299
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,260
Right.

300
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,320
There are plenty of other fish in the sea.

301
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
If you don't mind,

302
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,820
why not settle in here?

303
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,980
The house next to ours...

304
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,680
The house next to ours

305
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,140
used to belong to a family.

306
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,140
They joined the army, fought in war,

307
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,800
and all passed away years ago.

308
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,860
Their house has been vacant thereafter.

309
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,320
Mr. Feng, if you live here,

310
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,820
my wife and I will definitely

311
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,380
help you find a good wife.

312
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,380
Mr. Feng!

313
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,580
Mr. Feng!

314
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,660
Be careful.

315
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,940
Dinner is ready.

316
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,140
Come eat!

317
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,060
Mr. Feng,

318
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,820
these are the new linens Yaoqing and I got
when we tied the knot.

319
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,620
Take them.

320
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,740
They are all clean.

321
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,380
Put them away

322
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,140
and come eat.

323
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,270
There's meat today.

324
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,160
Be quick!

325
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,460
Honey, you love this.

326
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,320
Here,

327
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,300
more for you.

328
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,470
There's another piece.

329
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,040
Eat up.

330
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,170
I've got enough.

331
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,220
Mr. Feng,

332
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,060
dig in.

333
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,730
Don't just look at the food.

334
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,080
Let me serve you some.

335
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,860
Eat up.

336
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,180
I...

337
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,240
don't like green vegetables.

338
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,180
Got it.

339
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,160
Help yourself then.

340
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,420
Make yourself at home.

341
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,420
Cao Yuan,

342
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,260
your wife's so beautiful.

343
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,470
What a pity that she's with you.

344
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,720
Yaoqing,

345
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,100
would you consider marrying me?

346
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,140
Marry you?

347
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,100
Don't hurt me!

348
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,920
Marry you, huh?

349
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,740
That was a joke!

350
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,400
Stop running!

351
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,640
Stay away from me, Cao Yuan!

352
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,620
Let me marry you then!

353
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,880
That was just a joke!

354
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,940
Stop running!

355
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,940
I don't think he'd enjoy this now.

356
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,580
Freeze!

357
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,060
Stop running!

358
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,460
Honey,

359
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,220
look.

360
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,990
Look at this one.

361
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,200
Aren't these two just like us?

362
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,980
Yes.

363
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,250
Here you are.

364
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,710
Have some water.

365
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,980
Honey,

366
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,240
why did you come out?

367
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,820
I'm fine.

368
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,460
Come over.

369
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Sit down and rest.

370
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,500
Slowly.

371
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,660
There you go.

372
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,140
Are you alright?

373
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,820
Hurry.

374
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,780
Slide that

375
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,900
back a bit.

376
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,140
Done.

377
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,200
I'm having a cramp.

378
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,920
Feeling better now?

379
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,880
Yes.

380
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,340
I told you not to come out.

381
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,980
The baby's kicking me.

382
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,380
Really?

383
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,200
It's true.

384
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,160
What do you think

385
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,340
we should name our baby?

386
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,340
People say that children

387
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,320
with vulgar names grow sturdier.

388
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,180
Well...

389
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,420
Let's call our kid "Hulk."

390
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,140
I wish for him or her
to grow tall and strong.

391
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,080
How about...

392
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,100
"Hammer"?

393
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,580
"Hammer"?

394
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,060
A good name indeed.

395
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,470
But it doesn't sound very nice.

396
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,400
I wonder if our baby is a boy or a girl.

397
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,200
Mr. Feng,

398
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,360
I'm going to be a father soon,

399
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,160
yet you're still not married.

400
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,090
So you don't like any of those girls

401
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,760
introduced to you?

402
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,140
Mr. Feng.

403
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,320
Are you secretly...

404
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,540
jealous of me?

405
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,200
Are you alright, honey?

406
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,440
I was just kidding.

407
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,360
Mr. Feng, I was kidding.

408
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,520
Let's eat.

409
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,640
You should have this too.

410
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,440
Don't worry.

411
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,560
Don't fret.

412
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,560
Relax.

413
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,040
How is my wife?

414
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,960
Congratulations.

415
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,690
Your wife and son are both well.

416
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,200
Mr. Feng,

417
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,480
watch the baby for me.

418
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,810
I'll go check on my wife.

419
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,510
It's time we sent our son to school.

420
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,560
Yet this is all the money we have.

421
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,200
How about postponing it
for two more years?

422
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,360
We will

423
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,880
surely send him to school.

424
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,480
I'll try to

425
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,480
bring more firewood from the mountain.

426
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,120
Great.

427
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,600
And I'll try selling

428
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,200
our home-grown vegetables.

429
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,220
I'll also go hunting when I have time.

430
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,240
Don't you worry.

431
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,920
I'll make more lanterns then.

432
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,400
Dad, Mom,

433
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
what's this?

434
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,280
This...

435
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,720
This...

436
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,480
This is...

437
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,320
Who lost it?

438
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,920
Its owner must be worried sick.

439
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,320
Yes.

440
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,000
Honey,

441
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,800
you stay put.

442
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,580
I'll send it to the magistrate's office.

443
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,780
Sure. Off you go.

444
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,440
Stay safe on the road!

445
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,100
Rest assured, honey!

446
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,440
Come on.

447
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,020
Feed the ducks with Mom.

448
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,080
Say this: coo-coo, coo-coo!

449
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,980
Mr. Feng!

450
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,580
Mr. Feng,

451
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,380
Cao accidentally fell off

452
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,780
a cliff when he was hunting
in the mountain.

453
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,220
Yaoqing,

454
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,260
why not reconsider

455
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,280
marrying me?

456
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,820
Get lost!

457
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
I'd sooner be dead

458
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,750
than marry another man!

459
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,680
You are a widow now.

460
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
Marrying me

461
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,150
is actually an honor for you. You know?

462
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,420
I can earn a living myself.

463
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,940
I don't need this so-called honor!

464
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,700
Go away!

465
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,340
Is it a gift for me?

466
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,860
Don't leave!

467
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,400
Yaoqing,

468
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,620
why not think about my proposal?

469
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,660
Open up!

470
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,940
Listen to me,

471
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,260
you're a widow now.

472
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,700
And you're so pretty.

473
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,540
I haven't got married even once.

474
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,540
What's not good about being my wife?

475
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,710
Who is it?

476
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
Ghost!

477
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,230
There's a ghost!

478
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,260
Help!

479
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,880
There's a ghost!

480
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,840
The broom has become a demon!

481
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,780
Help!

482
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,860
Mr. Feng.

483
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,040
Yes?

484
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,100
A widow is an easy target for gossip.

485
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,820
From now on,

486
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,950
don't do these things anymore.

487
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,380
Got it.

488
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,460
Also, don't come here again.

489
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,720
Got it.

490
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,600
Honey,

491
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,340
this wooden horse is for our son to ride.

492
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,610
It's time we sent our son to school.

493
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,220
This is all the money we have.

494
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,020
We will

495
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,580
surely send him to school.

496
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,040
I'll try to bring more firewood
from the mountain.

497
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,320
I'll make more lanterns then.

498
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,380
I'll also go hunting when I have time.

499
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,760
Honey, you love this.

500
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,600
Here,

501
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,330
more for you.

502
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,820
Little White Fox,

503
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,740
do you like the Moon Palace?

504
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,900
It's said that there live
Chang'e and the Jade Rabbit.

505
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,340
I truly envy them.

506
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,030
Chang'e and the Jade Rabbit
get to stay there.

507
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,460
You and I can reach there too, right?

508
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,820
I really wish I was there.

509
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,180
I believe

510
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,180
that place can bring people much joy.

511
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,460
Mr. Feng.

512
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,100
I didn't cross the boundary.

513
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,060
It's not about that.

514
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,460
I need a favor

515
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,340
from you.

516
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:50,780
Oh.

517
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,820
My son

518
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,550
is going to take the imperial exam
in the capital.

519
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,620
As you know,

520
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,100
just like Cao,

521
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,120
he's kind-hearted by nature.

522
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,440
I'm worried that he might get in trouble

523
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,800
when he travels to the capital alone.

524
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,580
You're experienced and knowledgeable.

525
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,020
Could you go with him?

526
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,240
He's the only child of Cao and me.

527
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,180
If you accompany him to the capital,

528
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,040
my mind will be set at ease.

529
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,420
Why don't you go with him?

530
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,420
This is the home of Cao and me.

531
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,000
If I'm away,

532
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,820
I'm afraid he might feel lonely.

533
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,220
Besides,

534
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,320
I'm capable of nothing.

535
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,040
I don't want to be a burden to my son.

536
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,440
If he's lucky enough

537
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,100
to excel in the exam

538
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,420
and gain a position in the court,

539
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,300
please stay with him,

540
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,380
watch him,

541
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,680
and encourage him to be
an upstanding official.

542
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,700
I'll do it.

543
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,260
Then my son...

544
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,820
is entrusted to you.

545
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,420
I'd like to thank you

546
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,500
on Cao's behalf.

547
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,860
Mr. Feng...

548
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,320
Is that you, Mr. Feng?

549
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,800
Yes, it's me.

550
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,240
We've been apart for many years.

551
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,560
How come...

552
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,200
you haven't aged at all?

553
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,900
I dare not get old,

554
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,120
since I'm afraid you can't recognize me.

555
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,440
Your son didn't let you down.

556
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,800
He's an upstanding official now.

557
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,000
All locals in the place

558
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,330
managed by him consider him fair and just.

559
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,570
But he has always regretted

560
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,590
not fulfilling his filial duties as a son.

561
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,000
He has sent many people to bring me

562
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,480
to him, but I declined.

563
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,120
I'm afraid Cao will feel lonely

564
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,640
if I leave here.

565
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,640
Please tell my son

566
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,050
that by being an upstanding official,

567
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,100
he has already fulfilled
his filial duties.

568
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,660
I'll tell him that.

569
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,000
Mr. Feng,

570
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,520
there's always

571
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,280
a question in my mind.

572
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,340
Years ago, why did you stay here

573
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,200
and go out of your way
to help our family so selflessly?

574
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,240
What's the real reason?

575
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,140
I did all that for the woman I love.

576
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,520
Oh, you,

577
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,760
so fond of

578
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,160
making jokes.

579
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,360
Thank you...

580
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,480
for letting me

581
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,880
see you for one last time.

582
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,260
How very nice.

583
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,500
How very nice.

584
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,210
You're shedding tears.

585
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,450
You must be in agony, right?

586
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,480
Fuying,

587
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,840
is your brother-in-law

588
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,520
just talking nonsense?

589
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,000
Father,

590
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,260
I've heard that the Demon Master

591
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,940
at Qingfeng Temple outside the city

592
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,940
has a tool called the Universe Ring,

593
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,600
which can make all demons
show their real forms.

594
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,320
We will figure out if Lord Feng

595
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,520
is a human or a demon as long as

596
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,760
we invite the Demon Master over.

597
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,220
Why would this happen?

598
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,880
Is someone trying to harm you?

599
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,040
During cultivation,

600
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,970
such minor injuries

601
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,560
are no big deal at all.

602
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,040
Does it happen a lot?

603
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,400
Once

604
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,530
in a thousand years.

605
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,520
Is it true?

606
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,860
Sorry to have frightened you.

607
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,440
Is...

608
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,460
Is becoming

609
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,060
an immortal

610
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,720
really that important to you?

611
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,680
Immortality

612
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,780
is my destination,

613
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,920
not my goal.

614
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,560
Then what's your goal?

615
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,000
Though this only happens once
in a thousand years,

616
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,960
you have to endure unfathomable pain
on the path to immortality.

617
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,160
Whatever your goal is,

618
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,140
is there any point
in bearing such torture?

619
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:15,780
Besides,

620
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,980
what's so good about being an immortal?

621
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,160
Immortals can't do anything

622
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,940
even when they see people suffer.

623
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,580
They can't bring salvation to people

624
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,600
or do whatever they like.

625
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,560
Old Fox,

626
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,410
why must you persist in
gaining immortality?

627
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,000
Yes.

628
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,960
There isn't

629
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,130
much good about being an immortal.

630
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,020
Then...

631
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,440
Can you promise

632
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,020
to give up the quest for immortality?

633
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,040
Just...

634
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,040
lead an ordinary life

635
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,080
as an ordinary human.

636
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,040
When I find my father,

637
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,200
let's move

638
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,920
to

639
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,120
the countryside,

640
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,450
where we'll have children,

641
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,520
farm, and weave.

642
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,360
Isn't it just nice to spend

643
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,260
the rest of our lives together

644
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,250
as two ordinary people?

645
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,660
Yes, it's nice.

646
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,450
It's wonderful.

647
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,800
I crave nothing

648
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,560
but a life like that.

649
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,120
Then it's a deal.

650
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,700
You'll quit cultivation.

651
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,040
Yes, I will.

652
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,940
Great.

653
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,520
Xiangjiu!

654
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,180
Wily Fox!

655
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,760
Xiangjiu!

656
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,080
Wily Fox!

657
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,600
Xiangjiu!

658
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,360
Wily Fox!

659
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,660
Did Wily Fox flee with Xiangjiu?

660
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,520
It's a good thing if he did.

661
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,600
Otherwise,

662
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,860
the world will be in chaos.

663
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:53,840
Master,

664
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,560
bad news!

665
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,760
What did I tell you before?

666
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,920
I asked you to guard her
and stick with her!

667
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,240
Please don't be mad, Master.

668
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,440
It's all my fault.

669
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,120
I didn't imagine

670
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,290
that they'd try to distract me.

671
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,440
But, Master,

672
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,620
do you know what happened to me

673
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,360
after I was tricked away?

674
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,360
Le Ning!

675
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,260
Mao Jin!

676
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,200
Le Ning!

677
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,380
Le Ning?

678
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,140
Mao Jin!

679
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,080
Where are you, Le Ning?

680
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,870
Isn't it the place I first entered?

681
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,260
I dealt with him for a long time

682
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,560
before finally making an escape.

683
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,170
Bai Yu's no match for him

684
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,800
in terms of magic power.

685
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,040
There must be

686
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,370
another cultivator in the palace.

687
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,840
Old Fox,

688
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,760
do you remember

689
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,690
what happened to us in the Cold Palace?

690
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,020
We're up against

691
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,800
either a human...

692
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,120
or a demon.
