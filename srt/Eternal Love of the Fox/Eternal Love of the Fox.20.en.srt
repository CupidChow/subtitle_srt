1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,280
That wily fox didn't run away with Xiangjiu, did he?

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,460
It might be for the best if they did.

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,340
Otherwise,

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,710
the world will fall into chaos.

5
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,420
Your Highness...

6
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,700
Why are you...

7
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,510
looking at me like that?

8
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,820
I've heard that Lord Feng is a demon.

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,710
You're not a demon too, are you?

10
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,600
Your Highness must be joking.

11
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,420
As the saying goes, "The Master does not speak of supernatural matters."

12
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,500
There are no such things as demons or evil spirits in this world.

13
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,430
It's nothing but baseless rumors.

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,640
Then swear it.

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,360
If you're lying to me,

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,800
may your bloodline be cursed:

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,520
may your sons be slaves for generations,

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,100
and your daughters be prostitutes forever!

19
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,960
Swearing oaths is also

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,450
part of such superstitious nonsense.

21
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,720
They are meaningless.

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,450
Since they're meaningless...

23
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,780
why don't you dare to swear?

24
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,400
Your Highness,

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,700
trust me.

26
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,100
I would never lie to you.

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,780
There are no demons in this world.

28
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,920
Feng Mochen is not a demon either.

29
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,500
Why are you here?

30
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,120
Bai Yu,

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,760
repeat what you just said.

32
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,940
He really is a demon!

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,740
I can't believe it.

34
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,760
Haven't you known all along?

35
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,680
Your Highness,

36
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,140
although he...

37
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,300
is not human,

38
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,260
he's not scary.

39
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,980
He won't hurt you.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
What do I have to be afraid of?

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,180
In this world,

42
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,060
what could be more frightening than humans?

43
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,260
He is not human,

44
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,520
but I am.

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,500
If anyone should be afraid,

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,030
it should be him fearing me.

47
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,760
Besides,

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,400
Lord Feng has been keeping Father alive all these years.

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,360
I believe

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,360
he must be kind-hearted.

51
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,720
You shouldn't be too confident.

52
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,360
Demons are capricious and treacherous.

53
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,700
My ancestor died at his hands.

54
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,920
You must not lower your guard.

55
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,620
Bai Yu,

56
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,700
why are you still so stubborn?

57
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,140
Lord Feng, could you show me

58
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,300
your true form?

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,640
I have never seen a demon before.

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,200
I haven't been

61
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,760
feeling well lately.

62
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,300
Perhaps another time.

63
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,340
That won't do.

64
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,600
If you don't show me something today,

65
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,700
I

66
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,280
won't let it go.

67
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,600
Your Highness.

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,440
Xiangjiu,

69
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,800
you're so lucky.

70
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,480
What do you mean?

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,120
You get to pet a cat every day.

72
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,280
Not really.

73
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,440
He's a fox!

74
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,640
Isn't that the same?

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,120
Xiangjiu! Xiangjiu!

76
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,400
Everyone in the palace is saying

77
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,680
Lord Feng is a demon!

78
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,560
Tell me,

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,400
how could anyone believe such an absurd thing?

80
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,100
A demon?

81
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,280
That's just a story for toddlers.

82
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,040
Le Ning!

83
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,340
What's wrong?

84
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,820
You're stepping on...

85
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,840
my tail.

86
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,800
Le Ning!

87
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,159
Mao Jin,

88
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,000
take her back to her room and look after her.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,560
Okay!

90
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,730
Let me try once more.

91
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,980
We're off.

92
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,180
The news has already spread throughout the palace.

93
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,080
Soon, the news that you are a demon

94
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,680
will spread across the land.

95
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,100
We can't let this get out.

96
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,660
Otherwise, panic will erupt,

97
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,580
and the world will descend into chaos.

98
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,380
I'm afraid

99
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,920
the Crown Prince won't let this go.

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,850
As long as you insist you're human,

101
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,600
the Crown Prince

102
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,130
can't do anything about it.

103
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,920
That's not necessarily true.

104
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,430
There are plenty of ways

105
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,220
to force him to reveal his true form.

106
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,940
Exactly.

107
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,520
Moreover, there's currently

108
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,640
a cultivator in the palace whose true nature remains unknown.

109
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,170
How could you be so foolish?

110
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,440
Lord Feng and Xiangjiu have treated me so well,

111
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,040
and yet you dared to hurt her?

112
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,490
The Crown Prince forced me to do it.

113
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,800
I had no choice.

114
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,180
Did you truly have no choice,

115
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,040
or were you trying to eliminate a threat to your father?

116
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
You reap

117
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,240
what you sow.

118
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,740
Everyone should be responsible for their own actions.

119
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,160
If your father was truly involved in Xiangjiu's father's disappearance,

120
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,280
then let him bear the consequences.

121
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,740
Feng Mochen...

122
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,140
is a demon.

123
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,200
Why are you so calm?

124
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,880
The people I live with

125
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
are no less terrifying than demons.

126
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,179
Your Grace,

127
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,820
His Majesty requests your presence!

128
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,600
Have you heard the rumors spreading through the palace, Lord Feng?

129
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,560
I've heard something.

130
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,350
Even Miss Xiangjiu has heard about it,

131
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,040
and you haven't, Lord Feng?

132
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,690
I've heard everyone in the palace saying that...

133
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,440
Your Highness is a demon.

134
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,120
What you've heard

135
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,760
differs greatly

136
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,040
from what I've heard.

137
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,220
What rumor

138
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,620
has Your Highness heard?

139
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,360
Lord Feng

140
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,320
is a demon.

141
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,920
That does sound

142
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,480
quite different.

143
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
I wonder...

144
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,060
what Your Majesty thinks.

145
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,880
This matter

146
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,960
is absurd.

147
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,640
However,

148
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
since word has spread,

149
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,680
let's gather everyone

150
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,120
and clear things up.

151
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
Father,

152
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,720
someone witnessed it.

153
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,400
Song Yicheng!

154
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,320
Yes!

155
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,780
Greetings, Your Majesty.

156
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,260
Tell Father

157
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,700
what you saw.

158
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,440
Yes,

159
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,380
Your Highness.

160
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,860
Your Majesty,

161
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,300
at noon today,

162
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,500
I was outside a window of Fucang Palace

163
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,420
when I saw His Grace suddenly appear

164
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,900
before my very eyes!

165
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,220
And...

166
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,500
and he even had a tail!

167
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,200
And his tail...

168
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,760
was this long!

169
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,940
I-I was terrified.

170
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,580
That sounds quite vivid.

171
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,980
However,

172
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,390
there's one thing I don't understand.

173
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,540
The Fucang Palace

174
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,480
lies within the inner courtyard.

175
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,560
Outsiders are

176
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,280
usually not allowed to enter.

177
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,280
How did you end up outside the window of Fucang Palace, Mr. Song?

178
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,220
I was just passing by!

179
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,540
You just happened to be

180
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,440
passing by and happened to see

181
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,240
His Grace brazenly

182
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,120
displaying his tail

183
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,000
by an open window?

184
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,060
These trivial details

185
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,020
aren't worth pursuing.

186
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,740
Father,

187
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,380
there's a Demon Master at Qingfeng Temple outside the city.

188
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,460
His magical powers are formidable

189
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,160
and can reveal the true form of any demon.

190
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,440
Why is Your Highness in such haste?

191
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,520
Could it be that you're

192
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,200
trying to strike first

193
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,220
and cover up the truth?

194
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,030
What do you mean by that?

195
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,600
I've already mentioned

196
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,120
that there are rumors in the palace

197
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,340
saying

198
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,400
Your Highness is a demon.

199
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,720
And that's not all—

200
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,480
I also have a witness.

201
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,220
Her Highness Princess Ningshuang has arrived!

202
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,440
Greetings, Father,

203
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,320
Lord Feng,

204
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,180
and Mentor.

205
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,200
You say

206
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,280
you saw your brother in his demon form—

207
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,140
What's this all about?

208
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,460
At noon today,

209
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,920
I went to the Eastern Palace to visit him

210
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,520
and accidentally saw him

211
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,720
with...

212
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,600
s-such a large tail!

213
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,800
I was absolutely terrified!

214
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,380
Ningshuang.

215
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,940
Your lie is far too obvious.

216
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,540
Everyone in the palace knows

217
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,300
you never set foot in my palace.

218
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,500
Crown Prince,

219
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,100
do you really not know

220
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,260
why I came to your palace today?

221
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,740
Do tell, dear sister.

222
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,780
Fine.

223
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,940
Since you, my brother,

224
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,400
have become so shameless,

225
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,300
then I, your sister,

226
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,300
no longer need to cover for you.

227
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,020
Father,

228
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,380
a few days ago,

229
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,480
the Crown Prince's brother-in-law—

230
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,900
that's him,

231
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,060
Song Yicheng—

232
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,990
made improper advances toward me!

233
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,400
I had him seized and brought to my palace.

234
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,660
But unexpectedly, the Princess Consort came to plead for him

235
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,940
and took him away,

236
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,440
promising to give me an explanation.

237
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,660
Two days have passed,

238
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,380
and still nothing has been said.

239
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,780
So I went to the Eastern Palace to demand an answer.

240
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,700
Fuying,

241
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,300
is this true?

242
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,060
Father...

243
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,940
Your Majesty,

244
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,820
it's true.

245
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,860
Then why was this not reported to me?

246
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,140
Father, please don't blame Steward Sun.

247
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,260
I was worried about your health

248
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,420
and feared you would get angry,

249
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,940
so I specifically instructed Steward Sun

250
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,180
not to tell you.

251
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,260
Song Yicheng!

252
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,180
How dare you!

253
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,080
I

254
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,400
only allowed you to serve in the palace

255
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,880
because you're Lian's brother.

256
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
Yet you shamelessly

257
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,060
committed such disgraceful acts!

258
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,080
Your Majesty,

259
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,580
it's not like that!

260
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,520
Princess Ningshuang...

261
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,560
she seduced me!

262
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,620
Insolent bastard!

263
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,480
With a face like yours,

264
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,640
I don't even want to look at you.

265
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,040
How could Ningshuang seduce you?

266
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,800
Guards!

267
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,580
Take him

268
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,240
to the prison

269
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,000
and castrate him!

270
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,820
-Yes, Your Majesty!
-Yes, Your Majesty!

271
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,620
Your Majesty!

272
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,420
Your Majesty, please spare me!

273
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,820
Brother Fuying, save me!

274
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,660
Brother Fuying, please save me!

275
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,540
Your Majesty,

276
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,700
how can we believe

277
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,900
the words of such a person?

278
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,120
Father,

279
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,780
in any case,

280
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,340
everyone in the palace knows Lord Feng is a demon.

281
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,260
Lord Feng, if you don't clear your name,

282
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,340
I'm afraid you won't be able to silence the rumors.

283
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,140
Why not

284
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,620
let the Demon Master test him first?

285
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,860
Pure gold fears no fire.

286
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,200
Since the master has arrived,

287
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,620
please bring him in.

288
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,900
Summon the Demon Master!

289
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,240
Insolent!

290
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,280
Bow to His Majesty at once!

291
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,720
I'm a cultivator.

292
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,780
I bow only to immortals,

293
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,820
not mortals.

294
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,760
Insolent fool!

295
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,120
Guards!

296
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,480
Enough.

297
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,520
I've heard that you

298
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,480
can force demons to reveal their true forms.

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,440
Is that true?

300
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,440
This Universe Ring

301
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,640
was bestowed upon me by the Great Deity of the Three Altars.

302
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,800
Any demon standing in this ring will be

303
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,599
forced to reveal its true form.

304
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,990
Everyone, please observe.

305
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Tong.

306
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,700
Follow my command!

307
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,620
He really transformed!

308
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,180
How magical!

309
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,620
Lord Feng,

310
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,420
please.

311
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,700
Wait.

312
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,040
The palace rumors

313
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,240
don't just point to Lord Feng alone.

314
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,860
Although

315
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,840
the Crown Prince is Your Majesty's own flesh and blood,

316
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,000
it's said

317
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,240
that demons

318
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,980
can possess human bodies.

319
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,740
Since Your Majesty wants to quell these rumors,

320
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,780
perhaps

321
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,680
His Highness should also enter the Universe Ring

322
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,820
to prove both their innocence.

323
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,300
Hmm.

324
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,900
That's a good idea.

325
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,240
Fuying,

326
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,980
enter together with Mochen.

327
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,740
Surely Your Highness isn't afraid?

328
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,540
If you are, then forget it.

329
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,420
I stand upright with a clear conscience.

330
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,700
Why would I be afraid?

331
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,440
Lord Feng.

332
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,340
After you.

333
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,060
Your Highness,

334
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,140
let's go.

335
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,080
Follow my command!

336
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,000
I heard that the Demon Master from Qingfeng Temple has entered the palace.

337
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,600
He has a Universe Ring.

338
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,640
That artifact can force any demon to reveal its true form.

339
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,520
So, besides telling jokes,

340
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,300
you actually know quite a lot.

341
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,260
The Universe Ring...

342
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,400
is a divine artifact left

343
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,730
in the mortal world by a deified immortal.

344
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:20,740
Then

345
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,640
can we destroy it?

346
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,380
It's not something mortals can destroy at will.

347
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,480
Extreme yin overcomes yang.

348
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
The Universe Ring is an object of extreme yang.

349
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,080
If I enter the ring with a person of extreme yin,

350
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,360
its power

351
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,840
can be neutralized.

352
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,760
What is a person of extreme yin?

353
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,020
Someone born in a yin year, yin month, yin day, and yin hour.

354
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,080
Would someone born in the year of Yi-Chou, month of Ji-Mao, day of Yi-Chou,

355
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,100
and hour of Ji-Mao be a person of extreme yin?

356
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,420
This is a destiny of pure yin in all four pillars,

357
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,860
an even stronger form of extreme yin.

358
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,060
Your Highness, is that you?

359
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,320
It's the Crown Prince.

360
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
The Crown Prince?

361
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,500
How could he possibly help us?

362
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,060
Nothing is impossible.

363
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,020
Right.

364
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,040
We'll make him

365
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,740
help us.

366
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,060
Follow my command!

367
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,600
Follow my command!

368
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,980
Follow my command!

369
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,200
Follow my command!

370
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,020
Demon Master,

371
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,800
where's your magic power?

372
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,860
Follow my command!

373
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,440
Follow my command!

374
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,940
Follow my command!

375
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,120
Follow my command!

376
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,720
Impossible.

377
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,600
I thought there'd be something interesting to watch.

378
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,720
How boring.

379
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,520
Your Majesty,

380
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,580
now

381
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,880
both of them have cleared their names.

382
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,620
So

383
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,900
it was all a misunderstanding.

384
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Well then,

385
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,080
I shall take my leave now.

386
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,560
Wait!

387
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,000
Silence!

388
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,880
Shut up!

389
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,840
You...

390
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,640
May I ask...

391
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,360
when were you born?

392
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,660
Year of Yi-Chou, month of Ji-Mao,

393
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,770
day of Yi-Chou, and hour of Ji-Mao.

394
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,920
So that's it.

395
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,770
Your four pillars are pure yin.

396
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,520
The Universe Ring is an artifact of extreme yang.

397
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,850
It's most incompatible with people of extreme yin like you.

398
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,200
Lord Feng.

399
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,110
Why don't you...

400
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,520
try entering it

401
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,160
again yourself?

402
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,880
Silence!

403
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,360
Are you finished?

404
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,960
You, a mere street magician,

405
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,440
know only some cheap tricks.

406
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,960
How dare you repeatedly

407
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,120
insult the Heaven-Mandated

408
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,600
Celestial Lord

409
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,840
of Supreme Purity

410
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,570
and Ultimate Divinity,

411
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,910
personally appointed by His Majesty!

412
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,900
That long?

413
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,860
Mm.

414
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,400
Though I may not be much,

415
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,280
I do know a thing or two

416
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,920
about these street tricks.

417
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,180
Mao Jin!

418
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,280
Everyone, please look.

419
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,900
It's nothing more than

420
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,880
some cheap illusions to fool children.

421
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,660
Alright.

422
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,620
There are quite a few demons here.

423
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,720
I'll start with you,

424
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,520
you babbling little girl!

425
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,720
You're that...

426
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,940
Little horse,

427
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,380
go cultivate for a few hundred more years

428
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,380
before coming back to challenge me.

429
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,440
So you're a fox spirit.

430
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,940
My horse!

431
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,500
Master!

432
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,560
If Your Highness wishes to see magic tricks,

433
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,840
you can come to my Fucang Palace.

434
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,480
Just don't bring charlatans like that

435
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
into the palace anymore.

436
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,720
Father.

437
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,460
That wasn't a trick.

438
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,160
Let's go back.

439
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,160
You should rest well.

440
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,280
I'll go to the Imperial Kitchen

441
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,140
to get you something nourishing.

442
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,040
I'll have Mao Jin go with you.

443
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,060
I'm not at ease

444
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,860
with you going alone.

445
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,280
Mao Jin needs to stay and take care of you.

446
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,620
I'll go with her.

447
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,860
Right.

448
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,220
With Her Highness accompanying me,

449
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,700
no one will dare to harm me.

450
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,740
Bai Yu,

451
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,000
you should go back and rest early too.

452
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,320
I'll leave in a bit.

453
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,020
Let's go.

454
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,340
Master.

455
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,300
You just endured a tribulation

456
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,300
and dealt with that so-called master.

457
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,030
You must have consumed a lot of spiritual energy.

458
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,260
I knew it.

459
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,660
Dealing with that person

460
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,400
shouldn't have drained your vital energy this much.

461
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,880
But haven't you

462
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,480
just endured a tribulation?

463
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,980
Bai Yu.

464
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,760
Let my master rest properly.

465
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,480
Has your tribulation cycle

466
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,520
already shortened to this extent?

467
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,720
Even if my master's tribulation cycle has shortened,

468
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,160
you're still no match for him with your abilities!

469
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,820
If his tribulation cycle shortens to once a day,

470
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,880
are you sure I still won't be able to handle him?

471
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,400
Don't forget!

472
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
There's still me!

473
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,400
Just you?

474
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,240
Wanna try?

475
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
Let's try then.

476
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,800
Come on!

477
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
You guys go ahead.

478
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,500
I'll go upstairs and rest.

479
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,520
You can't leave.

480
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,760
Look how much Xiangjiu cares about you.

481
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,840
When your tribulation shortens to once a day,

482
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,040
what about Xiangjiu?

483
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Do you want her to watch you suffer like this every day?

484
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,240
I know what I'm doing.

485
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,980
You're not only torturing yourself—

486
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,120
you're torturing Xiangjiu too!

487
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,920
Master,

488
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,460
Bai Yu has a point.

489
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,000
Since Huo Xiangjiu is your ferryman,

490
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,200
why not simply let her ferry you to ascend to immortality?

491
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,770
Xiangjiu is your ferryman?

492
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,540
Have you ever thought that

493
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,400
if she helps you ascend with her own hands

494
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,880
and you never meet again in her lifetime,

495
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,680
how painful that will be for her?

496
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,490
Are you doing this to get revenge on me?

497
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,520
You know I have feelings for her,

498
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,290
so you're hurting her to get back at me?

499
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,120
Bai Yu,

500
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,320
not everything is about you.

501
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,200
Then tell me,

502
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,460
why are you doing this?

503
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,460
Since you know she's your ferryman,

504
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,900
why couldn't you have just appeared before her

505
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,880
as a stranger

506
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,680
and asked her to help you ascend?

507
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,700
Or made her hate you to the core

508
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,350
so she wouldn't feel heartbroken?

509
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,790
You think my master doesn't want that?

510
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,980
He's already tried his best to avoid her!

511
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,460
He only wanted to see her once

512
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,260
before his ascension—

513
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,820
to appear before her as a stranger

514
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,900
asking for help!

515
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,520
That way, she wouldn't be in so much pain!

516
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,480
If that's what you wanted,

517
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,460
then why didn't you do it?

518
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,180
Yearning.

519
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,020
What?

520
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,270
My yearning for her.

521
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,880
I was torn every day,

522
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,520
unsure whether I should go see her.

523
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,080
If I went to her,

524
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,370
I was afraid I wouldn't be able to let go of this mortal world.

525
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,100
Yet if I stayed away...

526
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,620
what was the point of cultivating immortality?

527
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,660
When she appeared before me...

528
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,200
I told myself

529
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,220
to see her just this once.

530
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,720
After seeing her,

531
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,120
I'd ask her to help me ascend.

532
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,280
But after seeing her...

533
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,150
I began to think,

534
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,060
perhaps I could see her a few more times.

535
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,520
Then I thought...

536
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,480
perhaps I could spend more time with her—

537
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,740
just a little longer.

538
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,140
Then I thought...

539
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,100
I just wouldn't ascend at all.

540
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,370
Even if the tribulation shortens to once a day...

541
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,460
I'm willing to endure it.

542
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,360
The Dao says,

543
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,020
"From three, all things are born.

544
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,160
At seven, change is inevitable."

545
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,100
I've watched her fall in love

546
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,300
with someone else many times.

547
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,420
Do you understand that feeling?

548
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,860
This time...

549
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,340
I can't hold back anymore.

550
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,340
I can't suppress my yearning for her.

551
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,180
I just want to be with her every moment.

552
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,980
Bai Yu.

553
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,220
Am I being selfish?

554
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,020
I'm not in the mood to hear your stories now.

555
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,840
In short, you have only two choices.

556
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,000
One is to stay.

557
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,200
When your tribulation shortens to once daily,

558
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,400
not only will you suffer the pain of tribulation every day,

559
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,660
but Xiangjiu will too.

560
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,020
The other...

561
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,610
is to let Xiangjiu help you ascend.

562
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,370
Even if she suffers for a while,

563
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,900
at least she will still have a future.

564
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,500
Before she falls any deeper,

565
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,340
let her go now.

566
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,120
That's the only thing you can do for her now.

567
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,660
Old Fox,

568
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,150
time for your medicine.

569
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,660
Come on, take your medicine.

570
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,590
I don't want to drink it.

571
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,660
Take it away.

572
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,520
This medicine can ease the pain.

573
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,480
I said

574
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,960
I don't want it.

575
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,360
Are you feeling really uncomfortable?

576
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,100
Then let me feed you.

577
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,700
Come on...

578
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,960
You're really annoying.

579
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,820
Fine.

580
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,440
I won't bother you then.

581
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,820
Get some rest.

582
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,340
I... I'll sleep downstairs.

583
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,340
Call me when you wake up.

584
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,220
I'll bring you the medicine then.

585
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Mr. Song,

586
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,219
you should be seeking help from the Crown Prince and his consort right now.

587
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,380
Or at least

588
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,540
call for a doctor.

589
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,040
Why the urgency to see me?

590
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,840
I don't know how to reattach that thing to you.

591
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,719
Old Gongsun,

592
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,980
you're still in the mood to make sarcastic remarks?

593
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,900
I'm afraid you don't realize

594
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,270
that your family

595
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,460
is on the brink of disaster.

596
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,520
Well then,

597
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,880
I'd like to hear

598
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,120
what kind of disaster is coming.

599
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,239
I heard it myself—

600
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Huo Xiangjiu

601
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,719
told that wretched son of yours

602
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,000
that they're going to secretly

603
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
smuggle my sister out of the palace.

604
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,880
And you can guess the rest.

605
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,180
This time, when my sister leaves the palace,

606
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,520
she'll probably

607
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,860
elope with your wretched son.

608
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,360
Such words could cost us our heads.

609
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,890
You can't say them lightly.

610
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,210
"Say them lightly?"

611
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,280
Whether it's true or not,

612
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,720
you know better than anyone, Lord Gongsun.

613
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,240
Don't forget.

614
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,760
It was the two of us

615
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,800
who secretly sent

616
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,240
the Crown Prince to my sister's bed.

617
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,200
My Lord.

618
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,280
The drug's already been slipped in.

619
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,400
Don't mess this up.

620
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,180
Rest assured, My Lord.

621
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,280
My sister

622
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,610
is waiting for your son.

623
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,640
Compared to your son,

624
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,760
I'd certainly prefer

625
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,480
my sister

626
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,080
to become the Crown Prince's mistress.

627
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,120
Isn't that right, My Lord?

628
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,160
Just like you—

629
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,760
you surely hope your son

630
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,920
will marry a princess

631
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,880
rather than

632
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,160
some village nobody,

633
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,600
right,

634
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,080
My Lord?

635
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,900
Good that you know.

636
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,880
I'll leave the rest to you.

637
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,410
Alright.

638
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,840
If my sister

639
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,640
succeeds in eloping with your wretched son this time,

640
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,860
all our wealth and honor

641
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,660
will be gone.
