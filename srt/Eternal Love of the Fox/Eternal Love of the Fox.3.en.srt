1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,840
One Bam.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,240
I didn't touch you.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,400
Don't try to scam me.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,500
One Bam.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,500
One Bam?

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,260
One Bam is convulsing!

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,960
Someone come quickly!

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,260
One Bam is convulsing!

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,980
Help!

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,320
One Bam is convulsing!

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,040
That filthy mouth of yours

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,440
is unworthy of speaking
such a sacred name!

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,240
Feng Mochen.

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,960
The thousand-year grudge between
our Bai Clan of Bronze County and you

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,620
shall be settled here and now.

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,840
Ancestors of the Bai Clan
of Bronze County, bear witness—

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,040
I, Bai Yu,

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,560
thirtieth-generation disciple,

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,490
hereby vanquish evil
and defend the righteous path!

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,400
Heavenly Thunder, Earthly Fire,

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,360
the Five Elements and the Six Harmonies—

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,960
slay evil and subdue demons!

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,730
By this command!

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,479
♪ Treacherous winds and roiling clouds,
1,000 words dissolve into a single sigh ♪

25
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,020
♪ All that is heard and all that is seen,
the world's warmth and cold laid bare ♪

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,539
♪ Since this body is formless,
there's no need ♪

27
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:48,080
♪ For anyone to destroy or praise ♪

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,300
♪ Write as you will,
I drink to my heart's content ♪

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,220
♪ Spring or autumn, meetings or partings,
the Great Way follows its course ♪

30
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,440
♪ Once I leave this desolate ridge,
all ties are severed ♪

31
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,540
Hurry up!

32
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,780
One Bam is convulsing!

33
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,540
Hurry!

34
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,480
Hurry up and come here!

35
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,000
Is she okay?

36
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,620
What happened to her?

37
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,540
How would I know?

38
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,840
Is she alright?

39
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,940
Quit shoving.

40
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,460
Xiangjiu!

41
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,500
What's wrong with you, Xiangjiu?

42
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,220
Xiangjiu!

43
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,700
Why is she convulsing?

44
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,660
How would I know?

45
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,380
Xiangjiu.

46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,600
Xiangjiu!

47
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,620
Congratulations, Your Highness.

48
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,420
Congratulations

49
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,350
on eliminating this great threat.

50
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,300
The position of Emperor

51
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,180
will soon be yours.

52
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,020
Although His Grace
never thought much of us,

53
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,909
he once showed Father great kindness.

54
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,900
Now that His Grace's dead,

55
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,740
I'm afraid Father's life will...

56
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,080
Your Highness,

57
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,740
you're kind-hearted.

58
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,840
But if His Grace hadn't been eliminated,

59
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,990
he would've become a grave threat.

60
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,260
Lord Gongsun,

61
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,420
you're my most trusted advisor.

62
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,400
I

63
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,380
am willing to heed your counsel.

64
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,500
With my assistance,

65
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,400
Your Highness will surely
achieve greatness.

66
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,140
When that time comes,

67
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,160
Lord Gongsun,

68
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,280
you'll be the greatest contributor.

69
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,740
I wouldn't dare take the credit.

70
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,540
Your Highness.

71
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,960
I have a matter

72
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,260
that I'd like to trouble you with.

73
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,470
Please go ahead, Lord Gongsun.

74
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,500
My unworthy son
has reached marriageable age.

75
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
I humbly ask that Your Highness
persuade His Majesty

76
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,340
to bestow Princess Ningshuang

77
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,180
in marriage upon my son.

78
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,740
As you just saw,

79
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,520
Princess Ningshuang has quite a temper.

80
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,300
Father has spoiled her.

81
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,860
Can your son really handle her?

82
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,510
No matter how fierce a woman is,

83
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,500
once she enters our Gongsun household,

84
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,020
we'll make sure

85
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,600
she's brought to heel.

86
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,620
Since you're so confident,

87
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,100
I'll raise the matter with Father tomorrow

88
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,520
and ask him to grant the marriage.

89
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,820
In that case,

90
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,740
Your Highness,

91
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,340
your grand ambition
will surely be fulfilled.

92
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,880
It was Prince Fuying's doing.

93
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,020
I'll go kill him.

94
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,240
This is my business.

95
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,830
It doesn't concern you.

96
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,620
How could it

97
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,540
not concern me?

98
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,870
Whatever bond there was between us

99
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,740
was already severed completely

100
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,540
the day I got married.

101
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,460
Don't come looking for me again.

102
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,420
Lian.

103
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,820
I failed to protect you back then...

104
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,040
Gongsun Hao.

105
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,920
Everything from our past—

106
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,900
I've already put it behind me.

107
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,020
I hope you will too.

108
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,260
From now on,

109
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,190
let's each live our own lives in peace.

110
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,820
Can you...

111
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,100
Really be at peace?

112
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,440
That's my concern.

113
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,500
Eat more.

114
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,200
One Bam.

115
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,180
One Bam?

116
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,500
Why is she still unconscious?

117
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,620
She's not dead, is she?

118
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,260
You...

119
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,300
She's still breathing, okay?

120
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,260
I don't see that.

121
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,200
One Bam?

122
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,280
One Bam?

123
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,100
Then why hasn't she woken up yet?

124
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,340
How would I know?

125
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,020
Go.

126
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,960
Go away.

127
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,060
Xiangjiu, you're awake!

128
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,040
One Bam!

129
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,500
What are you doing?

130
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,400
How did I get back here?

131
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,260
I remember drinking too much last night.

132
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,240
Why do I feel so cold?

133
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,720
Could she be having a seizure?

134
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,380
You...

135
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,160
Xiangjiu!

136
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,300
What a feast!

137
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,220
This is what life's all about:

138
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,660
eating and drinking.

139
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,340
Open your mouth wide,

140
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,180
enjoy food from everywhere.

141
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,420
A wise man avoids the river of love.

142
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,860
Today, I've got

143
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,540
chicken and wine!

144
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,320
What bliss!

145
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,960
Bliss...

146
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,580
Bliss...

147
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,120
Bliss...

148
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,300
What's wrong with Xiangjiu?

149
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,220
One Bam.

150
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,900
Is the bucket that fragrant?

151
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,060
Is it so good you don't want to come out?

152
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,180
Xiangjiu.

153
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,180
Help me!

154
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,620
What are you guys standing there for?

155
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,420
Come pull her head out!

156
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,020
Hurry up! Come on.

157
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,820
Coming!

158
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,920
One, two, three,

159
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,000
pull!

160
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,320
Put some effort into it!

161
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,120
Haven't you eaten today or what?

162
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,540
Xiangjiu.

163
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,410
That wily fox really is something.

164
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,840
Even after what happened last night,
I still couldn't get rid of him.

165
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,900
I'll have to wait for another chance.

166
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,760
Right now, Xiangjiu is what matters most.

167
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,400
I can't let her sacrifice herself

168
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,930
to that wily fox for my sake.

169
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,940
My primordial spirit and physical body

170
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,920
must be entangled with each other.

171
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,380
I need to quickly use
the Spirit-Detachment Technique

172
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,780
to sever the connection.

173
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,340
Xiangjiu must be ill.

174
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,460
Please don't hold it against her,
Lady Zhao.

175
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,580
You dare to stop me?

176
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,840
You want a beating too, huh?

177
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,600
Stop!

178
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,540
You're nothing but a mere
Palace Gate official.

179
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,340
How dare you be so insolent?

180
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Release this Venerable One at once—

181
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,480
or I'll make sure

182
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,060
you die a miserable death.

183
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,180
Lady Zhao.

184
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,190
What did she just call herself?

185
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,000
What did you just call yourself?

186
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,530
This Venerable One.

187
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,010
Scared now, aren't you?

188
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,460
Release this Venerable One now.

189
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,700
How dare you presumptuously
call yourself "Venerable"?

190
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,140
You reckless fool.

191
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,359
Take her away!

192
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,300
Don't touch me!

193
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,780
Today I'll show you what this whip can do!

194
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,859
You wouldn't dare!

195
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,099
Watch me!

196
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,359
Let's see you act tough now, One Bam!

197
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,819
Does the whip feel good?

198
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:33,900
Enjoy it!

199
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,680
You...

200
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,880
Enjoy it!

201
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,020
Enjoy my little whip!

202
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,820
Stop it!

203
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,920
Isn't this Bai Yu, Attendant Bai?

204
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,420
Attendant Bai.

205
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,140
Come here, Attendant Bai.

206
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,900
Everyone, come here.

207
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,260
This is the legendary figure
of our Imperial Servants Bureau,

208
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,760
the one who scrubs toilets so well

209
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,700
that he earned His Majesty's favor—
Bai Yu, Attendant Bai.

210
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,540
Attendant Bai.

211
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,820
Xiangjiu.

212
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,620
Attendant Bai.

213
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,540
So white.

214
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,540
Attendant Bai.

215
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,460
Could you teach us

216
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,820
how you scrub toilets?

217
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,460
Attendant Bai.

218
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:34,940
Oh no.

219
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,300
Teach us, please.

220
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:36,900
Attendant Bai?

221
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,700
Xiangjiu!

222
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,630
Are you alright?

223
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,200
Where are you hurt?

224
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,780
How dare she hit me...

225
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,060
You...

226
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,060
You...

227
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,420
You...

228
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,460
Lady Zhao.

229
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,780
Are you...

230
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,700
Xiangjiu!

231
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,700
Xiangjiu.

232
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,850
No matter what happens,

233
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,340
as long as I'm here,

234
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,880
I will protect you.

235
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,200
Bai Yu.

236
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,880
I didn't want to tell you about this.

237
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,160
But right now,

238
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,100
it seems only you can help.

239
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,730
You've got a good appetite.

240
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,860
You should know your place.

241
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,470
You're just a lowly servant

242
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,880
temporarily residing in Master's body.

243
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,080
You mustn't do anything
to harm his precious body.

244
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,210
You should cherish his physical form.

245
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,600
You lackey.

246
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,240
Who are you to lecture me?

247
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,080
Xiangjiu.

248
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,400
Whatever you need, just say it.

249
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,120
Your business is my business.

250
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,160
How dare you!

251
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,610
Xiangjiu...

252
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,120
You...

253
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,140
What's this about?

254
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,940
I...

255
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,160
That girl again.

256
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,520
W...

257
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,800
Which girl?

258
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,080
You reckless fool.

259
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,120
Let me tell you,

260
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,050
you'd better show me some respect!

261
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,400
Stay here and behave yourself.

262
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,840
I'm going to check on Master.

263
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,770
I'll be back to deal with you later.

264
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,170
That felt really good just now.

265
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,900
Bai Yu.

266
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,720
You've likely

267
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,600
never encountered anything like this

268
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,280
in your lifetime.

269
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,760
That's true.

270
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Why does

271
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,920
this body

272
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,480
feel so off?

273
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,700
This face

274
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,030
is quite good-looking.

275
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,140
This thick hair.

276
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,990
A bit prematurely aged though.

277
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,640
This jawline

278
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,560
is so sharp.

279
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,440
Let's check out the physique...

280
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
That's not right.

281
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,140
That wouldn't be ethical.

282
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
However,

283
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,400
If I just take one quick look,

284
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,530
it shouldn't count as peeping, right?

285
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,200
After all, I'll be using this body
for quite some time.

286
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,800
Taking one look

287
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,310
shouldn't be a problem.

288
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,520
Not bad at all, buddy.

289
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,720
Let's do this then!

290
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,760
This... This is

291
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,160
something I've truly never seen before.

292
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,400
Xiangjiu.

293
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,060
Let's not rush things.

294
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,060
This isn't

295
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,100
the right place for that.

296
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,840
All these muscles.

297
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm truly blessed by Heaven.

298
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,480
These long legs.

299
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,060
Bai Yu.

300
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,220
Bai Yu!

301
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,120
Take my hand!

302
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,240
Bai Yu!

303
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,910
But I don't know this dance.

304
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,800
I'm not Huo Xiangjiu.

305
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,440
Xiangjiu.

306
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,520
What are you talking about?

307
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,320
Have you heard of soul exchange?

308
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,700
Soul exchange?

309
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,140
My father mentioned it to me before.

310
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,680
What's wrong?

311
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,620
I'm not Huo Xiangjiu.

312
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,520
I'm Feng Mochen.

313
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,250
Our souls have been exchanged.

314
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,240
What?

315
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,160
You...

316
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,440
You are Feng Mochen?

317
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,520
How do you prove that?

318
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,160
Ever since your forefather Bai Chi,

319
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
your Bai clan has been trying to kill me.

320
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,560
Unfortunately, each generation
has been weaker than the last.

321
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,000
And by your generation,
your skills are particularly poor,

322
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,440
not even close to matching mine.

323
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
Time and again, I've beaten you
until you were covered in wounds!

324
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,160
Shut up!

325
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,880
You truly are the wily fox—

326
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,920
twisting the truth!

327
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,680
So

328
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,340
last night, the one I tried to kill was...

329
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,440
Huo

330
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,560
Xiang

331
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,560
Jiu.

332
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,940
My Little Xiangjiu.

333
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,740
Little Xiangjiu...

334
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,940
Bai Yu, save me.

335
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,480
Bai Yu, save me.

336
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,420
Help me, Bai Yu.

337
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,320
Help me, Bai Yu.

338
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,040
Little Xiangjiu...

339
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,600
Bai Yu!

340
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,000
Little Xiangjiu...

341
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,360
Help me,

342
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,040
Bai Yu!

343
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Bai Yu.

344
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,220
Tails!

345
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,300
I have tails now!

346
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,040
But

347
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,930
they look rather ordinary.

348
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,760
Xiangjiu.

349
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,640
You wily fox!

350
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,480
What are you up to now?

351
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,610
I don't know either.

352
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,160
My spirit and body are intertwined
right now.

353
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,240
I'll need to use
the Spirit-Detachment Technique

354
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,480
to separate them.

355
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,480
I did learn
the Spirit-Detachment Technique,

356
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,680
but I've never used it before.

357
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,740
I've forgotten it.

358
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,160
What's happening now?

359
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,340
Is it Xiangjiu
who's controlling your actions?

360
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,580
Hurry up.

361
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,440
Take me to her.

362
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,880
If you want to get by in life,

363
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,440
your tail needs

364
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,400
a bit of

365
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,200
green.

366
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,720
Faster!

367
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,100
I've got a bad feeling about this.

368
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,680
I'm already going as fast as I can.

369
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,680
If anything happens to my physical body,

370
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,840
I'll be trapped in this body forever.

371
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,800
Am I beautiful?

372
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,880
Old Fox,

373
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,040
are you happy?

374
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,240
Without me,

375
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,240
I'm afraid you would never know

376
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,500
what

377
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,560
true elegance is.

378
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,320
So fragile?

379
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,520
Yu.

380
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,280
Aren't you afraid of me?

381
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,240
I never thought your Bai Clan
was this capable.

382
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,800
Yu.

383
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,850
When you call me with that appearance,

384
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,400
it feels really strange.

385
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,920
Bai Yu.

386
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,880
Just because I'm in a different body now,

387
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,210
does that mean we're not friends anymore?

388
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,440
It's not like that,

389
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,140
Xiangjiu.

390
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:32,960
I...

391
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,750
That's not what I meant.

392
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,460
Bai Yu.

393
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,800
Since you know magic,

394
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,300
can you help me find my father?

395
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,940
My magic can only be used
to vanquish demons.

396
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,600
I can't use it to find people.

397
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,320
So what should I do?

398
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,700
Xiangjiu.

399
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,940
That's not what I meant.

400
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,940
The most important thing right now is

401
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,160
that your primordial spirit

402
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,680
and your original physical body
are entwined.

403
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,160
Every move you make now

404
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,960
will affect your physical body.

405
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,280
I'll temporarily use
the Spirit-Detachment Technique

406
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,880
to sever that entanglement.

407
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,940
So can you help us

408
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,440
switch back?

409
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,320
We'll discuss that later.

410
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,450
Let's do the spirit detachment first.

411
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,360
Alright.

412
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,060
What do I need to do?

413
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,200
First,

414
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,010
turn your face away.

415
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,960
Huh?

416
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,440
It's not about you.

417
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,000
It's because our
Bai Clan of Bronze County

418
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,930
has a blood feud with that wily fox.

419
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,840
Whenever I see that face,

420
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,560
I just want to hit it.

421
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,480
Is this better?

422
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,280
Okay.

423
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,010
That will do.

424
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,190
What's the incantation again?

425
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,280
Got it.

426
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,220
Let me go!

427
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,260
You wily fox, you're finally awake!

428
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,080
Bai Yu,

429
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,040
cast the spell now!

430
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,780
What's the incantation
for the Spirit-Detachment Technique again?

431
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,780
I remember it now.

432
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,630
What kind of technique
did Bai Yu just use?

433
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,380
This fool.

434
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,900
The Bai Clan of Bronze County

435
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,270
is really going to end with him.

436
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,980
How did you two meet anyway?

437
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,980
The Bai Clan of Bronze County
has always prided itself on demon slaying.

438
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,380
One of Bai Yu's ancestors

439
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,500
died in an attempt to capture me.

440
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,620
Since then, the Bai descendants
have made capturing me their ambition.

441
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,140
So does that mean he has the ability
to switch us back?

442
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,940
What do you think?

443
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,800
It's a bit difficult indeed.

444
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,880
That's all right, though.

445
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,620
I can go on using your body

446
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,300
to search for my father's whereabouts.

447
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,460
Have you found anything?

448
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,780
I detected a few people last night.

449
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,700
But because of a sudden stomach pain,

450
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,560
I didn't get to Princess Ningshuang
and Madam Chen.

451
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,080
Why did you have stomach pain?

452
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,670
I don't know either.

453
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,480
It struck right after

454
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,560
I finished toasting them.

455
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,700
They all drank too,

456
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,940
but it seemed like
I was the only one affected.

457
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,940
Could it be

458
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,950
someone wanted to kill you?

459
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,900
Mere mortals like them can't hurt me.

460
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,780
That's right, you're a demon.

461
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,580
You're not that easy to kill.

462
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,360
That's great.

463
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,020
With this body,

464
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,780
I'm practically invincible.

465
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,420
Searching for my father

466
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,080
will be much more convenient.

467
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,080
Your father has been missing
for 2 years.

468
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,659
I'm afraid...

469
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,580
My father is a good man.

470
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,380
Good people always come out of trouble
safe and sound—

471
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,780
and live to a ripe old age.

472
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,500
Dad.

473
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,300
It's so late. How about calling it a day?

474
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,940
These memorials concern the
livelihood
of the people of Bronze County.

475
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,140
The sooner I finish,
the better it is for them.

476
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,460
But the light is so dim.

477
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,720
You'll wear your eyes out like this, Dad.

478
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,680
I'm the registrar of Bronze County.

479
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,260
I write memorials in the dark

480
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,780
so that the people of Bronze County

481
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,060
won't have to live in darkness.

482
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,460
What do you mean, Dad?

483
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,920
I don't quite understand.

484
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,260
Look,

485
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,980
every single memorial here

486
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,740
can bring a ray of light
to the people of Bronze County.

487
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,020
Don't you want

488
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,860
the people of Bronze County

489
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,380
to see that light sooner?

490
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,220
Of course I do!

491
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,420
Then I need to finish these memorials
as soon as possible.

492
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,180
I understand now.

493
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,720
You want to be the people's light, Dad.

494
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,480
Then let me...

495
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,340
Be your light, Dad!

496
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,380
Dad!

497
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,560
Dad.

498
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,870
Are you really going to sneak into
the palace to see His Majesty?

499
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,060
This Young Master Gao

500
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,220
with the magistrate backing him up,

501
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,220
has seized many shops
belonging to the people.

502
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,920
All these years,
the memorials I've submitted

503
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,500
have received no response.

504
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,900
This time, I must go in person.

505
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,080
Dad,

506
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,700
you're just a registrar.

507
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,760
Sneaking into the palace
is a capital offense.

508
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,700
Don't worry, Xiangjiu.

509
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,740
I'm not a fool.

510
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,540
I've thought of a foolproof plan

511
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,460
to ensure I can meet His Majesty safely.

512
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,860
Xiangjiu,

513
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,980
just wait for my good news.

514
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,350
Dad has been gone for two years now,

515
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,980
with no news whatsoever.

516
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,560
Still, I'm certain

517
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,020
he's safe and well.

518
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,500
I'll help you find him.

519
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,310
I don't believe you.

520
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,700
You're a fox.

521
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,990
Foxes are the sliest of all.

522
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,100
Fine, don't believe me then.

523
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,980
No, wait.

524
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,500
I believe you.

525
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,080
Then promise me

526
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,440
you'll get my father back.

527
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,300
Pinky swear?

528
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,900
So childish.

529
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,360
Let me try this.

530
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,740
What did we just see?

531
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,620
It might be...

532
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,580
An illusion.

533
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,220
An illusion it is.

534
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,910
You've finally switched back.

535
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,220
Xiangjiu...

536
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,380
You two are driving me crazy!

537
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,300
You two are really driving me crazy.

538
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,180
Yu.

539
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,780
It's okay.

540
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,420
I wonder how Master is doing.

541
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,740
Yellow.

542
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,000
It's been a long time since anyone's used
my childhood name.

543
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,560
I like you so much.

544
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,900
Oh no,

545
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,540
she just confessed her love to me!

546
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,020
I really want to kiss you.

547
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,940
She dares flirt with me!

548
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,900
Yellow, you'd better eat quickly,

549
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,790
or would you like me to feed you?

550
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,820
You're just too cute.

551
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,340
Mao...

552
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,380
Guard Mao.

553
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Please spare it.

554
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,300
It probably wandered in by accident.

555
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,820
I'll chase it away right now.

556
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,580
Wait!

557
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:06,900
Where

558
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,460
did you come from?

559
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,510
Since you're from the Cold Palace,

560
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,280
why are you wandering around
in broad daylight?

561
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,800
Even if you're hungry,

562
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,220
couldn't you come out at night?

563
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,220
Wandering around in broad daylight,

564
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,820
what if someone catches you?

565
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,260
Alright.

566
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,660
Go back now that you're full.

567
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,740
Go on.

568
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,740
Guard Mao.

569
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,780
You can talk to it?

570
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,820
What's so strange about that?

571
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,420
I can talk to you too, can't I?

572
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,380
Oh,

573
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,860
that's true.

574
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,740
Where did you get

575
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,180
all this food you're feeding it?

576
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:48,980
I...

577
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,100
I definitely didn't steal it!

578
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,660
This is my breakfast.

579
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,860
Now that you gave your breakfast to it,

580
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,860
what will you eat?

581
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,460
I'm often hungry.

582
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,540
I'm already used to it.

583
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,500
It's no big deal.

584
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:07,740
You!

585
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,260
Come with me!

586
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,780
My Spirit-Detachment Technique
is quite impressive, isn't it?

587
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,840
Our Bai Clan of Bronze County
isn't famous for nothing.

588
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,320
You spent so long on just
a simple Spirit-Detachment Technique,

589
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,780
and you're actually pleased with yourself?

590
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,060
You wily...

591
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,500
Why did you stop?

592
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,600
This face of yours

593
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,680
is just too tempting.

594
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,700
Yu...

595
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,500
What do you want!

596
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,060
You almost scared me to death.

597
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,220
Why are you so fierce?

598
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:11,820
No,

599
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,180
that's not what I meant.

600
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,100
Your face...

601
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,100
You two are really driving me crazy.

602
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,580
Then hurry up and help us switch back.

603
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,310
Don't tell me that someone from

604
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,600
the Bai Clan of Bronze County
can't even do that.

605
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,060
What's so hard about that?

606
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,260
I'll go home and check the secret manuals
passed down in my family.

607
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,260
There should be something in there.

608
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,440
What are you waiting for then?

609
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,250
I'm waiting for you.

610
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,020
Why wait for me?

611
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,680
I'm waiting for you to go home.

612
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,240
What, are you planning to

613
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,640
stay here with Xiangjiu?

614
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,880
Do you think I'd do anything to her?

615
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,240
I

616
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,880
will never go back to
that foul and degrading place,

617
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,800
the Imperial Servants Bureau!

618
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
Guard Mao,

619
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,320
His Grace's meals

620
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,180
didn't require sampling before.

621
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,520
That was then,

622
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
and this is now.

623
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,120
By that logic, your ancestors
were monkeys once.

624
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,380
Does that make you one?

625
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,000
If you put it that way,

626
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,360
your ancestors

627
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,370
were monkeys too back then, weren't they?

628
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,080
As a matter of fact,

629
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,040
they weren't.

630
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,680
Enough.

631
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,920
Stop wasting words.

632
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,760
Anyway,

633
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,290
from now on, whenever His Grace dines,

634
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,340
have her come in
and sample the dishes first.

635
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,680
You...

636
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,130
What's your name again?

637
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,760
Le Ning.

638
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,120
Le Ning.

639
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,520
Got it?

640
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,680
Got it.

641
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,000
Guard Mao.

642
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,080
That would be absolutely inappropriate.

643
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,320
What's inappropriate about it?

644
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,200
From now on, whenever it's mealtime,

645
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,460
I'll inform Lady Zhao,

646
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,680
and you can come over to sample the food.

647
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,980
But I don't know how to sample dishes.

648
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,320
There's nothing difficult about that.

649
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,240
Just take a bite of each dish,

650
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,940
and if you find something you like,

651
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,470
just eat as much as you want.

652
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,280
You have no idea

653
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,440
how much

654
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,840
I can eat.

655
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,800
No worries.

656
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,160
We've got plenty here.

657
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,020
Just eat to your heart's content.

658
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,200
Master!

659
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,200
Where are you going?

660
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,060
It's mealtime.

661
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,280
This...

662
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,120
It's all...

663
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,760
It's all the fault of that Imperial...

664
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,200
It's all the fault of Chef Xue
from the Imperial Kitchen.

665
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,040
He fell sick.

666
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,560
The other chefs

667
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,560
only know how to make chicken necks.

668
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,860
Give this to her to eat.

669
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,920
Master!

670
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,220
That's her, right?

671
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,130
After all this time,

672
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,220
I still recognize her.

673
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,600
Huo Xiangjiu—

674
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,620
That's her, right?

675
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,760
Princess Ningshuang and Madam Chen
are the only ones left.

676
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,600
If they don't have the scent of
Ganquan Register either,

677
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,940
what should I do?

678
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,480
Madam Chen?

679
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,880
Princess Ningshuang?

680
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,780
How can I get her to come out?

681
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,100
Got it.

682
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,380
To what do I owe

683
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,220
the honor of Your Grace's visit

684
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,780
to my Ningshuang Palace?

685
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:16,820
Well...

686
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,900
You... I...

687
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,740
I was just passing by.

688
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,180
Your Grace,

689
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,900
are you trying to seduce

690
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,300
Madam Chen?

691
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,460
Princess Ningshuang,
you really know how to joke.

692
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,720
I'll take my leave now.

693
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,660
It's you!
