1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,540
Everyone,

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,120
gather around.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,900
Don't miss out.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,700
Take a look.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,780
See what I've got.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,820
A precious treasure

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,180
will soon be presented to you.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,460
Do you fancy a peek?

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,240
Yes!

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,300
There's something you don't know.

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,180
All demons with the desire

12
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,180
to become immortals

13
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,100
must first go through tribulations.

14
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,880
Those who survive are counted

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,180
as precious treasures.

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,580
Registrar Huo, care for some buns?

17
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,380
Keep them for sale!

18
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,510
Alright. Take care!

19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,420
Registrar Huo,

20
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,020
where is Xiangjiu?

21
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,700
Did she not come out with you?

22
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,580
She did.

23
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,300
She's right behind me!

24
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,260
Got it.

25
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,240
Hello, Registrar Huo.

26
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,140
Hi, Registrar Huo!

27
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,460
Hello to you all!

28
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,780
What are you doing?

29
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,750
Don't you see
they're waiting to feast on the fox?

30
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,640
Isn't it too cruel?

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,220
None of your business.

32
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,160
You'd better not butt in.

33
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,120
Sir!

34
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,110
We need to hit the road soon.

35
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,120
Please hurry up with the cooking.

36
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,760
Sure!

37
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,260
Can't you eat something else?

38
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,920
Do you want it this badly?

39
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,270
You're hungry, aren't you?

40
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,580
Fine then.

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,580
I have tender skin.

42
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,860
Eat me instead!

43
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,740
Stop!

44
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,900
Stop there!

45
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,759
Let me through!

46
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,000
Stop!

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,920
Move aside!

48
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,720
My fox!

49
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,300
Stop running!

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,720
Dad!

51
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,380
Freeze!

52
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,820
Dad!

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
Dad!

54
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,060
Dad!

55
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,220
Run!

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,960
Dad?

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,520
Who...

58
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,160
Who are you?

59
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,280
He is

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,340
a one-thousand-year-old fox demon.

61
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,660
You must be lying.

62
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,860
He's clearly a human.

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,500
Have...

64
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,780
you seen my father?

65
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,760
It doesn't matter

66
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,820
whether I've seen your father or not.

67
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,980
If you want

68
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,900
to see your father,

69
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,220
I'll have him

70
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,760
bring forth

71
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,000
your father.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,960
Just you wait.

73
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,960
Do it!

74
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,840
Make her father appear!

75
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,100
Do it now!

76
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,700
Stop!

77
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,100
How could you abuse him?

78
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,200
He's not a human,

79
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,660
but a fox demon.

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,540
Do it!

81
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,460
Xiangjiu!

82
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,180
Huo Xiangjiu!

83
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,060
Huo Xiangjiu!

84
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,920
Xiangjiu!

85
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,920
Le Ning?

86
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,240
Why am I here?

87
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,160
Did you sleepwalk again?

88
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,500
Come down here.

89
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,180
I dreamed about the same demon again.

90
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,220
Xiangjiu,

91
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,380
your dad went missing in the royal palace.

92
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,080
Why do you keep dreaming about
him being taken by a demon?

93
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,409
My father has been missing
for a long time.

94
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,140
I wonder when I will get to see him again.

95
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,920
Didn't you say

96
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,640
he went to the palace

97
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,770
to lodge a complaint with the Emperor?

98
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,120
If I can get hold of Ganquan Register,

99
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,740
which records my dad's meeting
with His Majesty,

100
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,780
perhaps I'll be able to find him.

101
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,540
But Ganquan Register

102
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,670
is in Fucang Palace,

103
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,460
where Feng Mochen...

104
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,700
Treated with imperial devotion,
Feng Mochen

105
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,940
is revered as Lord Feng

106
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,120
and even respected by the Crown Prince
and Princess Ningshuang.

107
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,740
You'll die a slow and miserable death

108
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,000
if you're caught sneaking in that place.

109
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,900
I get that.

110
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,980
I know what to do.

111
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,840
Let's go to bed.

112
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,320
Hurry!

113
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,340
Deliver a message

114
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,040
to Lord Feng at Fucang Palace!

115
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,680
What message?

116
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,760
I'll do it!

117
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,120
No!

118
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,060
This matter

119
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,700
must be kept secret.

120
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,540
I have to send the message myself.

121
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,980
Chief, in light of such urgency,

122
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,280
to avoid wasting time on the land routes,

123
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,540
why not use the cannon?

124
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Come over.

125
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
Chief,

126
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,820
try to be...

127
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,980
careful.

128
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,180
Chief Steward Sun?

129
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,040
Mao...

130
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,940
Mao Jin.

131
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,140
Go

132
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,740
tell Lord Feng

133
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,700
that His Majesty,

134
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,580
the Heaven-Mandated

135
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,059
Celestial...

136
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:34,919
C-Ce...

137
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,840
Celestial

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,620
Emperor of Supreme Purity

139
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,220
and Ultimate Divinity

140
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,000
died again!

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,600
Don't fret.

142
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,260
Look,

143
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,640
just wait outside Ganquan Palace.

144
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,940
I'll report it to Master now.

145
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,220
Got it.

146
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,700
Thanks.

147
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,000
Thanks a lot.

148
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,340
Master!

149
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,900
Master!

150
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,320
Master!

151
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,760
Master,

152
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,800
Chief Steward Sun reported

153
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,600
that the Emperor had died again.

154
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,040
Mao Jin,

155
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,710
after working for me for years,

156
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,840
why haven't you learned
to keep your composure?

157
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,520
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
My apologies.

159
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,060
His Grace sets forth!

160
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,140
How is

161
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,380
His Majesty doing?

162
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,920
Why not let us pay a visit?

163
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,380
Yeah.

164
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,020
How is His Majesty?

165
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,020
Nothing happened.

166
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,760
His Majesty

167
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,120
is perfectly well.

168
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,480
But, Steward Sun, you were seen

169
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,300
being shot out

170
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,240
from the canon

171
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,720
to Fucang Palace.

172
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,640
That's right.

173
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,440
Everyone,

174
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,080
I swear I'm telling the truth.

175
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,000
I spent

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,340
the entire last night serving His Majesty

177
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,220
and never left Ganquan Palace.

178
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,820
Chief Steward Sun!

179
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,540
It's Lord Gongsun.

180
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,880
Greetings, Lord Gongsun.

181
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,300
If the rumor is true,

182
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,980
a new emperor should be appointed early.

183
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,840
To be on the safe side,
I suggest we assist Prince Fuying

184
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,520
in ascending the throne.

185
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,660
Lord Gongsun,

186
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,280
you're head of officials.

187
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,580
I dare not

188
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,180
lie in Your Grace's face.

189
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,820
In that case,

190
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,160
let me pay my respects

191
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,640
to His Majesty then.

192
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,140
His Majesty is resting.

193
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,620
By imperial order,

194
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,750
any request for an audience is denied.

195
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,180
Chief Steward Sun,

196
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,420
has His Majesty

197
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,700
also refused to see me?

198
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,060
Greetings, Your Highness.

199
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,680
Chief Steward Sun, in your eyes,

200
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,140
am I, the Crown Prince,

201
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,100
inferior to Lord Feng?

202
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,560
No, Your Highness.

203
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,120
I have nothing to do
with this whole thing.

204
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,180
The order was made by His Majesty.

205
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,160
All the other princes are stationed

206
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,940
at border areas and defending the state.

207
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,160
Only Prince Fuying stays here
to keep His Majesty company.

208
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,700
Now, His Highness is trying
to be a filial son.

209
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,540
Chief Steward Sun,

210
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,140
why must you stand in the way?

211
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,620
Chief Steward Sun,

212
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,300
I'm genuinely concerned
about Father's safety.

213
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,700
All I need is just a glance

214
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,000
of His Majesty.

215
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,260
As long as I see Father
being safe and sound,

216
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,140
I'll be relieved.

217
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,300
Chief Steward Sun,

218
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,320
I hope you can understand

219
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,780
my intentions

220
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,820
as a dutiful son.

221
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,200
But I can't let Your Highness in.

222
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,240
I can't,

223
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,580
Your Highness.

224
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,620
I really can't.

225
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,340
Here comes Lord Feng!

226
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,840
Greetings, Lord Feng.

227
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,860
Greetings, Lord Feng.

228
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,120
Your Grace,

229
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,420
His Majesty has been

230
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,340
waiting for Your Grace inside.

231
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,180
His Majesty has only summoned me.

232
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,240
Your Highness is not jealous, right?

233
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,080
Lord Feng,

234
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,680
you're benevolent and wise.

235
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,680
My father

236
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,840
trusts you.

237
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,940
It's a blessing for the state.

238
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,720
Good boy.

239
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,480
Feng Mochen,

240
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,940
it's bold of you to live
in the royal palace

241
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,800
pleasantly as if you belong here.

242
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,440
Bai Yu,

243
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
if you were able to seize me,

244
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,440
you wouldn't have to disguise as a eunuch
in the palace.

245
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,340
Wily fox,

246
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,040
don't try me, or I'll beat you
and crush your primordial spirit.

247
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,940
Aren't you afraid
that the world will be plunged

248
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,440
into chaos when my true form

249
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,060
is revealed and seen?

250
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,220
Don't worry.

251
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,440
I won't let anyone see your true form.

252
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
All ancestors
of the Bai Clan of the Bronze County,

253
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,600
I, the 50th-generation heir,

254
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,320
Bai Yu, am here

255
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
to purge evil for the good of all!

256
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,520
Heavenly Thunder, Earthly Fire,

257
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,880
Five Elements and Six Harmonies,

258
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,120
slay evil and subdue demons.

259
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,340
Follow my command!

260
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,960
Useless formalities.

261
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,180
Hold it.

262
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,040
Seriously, why did you have to

263
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,740
follow me here?

264
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,280
Because I'm worried about you.

265
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,720
What am I supposed to do if you get caught

266
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,380
sneaking into Fucang Palace?

267
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,380
You're being so mushy.

268
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,780
I'm getting goose bumps.

269
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,380
Later on, I'll cover you

270
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,640
while you covertly enter Fucang Palace.

271
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,000
That won't do.

272
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,600
I can't burden you with this.

273
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,060
We are good friends.

274
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,990
I've never considered it a burden.

275
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,800
All you need to do is figure out

276
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,530
a plan to sneak into that place.

277
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,660
Don't worry.

278
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,880
Where there is a will,

279
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,700
there is a way.

280
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,140
Don't you dare slack off.

281
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,280
Or you'll be punished

282
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,740
when Lord Feng comes back!

283
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,280
Lady Zhao!

284
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:10,980
Lady Zhao,

285
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,980
look over here!

286
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,420
We've cleaned it all up.

287
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,100
Look.

288
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,440
Lady Zhao,

289
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,740
please don't be mad.

290
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,140
How about

291
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,260
I go clean the inside?

292
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,600
You want to go indoors, right?

293
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Look at the results of your work!

294
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,020
Is this

295
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,200
how...

296
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,480
how...

297
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,340
you clean?

298
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,120
Reflect on yourself.

299
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,040
Take Bai Yu as an example.

300
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,620
Even the toilet brushed by him

301
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,020
gives off a lovely smell.

302
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,540
He was promoted to a court attendant
for that.

303
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,140
You're all incompetent servants

Attendant Bai Yu.

315
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,480
I was just talking about you.

316
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,160
Why did you

317
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,480
descend from the sky?

318
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,960
The cannon propelled me upward.

319
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,760
The cannon?

320
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,500
Attendant Bai,

321
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,440
you're indeed
Chief Steward Sun's right-hand man.

322
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,160
Not everyone

323
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,020
can use the cannon as they please.

324
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,200
Attendant Bai,

325
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,540
please often visit us

326
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,580
in the Imperial Servants Bureau...

327
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,140
Please often visit us

328
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,100
in the Imperial Servants Bureau
in your spare time.

329
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,400
You're a legend here.

330
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,880
I keep telling the maids

331
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,660
how you got promoted.

332
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,180
Lady Zhao,

333
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,460
I need to use the toilet badly.

334
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,320
I really can't hold it in anymore.

335
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,760
A poor workman always blames his tools.

336
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,220
Finish the work there before you go!

337
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,620
She's just a servant.

338
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,840
Why do you have to
throw your weight around

339
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,900
and be harsh on her?

340
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,980
You're right, Attendant Bai.

341
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,890
Go to the toilet now!

342
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:29,940
Yes!

343
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,420
Thanks, Attendant Bai.

344
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,660
Thanks, Lady Zhao.

345
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,260
Miss, wait.

346
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,460
Have we met before?

347
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,140
You...

348
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,910
look a lot like
a childhood friend of mine.

349
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,580
Lady Zhao,

350
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,900
I really need to use the toilet now.

351
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,940
I...

352
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,900
Off you go!

353
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,740
Yes!

354
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,840
Huo Xiangjiu,

355
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
make it quick!

356
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,200
Huo Xiangjiu?

357
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,620
Xiangjiu!

358
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,920
Attendant Bai.

359
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,880
It's me.

360
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,660
Don't you remember me?

361
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,500
I'm Bai Yu,

362
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,740
your dear Yu.

363
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,100
I'm Yu.

364
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
I don't remember.

365
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,060
Attendant Bai,

366
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,220
can you stop behaving

367
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,660
this way and just talk to me?

368
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,740
My father is Master Bai
from the Bronze County.

369
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,460
Your home was right next to mine.

370
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:39,980
Your father

371
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,260
Huo Zhongren used to be the registrar

372
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,060
of the Bronze County,

373
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,320
I called him Uncle Huo.

374
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,100
Master Bai?

375
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,580
That conman Master Bai!

376
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,000
What conman?

377
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,860
Every generation in my family...

378
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,000
Forget it.

379
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,420
It's rather complex.

380
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,840
I just recalled it.

381
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,440
Your father often

382
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,380
invited my father for drinks.

383
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,640
You're his son, right?

384
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,640
Good for you.

385
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
You've really achieved excellence

386
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,140
since we parted years ago.

387
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,270
You're a eunuch now!

388
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,700
It's a long story.

389
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,960
We used to hang out a lot as kids.

390
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,000
Since my name is Bai Yu

391
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,880
and my skin is fair,

392
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,340
you affectionately called me...

393
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,660
-Yu.
-Yu!

394
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,520
I know.

395
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,180
I remember.

396
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,600
Uncle Huo

397
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,620
also allowed me

398
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,100
to marry you.

399
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,280
Don't...

400
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,080
Don't talk nonsense.

401
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,180
How come I didn't know that?

402
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,540
A marriage was arranged for us
when we were little.

403
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,460
You were too young back then.

404
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,080
Ask your father if you don't believe me.

405
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,740
My...

406
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,940
My father...

407
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,560
What happened to your father?

408
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,400
Yu,

409
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
I have something to do.

410
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,450
We'll talk some other time.

411
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,940
I won't take that as an answer!

412
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,840
I have a lot to say to you,

413
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,720
now that we've finally reunited
after so long.

414
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,280
Yu,

415
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,940
I really need to address an emergency.

416
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,140
In the toilet, right?

417
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,760
Come on.

418
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,600
I'll walk you there.

419
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,080
No!

420
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,700
We must do

421
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,660
some nice catching up today.

422
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,140
Yu!

423
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,780
After this time,

424
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,420
don't waste your spiritual energy anymore.

425
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,820
Otherwise, at this rate,

426
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,360
the effort you've put in cultivation

427
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,700
over all these years
will go down the drain.

428
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,360
Luckily,
there was a flicker of life left in you.

429
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,380
If you had really died,

430
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,240
even I couldn't have revived you.

431
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,220
Cultivators

432
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,260
are said to be kind-hearted.

433
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,240
Even so,

434
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,500
you've kept me company for so many years.

435
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,480
Isn't it enough?

436
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,400
That is none

437
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,940
of your concern.

438
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,060
Your Majesty.

439
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,420
I remember you once told me

440
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,800
that you would meet

441
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,180
your ferryman one day

442
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,920
and become

443
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,720
an immortal with his or her help.

444
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,880
But up till today,

445
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,340
there is still no trace of that ferryman.

446
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,100
Are you sure...

447
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,320
you don't want me to order a search
for this person?

448
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,400
Aren't you afraid

449
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,900
that I'll leave for the immortal realm

450
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,430
upon finding the ferryman?

451
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,300
As you said,

452
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,480
every meeting is a prelude

453
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,520
to a parting.

454
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,600
You have a bad memory,

455
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,100
yet you can keep many

456
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,360
of my words in the mind.

457
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,640
I vividly remember

458
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,120
all important things.

459
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,020
Chief Steward Sun.

460
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,120
Yes.

461
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,200
Get Mochen a bowl

462
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,120
of the All-Inclusive Tonic Soup as well.

463
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,580
No need.

464
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,520
Only humans need that sort of nutrition.

465
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,720
Save it for your son.

466
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,560
Is Prince Fuying also in poor health?

467
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,940
I don't know if he's in poor health.

468
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,020
But I'm sure he has

469
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,220
a guilty conscience.

470
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,160
What do you mean?

471
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,520
Don't forget to attend

472
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,050
tonight's family banquet!

473
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,500
Chief Steward Sun.

474
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,140
Yes.

475
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,000
Get me another bowl
of the All-Inclusive Tonic Soup.

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,800
Your Majesty,

477
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,280
you finished the last bowl
just a moment ago.

478
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
You can't have more.

479
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,020
When did I finish a bowl of it?

480
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,760
What you brought me was an empty bowl.

481
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,780
Yu!

482
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,040
I...

483
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,300
I...

484
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:56,520
I...

485
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:56,880
I...

486
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,100
Yu!

487
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,040
Yu...

488
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,040
Go in, please.

489
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,600
Yu...

490
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,800
Feel free to use the toilet.

491
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,940
I'll wait outside while chatting with you.

492
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,720
I...

493
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,340
don't think it's appropriate.

494
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,870
It seems appropriate to me.

495
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,460
Yu!

496
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,590
Yu is such a handful.

497
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,540
I need to quickly find a way

498
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,140
to sneak into Fucang Palace.

499
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,200
Xiangjiu,

500
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,060
how have you been

501
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,740
over these years?

502
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,100
Can't complain.

503
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,700
Had to make do with what I got.

504
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Over these years,

505
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,930
I've thought about our childhood
every now and then.

506
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,260
As a kid,

507
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,440
you liked flowers.

508
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,860
So I'd often pluck some
in the garden for you.

509
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,080
You liked fish,

510
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,580
so I went to catch fish.

511
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,640
In retrospect, we did have a wonderful

512
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,520
and unforgettable time.

513
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,200
Sorry.

515
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,560
Excuse me.

516
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,220
May I...

517
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,900
use that window?

518
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,860
Xiangjiu,

519
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,000
though we already got engaged
in childhood,

520
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,420
it's been a long time since we last met.

521
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,980
I don't think I'm ready...

522
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,280
to marry you so soon!

523
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,940
Can you lend me a helping hand?

524
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,700
Oh, right.

525
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,220
Don't

526
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,100
Let me tell you a secret.

527
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,980
I got in by pulling strings.

528
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,020
My nephew works in the royal palace.

529
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,020
I'm a full package—

530
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,360
by that, I mean I'm fertile.

531
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,280
For your sake,

532
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,680
I must keep my reproductive organs
intact.

533
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,260
Right?

534
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,260
Xiangjiu?

535
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,300
Xiangjiu.

536
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,160
Xiangjiu!

537
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,050
Are you trapped or what?

538
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,200
Xiangjiu!

539
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,960
Answer me!

540
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,500
I'm coming in!

541
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,900
Yu,

542
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,700
I'm really

543
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,820
not in the mood for a chat at the moment.

544
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,940
I promise to have

545
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,320
a nice talk with you

546
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,020
after I find my father.

547
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,320
It smells so good.

548
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,260
We're merely getting by,

549
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,140
while Lord Feng is living the high life.

550
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,020
Our lives are bitter,

551
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,120
while Lord Feng's is filled

552
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,620
with luxuries.

553
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,340
Every day of our lives is like a rat race,

554
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,400
while Lord Feng grows a tree in his place!

555
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,430
All we ever want is to fill our stomachs,
while...

556
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,280
I should look for Ganquan Register now.

557
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,240
How very odd.

558
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,200
God knows what elixir Lord Feng uses

559
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,600
to heal His Majesty from time to time.

560
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,500
With Lord Feng around,

561
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,980
my father will live a long life.

562
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,500
That's a great blessing to me.

563
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,240
Be that as it may,

564
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,540
counting on His Majesty's support,

565
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,460
Feng Mochen not only boldly
disregards us senior officials,

566
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,840
but also Your Highness

567
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,020
the Crown Prince.

568
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,160
Exactly.

569
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,120
His Majesty favors Lord Feng a lot.

570
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
What if

571
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,440
His Majesty passes the throne onto

572
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,020
Lord Feng?

573
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,600
It's time

574
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,940
we came up with a plan

575

00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,660

Why are two pages missing?

584
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,200
