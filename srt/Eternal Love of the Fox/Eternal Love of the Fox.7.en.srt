I was truly worried that you might die.

37
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,840
I'm the Old Fox.

38
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,820
How could I have

39
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,440
died so easily?

40
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,340
That makes sense.

41
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,260
The good never live long,

42
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,900
but the bad always linger on.

43
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,950
Evil creatures of your kind

44
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,300
definitely won't die easily.

45
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,100
That's not true.

46
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,940
Sometimes good people live long lives.

47
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes.

48
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,920
You're right.

49
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,360
I'm sure my father...

50
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
will live a long life.

51
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,760
However,

52
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,680
Qiaoru is gone now.

53
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,180
There's no lead at all,

54
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,420
except for that mysterious man.

55
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,180
Previously, Qiaoru said...

56
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,020
your dad

57
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,180
had entered a horrifying place.

58
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,420
Right.

59
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,380
That place

60
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,220
probably has a link
with that man of mystery.

61
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,520
Otherwise,

62
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,230
Qiaoru wouldn't have been so nervous.

63
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,660
I'm just wondering...

64
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,840
what place could possibly frighten Qiaoru,

65
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,680
since she even had the guts

66
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,300
to break in Fucang Palace.

67
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,640
I've thought of a place.

68
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,650
Even the Emperor...

69
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,400
doesn't dare to go there.

70
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,120
God forbid

71
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,760
I run into the ghost!

72
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,440
Good heavens!

73
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,840
May God bless me.

74
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,370
Keep the ghost away from me.

75
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,760
Oh my!

76
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,840
Who's there?

77
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,540
My dad is the King of Hell,

78
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,760
I'm telling you!

79
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,360
Help me...

80
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,380
Help me!

81
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,680
Please help me!

82
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,860
Ah!

83
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,480
My goodness!

84
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,420
Ningshuang Palace

85
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,480
is haunted?

86
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,880
It's just a rumor in the royal palace.

87
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,940
Could it be possible
that the man of mystery who repeatedly

88
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,690
got in our way showed up
in Ningshuang Palace,

89
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,140
and that Princess Ningshuang
tore out pages from Ganquan Register?

90
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,900
Suppose

91
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,100
Qiaoru was crushed

92
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
for seeing my dad get in

93
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,420
Ningshuang Palace,

94
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,700
then the key to solving the puzzle

95
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,020
actually lies in that place.

96
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,120
You know what Princess Ningshuang is like.

97
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,220
Your sudden appearance

98
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,030
will definitely alert her.

99
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,740
If

100
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,500
I get a job in Ningshuang Palace,

101
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,640
won't I have a shot at an investigation?

102
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,600
Princess Ningshuang is moody,

103
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,740
unpredictable,

104
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
and very shrewd.

105
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,540
The staff in Ningshuang Palace

106
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,820
have all worked for her for many years.

107
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,920
She hardly recruits anyone new.

108
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,280
Who are you?

109
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,860
You are an amazing

110
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,180
nine-tailed fox,

111
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,340
a revered lord in the royal palace.

112
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,560
Tell me.

113
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,960
What in this world
could possibly be difficult for you?

114
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,720
"Omnipotent"

115
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,880
is the perfect description for you.

116
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,240
Mochen.

117
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,060
Mochen.

118
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,520
I know your weakness.

119
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,900
How did you figure it out?

120
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,540
Our souls were once swapped.

121
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,360
When mine dwelled in your body,

122
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,620
I blacked out at the sight of a cage.

123
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,940
You did the same just a moment ago.

124
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,450
Are you threatening me?

125
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,190
It's my only option.

126
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,100
I have to act as a villain for once

127
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,900
in order to find my dad.

128
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,600
I'm going to get

129
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,880
a cage.

130
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,400
Don't!

131
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,380
If you dare threaten me again,

132
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,740

Wait.

145
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,120

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,830
it's very likely

150
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,180
that she has developed

151
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,180
a keen sense of perception from you.

152
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,200
Will the memories of her past life
come back to her?

153
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,840
What's the matter with me?

154
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,820

is flashing through my mind again?

Seriously,

156
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
I must find out why.

157
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,740
What are you doing?

158
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,320
Do me a favor.

159
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,380
All I need is a kiss.

160
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,760
Why isn't it working?

161
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,260
Let me try a different spot.

162
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,000
What exactly are you

163
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,380
doing?

164
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,020
Don't interrupt me.

165
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,680
When will you stop kissing me?

166
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,040
Why is your face so red?

167
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,660
I need to use the restroom.

168
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,670
Did I kiss him the wrong way?

169
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,200
Come back soon!

170
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,400
Wily fox!

171
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,580
Bai Yu!

172
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,120
I've searched the entire palace,

173
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,440
but still can't find Xiangjiu.

174
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,940
Why...

175
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,460
Why did your ears turn red

176
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,380
when you saw me?

177
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,840
They didn't.

178
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,640
Wily fox!

179
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,820
Is Xiangjiu hidden by you?

180
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,700
You'll know if you just go in and search.

181
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,480
The fact that you told me to go in

182
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,720
for a search
means Xiangjiu is not in there.

183
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,120
Where on earth is Xiangjiu?

184
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,040
Fucang Palace.

185
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,400
Do I look like a fool to you?

186
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,660
She's in Fucang Palace.

187
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,880
I demand the truth.

188
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,780
She's in Ningshuang Palace.

189
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,970
Sounds about right!

190
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,300
I've searched every place

191
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,830
except Ningshuang Palace.

192
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,000
You should have told the truth earlier.

193
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,600
I'll get back at you

194
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,180
after I find Xiangjiu.

195
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,200
Honey!

196
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,540
Xiangjiu.

197
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,940
Xiangjiu.

198
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,580
Xiangjiu!

199
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,920
Xiangjiu?

200
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Xiangjiu!

201
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,940
Xiangjiu!

202
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,420
Xiangjiu!

203
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,410
Who's skulking around at my place
in the middle of the night?

204
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:13,900
Xiangjiu!

205
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,079
Little Xiangjiu?

206
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,720
Xiangjiu!

207
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,680
Xiangjiu...

208
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,920
How audacious of you,

209
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,040
Attendant Bai,

210
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,560
for intruding into Ningshuang Palace.

211
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,340
I will be a loyal servant

212
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,940
to His Majesty

213
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,240
and the court forever.

214
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,620
I will be a loyal servant

215
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,180
to His Majesty

216
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,520
and the court forever.

217
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,620
I will be a loyal servant

218
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,300
to His Majesty

219
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,260
and the court forever.

220
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,600
My allegiance

221
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,400
also lies with the princess.

222
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,750
I must treat Her Highness well.

223
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,050
I wish Her Highness a long life,

224
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,880
good fortune and success,

225
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,840
abundant joy in her family life,

226
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,140
eternal youth,

227
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,570
and great happiness every day.

228
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,120
Where am I?

229
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,380
Your Highness?

230
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,540
Oh no.

231
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,540
I'm a sleepwalker.

232
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,620
I must've come here by mistake

233
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,420
when I was traveling to a temple.

234
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,420
Well...

235
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,880
Be careful when you sleepwalk next time.

236
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
Yes, sure.

237
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,700
I...

238
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,200
I'm heading back to my bedroom.

239
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,060
I'm heading back to the restroom.

240
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,100
Goodbye!

241
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,910
Why is my heart beating so fast?

242
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,160
It must because I've been frightened.

243
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,380
That was truly scary.

244
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,220
Your Highness,

245
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,930
what's on your mind?

246
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,140
Nothing.

247
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,640
I just want to shoot some arrows.

248
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,240
Shall we go visit Old Madam in a few days?

249
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,330
No. She always gives me the cold shoulder.

250
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,360
Oh, you.

251
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,120
I spoke with Old Madam several days ago.

252
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,600
From what she said, I guess she'll agree

253
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,060
to meet with you this time.

254
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,960
Madam Chen,

255
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,920
forget it.

256
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,320
I've grown up already,

257
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,160
yet she has never seen me once.

258
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,630
I expect nothing

259
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,920
from her.

260
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,800
No matter what,

261
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,700
she's your birth mother.

262
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,640
Speaking of which,

263
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,640
I consider no one but you as my mother.

264
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,960
You are the one who raised me.

265
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,740
I dare not say that.

266
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm just

267
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,600
a humble servant to Old Madam.

268
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,940
Years ago, she entrusted Your Highness

269
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,600
to my care simply out of trust.

270
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,500
How would I dare to overstep
my boundaries?

271
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,630
Enough, Madam Chen.

272
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,020
Drop the subject.

273
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,080
Look at you, so irritated

274
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,010
whenever this topic is brought up.

275
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,340
Madam Chen!

276
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,240
Are you alright?

277
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,160
Are you hurt?

278
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,960
You must've got quite a fright,
Madam Chen.

279
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,760
I'm fine.

280
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,460
Thank God you were around, clever girl.

281
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,590
Did you all go blind?

282
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,960
Alright.

283
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,320
Don't worry, Your Highness.

284
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,380
I'm barely hurt.

285
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,190
Greetings, Your Highness.

286
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,700
Little maid,

287
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,370
you're smart and agile.

288
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,320
Thanks for the compliment, Your Highness.

289
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,420
Are you...

290
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,200
from

291
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,930
the Imperial Servants Bureau?

292
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,580
Yes.

293
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,860
I work there.

294
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,660
Your Highness,

295
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,520
look how bright she is.

296
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,240
She's way better
than the maids at our place.

297
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,120
How about

298
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,380
transferring her to Ningshuang Palace?

299
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,840
As a lowly servant,

300
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,570
I dare not dream of working
in Ningshuang Palace.

301
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,780
Glad that you're aware
of your humble status.

302
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,060
Ningshuang Palace

303
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,660
won't just take anyone in.

304
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,360
Your Highness,

305
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,120
Madam Chen.

306
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,120
Madam Chen,
you're credited for raising Her Highness.

307
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,860
Today,

308
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,640
I was honored with a chance
to help you out of danger.

309
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,520
I deem it as the greatest blessing

310
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,380
and the crowning glory of my life.

311
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
How dare I

312
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,460
ask Her Highness for rewards?

313
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,500
I will take my leave now.

314
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,280
What should I do?

315
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,020
Madam Chen,

316
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,680
one should be careful
around exercise equipment.

317
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,920
After being soaked in palm oil,
this hemp rope

318
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,960
will not rot,

319
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,360
and will become sturdier and more durable.

320
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,300
You're more knowledgeable than I thought.

321
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,040
I've learned something about everything

322
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,200
from doing various chores.

323
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
Your Highness,

324
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,800
she's indeed quite a clever girl.

325
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,580
Why not

326
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,460
transfer her to Ningshuang Palace?

327
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,820
What do you say?

328
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,780
Now that you appreciate her,

329
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,840
let's tell the Imperial Servants Bureau
we'll take her.

330
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,240
Great.

331
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,440
Master,

332
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,020
here comes a tribulation for you.

333
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
You may leave now.

334
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,260
This could be your last tribulation.

335
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,890
Please let me stay with you.

336
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,560
I'll be fine.

337
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,020
Off you go.

338
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,120
Got it.

339
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,100
I started

340
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,360
serving Princess Ningshuang
when I was little.

341
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,820
Just call me Ms. Xiang.

342
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,680
Yes, Ms. Xiang.

343
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,980
Caution is a must when you work

344
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,660
in Ningshuang Palace.

345
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,560
Her Highness has zero tolerance

346
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,400
for even the slightest mistake.

347
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,820
A few days ago,

348
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,360
a maid accidentally farted

349
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,020
when she served Her Highness,

350
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,140
and was thus punished with 50 lashes.

351
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,200
She still can't stand on her feet now.

352
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,280
Did she deserve that harsh punishment

353
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,020
for such a triviality?

354
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,020
Of course she did!

355
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,440
You'd better be careful.

356
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,320
W-What's with you, Ms. Xiang?

357
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,180
Well...

358
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,720
It's going to rain.

359
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,680
Ask Madam Chen to stop doing exercise

360
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,080
and go indoors.

361
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,640
If she gets caught in the rain,

362
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,500
the princess will go livid again.

363
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,520
Ms. Xiang,

364
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,120
Madam Chen and the princess
are really close, aren't they?

365
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,340
Princess Ningshuang

366
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,740
was raised by Madam Chen,

367
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,340
so naturally
they've developed a strong bond.

368
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,240
Ask me more questions.

369
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,480
Well...

370
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
I'm just baffled.

371
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,420
Old Madam

372
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,760
is alive and well.

373
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,820
Why doesn't she

374
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,300
take care of the princess?

375
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,270
This is what I heard:

376
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,380
Old Madam nearly died when she gave birth

377
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,140
to Princess Ningshuang,

378
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,140
which triggered her hatred for the latter.

379
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,480
So, she made Madam Chen,
a senior maid of hers,

380
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,010
raise the princess for her.

381
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,440
As Princess Ningshuang grew older,

382
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,240
Her Highness would often
go to Kunning Palace to pay respects,

383
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,120
yet Old Madam always refused

384
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,080
to meet with Her Highness.

385
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,560
Why?

386
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,490
How would I know?

387
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
So over time,

388
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,680
Her Highness naturally grew close
to Madam Chen and resentful to Old Madam.

389
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,920
There's one more reminder for you.

390
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,620
Try not to leave your room at night.

391
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,400
Ningshuang Palace is actually...

392
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,640
haunted.

393
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,620
Ordinary beings

394
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,180
should stick to their mediocre paths.

395
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,220
To obtain immortality and break free

396
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,680
from the cycle of samsara,

397
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,080
one has to undergo tribulations.

398
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,040
How bold of you, demon,

399
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,370
for thinking about to become an immortal!

400
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,900
This is

401
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,820
the price you must pay for that!

402
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,520
I don't believe

403
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,160
you'll survive this time.

404
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
This is so much fun!

405
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,220
Make it more intense!

406
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,180
Tribulations occur at long intervals,
but the wait

407
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,320
between each one is halved consecutively.

408
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,800
First, the gap is 1,000 years,

409
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,440
followed by 500,

410
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,760
and then 250,

411
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,340
and so on.

412
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,920
Only

413
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,360
when you meet

414
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,240
the destined ferryman
who can guide you to immortality

415
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,000
will you be liberated

416
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,560
from the mortal world

417
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,380
and become a celestial being.

418
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,400
However,

419
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,440
many cultivators

420
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,300
would quit

421
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,100
when they found themselves unable to bear

422
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,480
the pain of the first tribulation.

423
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,760
Their bodies and spirits

424
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,460
would then perish in despair.

425
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,080
Little White Fox,

426
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,120
upon hearing my words,

427
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,460
do you...

428
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,020
still want to go for cultivation?

429
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,360
Very well.

430
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,500
Then can you tell me

431
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,620
why you insist on

432
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,700
cultivating?

433
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,600
Never did I expect you,

434
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,460
a little white fox,

435
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,240
to have grown affection for a girl.

436
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,080
I get it now.

437
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,160
You wish to take human form.

438
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,280
Though you're exceptionally gifted,

439
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,000
it'll still at least cost you 500 years.

440
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,180
Meanwhile,

441
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,520
it's unclear when or where
the girl might appear and meet you again.

442
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,400
For that,
you'll have to go through tribulations.

443
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,880
Is it really worth it?

444
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,120
Master,

445
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,170
let me help you go upstairs.

446
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,120
I'm sorry, Master.

447
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,760
I forgot

448
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,560
you couldn't be touched
since you're injured now.

449
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,120
Master,

450
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,960
the gaps between your tribulations
are getting shorter.

451
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,220
Another one will occur in the next month.

452
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,540
You've already found the ferryman.

453
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,800
Why not let her help you

454
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,420
obtain immortality
during the next tribulation?

455
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,660
Old Fox!

456
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,740
Old Fox!

457
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,640
Why are you lying here?

458
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,280
That kick of mine couldn't have

459
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,410
caused this much harm to you, could it?

460
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,060
Are you sick?

461
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,780
No.

462
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,840
It feels normal.

463
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,910
Are you running a fever?

464
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,340
No.

465
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,100
But your face has turned red.

466
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
That's not true.

467
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,060
Why are you all alone?

468
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,060
Where's Mao Jin?

469
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,320
He's out fetching medicine.

470
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,640
So you're really sick?

471
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,160
I...

472
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,200
I'm not. It's...

473
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,070
It's Mao Jin who's sick.

474
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,680
What kind of sickness?

475
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,600
He...

476
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,660
He...

477
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,160
He has...

478
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,880
Rabies, right?

479
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,719
I should've thought of that!

480
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,389
This is just as I suspected.

481
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,739
That silly dog

482
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,679
always barks at me

483
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,199
for no reason.

484
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:19,000
It turns out he has rabies.

485
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,040
No, that's not it.

486
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,440
He doesn't have rabies.

487
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,199
Then what does he want medicine for?

488
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,280
Are you the one who's sick?

489
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,260
Mao Jin does have rabies.

490
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,679
But you just said he didn't.

491
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,440
I didn't want you to worry about him.

492
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,360
Why would I worry about him?

493
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,620
I'm worried about you!

494
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,739
You always let him stick around.

495
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:51,380
What if he bites you one day?

496
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,300
He won't.

497
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,760
He...

498
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,580
has been on medication.

499
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,020
The symptoms are well controlled.

500
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,740
Nothing will happen.

501
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,500
Don't worry.

502
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,040
Still, don't let your guard down.

503
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,380
How about

504
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,140
putting him on a leash?

505
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,000
Well then...

506
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,160
Would you get me a sturdy one?

507
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,160
Sure.

508
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,800
Sir,

509
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,200
please be quick.

510
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,100
Lord Feng is waiting for the medicine.

511
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,430
You think it's too slow?

512
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,800
Then do it yourself.

513
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,940
Preparing medicine isn't child's play.

514
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,240
It's not to be taken lightly.

515
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,360
But you...

516
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,240
Attendant Mao.

517
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,960
Sir,

518
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,610
we're here to get medicine.

519
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,500
You're here for medicine too?

520
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,100
Yes.

521
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,580
Lady Zhao has caught a cold.

522
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,380
We're getting medicine for her.

523
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,960
What if Le Ning contracts it?

524
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,180
Dear sir.

525
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,400
Could you please

526
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
give me something to ward off a cold?

527
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,980
Please hurry.

528
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,800
Stop stressing me.

529
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,760
Don't you see I'm preparing medicine
for Lord Feng?

530
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,660
Lord Feng's life is not in danger.

531
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,440
Why the rush,

532
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,380
dear sir?

533
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,250
Everyone in Ningshuang Palace

534
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,020
knows it's haunted.

535
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,040
Do you really think

536
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,560
your father was taken by that man?

537
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,920
Of course.

538
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,080
Why else would he try to stop me?

539
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,080
The truth won't be out

540
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,280
unless he is found.

541
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,580
Oh no.

542
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,900
I need to go now.

543
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,080
If Princess Ningshuang

544
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,620
discovers I've sneaked out,

545
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,960
I'll be done for.

546
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,500
I heard

547
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,640
that she nearly had a maid beaten to death

548
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,400
over a fart.

549
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,140
Bye!

550
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,440
Who told you that?

551
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,020
If you're tired, go upstairs and sleep.

552
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,720
♪ The moon rises above the treetops
as the wind softly whispers ♪

553
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,660
♪ We drink and sing,
sighing beneath the scattered stars ♪

554
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,340
♪ Throughout the long night,
a single lamp remains lit ♪

555
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,260
It's raining.

556
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,540
You need an umbrella.

557
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,780
♪ Who truly knows my sorrow and my joy? ♪

558
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,580
I rushed out in haste out of fear

559
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,840
of being caught by Princess Ningshuang.

560
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,620
Let me walk you back to Ningshuang Palace.

561
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,580
At least I can defend you

562
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,110
if the princess blames you.

563
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,400
Yes.

564
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,310
Have you heard of immortality?

565
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,860
When cultivators

566
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,460
reach the ultimate success,

567
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,540
they'll gain immortality

568
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,340
and turn into celestial beings.

569
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,320
I'm about to achieve that.

570
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,780
Really?

571
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,000
But first,

572
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,500
I need the help of someone

573
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,030
who has a fated bond with me.

574
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,900
We refer to that person

575
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,270
as the ferryman.

576
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,820
That's wonderful!

577
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,900
When you find your ferryman

578
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,280
to guide you to immortality,

579
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,620
won't I have

580
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,040
a celestial being as my friend?

581
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,480
The mortal world has its laws,

582
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,040
and the celestial realm has its rules.

583
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,500
Once I become an immortal,

584
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,820
I'm afraid

585
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,080
I can never visit the mortal world again.

586
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,760
How's that possible?

587
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,440
Aren't there many stories
about immortals coming down to earth?

588
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,720
As you said,

589
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,370
those are just stories.

590
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,940
They are proof

591
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,300
of how difficult it is for humans
to meet immortals in their lifetime.

592
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,880
Well...

593
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,880
Have you found your ferryman yet?
