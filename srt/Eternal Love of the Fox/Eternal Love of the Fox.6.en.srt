1
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,530
Greetings, Your Grace.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,920
Why did you

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,200
barge into my Fucang Palace like this?

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,920
Your Grace,

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,850
I'm here to apprehend an assassin.

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,920
You...

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,900
You harassed me first.

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,620
Considering your meritorious service
to His Grace,

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,600
I wanted to summon you
to the Eastern Palace

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,020
to reward you properly.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,100
Who would have thought...

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,480
you tried to climb the social ladder

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,340
by seducing me?

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,060
You...

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,680
I reprimanded you severely,

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,480
but you tried to assassinate me.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,640
You're slandering me!

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,560
Who is the slanderer—

19
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,670
Your Grace, given how well you know me,

20
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,760
you should be able to tell. Right?

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,319
Prince Fuying is benevolent
and kind-hearted.

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,519
Everyone knows that.

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,880
If this gets out,

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,680
I'm afraid everyone would think

25
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,300
she slandered you.

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,920
You are a wise man, Your Grace.

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,180
Since that is the case,

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,120
let me take her away.

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,520
Wait.

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,160
Anything else, Your Grace?

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,070
How long have you been
by His Grace's side?

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,620
His Grace is very strict.

33
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,440
Being by his side

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,020
must be quite taxing.

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,940
How long have you been
by His Grace's side?

36
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,300
Your Highness,

37
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,500
it hasn't been long.

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,420
His Grace is very strict.

39
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,750
Being by his side must be quite taxing.

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,820
I don't know why,

41
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,120
but when I first saw you

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,979
at the family banquet,

43
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,580
my heart was deeply stirred.

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,200
Since that day,

45
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,020
I've been thinking about you
day and night.

46
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,080
Today, I specifically ordered someone
to summon you here

47
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,440
to relieve the pain of this longing.

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,880
If I go with you to confront each other
before His Majesty,

49
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,560
How did he know?

50
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,920
do you think His Majesty

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,820
would believe me

52
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,800
or you?

53
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,070
It was merely a misunderstanding.

54
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,960
I didn't expect...

55
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,150
to disturb you, Your Grace.

56
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,240
I...

57
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,710
won't disturb you any further.

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,760
I'll take my leave.

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Wait.

60
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,780
You harassed her.

61
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,690
And you haven't given her an explanation.

62
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,020
Your Grace, do you...

63
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,240
want me to apologize to her?

64
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,160
Of course not...

65
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,360
as simple as apologizing.

66
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,500
What do you want, Your Grace?

67
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,020
It's up to her.

68
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,760
Let it go.

69
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,840
He is the Crown Prince after all.

70
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,760
You have my support.

71
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,220
What are you afraid of?

72
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,079
You said that yourself.

73
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,840
Your Highness,

74
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,580
drink all of this,

75
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,070
and our misunderstanding
will be considered resolved.

76
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,040
I am the Crown Prince.

77
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,120
Your Grace,

78
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,100
you just let her humiliate me like this?

79
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,210
That's a fair point.

80
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,640
Xiangjiu,

81
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,720
he is the Crown Prince after all.

82
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,880
For my sake, how about letting him...

83
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,030
drink half of it?

84
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,420
Well...

85
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,020
since His Grace already said that...

86
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,920
just drink half of it.

87
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,840
Are you trying to kill me?

88
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,380
You're exaggerating.

89
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,510
This is merely a bucket of dirty water.

90
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:47,780
Your Highness,

91
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,140
please.

92
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,340
Since you're not willing...

93
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,680
kill her.

94
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,560
Your Highness!

95
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,580
Your Highness!

96
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,840
Please spare me, Your Highness!

97
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,240
Please don't kill me, Your Highness!

98
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,780
Your Highness!

99
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,540
Let go!

100
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,960
What are you doing?

101
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:29,900
Let go!

102
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,030
Let go immediately!

103
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,320
Your Majesty!

104
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,080
Your Majesty!

105
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,200
Your Majesty, help!

106
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,240
Your Majesty!

107
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,640
His Highness wants me to drink that!

108
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,080
If I don't drink it, he'll kill me!

109
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,320
Help me!

110
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,600
Your Majesty!

111
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,540
You set me up.

112
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,340
Fuying.

113
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,060
What's going on?

114
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,940
Father.

115
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,550
It's not what you think.

116
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,860
Why would I do something like that?

117
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,180
It was...

118
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,740
It was just a joke.

119
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,620
A joke?

120
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,640
Yes.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,720
A joke.

122
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,260
A joke!

123
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,799
What joke?

124
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,740
Prince Fuying...

125
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,059
was here to alleviate my boredom.

126
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,220
We made a small bet.

127
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,190
The loser
would drink this bucket of dirty water.

128
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,900
Prince Fuying unfortunately lost.

129
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,720
My maid took it seriously

130
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,860
and forced him to drink it.

131
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Prince Fuying... was furious,

132
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,190
so he took out the dagger...

133
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,580
It's all my fault.

134
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,700
I shouldn't have let them make that bet.

135
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,030
How can it be your fault?

136
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,720
A bet is a bet.

137
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,160
Fuying.

138
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
You have always been broad-minded.

139
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,800
How could you
lose your gentlemanly composure

140
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,920
on such a trivial matter?

141
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,260
Father, you're right.

142
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,260
I lost my composure.

143
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,080
A bet is a bet.

144
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,600
I should...

145
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,900
I should drink this bucket of dirty water.

146
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,120
Your Highness, don't say that.

147
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,920
How could we make His Highness
drink something like this?

148
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,860
I was...

149
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,480
I was just

150
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,540
joking with His Highness.

151
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
If anyone should drink it,

152
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,020
it should be me!

153
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,600
How could we make

154
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,980
a young lady like you
drink such dirty water?

155
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,620
How could we make the noble Crown Prince

156
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,340
do something like this?

157
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,880
I'll drink.

158
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,840
I'll drink!

159
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,780
I'll drink.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,800
I'll drink!

161
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,920
I'll drink!

162
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,600
I'll drink!

163
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,400
I'll drink!

164
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,720
Alright,

165
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,840
you drink!

166
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,160
A bet is a bet.

167
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,320
Mochen,

168
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,400
the girl by your side...

169
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,220
is quite impressive.

170
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,760
She is indeed a bit mischievous,

171
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,220
but she's not a bad person.

172
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,320
Today, Prince Fuying offended her first.

173
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,160
After all, she's from the Fucang Palace.

174
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,960
So I ordered her
to administer a small punishment.

175
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,820
I understand.

176
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,220
We can't indulge Prince Fuying

177
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,620
when he makes a mistake

178
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,560
just because he's benevolent
and kind-hearted.

179
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,040
With you overseeing him for me,

180
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,960
I feel much more at ease.

181
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,380
Your Majesty,

182
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,860
I have a presumptuous request.

183
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,760
Then don't say it.

184
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,860
But I still can't help saying it.

185
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,040
Mochen,

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,520
let her speak.

187
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,200
I

188
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,380
allow you to say it.

189
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,100
Your Majesty,

190
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,140
the Crown Prince is benevolent,
but only to some people, I think.

191
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,560
I...

192
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,180
I...

193
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,960
Stop coughing.

194
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,950
You'll cough your liver out later.

195
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,060
Mochen,

196
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,680
let her speak.

197
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,660
Say it.

198
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,780
Go ahead.

199
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,680
Mm.

200
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,380
Your Majesty,

201
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,190
I saw with my own eyes
in the Eastern Palace

202
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,780
that the Crown Prince either beat
or berated the Princess Consort.

203
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,340
Although you are the Emperor,

204
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,740
you're also
the Princess Consort's father-in-law.

205
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,140
Your daughter-in-law was abused,

206
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,820
but you ignored it.

207
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,220
It's akin to being an accomplice.

208
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,550
The sin is even greater!

209
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,980
How dare you!

210
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,080
The Crown Prince and the Princess Consort
live in the Eastern Palace.

211
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,220
They spend their own time together.

212
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,540
How would His Majesty know

213
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,580
how they get along?

214
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,480
That's not true.

215
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,740
Has the Princess Consort

216
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,060
never mentioned to His Majesty
that she was abused?

217
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,100
I can guarantee

218
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,780
the Princess Consort indeed
has never mentioned it to His Majesty.

219
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,600
Then the problem is even bigger.

220
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,140
Your Majesty,

221
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,700
please think about it.

222
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,360
How come the Princess Consort
has never dared to mention it to you?

223
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,900
There must be

224
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,700
a reason for that.

225
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
You're right.

226
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,840
If this is true,

227
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,700
I will

228
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,100
give the Princess Consort an explanation.

229
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,000
Mm.

230
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,040
Mochen,

231
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,560
you've got

232
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,890
quite a discerning eye.

233
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,720
Master,

234
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,900
don't you think you're

235
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,320
too close to her?

236
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,740
If you're too close,

237
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,270
you'll be reluctant again.

238
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,540
Your tribulation is in a few days.

239
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,490
Since she has appeared,

240
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,760
don't miss her this time.

241
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,570
Let her help you ascend,

242
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,280
so you won't suffer the tribulation again.

243
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,620
Master!

244
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,200
Master.

245
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,200
-Greetings, Your Grace!
-Greetings, Your Grace!

246
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,700
Your Grace, why

247
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,780
d-did you come

248
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,920
to this s-small Imperial Wardrobe Bureau?

249
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,780
Director Zhou,

250
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,820
does His Grace need a reason

251
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,220
to go wherever he wishes?

252
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,020
That's n-not...

253
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,700
not what I meant.

254
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,420
Is there

255
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,620
a maid named Xin Qiaoru here?

256
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,140
Xin Qiaoru?

257
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,880
Director Zhou,

258
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,660
is he

259
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,040
talking about Ru?

260
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,420
T-There is...

261
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,700
There is such a girl.

262
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,140
But she's no longer
in the Imperial Wardrobe Bureau.

263
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,500
Where is she?

264
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,300
Well...

265
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,060
She was punished
and sent to the Cold Palace.

266
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,990
The Cold Palace?

267
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,020
Why was she sent to the Cold Palace?

268
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,500
She tore the dress we made

269
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,200
for Princess Ningshuang!

270
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,800
She...

271
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,320
She was sent to the Cold Palace
just because of that?

272
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,000
That wretched girl

273
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,420
was very withdrawn usually.

274
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,500
She didn't fit in.

275
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,160
No one wanted to be around her.

276
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,200
She only got along well

277
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,320
with that animal.

278
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,400
Animal?

279
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,600
Animal?

280
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,000
Your Grace,

281
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,800
there is a stray dog

282
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,760
in the Cold Palace.

283
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,250
She always fed that animal.

284
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,720
Since we're both lost souls,

285
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,520
do you want to go back
to the Fucang Palace with me?

286
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,360
There's a lot of good food there.

287
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,920
Come on!

288
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,570
If you don't come, I'm leaving.

289
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,870
Where are you going?

290
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,220
Master, why is she acting so crazy?

291
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,900
-Take care, Your Grace!
-Take care, Your Grace!

292
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,040
Come.

293
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,960
Did they...

294
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,340
discover something?

295
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,940
Don't worry, Director Zhou.

296
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,640
No one

297
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,200
will ever discover that.

298
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,480
Clever.

299
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,120
Qiaoru.

300
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,440
You can still see her?

301
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,700
Yes.

302
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,820
We've already switched back.

303
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,740
Why can I still see her?

304
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,440
It...

305
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,920
is your regret, right?

306
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,100
I remember now.

307
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,540
You're Xiaofu.

308
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,280
Xiaofu.

309
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,860
Since you couldn't bear to part from it,

310
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,340
why did you hang yourself?

311
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,130
Listen to me, everyone.

312
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,200
There were 2 apes on a tree,

313
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,040
one male and one female.

314
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,460
An old man was herding sheep
below the tree.

315
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,680
Suddenly, a fierce tiger pounced to hunt

316
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,010
and devoured his sheep.

317
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,560
The female ape on the tree
said 5 words in astonishment.

318
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,880
The male ape immediately

319
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,320
molested the female ape.

320
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,640
Everyone,

321
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,340
what were the 5 words

322
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,470
the female ape said?

323
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,900
Director Zhou,

324
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,170
that's so dirty.

325
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,420
Ru,

326
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,860
why aren't you laughing?

327
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,220
Director Zhou's joke is so funny.

328
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,220
It's funny, right?

329
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,900
This kind of joke is very dull.

330
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,100
Dull?

331
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,180
It's okay. It's okay.

332
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,540
I know a better one.

333
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,420
Director Zhou.

334
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,660
I...

335
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,340
I'm not interested in this kind of joke.

336
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,080
Everyone is laughing so happily.

337
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,880
Why won't you play along?

338
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,880
Ru,

339
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,300
you're so unsociable.

340
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,520
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

341
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,040
Oh.

342
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,000
You don't know how to laugh.

343
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,720
It's okay. It's okay.

344
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,560
Xiang Dong.

345
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,280
Xiang Ling.

346
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,720
You two,

347
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,400
teach your younger sister

348
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,080
how to laugh.

349
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,180
-Yes.
-Yes.

350
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
When your superior tells a joke,

351
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,280
you should... laugh!

352
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,760
Laugh! Laugh!

353
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,780
Funny, right?

354
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,340
Laugh!

355
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,480
Funny, right?

356
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,160
Laugh happily.

357
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,720
If Princess Ningshuang
finds out about this,

358
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,480
we will die.

359
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,500
Of course!

360
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,900
Of course.

361
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
I don't need you to remind me.

362
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,620
Go fix it now.

363
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,240
Director Zhou,

364
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,730
if Princess Ningshuang

365
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,420
finds out we hide it from her,

366
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,680
I'm afraid we'll die even more horribly.

367
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,460
How about...

368
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,600
You tore Princess Ningshuang's dress.

369
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,760
Princess Ningshuang showed mercy

370
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,960
and spared your life.

371
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,600
Just stay in the Cold Palace

372
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,000
for the rest of your life.

373
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,800
But you must never step outside.

374
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,960
Taking even half a step
out of the Cold Palace

375
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,320
is a capital offense.

376
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,320
But

377
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,320
someone will deliver food to you
at the door every day.

378
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,020
But I heard that those people

379
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,240
are not very punctual.

380
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,520
Sometimes...

381
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,360
they forget the time.

382
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,040
Let's go.

383
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,570
Let's go.

384
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,480
Xiaofu.

385
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,240
Come.

386
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,280
Xiaofu,

387
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,320
it's been 3 days
since they delivered food to us.

388
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,740
Where are you going, Xiaofu?

389
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,860
Xiaofu.

390
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,540
Where did you get this?

391
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,320
As usual,

392
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,380
half for each of us.

393
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,980
Look at her.

394
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,980
She's sleeping quite contentedly.

395
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,860
Ru,

396
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,210
I thought you didn't know how to smile.

397
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,880
This animal made you smile, right?

398
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,420
Xiaofu.

399
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,860
Let it go!

400
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,260
Xiaofu!

401
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm begging you.

402
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,140
You can do whatever you want to me.

403
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,500
Then smile.

404
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,000
Give us a smile.

405
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,000
If you smile,

406
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,040
we'll let it go.

407
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,420
Come on, smile.

408
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,180
I'll smile.

409
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,060
I'll smile.

410
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
Let me see

411
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,520
how deep your bond is.

412
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,820
Will you die for it?

413
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,100
Too bad.

414
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,160
It seems your bond with it
isn't that deep.

415
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,960
Then...

416
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,420
say goodbye now.

417
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,220
Wait!

418
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,920
If I die,

419
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,480
will you let it go?

420
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,720
We'll keep

421
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,700
our word.

422
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,490
She really hanged herself!

423
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,220
We...

424
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,420
Don't let anyone see us!

425
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,060
Let's go!

426
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,740
Let's go!

427
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,320
Thank you.

428
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,290
She was also a demon.

429
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,900
Why had she always been bullied?

430
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,540
To transform into human form,

431
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
she exhausted all her cultivation.

432
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,520
If she had remained a little flower,

433
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,040
she wouldn't have suffered any of this.

434
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,440
She fell in love.

435
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,940
What does that mean?

436
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,170
Now you should understand.

437
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,200
Some regrets don't need to be made up for.

438
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,490
If she could forget her regret,

439
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,160
at least when she left,

440
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,530
she wouldn't have been so heartbroken
or reluctant.

441
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,100
If it were you,

442
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,300
when your life is nearing its end,

443
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
would you choose
to make up for your regret?

444
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,520
To make up for 1 person's regret,

445
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,280
only for it to become 2 people's regret—

446
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,380
what's the point?

447
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,980
Of course we should make up for it.

448
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,900
Even if it becomes 2 people's regret,

449
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,540
regret

450
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,830
is better than forgetting.

451
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,620
Move.

452
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,180
Move forward.

453
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,310
Why did His Grace...

454
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,940
ask us to come to such a place at night?

455
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,820
It's so creepy.

456
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,020
Isn't...

457
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,660
Isn't this

458
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,420
where Ru hanged herself?

459
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,600
L-Let's... go back.

460
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,500
-Okay.
-Okay.

461
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,740
Stop!

462
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,740
You wretched girl,
where did you come from?

463
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,660
Why are you here playing tricks

464
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,120
in the middle of the night?

465
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,880
Director Zhou.

466
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,720
Isn't she the maid by His Grace's side?

467
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,900
So you are His Grace's maid.

468
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,380
His Grace asked us to come here

469
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,900
in the middle of the night.

470
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,660
May I ask why?

471
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:41,980
Yes.

472
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,820
I heard

473
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,300
Director Zhou likes to laugh very much.

474
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,560
So I specifically came here

475
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,160
to see how you laugh.

476
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,340
Laugh?

477
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,100
Laugh.

478
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,480
Are you...

479
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,380
making fools of us?

480
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,040
You...

481
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,360
How outrageous.

482
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,530
Let's go!

483
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,160
Stop!

484
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,990
You're leaving just like that?

485
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,720
Then the matter
of you ruining Princess Ningshuang's dress

486
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,760
and framing Qiaoru for it

487
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,980
will be exposed.

488
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,160
Hey.

489
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,500
Don't talk nonsense!

490
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,660
I saw it with my own eyes.

491
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,420
You used Xiaofu

492
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,840
to force Qiaoru to hang herself!

493
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,900
You were there too?

494
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,820
You...

495
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,900
You really did something like that?

496
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,540
No!

497
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,180
We were just joking.

498
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,880
We didn't know
she would really sacrifice her life

499
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,440
for that animal!

500
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,640
It's an animal to you,

501
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,620
but not to Qiaoru.

502
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,300
In Qiaoru's eyes,

503
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,260
Xiaofu was her family.

504
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,620
Just like now, in the eyes of others,

505
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,450
you might be considered human.

506
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,660
But in my eyes,

507
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,340
you are worse than pigs and dogs.

508
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,620
Those above are superior;

509
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,800
those below are lowly.

510
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,820
That is an eternal, unchanging truth.

511
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,020
I told a joke,
and she had the nerve not to laugh!

512
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,560
She didn't even know
how to flatter her superiors.

513
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,620
What's the point

514
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,480
of keeping her?

515
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,440
So when you tell those dirty jokes,

516
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,540
she should force a laugh?

517
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,180
She earned a job

518
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,580
through her own hard work.

519
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,140
That makes her lowly?

520
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,960
You're merely in a different position.

521
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,640
That makes you superior?

522
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,810
Who are you to decide
who is superior and who is lowly?

523
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,960
Director Zhou,

524
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,360
don't waste words on her.

525
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,160
She knows too much.

526
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,890
How about...

527
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,700
killing her?

528
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,140
You wretched girl,

529
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,000
you brought this on yourself!

530
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,940
Don't blame me.

531
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,260
Didn't you practice martial arts before?

532
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,180
Kill her.

533
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,200
Go!

534
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,040
Since you all love jokes so much,

535
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,160
let's make a joke too.

536
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,360
You guys are so close.

537
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,180
I'd like to see

538
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,620
who is willing...

539
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,280
to die for her.

540
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,600
I don't believe
you have the nerve to kill someone!

541
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,260
Of course I don't have the nerve
to kill a person.

542
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,760
But an animal—

543
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,140
it's hard to say!

544
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,180
What do you want?

545
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,900
As long as we have it,

546
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,780
we'll give it to you!

547
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,820
I made myself very clear just now.

548
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,680
Xiang Dong.

549
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,500
Xiang Dong,

550
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,770
we are good friends.

551
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,640
When you first
joined the Imperial Wardrobe Bureau,

552
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,320
I always took good care of you.

553
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,440
Now,

554
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,120
it's time for you to repay me.

555
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,000
Xiang Ling.

556
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,840
Actually,

557
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,160
we aren't that close.

558
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,880
What did you say?

559
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,120
When I first
joined the Imperial Wardrobe Bureau,

560
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,620
you always bullied me.

561
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,020
Every time you bullied someone,

562
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,620
you demanded I must be on your side.

563
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,780
When did you ever treat me as a friend?

564
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,060
Clearly, you've always treated me
as your lackey.

565
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,320
If you want to kill her,

566
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,580
just do it!

567
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,340
I've long disliked her!

568
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,260
Killing someone like her

569
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,620
is getting rid of the evil for the people!

570
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,700
You wretched girl!

571
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,340
Xiang Dong!

572
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:26,980
Where are you going?

573
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,700
You wretched girl!

574
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,700
Come back!

575
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,700
Director Zhou.

576
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Don't call me!

577
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,780
You are just a lowly maid.

578
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,820
What?

579
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,140
Do you think
I'll take your life seriously?

580
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,020
Director Zhou.

581
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,780
Miss,

582
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,140
do whatever...

583
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,160
you want!

584
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,360
Director Zhou!

585
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,000
These friends of yours

586
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,800
really are not as good as Xiaofu.

587
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,380
Please.

588
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,500
Don't... Don't kill me.

589
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,600
You are

590
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,520
worthless in your friends' eyes.

591
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,320
Now, I...

592
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
can't even bear to kill you.

593
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,460
How come you...

594
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,920
Why did you do that to me?

595
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,500
I didn't bully you.

596
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,080
You two bastards!

597
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,740
Third Uncle,

598
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,980
this window is so heavy.

599
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,580
I can't carry it much longer.

600
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,020
Tell me,

601
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,270
why did you insist on catching assassins?

602
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,440
When can we...

603
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,600
ever stop doing this?

604
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,580
How about this?

605
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,080
You go beg Chief for mercy.

606
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,940
I'll kill you!

607
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,760
Assassins!

608
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,320
Guards!

609
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,760
Assassins!

610
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,160
Guards!

611
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,800
Assassins!

612
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,240
Assassins!

613
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,060
There really are assassins!

614
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,360
Over there!

615
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,800
Assassins!

616
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,420
Finally, we've got assassins!

617
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,300
Assassins!

618
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,340
Assassins!

619
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,580
Does it still smell?

620
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,820
Yes.

621
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,540
The smell of a dragon.

622
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,980
Your Highness,

623
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,340
last time, His Grace repeated your words

624
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,620
exactly as they were.

625
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,040
It must be because
that bitch Huo Xiangjiu informed on you.

626
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,360
One day,
I'll find an opportunity to kill her

627
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,960
to avenge you.

628
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,740
If she dies now,

629
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,880
how will Father think of me?

630
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,680
Find a perfect way...

631
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,180
to get rid of her.

632
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,040
But Your Highness,

633
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,820
do you truly plan
to keep Song Yicheng by your side?

634
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,700
He is not someone easy to deal with.

635
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,260
Your Highness...

636
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,420
Isn't that better?

637
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,110
Let him stay by Gongsun Hao's side,

638
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,590
accompanying him at all times.

639
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,460
Then Gongsun Wugui will have no choice
but to work diligently for me

640
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,980
day and night, with utmost caution.

641
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,960
Your Highness, you truly know
how to make the best use of everything.

642
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,480
Your Highness.

643
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,850
Here is the record
of the Princess Consort's activities today.

644
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,560
She went to the Kunning Palace
to see Old Madam.

645
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,200
She said a total of 27 sentences,

646
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,080
365 words,

647
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,360
to Old Madam.

648
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,360
The Princess Consort knelt
and paid respects to Old Madam.

649
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,440
Old Madam asked,

650
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,600
"how have you been?"

651
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,520
The Princess Consort answered,

652
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,880
"thanks to your blessing,

653
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,400
everything's been fine."

654
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,880
Old Madam asked,

655
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,440
"you look much more haggard.

656
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,680
Is there anything

657
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,880
that upsets you in the Eastern Palace?"

658
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,440
The Princess Consort answered,

659
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,960
"nothing upsets me."

660
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,520
When she went to see Mother,

661
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,450
was she wearing makeup?

662
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,160
Why did you let Mother see
how haggard you were?

663
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,720
You told me to go

664
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,320
to the Kunning Palace
to pay respects to Mother every 3 days.

665
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,920
Today is the day.

666
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,720
Of course I should go.

667
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,940
I don't know

668
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,120
how Mother noticed I looked haggard.

669
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,320
You did it on purpose.

670
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,280
You deliberately let Mother see
how haggard you were,

671
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,800
making her think I didn't treat you well!

672
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,180
I didn't.

673
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,680
I didn't.

674
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,040
I treat you so well.

675
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,660
Why did you do that to me?

676
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,780
Why?

677
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:26,840
Chief!

678
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,920
Move aside!

679
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,660
His Majesty ordered me
to come and take a look.

680
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,460
So it's true!

681
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,260
Your Highness,

682
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,300
you've truly broadened my horizons.

683
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,560
Chief Steward Sun,

684
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,580
it's not what you think.

685
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,000
Get ready for His Majesty's oral decree.

686
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,500
Chief Steward Sun!

687
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,160
Get ready for the oral decree!

688
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,580
Prince Fuying

689
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,260
has always prided himself on benevolence,
filial piety, and virtue.

690
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,340
Recently, I heard

691
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,980
he has mistreated his wife
and acted unscrupulously.

692
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,460
I don't know if it's true.

693
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,460
To prevent further rumors from spreading,

694
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,780
I hereby grant

695
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,980
the Princess Consort a decree of favor.

696
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,840
From now on,

697
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,180
if Prince Fuying harms her
in the slightest,

698
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,700
it will be as if he harms me!

699
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,980
Your Highness,

700
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,740
His Majesty also said if you

701
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,180
suffer any grievance in the future,

702
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,580
you must tell him.

703
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,780
He is not just the Emperor.

704
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,550
He's also your father-in-law.

705
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,000
There are some matters...

706
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,860
that even Father can't handle.

707
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,980
In this world,

708
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,060
is there anything
that His Majesty can't handle?

709
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,760
If Father really wants to help me,

710
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,160
please allow me...

711
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,680
to divorce the Crown Prince.

712
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,500
Show yourself.

713
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,720
Show yourself!

714
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,780
It's not raining.
Why are you holding an umbrella?

715
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,920
My style today:

716
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,080
elegant.

717
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,160
Leaving your back to your enemy—

718
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,220
you're quite bold.

719
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,160
What's wrong with that?

720
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,280
I have you.

721
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,240
Are you sure I'll help you?

722
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,700
I'm 100% sure.

723
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,820
Why?

724
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,240
I don't know.

725
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,520
I just...

726
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,120
trust you...

727
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,800
for no reason.

728
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,320
Actually,

729
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,160
when I first saw you,

730
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,640
I felt somehow familiar.

731
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,280
Have we met before?

732
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,340
Qiaoru?

733
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,260
Qiaoru's spirit and body
have been utterly destroyed.

734
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,920
This is her lingering shadow.

735
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,400
That's right.

736
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,020
I'm her lingering shadow.

737
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,240
Miss Xiangjiu,

738
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,800
did your father

739
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,900
disappear 2 years ago?

740
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,520
Let me tell you.

741
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,600
Two years ago,

742
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,900
I saw a very, very suspicious,
strange man in the palace.

743
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,620
Although he was
wearing eunuchs' clothes,

744
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,020
he clearly wasn't someone from the palace.

745
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,120
I saw him...

746
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,940
enter a very terrifying,

747
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,620
very,

748
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,780
very terrifying place.

749
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,160
You must never go there, understand?

750
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,560
What is that place?

751
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,600
It's...
