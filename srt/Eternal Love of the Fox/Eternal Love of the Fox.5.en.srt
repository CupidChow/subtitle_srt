1
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,720
I'm Huo Xiangjiu.

2
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,640
I pay my respects, Your Highness.

3
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,600
How long have you been serving
at His Grace's side?

4
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,400
Your Highness,

5
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,620
it has not been long.

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,340
His Grace is quite strict.

7
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,780
Should you ever suffer any grievances,

8
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,110
feel free to speak to me—

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,280
I shall see that justice is done.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,900
I have long heard of Your Highness's
kindness and benevolence.

11
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,780
Seeing you today,

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,510
I can confirm
that reputation is well-deserved.

13
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,010
Heaven itself shows mercy—

14
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,180
girls

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,280
are meant to be cherished.

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,940
Your Highness is so considerate.

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,440
I imagine

18
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,180
the Princess Consort

19
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,900
must be living a most blissful life.

20
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,220
What about you?

21
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,990
Do you want that happiness?

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,280
Well,

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,960
who wouldn't want to be happy?

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,979
I could grant you that happiness.

25
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,900
Your Highness—

26
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,259
Your Highness Prince Fuying,

27
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,800
I still have duties to attend
to at His Grace's side.

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,080
I'll take my leave now.

29
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,940
I don't know why,

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,140
but the moment I first saw you

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,440
at the family banquet,

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,860
my heart was stirred.

33
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,160
From that day on,

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,400
I've been thinking of you day and night.

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
That's why

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,120
I had you summoned today—

37
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,360
to ease this longing

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,940
of mine, if only a little.

39
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,900
Got it back at last!

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
No wonder

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,520
the Bai Clan of Bronze County

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,960
has fallen into decline.

43
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,030
You can't expect ivory
from a dog's mouth.

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,320
A dog, yes—

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,240
a loyal dog.

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,560
A Chinese Pastoral Dog, to be precise.

47
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,780
Get up—

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,520
this is the master's residence.

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,720
How dare you lie here?

50
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,600
If your master hasn't said a word,
why are you so worked up?

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,640
Typical—acting tough just
because you have someone backing you.

52
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Well, obviously!

53
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,220
If a dog doesn't lean on its master,

54
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,220
what should it lean on—a pig?

55
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,150
Enough arguing.

56
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,360
Where's Huo Xiangjiu?

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,360
Y-

58
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,090
Your Highness must be jesting.

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,740
The Princess Consort is
virtuous and gracious—

60
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,640
how could someone as crude as me

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,680
ever compare?

62
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,120
The Princess Consort and I were married

63
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
only because fate played its tricks.

64
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,520
If one truly had a choice,

65
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,760
who wouldn't choose
to marry the one they love?

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
It must be Heaven showing me mercy—

67
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,720
sending you

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,340
to stand before me.

69
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,560
If you're willing,

70
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,060
I can have you transferred
to the Eastern Palace.

71
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,840
What do you say?

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,900
Thank you for Your Highness's favor.

73
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,500
I will report this

74
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,400
to His Grace

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,520
once I return to the palace,

76
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,920
and then

77
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,400
inform Your Highness.

78
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,480
I only want to know—

79
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,850
are you willing to come
to the Eastern Palace?

80
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,500
As long as

81
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,700
His Grace permits it,

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
I would naturally—

83
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,200
What I choose to do—

84
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,060
why should I need his permission?

85
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,960
Is it that even you, a lowly maid,

86
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,380
believe he—Feng Mochen—
stands above me?

87
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,400
No,

88
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,840
Your Highness, you misunderstand.

89
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,960
Please calm down, Your Highness.

90
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,040
Today,

91
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,340
I will keep you here.

92
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,060
We'll see what Feng Mochen
can do about it.

93
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,060
Your Highness—

94
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,020
put me down!

95
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,040
Your Highness.

96
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
You pride yourself on your virtue.

97
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
If word of you taking liberties
with a palace maid

98
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,480
were to reach Father,

99
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,300
it would not bode well for you.

100
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,899
How could anything
that happens in the Eastern Palace

101
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,700
possibly reach Father's ears?

102
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,120
But…

103
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,510
Get lost!

104
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,220
Stop!

105
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,980
As the Princess Consort,

106
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,000
how dare you speak to your own husband,
His Highness, in such a manner?

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,040
It's obvious that His Highness

108
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,760
has spoiled you far too much.

109
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,260
Your Highness,

110
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,560
please allow me
to teach her a proper lesson.

111
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,020
Move it!

112
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,810
Let's go!

113
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,500
I was rude just now.

114
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,630
Please forgive me, Princess Consort.

115
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,680
It's all right.

116
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,490
I believe you come
from a respectable family.

117
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,010
If Prince Fuying has set his sights
on you,

118
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,860
your days here

119
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,800
will not be easy.

120
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,940
You can't stay in this palace any longer.

121
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,020
Take this—
it should serve as travel money.

122
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,680
Find a way to escape the palace
as soon as you can.

123
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,240
We've never met before,

124
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,920
and you've already saved me.

125
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,000
How could I possibly accept such
valuable jewelry from you as well?

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I can't accept it.

127
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,140
Don't stand on ceremony.

128
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,800
Take it and leave through the back gate.

129
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
Get out of the Eastern Palace first—
then make your plans.

130
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,100
You're truly kind, Princess Consort.

131
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,060
Should the opportunity ever arise,

132
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,580
I will repay your kindness.

133
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,540
It was nothing.

134
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,820
Go, quickly.

135
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:57,740
Alright.

136
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,120
Y-Your Highness.

137
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,280
Where do you think
you're going, little girl?

138
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,800
I...

139
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,490
Didn't you say yourself

140
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,620
that earning my favor

141
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,060
was a blessing

142
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,640
gained over many lifetimes?

143
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,040
What now?

144
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,120
You're ready to throw

145
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,090
that blessing away so soon?

146
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,560
Your Highness,

147
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,100
I-

148
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,640
I just remembered something urgent.

149
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll come back later to serve you.

150
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,310
No need to wait until later—

151
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,840
do it now.

152
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:53,840
Y-

153
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,120
You dare hurt His Highness?

154
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,640
I'll fight you!

155
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,460
Your Highness—help!

156
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,820
Just as I thought—you are different.

157
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,780
That only makes me

158
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,040
want you even more.

159
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,220
Who would have thought
that Prince Fuying,

160
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,700
famed for his benevolence,
would turn out to be such a man?

161
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,100
Deal with him—properly.

162
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,200
It wasn't me…

163
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,400
Your Highness, save me!

164
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,260
Your Highness!

165
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,460
We haven't even seen
where Xiangjiu went yet—

166
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,660
why did you cut it off?

167
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,340
Then go find her yourself.

168
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,300
What use are you?

169
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,700
You're completely useless!

170
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,660
A total waste!

171
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,220
Trash...

172
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,300
Let me tell you a secret—

173
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,700
don't tell anyone.

174
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,080
I hear His Highness Prince Fuying

175
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,700
got beaten up by a woman.

176
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,140
Relax.

177
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,220
I'd rather die than tell anyone.

178
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,830
Let me tell you a secret—

179
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,660
I hear…

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,760
Relax.

181
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,560
I won't say a word.

182
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,400
Wait—

183
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,040
let me tell you a secret.

184
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,760
Don't tell anyone.

185
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,800
His Highness Prince Fuying…

186
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,200
That serious?

187
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,680
I'd better find somewhere

188
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,840
to lie low—fast.

189
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Who are you?

190
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,500
Heh heh.

191
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,320
That's a lot of silver.

192
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,200
Third Uncle,

193
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,180
you've mobilized so many people

194
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,600
in the palace just to look
for a mere palace maid.

195
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,080
If the Chief finds out,

196
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,720
we'll be up to our necks in it!

197
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,280
Look, my dear nephew,

198
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,710
she's no ordinary palace maid.

199
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,960
She's tied to my happiness

200
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,120
for the rest of my life.

201
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,810
The rest of your life…
You mean down there?

202
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,460
She's your future third aunt.

203
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,040
Third Aunt?

204
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,120
Listen up, everyone.

205
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,300
This woman is someone

206
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,780
I hold very dear.

207
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,560
Whoever finds her first

208
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,640
will get all this gold and jewelry.

209
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,840
Find her!

210
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,080
Give it to me!

211
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,920
Don't grab it!

212
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,900
Let go!

213
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,180
Is anyone there?

214
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,120
Anyone?

215
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,020
Is anyone there?

216
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,400
Anyone?

217
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,000
Is there anyone at all?

218
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,290
I can't just hide like this—

219
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,440
I'll starve.

220
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,860
Who's there?

221
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,480
Who?

222
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,340
Don't scare me—

223
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,540
I was wrong.

224
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,340
Your Highness,
please spare me.

225
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,600
You gave me a fright.

226
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,940
Who are you?

227
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,720
You've been hoarding this much food?

228
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,260
Look,

229
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,560
we're both in the same boat—
fellow strays.

230
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
So how about this—

231
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,440
we split it

232
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,140
fifty-fifty.

233
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,180
That way, neither of us

234
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,060
has to be alone.

235
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,280
I'm doing this for your own good,
you know.

236
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,620
Eating too much at night
isn't good for you.

237
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,540
Got it?

238
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,810
All right then—
I won't stand on ceremony.

239
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,320
May misfortune stay away,

240
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,600
evil spirits be banished,

241
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
good fortune shine upon all,

242
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,730
and auspicious energy always remain.

243
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,440
Don't worry—

244
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,880
I'll be back very soon.

245
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
What was that thing just now—

246
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,120
the one trailing black smoke?

247
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Looks like

248
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,650
there are other evil entities
lurking in the palace.

249
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,140
Judging by its moves,

250
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,109
it was no weaker than me.

251
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,160
This place really

252
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,089
has all kinds of demons and beasts…

253
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,640
I'd better find my father

254
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,240
and get out of this hellhole.

255
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,359
Oh—by the way,

256
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,040
did you cast a spell

257
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,840
to make me hallucinate just now?

258
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,120
What hallucination?

259
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,040
What do you mean, "what hallucination? "

260
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,260
How could you not know?

261
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,320
If you don't tell me,
how would I know?

262
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,480
You shouldn't need me to tell you.

263
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,160
Otherwise, what was the point
of a thousand years of cultivation?

264
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,840
I don't cultivate
to read other people's minds.

265
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,200
Then why do you cultivate at all?

266
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,650
Don't you know why I cultivate?

267
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,540
If you don't say it,
how would I know?

268
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,000
Even if I don't say it,
you should still know.

269
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,080
Y-You…

270
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,800
what kind of person are you?

271
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,520
Are you even a man?

272
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,650
Strictly speaking,

273
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,200
I'm not even human.

274
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,060
Wait—

275
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,540
why are you

276
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,180
in such a hurry to leave?

277
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,820
And tell me,

278
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,180
what brought you
to the Cold Palace all of a sudden?

279
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,560
Just passing through.

280
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,860
The Cold Palace is so remote—
how did you even…

281
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,920
Wow, the Blank Divine Scripture.

282
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,180
Are you staying here?

283
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,780
What?

284
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,500
Suit yourself if you want to stay.

285
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,100
I'm heading back to Fucang Palace.

286
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,980
Wait—

287
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,800
are you saying

288
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,780
I can go back to Fucang Palace too?

289
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,920
That's great!

290
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,360
I was just worrying about Qiaoru.

291
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,160
If I don't deal with her soon,
she'll vanish into nothingness.

292
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,800
But…

293
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,360
I messed up.

294
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,540
I hit Prince Fuying.

295
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,210
I'm afraid he'll go to Fucang Palace
to come after me.

296
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,780
Prince Fuying is nothing but a...

297
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,720
Why are you swearing ...

298
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,980
all the time?

299
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,440
None of your... business.

300
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,580
Wait for me!

301
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,440
Hey, Glutton.

302
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,180
Since we're both strays in the same boat,

303
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,900
do you want to come back
to Fucang Palace with me?

304
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,280
There's plenty of good food there.

305
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,740
Come on—

306
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,860
let's go!

307
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,920
If you don't move, I'm leaving!

308
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,600
All right.

309
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,600
Third Uncle,

310
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,400
aside from Ganquan Palace,

311
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,930
we've pretty much searched
the whole palace—

312
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,290
but we still can't find Third Aunt.

313
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,690
Why haven't you
searched Ganquan Palace?

314
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,130
Are you out of your mind?

315
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,000
That's His Majesty's sleeping quarters.

316
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,160
Sneaking in there in the dead of night—

317
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,490
we'd be gambling with more than our lives.

318
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,960
Where are you going?

319
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,890
Ganquan Palace.

320
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,320
Third Uncle,

321
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,560
maybe you should
consider
picking someone else as my third aunt.

322
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,240
Hold on—

323
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,760
if the Chief finds out
we've been to Ganquan Palace...

324
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,720
Third Uncle,

325
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,980
wait for me!

326
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,820
Third Uncle!

327
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,050
This is the roster
of all the palace staff.

328
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,960
I remember her name is Qiaoru.

329
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,300
We can go through these lists

330
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,380
and find any maids with Ru in their names.

331
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,100
Go ahead.

332
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,580
You expect me to do this alone?

333
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,680
You said you'd help her.

334
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,130
I never said I would.

335
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,900
Are you even human?

336
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,760
Nope.

337
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,120
At this rate,

338
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,580
when am I ever

339
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,200
going to finish?

340
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,120
Mochen...

341
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,100

What we call trivial

394
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,200
is simply a difficulty

395
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,800
that hasn't happened to us.

396
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,360
Third Uncle,

397
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,020
get inside.

398
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,920
I'll hold it up.

399
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,880
It's fine.

400
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,760
Easy, easy…

401
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,320
You're pulling my ears off!

402
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,520
Chief, please calm your anger.

403
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,560
You two wretches!

404
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,040
Sneaking to Ganquan Palace
in the dead of night

405
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,200
and clambering through windows—

406
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,920
are you trying to spy on His Majesty?

407
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,240
Chief, we wouldn't dare.

408
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,820
We're here to look for someone.

409
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,820
Look for someone?

410
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,940
Who?

411
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,110
An assassin.

412
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,720
An assassin.

413
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,360
Chief,

414
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,680
we were worried
about His Majesty,

415
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,560
so we came specifically
to search for the assassin.

416
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,240
Climbing through windows
to look for an assassin?

417
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,200
Fine.

418
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,060
Then clamber—right now.

419
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,120
Keep clambering

420
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,720
until I see an assassin.

421
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,700
Clamber now!

422
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,280
Chief, please calm your anger—

423
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,060
please!

424
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,940
Easy, Third Uncle—

425
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,100
easy.

426
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,280
Getting handsy?

427
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,720
Then you'll get a taste
of your own medicine.

428
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,900
Your face is

429
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,620
so smooth—

430
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,380
how do you manage that?

431
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,060
I was born this way.

432
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,160
I really want to beat you up.

433
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,000
You should

434
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,020
put your hand

435
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,760
back now, shouldn't you?

436
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,640
What's wrong?

437
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,880
A mighty Nine-Tailed Fox—

438
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,560
are your little paws

439
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,480
really that fragile?

440
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,480
I'm just worried your hand will get tired.

441
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,280
Oh yeah?

442
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,160
Then let's see

443
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,840
who gets tired first.

444
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,500
Fine. Let's see.

445
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,640
My hand's underneath anyway—
I won't get tired.

446
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,500
I won't either.

447
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,620
Then let's compete.

448
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,300
Bring it on.

449
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,020
Is your competitive streak
really that strong?

450
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,920
I'm learning from humans.

451
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,650
All right, then—

452
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
if you've got the guts,
don't let go.

453
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,300
Today,

454
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,620
we'll go through these rosters
one by one

455
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,000
and verify every person
with "Ru" in their name—

456
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,160
to see who's no longer present.

457
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,560
Leave that

458
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,000
to Mao Jin.

459
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,740
Then

460
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,670
where's Mao Jin?

461
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,360
Xiangjiu offended His Highness.

462
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
Now that she has His Grace's protection,

463
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,080
I can finally rest easy.

464
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Otherwise, I'd be too worried to eat.

465
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,840
Le Ning, you're truly kind-hearted,

466
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,440
always caring about others.

467
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,900
Back then, I came to Muxi City
to seek refuge with relatives,

468
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,360
never expecting them
to sell me to a brothel.

469
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,980
I mean, they almost pulled it off.

470
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,600
Luckily, I met Xiangjiu.

471
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,960
Though we'd never met,

472
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,760
she wasn't afraid of danger
and stepped in to save me,

473
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,220
sparing me from that fate.

474
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,320
I didn't expect

475
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,440
Huo Xiangjiu

476
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,360
to be so loyal and honorable.

477
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,080
Don't worry.

478
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
With Master here,

479
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,850
nothing will happen to her.

480
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,120
Will His Grace really protect her?

481
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,040
Of course.

482
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
She's the one who will help His Grace

483
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,300
transcend and ascend.

484
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,760
Help him transcend?
What do you mean by that?

485
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,080
It's nothing.

486
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,400
She'll be fine.

487
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,400
Eat up.

488
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,720
You should eat too.

489
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,550
Look at your hair—
you're practically undernourished.

490
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,780
This probably isn't even enough for you.

491
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,180
I'd better not eat.

492
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,880
Huo Xiangjiu,

493
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,000
how could you put your hand
on my master's face?

494
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,360
You have no sense of propriety at all.

495
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,120
Mao Jin,

496
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,840
I haven't seen you all day.

497
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,920
What have you been busy with?

498
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,320
I…

499
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,730
went to look
for free-range chickens for you.

500
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,000
Those chickens probably never knew

501
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,600
they were so desirable,
even till the very end.

502
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,120
The chickens in the palace

503
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,520
aren't very nutritious,

504
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,240
so I specifically went out

505
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,770
to find some free-range ones
for you, Master.

506
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,920
Huo Xiangjiu,

507
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,480
how can you have no sense of propriety?

508
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,280
This meal was specially prepared
for my master.

509
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,680
If you want to eat, you'll have
to have my master's leftovers.

510
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,360
Well…

511
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,760
it's all Chef Xue's fault.

512
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,840
He's been ill these past few days
and still hasn't recovered.

513
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,840
The other cooks only know
how to make these two dishes.

514
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,320
Guard Mao, who serves directly
beside His Grace,

515
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,040
sent me to taste His Grace's dishes.

516
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,600
Anything prepared for His Grace,

517
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,060
I'm allowed to eat freely.

518
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,560
Mao Jin.

519
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,000
What is it, Master?

520
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,880
You're really something else.

521
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,680
Of course.

522
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,700
I'm a loyal dog

523
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,440
through and through.

524
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Here's a list.

525
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,600
Take it

526
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,760
and see

527
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,120
which palace maid is missing.

528
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,280
What does this mean?

529
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,540
Just go when you're told.

530
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,740
Why all the nonsense?

531
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,520
You wretched maid!

532
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,040
How dare you speak to me like that?

533
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,840
How dare you!

534
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,020
Go, and be quick about it.

535
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,360
I'm done for.

536
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,240
I've fallen out of favor.

537
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,830
Have all the Eastern Palace guards

538
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,380
been assembled?

539
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,340
Your Highness was the one
who made advances on her first.

540
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,670
If this matter blows up,

541
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,790
it will only put Your Highness
at a disadvantage.

542
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,140
I made advances on her?

543
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,040
And who's to prove that—

544
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,840
you?

545
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,860
Everyone in the Eastern Palace saw it:

546
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,620
she was attempting to assassinate me.

547
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,660
I let my guard down

548
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,660
and didn't dodge in time—

549
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,300
that's the only reason
she got the upper hand.

550
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,360
Princess Consort,

551
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,500
why do you always speak up for outsiders?

552
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,159
His Highness is your husband.

553
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,639
My Brother Fuying!

554
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,760
His Highness is resting.
Keep your voice down.

555
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,560
Don't stop me!

556
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,920
His Highness is not available
to see you.

557
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,100
Why are you stopping me?

558
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,159
My Brother Fuying!

559
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,639
Sister!

560
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,500
Watch out!

561
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,179
Brother Fuying!

562
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:21,980
Don't stop me.

563
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,860
Brother Fuying!

564
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,420
His Highness is not available
to see you.

565
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,500
What do you mean he's not available?

566
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,760
I'm the Crown Prince's brother-in-law—

567
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,639
the Princess Consort's own brother!

568
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,620
I'm the future Imperial Uncle!

569
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,679
I'm here to deliver bad news—

570
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,639
to report a death to my sister
and brother-in-law.

571
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,620
How could he possibly be unavailable?

572
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,100
Sister.

573
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,120
Sister!

574
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,020
Our father...

575
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,580
What happened to Father?

576
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,699
On his

577
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,400
wedding night…

578
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,239
Father passed away.

579
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,280
Before he died,

580
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
the one he worried about most was me.

581
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,560
He even instructed

582
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,040
that you—

583
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,300
that you arrange an official post for me.

584
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,880
There's no suitable position
for you here.

585
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,740
Go back for now.

586
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,720
I'll take care of it later—

587
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,800
Don't send me away yet.

588
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,260
I haven't even had a proper talk
with my brother-in-law.

589
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,190
Brother Fuying,

590
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,860
why are you

591
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,640
taking medicine?

592
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,440
Song Yicheng,

593
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,320
this has nothing to do with you.

594
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,120
Leave at once.

595
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,940
He's my own brother-in-law—

596
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,420
how could it have nothing to do with me?

597
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,300
Brother Fuying,

598
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,500
who did this to you?
Tell me—I'll skin them alive!

599
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,900
Stop making such a scene.

600
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,490
Brother Fuying,

601
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,700
I've said it before—

602
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,820
you really should've kept me
by your side to serve you.

603
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,780
Otherwise, if someone bullies you,

604
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,300
who's there to look out for you,

605
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,100
right?

606
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,580
Think about it—

607
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,420
how did Liu Bang conquer
the realm back then?

608
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,960
Didn't he have his brother-in-law
Fan Kuai backing him up?

609
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,490
Brother Fuying,
just let me stay with you please.

610
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,680
As the saying goes—

611
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,200
family sticks together in battle…

612
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,800
runs together,

613
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,360
rings together,

614
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,680
roars together—

615
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,520
no, forget it!

616
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,650
You know what I mean.

617
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,920
We'll stand shoulder to shoulder,

618
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,640
watch each other's backs,
and face everything together.

619
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
Brother Fuying,

620
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,200
keep me by your side.

621
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,360
If anyone dares

622
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,480
lay a hand on you,

623
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,920
I, Song Yicheng, will step in first.

624
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,200
For you,

625
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,260
I'd risk my life without hesitation.

626
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,000
Very well,

627
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Song Yicheng.

628
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,840
You'll stay with me.

629
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,380
Thank you, Brother Fuying.

630
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,380
Mao Jin has verified
all the palace maids on the list.

631
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,020
Only one is unaccounted for—
Xin Qiaoru

632
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,020
from the Imperial Wardrobe Bureau.

633
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,780
The Imperial Wardrobe Bureau?

634
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,900
Could Qiaoru's death be connected
to the Imperial Wardrobe Bureau?

635
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,120
Hey, Old Fox.

636
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,280
By order of the Crown Prince:

637
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,440
seize the assassin

638
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,920
Huo Xiangjiu.

639
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,560
Anyone who disobeys

640
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,640
will be killed on the spot!

641
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,540
Kill! Kill! Kill!
