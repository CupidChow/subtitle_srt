1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,400
Bai Yu,

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,560
have you thought it through?

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
Your cultivation may surpass mine,

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,600
but if you intend
to fight Feng Mochen to the death,

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,640
even with my help,

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,320
there's no guarantee we'd prevail.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,600
Then why did you come?

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,460
Tomorrow is Feng Mochen's tribulation.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,120
During a tribulation, he's at his weakest.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,370
Eliminating him at that moment

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,840
would be effortless.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,680
Why should I believe you?

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,380
Can a tribulation be fake?

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,240
Then how about

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,560
offering a token of allegiance?

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,360
I won't slaughter the innocent.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,600
Of course.

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,480
Like you,

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,360
I have a kind heart—

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,360
how could we possibly
slaughter the innocent?

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,840
The token I want

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,720
is Feng Mochen's barrier incantation.

23
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,990
For Xiangjiu's safety,

24
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,160
you must take her far away.

25
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,870
Xiangjiu is your ferryman.

26
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,380
If you don't let her ferry you
through your ascension,

27
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,700
you'll have to endure endless torment
in the future.

28
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,630
No matter how much you cherish her,

29
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,430
she must ferry you through your ascension
and become immortal.

30
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,220
This isn't the time to discuss that.

31
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,900
For now, stay here and protect Xiangjiu.

32
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,100
Once I have dealt with Gongsun Hao,

33
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,560
you may then take her away.

34
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,960
I've faced Gongsun Hao in combat.

35
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,860
He truly is gifted—

36
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,670
his power even surpasses my father's.

37
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,470
In a true fight to the death,

38
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,140
you may not be his match.

39
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,470
If you don't try,

40
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,940
you'll never know the outcome.

41
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,900
And if you fail?

42
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,740
A warrant has already been issued.

43
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,800
Xiangjiu has been branded a criminal

44
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,280
and forced to live her entire life
on the run.

45
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,300
I will persuade His Majesty.

46
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,180
We'll join forces

47
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,750
and eliminate Feng Mochen.

48
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,830
I will see that Huo Xiangjiu

49
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,740
is returned to you safely.

50
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,380
Xiangjiu,

51
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,670
do you remember when we were young?

52
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,380
There were people coming and going
at your home every day,

53
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,980
asking your father for help—

54
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,360
anything from wrongful cases

55
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,380
to neighbors' marital disputes.

56
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,240
Your father took care of them all.

57
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,780
Back then,

58
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,060
you often helped him,

59
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,320
and he always praised you,

60
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,740
saying that when you grew up,

61
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,680
you would surely surpass him.

62
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,740
By contrast,

63
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,159
my father was always scolding me
for being useless,

64
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,940
for disgracing the Bai Clan.

65
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,220
I, too, wanted to make him proud.

66
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,300
Bai Yu,

67
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,800
in the absence of our parents' guidance,

68
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,800
we must forge our own path to decency.

69
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,840
Y-You're not going to eat me, are you?

70
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,180
We're cultivators.

71
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,940
We're meant to ascend
and become immortals—

72
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,300
we don't do bad things.

73
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,980
You'll become an immortal someday too?

74
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,940
Of course.

75
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,980
In the future,

76
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,220
I'll stand guard
at the South Heavenly Gate

77
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,340
alongside Lord Howling Celestial Dog.

78
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,700
That's wonderful.

79
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,540
Then once you ascend,

80
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,470
grant me a good marriage, will you?

81
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,580
Well…

82
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,920
it's not that easy, actually.

83
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,960
One has to endure many tribulations—

84
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,300
and also

85
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,700
has to meet one's ferryman.

86
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,940
Some people

87
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,080
wait thousands of years

88
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,210
before they ever do.

89
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,180
The tribulation
must be terribly painful, right?

90
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,840
Probably extremely painful.

91
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,630
I haven't been through one yet.

92
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,020
My first tribulation

93
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,280
is coming in a few days—

94
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,510
I hope I can make it through.

95
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,700
If only I could meet

96
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,260
my ferryman before then…

97
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,550
but that's just wishful thinking.

98
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,020
What does your ferryman look like?

99
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,340
Any distinguishing features?

100
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,540
I could help you look.

101
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,740
You won't find them.

102
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,700
A ferryman bears a mark
on the back of the neck—

103
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,500
only the one ferried can see it.

104
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,100
The back of the neck?

105
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,740
Hmm…

106
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,140
do you mean right here?

107
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:43,620
Yes.

108
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,350
Right there.

109
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,060
Oh my heavens!

110
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,860
Master,

111
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,780
look!

112
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,100
Oh—right,

113
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,060
I forgot.

114
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,660
You can't see it—

115
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
only I can.

116
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,420
She bears the ferryman's mark—

117
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,480
she's my ferryman!

118
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,220
I can ascend!

119
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,500
I can ascend!

120
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,380
I can!

121
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,620
I can stand guard
at the South Heavenly Gate

122
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,480
with Lord Howling Celestial Dog!

123
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,020
I was worried about what I'd do

124
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,140
when the tribulation came in a few days,

125
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,140
but now I don't have to worry anymore.

126
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,660
I don't have to undergo a tribulation.

127
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,940
I don't need
to undergo a tribulation anymore.

128
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,220
Tribulation?

129
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,820
I never imagined that Le Ning
would turn out to be my ferryman.

130
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,740
Mao Jin,

131
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,980
a tribulation?

132
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,020
What does that mean?

133
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,260
You've seen it before,

134
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,190
Master earlier—

135
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,500
What you suffered before…

136
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,540
was that a tribulation?

137
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,780
It's nothing.

138
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,820
I'm used to it.

139
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,220
I-I really can't hold it in any longer.

140
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,260
Tomorrow is Master's tribulation again.

141
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,860
The only one who can help him now is you.

142
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,820
As long as you're willing to ferry Master
through his ascension,

143
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,860
then Master won't have to endure—

144
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,320
Enough!

145
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,020
All right.

146
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,380
I'll ferry you through your ascension.

147
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,460
All right.

148
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,020
I'll help you deal with Gongsun Hao.

149
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,659
This won't do.

150
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,460
Cultivators are not allowed to—

151
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,070
What I want as your token of allegiance

152
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,940
is Feng Mochen's barrier incantation.

153
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,700
I know

154
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,620
you've been to his barrier.

155
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,140
As long as you tell me the incantation,

156
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,900
we can truly become one family.

157
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
Give me your hand.

158
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,400
G–

159
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,320
Gongsun Hao!

160
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,580
How did you get in here?

161
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,700
Your Grace,

162
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,970
Absence makes the heart

163
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,800
grow fonder.

164
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,640
Let her go.

165
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,680
If you want anything,
take it up with me!

166
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,080
It was no small feat catching her.

167
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,800
How could I just let her go like that?

168
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,760
What do you want?

169
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,280
What do I want—

170
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,240
don't you already know?

171
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,920
You understand me so little.

172
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,380
It truly breaks my heart.

173
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,040
Old Fox,

174
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,000
kill him!

175
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,200
Kill me?

176
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,520
Cultivators who take a life

177
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,560
suffer total annihilation
of body and soul.

178
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,960
You know that, don't you?

179
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,480
Feng Mochen.

180
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Feng Mochen,

181
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,200
when you've thought it through
and figured out what I really want,

182
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,840
come find me.

183
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,080
But

184
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,280
make it quick—

185
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,040
I can't promise

186
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,200
I'll be patient.

187
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,800
Xiangjiu!

188
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,400
Mao Jin,

189
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,160
you don't need to worry about anything.

190
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,730
You're about to ascend.

191
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,760
Heaven let you

192
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,480
meet your ferryman
before your tribulation—

193
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,920
that is Heaven's favor.

194
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,580
Go. Fulfill your ascension.

195
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,120
Master,

196
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,820
what are you saying?

197
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,820
How could I leave you at a time like this?

198
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,350
The more people I care about

199
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,460
who stay behind,

200
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,220
the greater my misgivings.

201
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,460
If you ascend now,

202
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,660
you'll be helping me.

203
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:40,980
Master,

204
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,260
no!

205
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,540
Mao Jin,

206
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,320
didn't you once say

207
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,260
you were a loyal dog?

208
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,780
This is my final command as your master.

209
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,680
For hundreds of years,

210
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,380
thank you for staying by my side,

211
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,540
so I was never so lonely.

212
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,380
Every parting

213
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,480
begins with a meeting.

214
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,740
From the day we met,

215
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,320
it was destined that there would
come a day of separation.

216
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,800
Mao Jin,

217
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,400
go ascend.

218
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,640
Go fulfill your wish.

219
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Go meet Lord Howling Celestial Dog,

220
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
and stand guard with him

221
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,180
at the South Heavenly Gate
you are meant to protect.

222
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,740
Since things have come to this pass,

223
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,300
Your Highness, why not

224
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,460
proceed to the inevitable?

225
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,060
Have an abdication decree prepared
at once,

226
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,020
secure His Majesty's relinquishment
of the throne,

227
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,880
and at tomorrow's court assembly,
you may claim your rightful place.

228
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,880
My concern is
that the conservative faction

229
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,740
will condemn my ascent as a usurpation.

230
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,620
At tomorrow's morning court,

231
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,940
I will prepare a grand gift
for Your Highness—

232
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,300
a gift

233
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,540
that serves as irrefutable proof
that His Majesty

234
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,500
has been bewitched by a demon.

235
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,380
When the time comes,

236
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,440
the court will surely stand with you.

237
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,020
What kind of gift

238
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,350
could be so formidable?

239
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,780
The

240
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,540
Nine-Tailed

241
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,340
Fox.

242
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,980
Gongsun Hao,

243
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,620
how dare you capture Xiangjiu!

244
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,420
Bai Yu,

245
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,060
why such anger?

246
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,900
Now that we have Huo Xiangjiu
in our hands,

247
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,860
Feng Mochen

248
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,220
will surely walk into the trap.

249
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,820
Why not take advantage of it?

250
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,140
You promised me

251
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,480
that Xiangjiu would be kept safe.

252
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,140
Yes,

253
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,740
of course I did.

254
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:22,700
She

255
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,500
is my future sister-in-law—

256
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,160
how could I possibly harm her?

257
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,300
I won't hurt her.

258
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,100
Rest assured.

259
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,940
Tomorrow,

260
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,660
dress splendidly

261
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,680
and accompany me to court.

262
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,780
The state's lively, isn't it?

263
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,140
Much more so than before.

264
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,060
Prince Fuying forced me

265
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,340
to write an abdication edict.

266
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,510
Did you write it?

267
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,700
I did.

268
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,940
A wise man knows when to yield.

269
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,380
When it's announced,

270
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,020
I'll simply deny it

271
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,340
and see what he does then.

272
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,100
I came this time

273
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,580
to bid you farewell.

274
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,100
So you've finally

275
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
met the one you've been waiting for?

276
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,820
That's good.

277
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,740
You've kept an old man like me company
all these years—

278
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,140
it hasn't been easy on you.

279
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,140
Take care of yourself.

280
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,740
You too.

281
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,220
I won again.

282
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,340
Not quite.

283
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,180
Our thousand-year Nine-Tailed Fox
has finally appeared.

284
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,500
Can you let her go now?

285
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,180
Old Fox,

286
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,300
I'm fine.

287
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,220
Get out of here!

288
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,740
So noisy.

289
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,740
You little beast—

290
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,600
acting on impulse again, are you?

291
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,580
What exactly do you want?

292
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,020
Of course

293
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,740
I'm here to give you a gift.

294
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,160
Feng Mochen,

295
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,660
this is your new home,
forged from black iron just for you.

296
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,520
Help yourself.

297
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Open the gate!

298
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,100
Need some help?

299
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,020
Old Fox,

300
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,860
don't go in.

301
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,700
Old Fox!

302
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,740
Crawl!

303
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,500
Go on—keep crawling.

304
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,180
You're almost inside your new home.

305
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,420
That's what a beast

306
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,100
should look like.

307
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,220
Old Fox.

308
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,340
Damn it—

309
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,180
who locked you in there?

310
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,020
Old Fox!

311
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,420
Long live Your Majesty!

312
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,980
May the State of Muxi prosper eternally,

313
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,540
the realm remain at peace,

314
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,340
and all generations dwell
in safety and wellness.

315
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,180
All ministers, rise.

316
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,540
We thank Your Majesty.

317
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,520
Do the ministers have any matters
to present today?

318
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:05,900
Recently,

319
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,940
forces from Xuanyue State
have been
making repeated incursions to our state.

320
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,020
Father,

321
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,910
I have a memorial to submit.

322
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,260
Prince Fuying,

323
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,980
what is it you wish to present?

324
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,590
The abdication edict
Father drafted yesterday—

325
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,600
shall it be proclaimed today?

326
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,580
Is this not an act of usurpation?

327
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,580
An abdication edict?

328
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,460
When did I ever issue an abdication edict?

329
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,900
Father is truly growing old—

330
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,260
your memory has failed you.

331
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,460
Father,

332
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,980
bewitched by a fox demon,

333
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,820
you have thrown the court into disorder.

334
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,660
You are no longer fit

335
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,540
to occupy the thorn.

336
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,540
Is this not rebellion?

337
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,860
This is rebellion!

338
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,060
Exactly.

339
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,660
Bewitched by a fox demon?

340
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,140
A convenient charge.

341
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,820
Framing someone this way—

342
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,940
how very clever.

343
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,040
Father, do you refuse to acknowledge it?

344
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,780
I can't.

345
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,220
I

346
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,660
no longer even recognize you as my son—

347
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,700
how would I recognize any fox demon?

348
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,660
Will you

349
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,020
ever come back?

350
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,520
The heavenly laws are strict—

351
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,700
I'm afraid it will be
very difficult to return.

352
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,540
I understand.

353
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,940
This will be your last meal
in the mortal world.

354
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,220
Eat, then set out.

355
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,900
Le Ning,

356
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,500
when I was very young,

357
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,580
I'd already heard the legendary tales
of Lord Howling Celestial Dog.

358
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,980
As one of the canine clan,

359
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,060
fate is not easily defied—

360
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,660
yet he broke free of it

361
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,840
and rose among the immortals.

362
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,420
From that day on, I made up my mind

363
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,480
to become someone like him—

364
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,380
to become a divine dog

365
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,840
and stand guard with him
at the South Heavenly Gate.

366
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,120
No matter what I encounter

367
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,940
along the way,

368
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,980
I must not waver.

369
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,660
All right.

370
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,740
I never said I wouldn't help you.

371
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,350
Since Heaven chose me
to be your ferryman,

372
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,340
then this is our destiny.

373
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
Go fulfill your wish.

374
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,340
Isn't that His Grace?

375
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,580
How did he end up in a cage?

376
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,420
Yes—

377
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,740
he's clearly Lord Feng.

378
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,670
Where is this so-called fox demon?

379
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,300
Your Highness,

380
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,300
surely you must be joking.

381
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,700
Esteemed ministers,

382
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,900
please remain calm.

383
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,940
Today

384
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,260
is the day this demon
is to suffer a tribulation.

385
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,980
When the tribulation descends,

386
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,620
I will make this demon

387
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,900
reveal its true form.

388
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,340
Gongsun Hao,

389
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,270
what exactly are you trying to say?

390
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,140
Yes—

391
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,820
what is this tribulation?

392
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,100
None of us understand!

393
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:25,740
Exactly.

394
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,220
What is a tribulation?

395
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,020
A tribulation

396
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,020
is a punishment imposed by Heaven

397
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,950
upon demons who refuse to stay
in their proper place.

398
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,780
Once they develop feelings

399
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,060
and dare to defy the Six Realms,

400
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,100
they must face a tribulation —

401
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,500
to be struck by thunder

402
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,230
and scorched by raging flames.

403
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,380
To take human form,

404
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,900
she has already expended
all her cultivation.

405
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,900
Had she remained a little flower,

406
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,640
she would never have had
to endure any of this.

407
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,220
She fell in love.

408
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,220
For demons, the interval between
tribulations is halved each time.

409
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,540
The first tribulation

410
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,540
comes after 1,000 years of cultivation;

411
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,100
thereafter, the interval keeps halving,

412
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,260
until they encounter a destined one
who can ferry them through the ascension—

413
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,420
only then can they fully ascend
and become immortal.

414
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,020
As for the Nine-Tailed Fox before you,

415
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,460
his tribulation cycle

416
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,980
is approaching—

417
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,380
soon to be a daily ordeal.

418
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,430
Have you ever seen anything like this?

419
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,980
Does this happen often?

420
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,060
Once

421
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,190
in a thousand years.

422
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,820
Everyone,

423
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,630
please look.

424
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,060
Yes—

425
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,660
it's true!

426
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,670
The tribulation

427
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,300
is here!

428
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,980
Feng Mochen!

429
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,380
Feng Mochen.

430
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,060
Appear, demon!

431
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,420
It really is a nine-tailed fox demon!

432
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,820
A demon—an actual demon!

433
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,140
Unbelievable.

434
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,900
Truly unbelievable!

435
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,600
Now you all believe it, don't you?

436
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,460
I've never seen anything like this
in my life.

437
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,180
I'd only read about it in books—

438
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,100
who would've thought
I'd see a real demon,

439
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,940
and

440
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,820
a demon undergoing a tribulation at that!

441
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,660
Well, this really is an eye-opener—

442
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,260
never seen anything like it.

443
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,420
If this were a human,

444
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,280
they'd probably already be dead.

445
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,780
Exactly—

446
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,580
just look.

447
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,580
Distinguished ministers,

448
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,060
if any of you take pleasure in it,

449
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,860
we can hang him outside the gates.

450
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,820
From now on,

451
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,020
you may enjoy this spectacle every day.

452
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,940
Isn't that a bit too cruel?

453
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,020
It's a demon,

454
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,500
not a person.

455
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,520
Why pity it?

456
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,260
Yes, yes.

457
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,220
That's true.

458
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,580
Bai Yu!

459
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,860
What are you doing?

460
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:39,860
Heavenly Thunder,

461
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,400
Earthly Fire,

462
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,000
Five Elements,

463
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,620
Six Harmonies,

464
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,680
Commence the soul exchange!

465
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,740
Follow my command!

466
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,540
Bai Yu,

467
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,460
you actually joined forces
with this demon?

468
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,380
Master was right about you—

469
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,700
you really are useless!

470
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,500
Xiangjiu once told me

471
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,860
I could live like my father—

472
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,740
but I won't.

473
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,420
All right.

474
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,700
I'll ferry you through your ascension.

475
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,280
Good.

476
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,940
I'll help you deal with Gongsun Hao.

477
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,700
Bai Yu.

478
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,140
Bai Yu!

479
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,500
Are you hiding something from us?

480
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,500
It won't be that easy

481
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,120
dealing with Gongsun Hao.

482
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,219
Aside from fighting Gongsun Hao,

483
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,940
what else did you say?

484
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,699
You fought Gongsun Hao?

485
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,739
Yes.

486
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,620
He's my senior.

487
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,540
What else is there?

488
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,340
He wants me

489
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,600
to join forces with him

490
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,280
to eliminate Feng Mochen.

491
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,500
Then join him.

492
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,900
This may be our chance—

493
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,620
not only to get rid of Gongsun Hao,

494
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,420
but also

495
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,940
to set things right.

496
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,860
Gongsun Hao,

497
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,340
what happened?

498
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,260
Your Highness,

499
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,990
you may now read
His Majesty's abdication edict.

500
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,660
Gao Wei!

501
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,790
Yes, Your Highness!

502
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,860
By Heaven's mandate,

503
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,120
in accordance with the will of the times—

504
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,820
What's wrong?

505
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,700
What's happening?

506
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,780
Go on. Read it.

507
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,900
Let me do it.

508
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,500
You wretched woman—

509
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,940
who do you think you are?

510
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,140
What right do you have to read the edict?

511
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,820
This edict—

512
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,460
apart from me,

513
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,460
I'm afraid no one would dare read it.

514
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,860
Gao Wei.

515
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,620
T-This—how could this be?

516
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,140
How could it—

517
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,060
Such a bother.

518
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,500
By Heaven's mandate,

519
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,760
in accordance with the will of the times—

520
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,220
Edict to Depose the Crown Prince.

521
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,220
Prince Fuying,

522
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,340
as my beloved son,

523
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,540
ought to have restrained himself,
observed propriety,

524
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,260
upheld virtue,

525
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,500
and placed the people

526
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,100
and the realm above all else.

527
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
Yet

528
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,420
beneath a facade of benevolence,

529
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,140
he is cruel by nature,

530
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,140
devoid of kindness or filial piety.

531
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,660
As a husband,

532
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,300
he habitually abused his wife
to vent his rage.

533
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,180
Even branches know to entwine

534
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,940
and rely on one another—

535
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,020
yet he showed no tenderness
to his spouse,

536
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,620
worse than grass and trees.

537
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,300
How could he be a husband?

538
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,460
As a son,

539
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,740
with his father gravely ill,

540
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,100
he failed in filial duty,

541
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,740
day after day wishing
for his father's death,

542
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,540
night after night longing for his passing

543
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,020
so he might inherit the throne—

544
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,620
heedless of human bonds.

545
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,980
How could he be a son?

546
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,540
As a subject,

547
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,140
he forced his way into the palace
and plotted rebellion,

548
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,540
seeking to murder his sovereign
and usurp the throne—

549
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,220
betraying loyalty and abandoning virtue.

550
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,660
How could he be a subject?

551
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,740
Such a man—

552
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,900
disloyal,

553
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,860
unjust,

554
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,100
inhumane, and unfilial—

555
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,560
how can he be allowed
to remain in this world?

556
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,780
In consideration of the bond
between father and son,

557
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,380
I cannot bear to send him
to the execution grounds.

558
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,700
By imperial grace,

559
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,150
he is granted

560
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,100
leave to end his own life.

561
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,620
So decreed.

562
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,160
Your Highness,

563
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,960
accept the edict and give thanks.

564
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,860
Gongsun Hao,

565
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,260
what are you standing there for?

566
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,590
Seize that demon woman!

567
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,900
Guards—

568
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,080
seize the traitor Prince Fuying!

569
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,220
Gongsun Hao,

570
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,940
are you out of your mind?

571
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,940
You're insane!

572
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,060
Gongsun Hao,

573
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,140
what are you doing?

574
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,740
We're setting things right!

575
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,860
Father,

576
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,540
it was all Gongsun Hao—
he led me astray.

577
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,940
Do you remember

578
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,420
what I once told you?

579
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,340
In this world,

580
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,780
there are two hardest things:

581
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,900
first,

582
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,460
to keep to one's place,

583
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
and second,

584
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,900
to govern oneself.

585
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,260
As your father,

586
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,980
I gave you chances—

587
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,700
but you

588
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,740
squandered every one of them.

589
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,540
Father!

590
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,980
Father!

591
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,300
Let go!

592
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,420
Gongsun Hao,

593
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,780
you framed me!

594
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,220
Let go!

595
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,700
Let go!

596
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,220
There is still one person

597
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,350
left to be punished—

598
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,380
and that is me,

599
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,660
Gongsun Hao.

600
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,940
I killed my father,

601
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,300
Gongsun Wugui.

602
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,420
I also killed

603
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,700
the Princess Consort.

604
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,180
What does this mean?

605
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,910
How could it turn out like this?

606
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,580
Is this really true?

607
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,860
I am

608
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,620
willing to give my life,

609
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,480
to atone before all under Heaven.

610
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,740
Don't!

611
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,060
How is it?

612
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,920
Just recite the incantation exactly

613
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,060
as I wrote it for you.

614
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,580
And that

615
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,620
will let you ascend and become immortal?

616
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,420
Yes.

617
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,340
Understood.

618
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,700
Nine stars move in order.

619
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,180
Primordial forces stir.

620
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,620
Radiant essence shines bright.

621
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,740
The primal spirit disperses.

622
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,900
The gaze flows without end.

623
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,190
Descend upon me your radiance.

624
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,480
I ascend toward the Vermilion Realm.

625
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,820
Obstructions are released;
the heart is unbound.

626
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,840
I abide among soaring clouds.

627
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,990
I rise to the Purple Firmament.

628
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,380
All matters of the mortal world—

629
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,140
let them be revealed to me first.

630
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,080
I'll let you out first.

631
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,900
The fox demon is being released!

632
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,270
My stomach hurts terribly!

633
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,460
Your Majesty,

634
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,540
I must take my leave and return home!

635
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,870
I must take my leave now.

636
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,360
My mother is waiting for me to eat!

637
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,860
Feng Mochen,

638
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,260
do you really think you've won?

639
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,820
Then we'll

640
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,940
die together.

641
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,040
Gongsun Hao,
don't do anything rash!
