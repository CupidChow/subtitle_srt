1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,160
Gongsun Hao.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,200
You left early that day,

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,820
so you missed it entirely.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,280
Brother Fuying

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,379
spoke highly of me.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,700
He also said

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,220
he would entrust me with important
responsibilities in the future.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,240
At the very least, I'd be appointed
as a first-rank official.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,060
As for you,

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,280
just be obedient to me.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,080
In the future,

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,940
I might even let you be my footman.

13
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,440
Sir,

14
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,620
I heard you injured your back.

15
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,200
Were you injured

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,880
by Princess Ningshuang?

17
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,960
I got injured
from my last sword practice.

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,180
Every horse might fumble,

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,800
and every man might stumble.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,770
My martial arts skills
are quite impressive.

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,860
Someday,

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,360
I'll show you what I can do.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,440
Stop!

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,020
It's that damn girl again.

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,000
After all that searching,
she falls right into my lap!

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,660
This is our chance to earn some merit!

27
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,500
Kill her!

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,780
Where are they?

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,660
You wretched girl!

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,480
Song Yicheng!

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,000
Don't run!

32
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,300
My Lord.

33
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,940
How could a perfectly fine person

34
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,940
vanish into thin air just like that?

35
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,940
Gongsun Hao,

36
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,070
where are you going?

37
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,540
Where am I now?

38
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,540
Why is it suddenly daytime already?

39
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,340
It's the Illusory Flower Woods.

40
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,240
It's so beautiful.

41
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,550
I don't know what's been wrong lately.

42
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,540
Strange visions keep flashing
before my eyes.

43
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,899
Did you see that shadowy figure just now?

44
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,860
It seemed to be a woman.

45
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,180
A woman?

46
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,300
Yes.

47
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,659
That must have been a woman.

48
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:38,180
Does she have some unresolved wish?

49
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,060
If she does have some unresolved wish,

50
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,180
she should have come to you.

51
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,200
Why did she go
to Ningshuang Palace instead?

52
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,080
I said

53
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,880
she might be a woman.

54
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,080
You mean...

55
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,880
she's human?

56
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,600
At Ningshuang Palace,

57
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,420
has anyone seen her?

58
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,400
Yes.

59
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,420
Right.

60
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,460
She's human,

61
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,520
so people can see her.

62
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,960
If she's human,
then this is much easier to handle.

63
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,790
Is your stomach aching?

64
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,920
Sit down for a rest.

65
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,020
Maybe I ran too fast just now.

66
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,000
You need to take care of yourself lately.

67
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,420
Don't make your fiancé worried.

68
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,300
You were right there beside me just now?

69
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,320
Are you

70
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,400
jealous?

71
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,600
What does it have to do with me?

72
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,580
You're not jealous?

73
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,380
No.

74
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,380
You are jealous!

75
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,560
No.

76
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,160
He looks so cute when he's jealous,

77
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,520
like a softshell

78
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,180
turtle.

79
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,380
Softshell turtle,

80
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,980
I think I heard someone calling you.

81
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,940
I'm a turtle,

82
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,100
not a softshell turtle.

83
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,260
Same difference.

84
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,300
Of course it's different.

85
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,540
Softshell turtles
belong to the Trionychidae family,

86
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,820
while turtles belong
to the Testudinidae family.

87
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,020
A softshell turtle has a pointed head.

88
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,540
A turtle has a rounded head.

89
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,140
Turtles are gentle by nature.

90
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,340
Softshell turtles are short-tempered.

91
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,220
But you really
do look like a softshell turtle.

92
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,940
I already told you I'm a turtle!

93
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,260
You've slipped up.

94
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,720
You just said the short-tempered one
is the softshell turtle.

95
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,659
Your Highness!

96
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,520
I heard many guards running outside.

97
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,200
There seems to be an assassin.

98
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,260
Please be careful.

99
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,940
An assassin?

100
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,580
Yes.

101
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,550
Don't follow me.

102
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,060
Your Highness, why are you here?

103
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,940
Where is Huo Xiangjiu?

104
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,640
She...

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,960
She...

106
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,320
Who is it?

107
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,760
Right here.

108
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,260
Your Highness,

109
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,540
why are you here?

110
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,740
Huo Xiangjiu,

111
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,020
come out.

112
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,740
Didn't Xiangjiu just go out?

113
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,940
How did she pop out of the room?

114
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,040
You're the one the assassin is after,
aren't you?

115
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Your Highness, you must be joking.

116
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,580
I've been resting in my room all along.

117
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,000
I never stepped out.

118
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,760
You didn't go out?

119
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,100
No.

120
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,880
I just love

121
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,360
sleeping with flowers on my head.

122
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,120
Got a problem with that?

123
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,960
Huo Xiangjiu,

124
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,960
let's be frank with each other.

125
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,200
Are you really

126
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,160
capable of helping me
reconcile with my mother?

127
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,160
Heroes are not judged by their origins.

128
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,700
I have my own ways to help you.

129
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,320
Your Highness, if you didn't believe me,

130
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,580
you wouldn't have brought me here
late at night, right?

131
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,320
Lord Feng said

132
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,580
I can get what I want from you,

133
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,180
and you can get what you want from me.

134
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,570
I don't know how capable you truly are,

135
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,660
so for now,

136
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,660
I'll give it a try.

137
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,640
However,

138
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,530
as a condition of our exchange,

139
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,080
you must tell me

140
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,760
what exactly you want.

141
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,720
In the Fucang Palace,

142
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,260
the two missing pages
from the Ganquan Register

143
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,790
were torn out by you, right?

144
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,760
What was actually written on them?

145
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,980
Just for this?

146
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,340
Yes!

147
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,540
Good.

148
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,260
Once you've settled the matters
between my mother and me,

149
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,060
I will certainly tell you everything
truthfully.

150
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,500
Your Highness, I hope
you won't go back on your word.

151
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,880
I am a princess.

152
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,800
A princess never lies.

153
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,320
Good.

154
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,180
It's a deal.

155
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,140
Deal.

156
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,160
I've cast an invisibility spell on this.

157
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,780
As long as you hold it in your hand,

158
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,240
you'll become invisible,

159
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,460
unseen by anyone.

160
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,160
Wow!

161
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,710
If you have such skill,
why didn't you use it earlier?

162
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,480
This spell drains
a great deal of vital energy.

163
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,160
You don't even go near women.

164
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,600
What do you need so much vital energy for?

165
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,200
It drains your vital energy.

166
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,310
Perhaps I should think of another way.

167
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,180
No!

168
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,910
This one is good.

169
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,280
I'm young and healthy.

170
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,660
Just tell me

171
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,420
how to use it.

172
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,840
Old Fox!

173
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,620
This is the invisibility spell.

174
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,060
That's amazing.

175
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,100
With this,

176
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,500
I will be invincible!

177
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,840
Old Fox,

178
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,020
you can't see me?

179
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,640
You really can't see me.

180
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,000
You can see me?

181
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,780
For some people,

182
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,900
I can sense them.

183
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,740
Mao Jin.

184
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,200
I'm really brave.

185
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,880
If you don't believe me,

186
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,720
you can do anything to scare me.

187
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,410
Why on earth would I do that?

188
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,220
To prove I'm brave!

189
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,960
Why do you need to prove you're brave?

190
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,500
Then

191
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,740
Xiangjiu will tell me her secret.

192
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,300
Actually, her secret is quite terrifying.

193
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,360
Her secret

194
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,140
indeed will scare you.

195
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,040
So even you know what it is?

196
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,400
I suppose so!

197
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,360
Then tell me now.

198
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,700
I already told you I'm very brave.

199
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,700
If you don't believe me,

200
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,680
you can try to scare me with anything.

201
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,800
If I get scared,

202
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,460
I'll never ask about it again.

203
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,580
Let's just drop it.

204
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,040
Come on, tell me.

205
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,500
Then would you dare

206
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,440
to kiss a man?

207
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,920
But

208
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,360
men and women
should not interact improperly.

209
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,900
Scared now, aren't you?

210
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,540
Just as I said,

211
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,260
actually, many things

212
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,860
are better left unknown.

213
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,740
Why do you need to know them?

214
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,600
Knowing them won't do you any good.

215
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,240
Right?

216
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,200
Fine, I'll kiss you!

217
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,760
My apologies

218
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,300
for the interruption.

219
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,380
Attendant Bai!

220
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,400
No.

221
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,180
Lady Zhao,

222
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,340
the royal physician has told you

223
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,780
to walk slowly and take care of yourself.

224
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,360
It's no big deal.

225
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,490
I'm perfectly fine.

226
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,300
Watch how I ruin

227
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,600
that wretched One Bam this time.

228
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,300
Lady Zhao,

229
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,320
will Prince Fuying believe us?

230
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,420
Why wouldn't he?

231
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,460
I heard

232
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,740
that last time at Fucang Palace,
she made a laughingstock of Prince Fuying.

233
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,500
As long as we let Prince Fuying know

234
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,860
that One Bam snuck into the palace
with ulterior motives,

235
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,340
even if he doesn't skin her alive,

236
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,060
he'll at least kick her out of the palace!

237
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,660
But I just accidentally overheard this

238
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,360
when she was chatting with Le Ning.

239
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,700
We have no solid proof.

240
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
It doesn't matter!

241
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,680
It never hurts to take a shot!

242
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,720
Hold me steady!

243
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,500
With Prince Fuying's abilities,

244
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,900
finding evidence will be easy for him.

245
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,540
Let's go.

246
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,700
Let's hurry to the Eastern Palace

247
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,200
and get rid of her once and for all!

248
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,000
Move faster!

249
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,760
I can't let her go like this.

250
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,290
I need to come up with a plan.

251
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,220
I've got it.

252
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,420
Greetings, Your Highness.

253
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,360
I'm told that you have a secret
about Huo Xiangjiu

254
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,400
to tell me.

255
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,720
Yes.

256
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,180
I guarantee
it will surprise Your Highness.

257
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,940
What are you looking for?

258
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,020
Your Highness,

259
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,220
Huo Xiangjiu

260
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,620
works for Lord Feng.

261
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,460
Lord Feng is incredibly powerful.

262
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,180
Once,

263
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,040
he suddenly landed on my shoulders.

264
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm worried

265
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,360
that the walls have ears.

266
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,890
Come closer and tell me.

267
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,260
Yes.

268
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,340
Speak.

269
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,460
Your Highness.

270
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
Huo Xiangjiu entered the palace...

271
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,060
I never thought

272
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,220
His Highness asked me to come closer
for this reason.

273
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
I truly am a stunning beauty.

274
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,040
Even His Highness can't resist my charm.

275
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,860
Are you going to tell me or not?

276
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,619
Your Highness,

277
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,660
you're so distracted.

278
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
How am I supposed to speak properly?

279
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,819
Just speak.

280
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,099
You're terrible.

281
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:21,980
If you keep this up,

282
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,640
I won't say another word.

283
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,060
Lady Zhao, are you making a fool of me?

284
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,180
Do I really need to spell out
what you've done?

285
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,220
Could it be

286
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,760
that she knows I harassed Huo Xiangjiu?

287
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,480
You mean…

288
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,320
that incident?

289
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,900
Your Highness, this kind of matter

290
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,340
is better left unspoken.

291
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,840
Saying it aloud

292
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,570
would be utterly humiliating.

293
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,300
Lady Zhao, you came here

294
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,740
just for this matter?

295
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,960
Of course not.

296
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,860
However,

297
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,020
since things have come to this point,

298
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,480
I won't hold back anymore.

299
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,500
Lady Zhao!

300
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,460
Are you trying to use these rumors

301
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,840
to threaten me?

302
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,160
How dare you!

303
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,080
Listen up!

304
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,820
Even if you spread this story everywhere,

305
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,220
no one will believe you!

306
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,000
Your Highness!

307
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,960
The people from the
Imperial Servants Bureau saw her come in.

308
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,000
If she dies here,

309
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,380
I'm afraid it won't be easy for us
to explain this later.

310
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,240
Your Highness.

311
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,960
Your Highness...

312
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,890
I'm warning you.

313
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,980
If word of this gets out,

314
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,040
I will definitely have you

315
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,600
cut into a thousand pieces!

316
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,120
Spare me, Your Highness!

317
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,600
Guards!

318
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,180
Throw her out!

319
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,280
I won't dare
to have improper thoughts again!

320
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,810
I won't dare
to have improper thoughts again!

321
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,420
Spare me, Your Highness!

322
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,040
Please spare me, Your Highness!

323
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,640
Lady Zhao, don't blame me.

324
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,900
You just got a taste of your own medicine!

325
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,720
Your Highness, please don't be angry.

326
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,940
That Lady Zhao is far too bold,

327
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,240
daring to act so recklessly
in the Eastern Palace.

328
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,120
Gao Wei.

329
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,560
Yes.

330
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,500
Huo Xiangjiu used to be work
at the Imperial Servants Bureau, right?

331
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
That seems right.

332
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,260
Ask Gongsun Wugui

333
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,000
to look into her background.

334
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,420
It's her!

335
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,900
Why is she in Kunning Palace?

336
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,940
Greetings, Old Madam.

337
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,940
Madam Chen?

338
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,700
She is the Old Madam?

339
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,900
If that shadowy figure was the Old Madam,

340
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,490
why would she go to Ningshuang Palace?

341
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,940
How has Ningshuang been lately?

342
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,940
She's doing well,

343
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,300
though she was rather displeased

344
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,430
at not being summoned by you last time.

345
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,980
Fine.

346
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,000
Have a seat.

347
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
Old Madam,

348
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,920
do you really not want to meet her?

349
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,720
You know

350
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,600
what would happen if I met her.

351
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,840
I won't meet her.

352
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,200
Just let her hate me.

353
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,140
So the Old Madam truly has hidden reasons.

354
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,520
Madam Chen,

355
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,690
thank you for your hard work

356
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,400
all these years.

357
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,280
Old Madam, why say such things?

358
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,680
Back then, it was only
because you trusted me

359
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,400
that you asked me
to take care of Princess Ningshuang.

360
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,200
I'm even worried
that I haven't done my job well,

361
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,460
ruining Princess Ningshuang's future.

362
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,200
Why do you even speak
of ruining her future?

363
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,940
Now, Ningshuang

364
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,180
can distinguish right from wrong

365
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,580
and is skilled
in both literary and martial arts.

366
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,360
This is all thanks to your teaching.

367
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,060
In Ningshuang's eyes,

368
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,340
you have long been

369
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,020
her mother.

370
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,730
I wouldn't dare!

371
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,880
I would never dare to overstep my bounds!

372
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,280
Oh, look at you.

373
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,360
I didn't mean anything by it.

374
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
Get up now.

375
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,260
I have never fulfilled my duty
as a mother.

376
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,720
How could I dare to hope that Ningshuang

377
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,200
would regard me as her mother?

378
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,720
All the motherly love she has got

379
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,360
comes from you.

380
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,620
Old Madam,

381
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,210
are you sure you don't want
to meet Princess Ningshuang?

382
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,140
Forget it.

383
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,570
Let's not talk about this anymore.

384
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,160
I'm feeling a little tired.

385
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,760
I'd like to rest for a while.

386
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,440
Then I

387
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,680
shall take my leave.

388
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,910
Just what hidden reason could there be

389
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,060
to abandon one's own child?

390
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,120
That's not right.

391
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,580
If the Old Madam had abandoned
Princess Ningshuang,

392
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,740
then why would she have gone

393
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,520
to Ningshuang Palace at night?

394
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,660
She certainly didn't go

395
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,680
to Ningshuang Palace for Madam Chen.

396
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,210
She can summon Madam Chen
anytime she wishes.

397
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,440
Could it be

398
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,900
for Princess Ningshuang?

399
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,380
You...

400
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,220
I am...

401
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,580
A flower spirit?

402
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,060
You're so adorable

403
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,420
and you know magic.

404
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,540
You must be a flower spirit.

405
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,300
Old Madam,

406
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,940
you flatter me.

407
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,620
How could I be a flower spirit?

408
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,300
A fairy.

409
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,560
A heavenly

410
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,760
fairy.

411
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
I never imagined

412
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,940
that immortals actually
exist in this world.

413
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,420
Come here. Have a seat.

414
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,780
Have a seat.

415
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,400
All right.

416
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,600
In my life,

417
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,860
it is such a rare blessing
to meet a fairy.

418
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,700
I haven't prepared any welcome gift.

419
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,160
If you don't deem them unworthy,

420
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,100
I'd like to give you

421
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,660
these jewelry pieces.

422
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,860
This is too much.

423
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,260
We've just met,

424
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,720
and you're giving me
such valuable jewelry.

425
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,080
Perhaps

426
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,280
I should also give you something

427
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,220
in return.

428
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,660
Yes, please.

429
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,280
Of course.

430
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,500
A gift from a fairy

431
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,060
must be extraordinary.

432
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,220
Then, I...

433
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,860
I'll give you...

434
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,260
I'll give you...

435
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,740
I'll give you a...

436
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,180
blessing.

437
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,660
A blessing from a fairy

438
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,860
is very efficacious.

439
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,980
Since it's efficacious,

440
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,000
then why not

441
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,480
give this blessing

442
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,080
to Ningshuang?

443
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,900
May Ningshuang

444
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,300
enjoy health and peace

445
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,700
and

446
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,660
be happy every single day.

447
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,680
Old Madam.

448
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,660
Old...

449
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,080
Old Ma...

450
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,700
People all say

451
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,620
that in your earlier years,

452
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,140
you nearly died in childbirth.

453
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,900
Because of this,

454
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,660
you grew distant from Princess Ningshuang,

455
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,200
refusing to see her for decades.

456
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,740
But from what I witnessed today,

457
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,820
you still care deeply

458
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,500
about Princess Ningshuang.

459
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,960
Actually,

460
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,260
I...

461
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,700
bring misfortune to Ningshuang.

462
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,260
If I come into contact with Ningshuang,

463
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,860
the consequences that befall her
will range

464
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,000
from minor injuries to severe illness.

465
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,660
It happens every single time.

466
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
I am...

467
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,640
a jinx to her.

468
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,840
So when I miss Ningshuang,

469
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,300
I can only sneak to Ningshuang Palace
late at night

470
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,820
and watch her from afar.

471
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,060
So,

472
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,300
the evil spirit they mentioned...

473
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,940
was...

474
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,120
you?

475
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,460
Then,

476
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,440
they said

477
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,760
in the outhouse...

478
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,800
I'm embarrassed to admit it.

479
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,380
That night,

480
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,600
when I was watching Ningshuang
from a distance,

481
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,220
I suddenly felt

482
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,140
a dull ache

483
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,580
in my abdomen.

484
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,640
Help me...

485
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,140
Ah!

486
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,440
Oh my goodness!

487
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,000
So that's what happened.

488
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,000
Please rest assured, Old Madam.

489
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,620
I will definitely help you reunite

490
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,150
with Princess Ningshuang.

491
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,160
Among the hundred schools of thought
during the early Qin period,

492
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,840
Zou Yan

493
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,400
established the Theory
of the Five Elements' Cycles,

494
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,460
emphasizing the mutual generation
and restriction of the Five Elements.

495
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,700
This had a profound impact
on later generations.

496
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,640
The Zhou Dynasty valued the Fire Element
and the color red.

497
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,900
After Qin destroyed Zhou,

498
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,200
they established their nation valuing
the Water Element and the color black.

499
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,000
However,

500
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,340
these are just theories.

501
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,040
The situation between the Old Madam
and Princess Ningshuang

502
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,040
is simply too bizarre.

503
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,880
The Old Madam told me in detail

504
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,640
that every time she attempted
to meet Princess Ningshuang,

505
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,000
something untoward would happen
to the princess.

506
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,520
This reminds me

507
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,610
of the incident
where the bathtub turned blood-red.

508
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,280
It seems that Ningshuang Palace

509
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,840
is really haunted by evil spirits.

510
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,790
Whether it's an evil spirit or not,

511
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,060
we'll find out once we lure it out.

512
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,560
Go to see her now?

513
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,960
Yes.

514
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,960
I've already spoken to the Old Madam.

515
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,680
She's waiting for you now.

516
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,080
Do you expect me to believe that?

517
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,500
When we arrive at Kunning Palace,

518
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,340
she

519
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,220
will turn me away again.

520
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,840
This

521
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,920
has happened too many times.

522
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,120
Your Highness.

523
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,340
I...

524
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,320
I swear on my life!

525
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,120
If the Old Madam refuses to see you,

526
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,320
I'll accept any punishment you decide.

527
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,460
Why are you so certain?

528
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,280
I'm certain

529
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,410
of the Old Madam's love for you.

530
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,000
Love

531
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,680
can't be hidden.

532
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,800
Your Highness, please get
in the palanquin.

533
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,010
What is the meaning of this?

534
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,460
To ensure your safety.

535
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,720
Getting in Lord Feng's palanquin

536
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,080
will keep me safe?

537
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,830
Of course it's not just about a palanquin.

538
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,700
Your Highness,

539
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,180
please.

540
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,860
If you encounter anything strange,

541
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,220
he can help resolve it.

542
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,910
He has that kind of ability?

543
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,660
Of course!

544
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,780
He is a descendant
of the Bai Clan of Bronze County,

545
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,440
specializing in dealing
with these bizarre and unusual matters.

546
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,540
Your Highness,

547
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,570
I've also prepared a second layer
of protection!

548
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,120
What a grand

549
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,020
spectacle this is!

550
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,900
I never thought in my lifetime

551
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,440
that I'd receive the honor
of Lord Feng's personal escort.

552
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,680
You flatter yourself, Princess Ningshuang.

553
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,960
It's not for your sake.

554
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,180
I know.

555
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,740
It's because of this girl.

556
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,940
Indeed,

557
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,400
she is quite interesting.

558
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,920
Not just interesting.

559
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,470
She's also cute.

560
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,840
Not just cute.

561
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,860
She's also

562
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,420
pretty, I guess.

563
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,700
Not just pretty.

564
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
I'm done talking.

565
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,720
She is kind-hearted
and always ready to help others in need.

566
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,800
She has a strong sense of justice

567
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,520
and likes to help those in distress.

568
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,400
No matter what difficulties come her way,
she always finds a way to solve them.

569
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,240
She is persevering

570
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,760
and never gives up easily.

571
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,580
Enough.

572
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,220
In all my years,

573
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,180
I've never once heard

574
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,320
a single word of praise from you.

575
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,920
You lot

576
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,840
really don't have these fine qualities.

577
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,680
Enough!

578
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,960
I can't stand listening to this anymore.

579
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,800
Let's go now.

580
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,540
Disgusting.

581
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,680
If I come into contact with Ningshuang,

582
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,160
the consequences that befall her
will range

583
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,200
from minor injuries to severe illness.

584
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,860
It happens every single time.

585
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,700
I am...

586
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,740
a jinx to her.

587
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,620
The Old Madam is waiting for you inside.

588
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,200
Okay.

589
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,260
Your Highness!

590
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,400
Your Highness!
