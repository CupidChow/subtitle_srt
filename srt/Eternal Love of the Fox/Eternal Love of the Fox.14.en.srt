1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,820
You never eat on time—

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,400
especially breakfast—

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,140
and it makes me

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,620
suffer terribly.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,140
I endure it all day, and when it finally

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,200
gets late at night, you start eating.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,600
After you eat, you fall asleep,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,440
while I...

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,240
have to spend the entire night, again and again,

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,620
working hard to digest all that food.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,600
You're so cruel to me.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,840
Drink the medicine quickly.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,920
The medicine can suppress her.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,360
Stop struggling.

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,620
Let's go to

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,680
the underworld together.

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,030
Drink the medicine now!

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,820
This is between us.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,120
It's none of your business...

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,880
Am I... really going to die?

21
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,120
From today onward,

22
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,100
take your medicine on time every day.

23
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,300
You need to eat the meals

24
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
I prepare for you, three times a day.

25
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,420
You must go to bed before 9 PM every night.

26
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,280
You must not overindulge in food,

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,040
get angry,

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,800
be sad,

29
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,680
worry,

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,800
stay up all night,

31
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,680
exhaust yourself,

32
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,720
or do anything harmful to your body.

33
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,660
Okay!

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,200
No need to wait until 9 PM.

35
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,480
I'll sleep right now.

36
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Do you think I want to live like this?

37
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,900
We work until late every day.

38
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,800
Even after we're off duty,

39
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,880
Lady Zhao still makes us keep working.

40
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,260
When we're done, we sleep.

41
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,940
When we wake up, we work again.

42
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,260
As for food,

43
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,980
it's just leftovers from the Imperial Kitchen.

44
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,640
Even so,

45
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,040
I still want to do something I truly want to do.

46
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,080
Even if it's just for an hour.

47
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,560
To read

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,640
some novels.

49
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,880
At least this way,

50
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,480
I can fool myself into thinking

51
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,920
that my life is my own,

52
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,480
not owned by work.

53
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,360
Perhaps...

54
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,460
this is just the fate of us commoners.

55
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,120
How long...

56
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,180
does it take you...

57
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,240
to forget someone who's passed away?

58
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,480
You've been married into our family for a year now!

59
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,300
Why haven't you

60
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,740
gotten pregnant yet?

61
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,670
Even a hen would've laid several clutches of eggs by now!

62
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,460
Are you plotting something in your heart?

63
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,100
No.

64
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,420
Drink this bowl of

65
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,580
cow dung soup!

66
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,880
I had an old imperial physician prepare it specially!

67
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,240
Drink it!

68
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,640
Drink!

69
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,940
Such good soup, all wasted!

70
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,100
You wretched girl!

71
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,980
I'll beat you to death today!

72
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,380
You wretched girl!

73
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,520
How dare you spit it all out!

74
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,659
You wretched girl!

75
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,000
Where did this little beast come from?

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
Catch it!

77
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,840
Don't hit it!

78
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,560
Beat it!

79
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:44,900
Kill it!

80
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,400
Little White Fox!

81
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Don't hit it!

82
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,360
Little White Fox, run!

83
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,360
Run!

84
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,920
Kill it!

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Don't hit it!

86
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,480
Little White Fox, run!

87
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,440
Run!

88
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,880
Don't worry about me!

89
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,540
Run!

90
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,680
I'll beat you to death, you wretched girl!

91
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,060
Don't worry about me!

92
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,200
Just stay in here and reflect on your actions!

93
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,240
Don't expect your husband to come rescue you!

94
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,520
He is my son

95
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,250
before he's ever your husband!

96
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,620
Mother,

97
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,620
please let me out!

98
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,540
Mother!

99
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,240
I was wrong!

100
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,860
Mother, please let me out!

101
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,100
Let me out,

102
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,220
Mother!

103
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,780
Little White Fox?

104
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
Little White Fox,

105
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,800
are you hurt?

106
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,180
Thank you, Little White Fox.

107
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,900
Don't worry.

108
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,140
My husband is...

109
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,380
is very good.

110
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,760
He's very kind.

111
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,880
He will definitely...

112
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,120
come get me out of here soon.

113
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,940
Little White Fox.

114
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,880
Do you like the Moon Palace?

115
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
I heard

116
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,700
that Chang'e and the Jade Rabbit live there.

117
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,660
I really envy them.

118
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,800
If Chang'e and the Jade Rabbit can go,

119
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
then you and I can go too, right?

120
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,880
I really want to go there.

121
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,700
That place...

122
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,559
must be a place of true happiness.

123
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,340
Little White Fox...

124
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,660
I'm so cold...

125
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,280
I'm so cold...

126
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,270
Little White Fox...

127
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,580
First bow to heaven and earth!

128
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,840
Second bow to the parents!

129
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,540
Husband and wife bow to each other!

130
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,960
Ceremony complete!

131
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,940
Escort the couple to the bridal chamber!

132
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,500
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

133
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,940
Little...

134
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,780
White Fox...

135
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,320
Don't worry about me.

136
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,140
I heard his son is very kind.

137
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,060
Take good care of yourself.

138
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,540
I will also...

139
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,100
live a very happy life.

140
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,160
Am I really...

141
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,700
going to die?

142
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,900
You'll be fine.

143
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,460
I really hope

144
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,300
I can see my dad

145
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,760
one more time before I die.

146
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,460
You'll be fine.

147
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,060
Oh, right,

148
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,960
about the Imperial Servants Bureau...

149
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,760
I said,

150
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,040
you'll be fine.

151
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,800
What's wrong?

152
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,410
Why are you so agitated?

153
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,440
Do you remember what I told you?

154
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,180
Holding hands can do many things

155
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,620
and cure all ailments.

156
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,240
During this time,

157
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,880
just rest well.

158
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,960
If our palace maids'

159
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,020
withheld wages...

160
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,500
Alright.

161
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,300
Rest easy.

162
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,760
Leave these matters to me.

163
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,020
Didn't you say you didn't want to meddle in such things?

164
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,730
Anything related to you

165
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,540
is never trivial to me.

166
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,280
May I ask

167
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,420
why Your Grace summoned

168
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,740
this servant today?

169
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,740
Two things.

170
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,260
First,

171
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,760
return every copper of the wages

172
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,890
you previously withheld to everyone.

173
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,360
Second,

174
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,720
after work hours,

175
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,320
you are forbidden to make them work anymore.

176
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,400
Your Grace,

177
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,140
the palace has its own rules.

178
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,020
Rewards and punishments

179
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,220
are clearly defined.

180
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,580
If I really carry out your orders,

181
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,220
how is this servant supposed to manage the bureau?

182
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,260
Lady Zhao, are you genuinely managing the bureau,

183
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,800
or are you using it as a pretext

184
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,560
to oppress others?

185
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,800
I presume Your Grace

186
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,600
must have been incited by that girl, Huo Xiangjiu.

187
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,600
It's not that this servant dares to disobey,

188
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,480
but

189
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,680
I'm worried

190
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,620
that Your Grace cannot

191
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,080
bear the consequences of this matter.

192
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
You cannot.

193
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,720
Lady Zhao,

194
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,840
are you threatening me?

195
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,460
My heavens.

196
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,540
I wouldn't dare.

197
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,620
This servant wouldn't dare.

198
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,380
Even with ten times the courage,

199
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,510
I'd never dare to threaten Your Grace.

200
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,540
It's just that this matter

201
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,800
is extremely serious.

202
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,360
It concerns more than just

203
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,960
a small Imperial Servants Bureau.

204
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,760
I beg Your Grace to reconsider carefully.

205
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,490
Please reconsider carefully.

206
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
Are you telling me what to do?

207
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,740
No, no, no.

208
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,780
Since Your Grace has spoken,

209
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,740
this servant will carry out your orders.

210
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,100
I'll act according to Your Grace's orders.

211
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,640
Lord Feng is no different from the rest.

212
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,840
These damn men

213
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
lose all sense when they see a woman.

214
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,760
I think Huo Xiangjiu will be the death of Lord Feng!

215
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,920
Let's see how I deal with this pair

216
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,240
of scoundrels!

217
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,660
Just you wait.

218
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,080
Put me down!

219
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,200
What are you doing?

220
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,660
Put me down!

221
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,660
Your Highness,

222
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,280
what is all this about?

223
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,220
I'm bored.

224
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,860
So I had you brought here

225
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,790
to entertain me.

226
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,780
Using me for entertainment?

227
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,700
You were never properly castrated, yet you still infiltrated the palace.

228
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,760
And you even dared to take liberties with me.

229
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,360
Using you for entertainment

230
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,860
is perfectly justified.

231
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,200
Your Highness,

232
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,540
I did help you reconcile with the Old Madam,

233
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,540
didn't I?

234
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,940
That's precisely why

235
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,700
you're still alive.

236
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,500
Otherwise,

237
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,920
I'd have killed you already.

238
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,080
Wait, wait!

239
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,440
Your Highness! Your Highness!

240
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,000
If you want entertainment,

241
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,360
let me tell you a joke.

242
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,560
Jokes are fun!

243
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Laugh once,

244
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,320
and you'll feel ten years younger.

245
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,160
Laugh twice,

246
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,090
and you'll feel like a child again.

247
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,240
Fine.

248
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,440
But if your joke isn't funny,

249
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,860
I'll have to entertain myself my way.

250
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,800
Got one.

251
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,840
Tell me,

252
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,000
is the Grim Reaper

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,800
divine or demonic?

254
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,740
How would I know that?

255
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,620
Obviously,

256
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,900
he must be divine.

257
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,560
Otherwise,

258
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,620
we'd just call him

259
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,910
"you old devil."

260
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,300
Old devil...

261
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
Have you started telling your joke?

262
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,510
I just finished.

263
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,660
Are you messing with me?

264
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,260
What I just said was the joke.

265
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,180
Wait, wait!

266
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,780
Let me think of another one for Your Highness!

267
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,840
Let me think again!

268
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,830
Another joke...

269
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,140
Got it.

270
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,380
Cats go "meow meow meow."

271
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,080
Dogs go "hah hah hah."

272
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,260
Ducks go "quack quack quack."

273
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,350
What do bees say?

274
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,580
Bees say...

275
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,060
"Bee prepared."

276
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,300
This one...

277
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,420
This one isn't funny either, eh?

278
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,820
When exactly are you going to start your joke?

279
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,480
Your Highness!

280
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,540
What's wrong?

281
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,140
The directors of the Palace Service Bureau and Imperial Wardrobe Bureau—

282
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,700
the heads

283
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,860
of the six bureaus and twenty-four departments—

284
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,300
all of them have gone to Fucang Palace to make trouble for Huo Xiangjiu!

285
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,340
What's the trouble about?

286
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,140
They say

287
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,579
Lord Feng is interfering with the management of their offices!

288
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,700
We demand to see His Grace!

289
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,180
We must see His Grace immediately!

290
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,140
We insist on seeing His Grace!

291
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,740
I've been managing the bureau for 30 years.

292
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,780
This implies we're incompetent!

293
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,859
How are we supposed to manage things from now on?

294
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,060
-Exactly!
-Yeah!

295
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,339
Might as well just execute us!

296
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,660
Directors!

297
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,220
His Grace is busy with official duties.

298
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,020
Everyone,

299
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,280
please go back.

300
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,900
-No way!
-No!

301
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,340
We're not leaving!

302
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,180
We want to see His Grace!

303
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,580
We absolutely won't leave without seeing His Grace!

304
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,980
Stop!

305
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,580
We want to see His Grace!

306
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,640
If you don't leave now,

307
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,970
I won't be so easy on you!

308
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,100
Come at me then!

309
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,100
Why did you bring me to the Illusory Flower Woods?

310
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,140
Let me out. I need to confront them!

311
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,870
Do you remember what I told you?

312
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,300
You can't get angry

313
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,000
or be sad.

314
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,740
You can't overindulge in food,

315
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,440
stay up all night,

316
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,120
or worry.

317
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,520
You can't do anything harmful to your body.

318
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,060
Rest well here.

319
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,120
When they're done arguing,

320
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,650
they'll leave on their own.

321
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,720
But...

322
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,320
But what if they don't leave?

323
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,120
Then you

324
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,160
can just stay here in the Illusory Flower Woods.

325
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,420
Wouldn't that be nice?

326
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,340
With such beautiful scenery,

327
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,020
staying here permanently

328
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,680
would certainly be pleasant.

329
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,620
Enjoy the flowers here.

330
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,820
I'll be right back.

331
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,900
Remember.

332
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,660
Don't overindulge in food.

333
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,380
Don't get angry,

334
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,100
be sad,

335
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,820
or worry.

336
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,500
Don't stay up late

337
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,420
or do anything harmful to my body!

338
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,620
I know it by heart.

339
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,380
Important things are always worth repeating.

340
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,100
Of course.

341
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,030
What do you mean?

342
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,180
Old people

343
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,240
always like to nag.

344
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,700
Am I old?

345
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,140
You're over 1,000 years old.

346
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,870
If that's not old, then what is?

347
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:57,860
Hmm.

348
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,300
Fair point.

349
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,980
Where are you going?

350
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,320
To get my dentures.

351
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,760
You petty fox.

352
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,240
You're...

353
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,100
You're just...

354
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,580
leaving me here all alone?

355
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,200
Feng Mochen!

356
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,380
Old Fox!

357
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,200
Now,

358
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,360
Lord Feng

359
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,900
must be overwhelmed.

360
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,880
Put it down.

361
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,800
Going up against me

362
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,500
means making an enemy

363
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,220
of all the bureaus.

364
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Everyone manages this way.

365
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,100
Dare to break my rules,

366
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,620
and you break everyone's rules.

367
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,080
None of those in charge

368
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,480
is easy to deal with.

369
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,140
Would they let her off easily?

370
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,360
I say that girl Huo Xiangjiu

371
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,920
is finished this time.

372
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,060
If other directors find out

373
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,060
she was the one instigating behind the scenes,

374
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,720
they'll

375
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,840
tear her to pieces!

376
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,580
I've recovered.

377
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,310
I've recovered!

378
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,400
I've fully recovered.

379
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,960
I've fully recovered!

380
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,580
Well...

381
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,000
Your Grace,

382
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,520
where is this place?

383
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,850
I wanted to give you a chance to start over,

384
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,040
but you've wasted it.

385
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,320
For 1,000 years,

386
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,540
you've remained utterly heartless.

387
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,160
Why does he like flowers so much?

388
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,100
Whose puppy are you? You're so white.

389
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,060
This sunny spot

390
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,940
is mine.

391
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,140
If you become my friend,

392
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,300
it'll be ours.

393
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,660
My dad

394
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,720
betrothed me to Landlord Li's son.

395
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,980
It's very far from here.

396
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,340
I'm afraid I won't be able to come play with you anymore.

397
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,860
You wretched girl!

398
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,420
You've been married into our family for a year now!

399
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,500
Why haven't you gotten pregnant yet?

400
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,780
I'll beat you to death today!

401
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,180
I'll beat you to death!

402
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,440
I'll beat you to death!

403
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,240
Beat you to death!

404
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,180
Your Grace,

405
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,380
what are you talking about?

406
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,100
I don't understand.

407
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,360
You wretched girl!

408
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,700
You've been married into our family for a year!

409
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,200
Why haven't you

410
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,320
gotten pregnant yet?

411
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,540
I'll beat you to death!

412
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,540
Beat you to death!

413
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,560
Who is she?

414
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Why...

415
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,140
Why does she look exactly like me?

416
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,640
Who are you?

417
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,680
What you owe Xiangjiu—

418
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,240
it's time you pay it back.

419
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,940
Why do you only ask who others are,

420
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,060
but never who you are?

421
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,460
Your Grace,

422
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,940
where exactly is this place?

423
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,800
This is the purgatory you built with your own hands!

424
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,480
Whoever built the purgatory—

425
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,500
for them it shall open.

426
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,240
What are you talking about?

427
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,240
I'll beat you to death!

428
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,460
Stop it! Stop it!

429
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,460
I'll beat you to death!

430
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,560
Whoever sows the cause

431
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,580
must reap the consequence.

432
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,220
Someone! Help!

433
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,980
Help!

434
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,920
Let me out!

435
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,140
Someone!

436
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,100
Help!

437
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,240
Let me out!

438
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,100
Someone, please!

439
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,960
Help!

440
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,820
Let me out!

441
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,320
Lady Zhao?

442
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,280
Lady Zhao?

443
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,200
Wake up!

444
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,280
Don't hit me!

445
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,360
Lady Zhao?

446
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,000
Don't hit me!

447
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,640
Lady Zhao!

448
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,480
Mother!

449
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,380
Lady Zhao!

450
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,120
Don't hit me!

451
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,880
Don't hit me!

452
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,180
It's okay.

453
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,700
It's okay!

454
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,630
Don't be afraid.

455
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,440
It's all right now!

456
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,120
I won't dare again!

457
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,740
Don't be afraid.

458
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,140
Don't hit me!

459
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,600
It's all right now, Lady Zhao!

460
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,720
It's all right now.

461
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,420
Mother!

462
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,740
I know I was wrong!

463
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,360
Don't hit me,

464
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,520
Mother!

465
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,100
That Xiangjiu, honestly...

466
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,300
I told her not to meddle in these affairs,

467
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,740
but she insisted on getting involved.

468
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,280
Those directors are all tough characters.

469
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,080
Look,

470
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,000
hasn't she brought trouble upon herself?

471
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,880
Exactly!

472
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,640
Huo Xiangjiu just isn't very bright.

473
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,040
Why does she always have to stick her nose in everything?

474
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,440
Who does she think she is?

475
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,640
What's wrong?

476
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,910
Why are you badmouthing my friend?

477
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,020
Xiangjiu did this for our sake.

478
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,480
She is kind and righteous.

479
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,340
Is there anything wrong with that?

480
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,880
It's fine if you don't help her,

481
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,140
but you shouldn't be making those snide remarks!

482
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,780
Mao Jin,

483
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,820
I really am disappointed in you!

484
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,280
No, Le Ning,

485
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,440
that's not what I meant.

486
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,700
I was just going along with what you said.

487
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,600
I was just concerned about Xiangjiu,

488
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,320
feeling sorry for her,

489
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,840
and that's why I complained a bit.

490
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,640
But you?

491
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,700
You're clearly criticizing her.

492
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,720
That's not the same thing at all!

493
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,940
I'm just like you.

494
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,390
I feel sorry for her too!

495
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,500
Well, she's about to die,

496
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,760
so why is she meddling in so many affairs?

497
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,780
What?

498
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,120
Who's dying?

499
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,860
Have something to eat.

500
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,670
Little white fox...

501
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,080
Just now, in a trance, I saw a little white fox.

502
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,160
Was that you?

503
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,580
Do you remember

504
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,180
I told you

505
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,540
that animals that have cultivated for 1,000 years

506
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,470
eventually need a destined person

507
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,060
to help them ascend

508
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,600
and become immortals?

509
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,540
I remember.

510
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,100
You said

511
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,300
they're called

512
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,520
"ferrymen,"

513
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,740
right?

514
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,060
The reason you can see those visions

515
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,320
is that...

516
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,540
you are my ferryman.

517
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,970
Are you alright?

518
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,440
So I'm your ferryman.

519
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,160
I'm your ferryman...

520
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,900
Then from now on, won't I have you

521
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,070
completely in my grasp?

522
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,180
You'd better obey me,

523
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,360
or you'll never become immortal!

524
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,280
Such a sad matter—

525
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,920
how can you laugh?

526
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,940
Of course.

527
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,220
Having you, Lord Feng,

528
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,660
in the palm of my hand—

529
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,560
how could I not laugh?

530
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,980
But you're dying.

531
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,540
But you also said

532
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,500
I'll be fine.

533
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,780
Besides,

534
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,400
I'm your ferryman.

535
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,900
If I die,

536
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,700
how will you become immortal?

537
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,540
Didn't you say

538
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,700
there are many things in the mortal world worth staying for?

539
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,080
You even persuaded me not to become immortal.

540
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,410
If worst comes to worst,

541
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,000
I just won't become immortal.

542
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'll just stay in this mortal world.

543
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,960
Yes.

544
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,120
But you've

545
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,080
cultivated for 1,000 years

546
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,640
to become immortal.

547
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,560
You can't let some worldly pleasures...

548
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,380
shake your resolve.

549
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
You still have to ascend.

550
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,920
So...

551
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,200
So,

552
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,400
I'm still...

553
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,280
still very useful to you.

554
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
You won't let anything happen to me.

555
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,360
You mean

556
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,610
if I can help you overcome this crisis,

557
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,080
you'll help me ascend?

558
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,760
We can discuss that later.

559
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,100
Right now...

560
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,820
save me first.

561
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,620
So, do you want me to stay

562
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,860
or ascend?

563
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,840
I want you...

564
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,060
to save me.

565
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,460
Honey.

566
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,640
Don't visit Huo Xiangjiu empty-handed.

567
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,220
Ever since you married me and came here,

568
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,180
you haven't been outside to have fun.

569
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,260
After you deliver this to Huo Xiangjiu,

570
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,860
you can go out and get some fresh air.

571
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
What do you think?

572
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,060
Those directors causing trouble outside

573
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,380
have really all left.

574
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,220
I heard

575
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,700
the Princess Consort summoned them to the Eastern Palace.

576
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,160
Lian is really good.

577
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,120
Who is Lian?

578
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,560
Song Lian,

579
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,820
the Princess Consort!

580
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,700
You may know a person's face but not their heart.

581
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,230
Don't trust people easily.

582
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,540
You're so suspicious.

583
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,410
Constantly doubting others—that's suspicion.

584
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,400
I just don't trust people easily.

585
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,260
At most,

586
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,780
I'm just being cautious.

587
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,240
Such a silver tongue.

588
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,020
I'll go to the Imperial Medical Bureau to get your medicine.

589
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,880
You should rest well in your room.

590
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,220
Such a small matter—I can get it myself.

591
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,480
Why are you going in person?

592
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,940
This is not a small matter.

593
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,580
By the way...

594
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,120
Don't...

595
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
Don't overindulge in food.

596
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,320
Don't get angry...

597
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,020
Don't worry.

598
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,340
Don't lose your temper

599
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,860
or get anxious.

600
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,160
-Don't...
-Don't...

601
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,060
exhaust myself

602
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,300
or do anything that makes me sad!

603
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,530
Don't overdo the nourishment.

604
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,760
Just now, in a trance,

605
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,960
I saw a little white fox.

606
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,840
Was that you?

607
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,060
The reason you can see those visions

608
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,180
is that...

609
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,300
you are my ferryman.

610
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,160
Didn't you say

611
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,800
there are many things in the mortal world worth staying for?

612
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,040
If worst comes to worst,

613
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,700
I just won't become immortal.

614
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,320
But you

615
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,880
have cultivated

616
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
for 1,000 years to become immortal.

617
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,340
You can't let some worldly pleasures

618
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,580
shake your resolve.

619
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,040
So, do you want me to stay

620
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,160
or ascend?

621
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,240
I want you...

622
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,000
to save me!

623
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,540
You're back so soon?

624
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,600
Lian?

625
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Am I disturbing you?

626
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,160
Not at all!

627
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,400
What brings you here?

628
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,440
If you hadn't summoned those directors away,

629
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,920
I'd still be having a nightmare of a time.

630
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,440
Come in.

631
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,180
Come on.

632
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:58,960
Sit.

633
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,160
Is Lord Feng not here?

634
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,560
He went to fetch my medicine.

635
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,300
What illness do you actually have?

636
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,660
Just a serious one.

637
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,540
I... I'm just kidding.

638
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,100
You

639
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,110
shouldn't talk nonsense anymore.

640
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,500
Lord Feng personally getting medicine for you

641
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,230
shows how much he cares for you.

642
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,680
A gentleman like him

643
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,680
is all one could ask for in this life.

644
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,840
If you could marry Lord Feng,

645
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,240
that would be wonderful.

646
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,980
Try some.
