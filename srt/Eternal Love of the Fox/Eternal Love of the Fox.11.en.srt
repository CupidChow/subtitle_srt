1
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,060
How is Her Highness now?

2
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,540
The imperial physician
has already examined Her Highness

3
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,700
and said that it's nothing serious—

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,100
it should be heatstroke.

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,580
Heatstroke?

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,400
How could Her Highness get heatstroke
in this weather?

7
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,520
How is it?

8
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,340
Stop pacing around.

9
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,900
Have you found the evil spirit
behind this?

10
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,960
Not really.

11
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,140
Other than that wily fox,

12
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,420
there aren't any other demons here.

13
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,280
The needle keeps pointing at him.

14
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,140
Old Fox,

15
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,600
how's it going on your end?

16
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,440
Nothing.

17
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,700
Everything's normal.

18
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,500
Could it be

19
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,020
so highly cultivated

20
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,100
that it's already fooled both of us?

21
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,380
Just like the bloody water
in the tub last time.

22
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,260
What kind of evil spirit

23
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,190
could have such formidable power?

24
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,260
Or perhaps

25
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,900
Princess Ningshuang

26
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,480
simply suffered from ordinary heatstroke.

27
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,700
Look,

28
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,540
this is fate.

29
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,060
Even if it's fate,

30
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,340
as long as one is willing
to fight for it,

31
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,000
destiny can still be changed.

32
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,740
Fate

33
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,240
is predetermined.

34
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,940
No one can change it.

35
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,140
I have resigned myself to my fate.

36
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,760
I only hope Ningshuang

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,160
can live

38
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,280
a happy and carefree life.

39
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,640
Even if

40
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,840
you never

41
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,570
see her again in this lifetime?

42
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,560
Princess Ningshuang, receive the decree:

43
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,920
the bond between us
as mother and daughter in this lifetime

44
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,180
was severed the moment you left the womb.

45
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,540
You must sever all futile attachments,

46
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,779
lest they harm others and yourself.

47
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,820
From this day forward,

48
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,740
you are forbidden to come anywhere
near Kunning Palace.

49
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,860
Any violation of this order

50
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,860
shall be treated
as an act of assassination.

51
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,360
Your Highness,

52
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:48,880
actually—

53
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,460
actually—the Old Madam did this
for your own good.

54
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,180
All along, she has been—

55
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,020
Get out!

56
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,600
Your Highness, the truth isn't
what you think it is.

57
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,730
Step outside first.

58
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,540
We can talk once Her Highness
has calmed down.

59
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,580
Madam Chen!

60
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,160
See her out.

61
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,180
Yes.

62
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,620
No.

63
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,660
That's not how it is.

64
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,100
Mentor.

65
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,760
The Old Madam has her reasons!

66
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,140
She truly cares about you, Your Highness!

67
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,240
Mentor, let's step outside first.

68
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,620
Mentor.

69
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,960
The Old Madam has her reasons!

70
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,880
Your Highness!

71
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,800
These

72
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,240
are the firsthand records
and related accounts

73
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,420
from before
and after Princess Ningshuang's birth.

74
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,760
We need to identify everything

75
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,360
connected to Princess Ningshuang
and the Old Madam.

76
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,200
Xiangjiu,

77
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,760
the matter between the Old Madam
and Princess Ningshuang

78
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,040
is an unsolvable knot.

79
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,040
Why waste our efforts on it?

80
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,080
Besides,

81
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,960
the Old Madam has already issued a decree

82
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,800
forbidding the princess
from approaching Kunning Palace.

83
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,420
The Old Madam did this

84
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,480
for Princess Ningshuang's own good.

85
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,560
No matter the reason,

86
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,040
the Old Madam
has already accepted her fate.

87
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Why go out of our way to interfere?

88
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,370
I don't believe in fate!

89
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Whether you believe in it or not,

90
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,740
destiny still exists—

91
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,160
right,

92
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,880
Old Fox?

93
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,340
Destiny

94
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,300
can be rewritten.

95
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,660
Why are you saying that too?

96
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,640
Anyway,

97
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,490
I don't believe in fate!

98
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,920
Any unhappy destiny

99
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,850
is meant to be challenged by great—

100
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,920
any great story is

101
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,520
about struggling
against an unhappy destiny!

102
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,740
Xiangjiu,

103
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,850
it's time to eat.

104
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,940
Attendant Bai,

105
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,560
join us as well.

106
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,480
I'm not very hungry.

107
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,360
You go ahead.

108
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,580
That won't do.

109
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,560
If you don't eat,

110
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,160
how can we have any appetite?

111
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,380
If you don't feel like eating,

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,600
let's work on this together.

113
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,180
All right then—together.

114
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,640
That way, it'll go faster.

115
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,100
All right.

116
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,740
Look—

117
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,159
after the princess fell ill this time,

118
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,460
the Old Madam invited a sorcerer
called Sorcerer Yu into the palace.

119
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,620
This was the fourth time
Princess Ningshuang

120
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,340
had fallen ill since her birth.

121
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,000
Because Princess Ningshuang

122
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,020
was often ill,

123
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,760
the Old Madam had no choice

124
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
but to invite a sorcerer
to perform rituals.

125
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,400
However,

126
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,200
there are no records here
of what happened

127
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,610
after Sorcerer Yu entered the palace.

128
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,640
I think I saw a record

129
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,010
of this Sorcerer Yu
in the palace gate guards' register.

130
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,740
Check this.

131
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,660
In the Gui-Mao year, he entered the palace
on the 4th of May

132
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,080
and departed on the 6th of May.

133
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,940
He stayed in the palace for 2 days.

134
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,280
It was after this incident

135
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,000
that the Old Madam expelled
Princess Ningshuang from Kunning Palace.

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,159
Sorcerer Yu must have told

137
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,340
the Old Madam

138
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,539
that the two of them were fated to clash.

139
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,760
So

140
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,340
Sorcerer Yu is the key to all of this.

141
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,820
That was more than 20 years ago—

142
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,419
and we don't even know this man.

143
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,150
How are we supposed to find him?

144
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,160
Chief Steward Sun has served His Majesty
since childhood.

145
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,840
With something this serious,

146
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,620
he must know about it.

147
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,220
All right.

148
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,380
Go find Chief Steward Sun right now.

149
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,860
Now?

150
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,460
Yes.

151
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,860
Isn't it a bit too late?

152
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,360
Mao Jin,

153
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,380
go with Bai Yu.

154
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,980
If Chief Steward Sun loses his temper,

155
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,200
say you were sent

156
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,640
on Lord Feng's orders.

157
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,340
All right.

158
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,940
Come on, let's go.

159
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,340
Come on!

160
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,580
Look at you!

161
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,380
Attendant Bai,

162
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:33,140
I'll go with you as well.

163
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,940
Xiangjiu,

164
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,000
take a little rest for now.

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,800
We'll wait until they have news.

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,520
They're being all lovey-dovey again.

167
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
I really can't stand the two of them.

168
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,720
Whose puppy is this, so white?

169
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,060
You're so well-behaved.

170
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,960
What's your name?

171
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,620
Where did you come from?

172
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,680
Can I be friends with you?

173
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,340
Let me tell you a story.

174
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,000
This sunny spot

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,840
is mine.

176
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,100
If you become my friend,

177
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,300
then it's ours.

178
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,800
I'll sleep a bit longer—

179
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,040
you can sleep here.

180
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,860
You can use the flowers as a pillow.

181
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,920
I'm going to sleep.

182
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,960
Ah, this feels so nice.

183
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,300
Xiangjiu.

184
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,020
Xiangjiu?

185
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,320
Where's Xiangjiu?

186
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,980
We spoke to Chief Steward Sun.

187
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,280
Back then, it was indeed Sorcerer Yu

188
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,640
who entered the palace
and told the Old Madam

189
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,520
that Princess Ningshuang
and the Old Madam were fated to clash.

190
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,120
Can we find this Sorcerer Yu?

191
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,200
It's said

192
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,520
that Sorcerer Yu

193
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,720
was recommended by one
of the palace's old nannies.

194
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,450
Chief Steward Sun didn't know
who that nanny was.

195
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,120
At the time, Chief Steward Sun

196
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,800
thought Sorcerer Yu was highly capable,

197
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,820
so he asked him

198
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,840
for this talisman of protection.

199
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,770
He's worn it on him all these years.

200
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,650
There's a second person's scent on it.

201
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,240
Yes.

202
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,200
This scent is different
from Chief Steward Sun's.

203
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,120
Can you find him?

204
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,380
Rest assured, Master.

205
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,540
If I can't even handle something
this minor,

206
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,460
how could I ever stand guard
at the South Heavenly Gate

207
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,390
alongside Lord Howling Celestial Dog
in the future?

208
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,160
I'm tired.

209
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,000
Move aside.

210
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,240
Go back to your attendant quarters
and sleep.

211
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,520
I won't bother her.

212
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,600
Wily fox,

213
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,440
don't force me to make a move!

214
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,700
Unlock me!

215
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,380
Unlock me!

216
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,620
You unlock me first.

217
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,760
I can't unlock you at all.

218
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,900
Then I can't unlock you either.

219
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,300
Fine—

220
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,440
then neither of us unlocks anything.

221
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,700
Hurry up and unlock me!

222
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,860
Unlock me first.

223
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,220
Then no one unlocks anything.

224
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,680
Let's just stay like this.

225
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,180
So be it.

226
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,780
Are you going to unlock me?

227
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,900
I'll unlock you if you do.

228
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,960
I won't unlock you.

229
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,060
Then no one unlocks anything.

230
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,920
Fine. So be it.

231
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,580
I'm not unlocking you anyway.

232
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,540
Ningshuang,

233
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,300
the weather is quite nice today.

234
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,560
Let's go out for a walk.

235
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,480
Not today.

236
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,490
I have something very important
to do.

237
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,710
Something very important?

238
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,390
Something I've wanted to do

239
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,020
for more than 20 years.

240
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,740
Have all of this taken away.

241
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,260
I have no appetite.

242
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,020
Mother—

243
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,220
we finally meet.

244
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,320
Old Fox,

245
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,360
has Mao Jin brought any news?

246
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,840
The answer

247
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,540
will surprise you.

248
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,120
Bad news!

249
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,600
Princess Ningshuang has forced her way
into Kunning Palace!

250
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,360
What?

251
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,440
Get out!

252
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,720
Get out!

253
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,360
Who allowed you to come in?

254
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,320
Didn't I issue a decree

255
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,680
forbidding you from coming anywhere
near Kunning Palace?

256
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,720
I once imagined countless versions

257
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,800
of our first meeting.

258
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,480
This—

259
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,320
your desperate attempt to drive me away—

260
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,540
was one of them.

261
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
Enough.

262
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,600
I don't want to hear it.

263
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,420
Stop talking.

264
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,660
Get out!

265
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,140
Get out!

266
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,520
I beg you—

267
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,420
leave now!

268
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Guards!

269
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,080
Guards!

270
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,180
Do you despise me that much?

271
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,180
If so,

272
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,060
why did you give birth to me
in the first place?

273
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,140
Ningshuang,

274
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,720
just assume you never had me
as your mother.

275
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,340
The bond between us

276
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,780
was severed long ago.

277
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,460
Do you think I wanted to see you
all these years

278
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,060
to rekindle some
mother–daughter affection?

279
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,100
You're wrong.

280
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,440
Whatever bond existed between us

281
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,100
will be cut

282
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,480
by my own hand.

283
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,040
Since you hate me so deeply,

284
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,960
I'll give this life

285
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,840
back to you.

286
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
No!

287
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,060
Ningshuang, no!

288
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,800
No!

289
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,940
No!

290
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,000
Old Madam!

291
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,780
Why would Mother save me?

292
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,380
She must have felt guilty toward you

293
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,180
and wanted to make amends to you.

294
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,660
Nurse,

295
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,220
from now on,

296
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,140
you're the only family I have.

297
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,240
Don't worry.

298
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,800
Haven't we always

299
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,660
relied on each other,
like mother and daughter, all these years?

300
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,870
What are you doing here?

301
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,800
Your Highness,

302
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,920
I've brought someone to see you.

303
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,900
Leave.

304
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,140
I don't want to see anyone.

305
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,560
I can leave—

306
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,160
but this person,

307
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,800
you must see.

308
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
He is the accomplice

309
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,330
who caused you and your mother
to be separated

310
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,660
for more than 20 years.

311
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,400
Kneel!

312
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,980
Your Highness.

313
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,440
Your Highness, please spare my life!

314
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,340
Back then, the Old Madam

315
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,420
did not abandon Your Highness

316
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,600
because of an inauspicious omen
surrounding the birth.

317
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,000
The true reason was that,

318
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,480
from infancy, Your Highness

319
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,000
was frequently ill.

320
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,780
Thus, the Old Madam

321
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,720
summoned this Sorcerer Yu
into the palace to perform rites.

322
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,940
It was also he

323
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,060
who declared that the Old Madam
and Your Highness

324
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
were fated to be incompatible—
that her proximity

325
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,040
would bring misfortune upon Your Highness

326
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,560
and even endanger
Your Highness's very life.

327
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,420
Your Highness,

328
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,340
I have committed a grave offense.

329
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,380
I deserve to die.

330
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,360
Your Highness,

331
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,660
please spare my life!

332
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,300
Your Highness,

333
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,500
please spare my life!

334
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,060
Please spare my life,

335
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,660
Your Highness!

336
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,720
You deserve to die—

337
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,280
but someone else deserves it even more.

338
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,970
What do you mean by that?

339
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,380
As I said just now,

340
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,940
he was only an accomplice.

341
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,340
The real culprit is you—

342
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,960
Madam Chen!

343
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,860
I truly have no idea
what you're talking about.

344
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,640
According to
the palace's official records,

345
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,440
it was

346
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,280
a senior maid serving the Old Madam

347
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,180
who proposed summoning
a renowned sorcerer to the palace

348
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,540
to perform an exorcism for Her Highness.

349
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,960
Coincidentally,

350
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,820
this Sorcerer Yu

351
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,080
turned out to be Madam Chen's cousin.

352
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,020
May I ask—was the senior maid who made
that proposal Madam Chen yourself?

353
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,380
So, what if it was me?

354
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,060
As the saying goes, "not to shy away
from recommending one's own kin."

355
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,420
Her Highness was frequently ill
at the time.

356
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,140
I was worried about Her Highness.

357
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,920
And my cousin happened to be
a sorcerer of some attainment—

358
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,820
what was wrong
with inviting him into the palace?

359
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,860
Your cousin has already confessed.

360
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,060
He was no accomplished sorcerer at all—

361
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,960
just an ignorant good-for-nothing.

362
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,780
It was you who arranged for him
to enter the palace,

363
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,260
and it was also you

364
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,340
who instructed him to say

365
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,760
that Her Highness and the Old Madam
were fated to clash.

366
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,020
Nonsense!

367
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,380
Huo Xiangjiu,

368
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,260
what exactly are you trying to do?

369
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,200
You schemed repeatedly
to stay in Ningshuang Palace—

370
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,000
I realized long ago
that you were not a good person.

371
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,380
So, this was your plan:
to sow discord and frame me.

372
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
Do you really think

373
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,740
Her Highness will believe
your wild accusations?

374
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,420
Your Highness,

375
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,460
these medicinal herbs

376
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,840
were just found in Madam Chen's room.

377
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,040
We've already had
the imperial physicians examine them.

378
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,160
Some can

379
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,800
induce unconsciousness;

380
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,480
others cause dizziness.

381
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,040
Their effects closely match
the symptoms displayed

382
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,570
when Your Highness
suddenly fell ill before.

383
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,270
I also have here a bottle of red liquid.

384
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,060
When the water

385
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,460
in Your Highness's bathing tub
suddenly turned into blood,

386
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,000
this must be what was used.

387
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,160
And at the time,

388
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,580
there was no one else in the room.

389
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
Ghost!

390
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,060
Madam Chen.

391
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,220
Your Highness,

392
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,320
don't believe her.

393
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,660
None of these things belong to me—

394
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,100
they're framing me!

395
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,400
Sis,

396
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,720
just admit it.

397
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,180
They already know everything.

398
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,240
You wretched fool!

399
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,960
How much did they give you

400
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,620
to make you falsely accuse me?

401
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,000
Your Highness,

402
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,500
please don't believe them.

403
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,220
My cousin is a gambler.

404
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,500
He's always borrowing money from me.

405
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,660
When I refused to lend it to him,

406
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,420
he turned around and framed me.

407
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,100
Your Highness.

408
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,060
Madam Chen,

409
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,260
you stole someone else's child
for more than 20 years,

410
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,190
and even now you still want
to argue your way out of it.

411
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,810
You act as if you believe
that until all is lost, nothing is lost.

412
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,460
I have here a letter

413
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,560
Madam Chen wrote to her cousin back then.

414
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,560
I'll read it for everyone.

415
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,560
Dear brother,

416
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,840
Recently,

417
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,020
the Old Madam went into labor

418
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,100
and gave birth to a princess,

419
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,460
bestowed with the name Ningshuang—

420
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,840
lovely and dearly cherished.

421
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,020
I entered the palace years ago
to serve the Old Madam,

422
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,120
yet I have no children of my own

423
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,460
and feel deeply lonely.

424
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,280
If you can help me seize the princess,

425
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,440
then in the future, glory and riches

426
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,000
shall be ours to share.

427
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,120
Didn't I tell you
to burn all the letters?

428
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,240
I...

429
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,490
What did you say?

430
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,100
She said,

431
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,220
"Didn't I tell you
to burn all the letters? "

432
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:12,760
I...

433
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,800
I really did burn them all!

434
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,460
Then what is this?

435
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,580
It's fake!

436
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,520
You set me up!

437
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,420
Your Highness.

438
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,680
Ningshuang.

439
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,960
Your Highness.

440
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,980
Ningshuang.

441
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
You know how much I love you,

442
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,720
don't you?

443
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,880
From the time you were little,

444
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,600
I've always treated you
as my own daughter.

445
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,440
You even said it yourself—

446
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,960
I was your real mother,

447
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
didn't you?

448
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,440
Ningshuang, don't—

449
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,600
don't believe
what they're saying, all right?

450
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,040
She has a mother.

451
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,520
And her mother's love for her
is the only true maternal love.

452
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,640
Yours is nothing but a thief's love.

453
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,960
What right do you have
to say that about me?

454
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,820
You don't understand my love
for Ningshuang at all!

455
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,660
Only a thief

456
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,600
would claim someone else's child
as their own.

457
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,020
It's not like that!

458
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,260
Ningshuang,

459
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,200
no!

460
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,460
This wasn't my fault!

461
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,060
True maternal love means

462
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,220
that as long as one's child
is safe and well,

463
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,550
a mother is willing to give up everything—

464
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,420
even if it means hiding in the shadows

465
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,620
and being regarded as an evil spirit.

466
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,040
From this day forward,

467
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,980
you are forbidden to come anywhere
near Kunning Palace.

468
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,060
Any violation of this order

469
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,340
shall be treated
as an act of assassination.

470
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,320
As long as the child is safe and well,

471
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,800
that is everything to a mother.

472
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,940
Huo Xiangjiu,

473
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,300
thank you.

474
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Ningshuang,

475
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,440
don't come any closer.

476
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,920
You'll be in danger.

477
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,400
Don't come near me—

478
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,540
you'll be in danger.

479
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,380
Go! Leave now!

480
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,300
No!

481
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,940
Your Highness.

482
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,540
Let go of me!

483
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,240
Let go of me!

484
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,500
No!

485
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,540
Your Highness!

486
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:53,220
Your Highness!

487
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,540
I don't want to leave you!

488
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,060
What's past is past—

489
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,340
why do you keep clinging to it?

490
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,560
Your Highness, please don't!

491
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,600
I don't know why,

492
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,840
but whenever I recall

493
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,770
those scenes of us sharing such tender
moments as mother and daughter,

494
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,620
I can't help thinking of my own mother—

495
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,760
and the pain she endured
while longing for me.

496
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,560
At the very moment you and I were enjoying
our bond as mother and daughter,

497
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,220
my mother

498
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,020
was suffering immense pain.

499
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,480
We are both accomplices in her misery.

500
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,960
We must both atone.

501
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,160
The way I atone

502
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,060
is by devoting the rest of my life

503
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,820
to honoring her all the more.

504
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,840
And the way you atone

505
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,480
is by spending the rest of your life

506
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,080
experiencing her pain.

507
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,960
No! No!

508
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,620
Please don't, Your Highness!

509
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,320
I beg you!

510
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
No!

511
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,280
I don't want to leave you!

512
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,260
I'll do anything for you—

513
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,060
I'll do the same
for the Old Madam too, all right?

514
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,600
Just give me another chance, please!

515
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,780
Your Highness, forgive me!

516
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,120
Please forgive me!

517
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,320
It's not that I don't want
to forgive you.

518
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,520
I simply have no right to.

519
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,080
You do!

520
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,520
Your Highness, how could you not?

521
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,280
Your Highness, you do,

522
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,080
don't you?

523
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,440
Ningshuang,

524
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,760
let me out! Ningshuang!

525
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,640
Ningshuang!

526
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,920
Ningshuang!

527
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,080
I will

528
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,640
take you horseback riding.

529
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,960
I will brush your hair, okay?

530
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,760
I...

531
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,240
Do you still remember?

532
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,960
I used to nurse you.

533
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,040
Ningshuang…

534
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,260
Mother.

535
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,200
I'm fine.

536
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,220
I'm sorry, Mother.

537
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,050
This is all my fault—

538
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,720
I truly deserve to die.

539
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,550
This has nothing to do with you.

540
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,720
If it weren't for what happened,

541
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,380
how could I have ever looked
at you from so close?

542
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,680
This is the first time in 20 years

543
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,340
that I've been able

544
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,320
to look at you this closely.

545
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,740
Mother,

546
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,460
from now on,

547
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,060
you can look at me
this closely every day.

548
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,760
Mother—are you happy?

549
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,400
I am happy.

550
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,820
But...

551
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,000
But what?

552
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,900
Never mind.

553
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,140
These were picked this morning.

554
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
Have a taste.

555
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,640
Mother, you even know

556
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,760
that I like these.

557
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,580
And yet,

558
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,480
I don't know anything
about you at all, Mother.

559
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,520
What is there to fear?

560
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,980
We have plenty of time ahead of us.

561
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,440
Then, Mother,

562
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,820
let's start with

563
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,080
what you were hesitating to say just now.

564
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,560
Whatever it is,

565
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,860
tell me—

566
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,600
will you?

567
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,260
How did you

568
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,600
end up growing all wrong?

569
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,680
You're not even half
as good-looking as me.

570
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,620
Mother, just how beautiful am I?

571
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,320
Mother,

572
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,160
do you know

573
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,220
why Heaven chose to have me born
within the palace?

574
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:35,940
Hm?

575
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,050
If someone as beautiful as I had been born
among the common folk,

576
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,420
any man in the realm
who laid eyes on me

577
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,160
would probably

578
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,900
be fighting over me.

579
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,440
All those

580
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,600
bloody cases—

581
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,800
I think

582
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,560
they'd exhaust the magistrates.

583
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,200
Are men nowadays truly
so lacking in discernment?

584
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Mother!

585
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,760
Then if that's the case,

586
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,660
why are you still unmarried?

587
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,120
I...

588
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,520
You're about the age.

589
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,980
It's time to arrange a marriage
for you.

590
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,840
I don't want to!

591
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,880
Mother,

592
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,460
we've only just been reunited,

593
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,460
and you already want to marry me off?

594
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,040
I want to stay by your side
every day, Mother.

595
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,620
All right, all right—

596
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,420
stay by my side every day.

597
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,440
A child's feelings

598
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,160
are always felt twice as strongly
by their parents.

599
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,900
When a child is in pain,

600
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,520
the parents suffer even more.

601
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,940
When a child is happy,

602
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,180
the parents' happiness
is doubled as well.

603
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,540
If my mother were still alive…

604
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,440
how wonderful that would be.

605
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,880
I can barely remember

606
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,680
Your mother

607
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,540
must have been

608
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,340
intelligent,

609
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,680
lovely,

610
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,000
beautiful,

611
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,480
kind,

612
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,120
brave,

613
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,920
and righteous.

614
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,740
How do you know?

615
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,760
Every mother leaves her mark
on her child—

616
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,520
and in you,

617
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,560
I can see her.

618
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,720
Steamed buns.

619
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,800
Ningshuang,
do you want some steamed buns?

620
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,320
Let me feed you.

621
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,200
Eat up.

622
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,640
Good girl.

623
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,650
Ningshuang, you're so beautiful.

624
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,160
You love it best when I comb your hair.

625
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,280
Don't cry.

626
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,880
Sweetheart.

627
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,120
Ningshuang, stop crying.

628
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,640
I love you the most.

629
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,440
Right?

630
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,370
They're all bad people.

631
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,280
Bad people—

632
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,720
all of them.

633
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,120
They want to tear us apart.

634
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,380
We won't be separated.

635
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,840
Don't separate us.

636
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,699
We won't be separated.

637
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,040
Not ever.

638
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,960
Together forever.

639
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,880
We'll be together forever.

640
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,159
I pay my respects to the Master of Virtue,
Compassion, Benevolence, Rectitude,

641
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,440
Harmony, Wellness, Nurturance, Felicity,

642
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,440
Illumination, Preparedness,
Solemnity, Humanity,

643
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,340
and Steadfastness…

644
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,920
I pay my respects to you, Mentor.

645
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,850
We pay our respects to you, Mentor.

646
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,940
Is all this formality really necessary?

647
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,500
I gave you my word—

648
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,900
if you helped Mother and me reconcile,

649
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,580
I would acknowledge you as my Mentor.

650
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,740
I keep my promises.

651
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,760
Mentor.

652
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,120
Your Highness.

653
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,320
What is it?

654
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,420
Do you remember

655
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,420
the other matter I mentioned to you?

656
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,380
You mean

657
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,820
the 2 pages torn out
of the Ganquan Register?

658
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,580
Yes.

659
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,260
Why are you so desperate
to know about them?

660
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,340
My father

661
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,270
disappeared in the palace.

662
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,940
Your father

663
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,320
is a eunuch?

664
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,960
No.

665
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,100
My father

666
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,420
is Huo Zhongren,
the Registrar of Bronze County.

667
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,020
He entered the palace to present
a petition to His Majesty 2 years ago,

668
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,720
and then vanished inside the palace.

669
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,020
I've verified it—

670
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,100
the two missing pages
from the Ganquan Register

671
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,340
correspond exactly to the time
my father secretly entered the palace

672
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,400
to seek an audience with His Majesty.

673
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,660
Then why do you believe

674
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,300
those torn pages have anything
to do with me?

675
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,720
Your Highness,

676
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,780
please just tell me what really happened.

677
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,580
I...

678
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,220
Mentor,

679
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,260
promise me this:

680
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,240
no matter what I'm about to say,

681
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,900
you must stay calm.
