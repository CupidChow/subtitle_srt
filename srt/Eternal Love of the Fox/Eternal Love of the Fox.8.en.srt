1
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,620
Then...

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,280
Have you found your ferryman yet?

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,640
Not yet.

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,740
♪ The moon rises above the treetops
as the wind softly whispers ♪

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,360
♪ We drink and sing,
sighing beneath the scattered stars ♪

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,360
Don't worry.

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,340
♪ Throughout the long night,
a single lamp remains lit ♪

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,480
Take your time.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,640
You'll find him.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,620
♪ Who truly knows my sorrow and my joy? ♪

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,360
♪ Years of shared moments fade
like drifting clouds ♪

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,320
♪ True love endures through
fate's countless turns ♪

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,300
♪ The one who returns
carries only regret ♪

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,000
♪ With a wave of the hand,
the dust drifts away ♪

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,840
♪ With every rise and fall of the wind,
I think of you ♪

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,200
♪ Your promise lies in my heart,
forever cherished ♪

17
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,080
There's still a long way across the courtyard.

18
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Then...

19
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,100
what about you?

20
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,800
Have you ever seen an animal using an umbrella?

21
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,160
Rain is just water to me.

22
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,490
I'm not afraid of water.

23
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,280
Then why did you ask me to use an umbrella?

24
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,610
I was afraid you'd catch a cold.

25
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,660
Oh.

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,720
Mm.

27
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,980
Let me ask you!

28
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,420
If

29
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,750
you find your ferryman,

30
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,579
will you ascend to heaven?

31
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,750
Is there really nothing

32
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,600
in this mortal world worth your attachment?

33
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,320
The Heavenly Court...

34
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,080
probably doesn't have any good food, right?

35
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,140
Seems so.

36
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,920
Right?

37
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,260
The Heavenly Court definitely has no delicious food.

38
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,579
Even if just for the food,

39
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,300
you should remain here.

40
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,310
Don't you think?

41
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:26,960
Yes.

42
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,900
You don't have to ascend?

43
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,020
Yes.

44
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,980
For the food here?

45
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
For the food here.

46
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,420
You...

47
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
You...

48
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,980
Take it!

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,400
From now on,

50
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,700
you

51
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,290
need to use an umbrella.

52
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,060
Bye!

53
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,620
♪ Who could truly not feel
that sudden flutter? ♪

54
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,280
♪ Let it grow with my eyes closed ♪

55
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,000
♪ I've asked my heart honestly,
yet I remain trapped ♪

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
♪ If lies could become true ♪

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,240
♪ Wherever you are would be my world ♪

58
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,440
I didn't catch a cold.

59
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,220
It's always good to take preventive measures.

60
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,300
Thank you for coming all the way here, Guard Mao.

61
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,100
It's nothing.

62
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,000
I've got nothing else to do anyway.

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,220
The weather has been cold lately.

64
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,100
Be careful not to catch a chill.

65
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,380
Remember to take your medicine on time.

66
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,580
Thank you, Guard Mao.

67
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,380
Look.

68
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,220
Isn't it cute?

69
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,500
I knitted this pair for Xiangjiu...

70
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,900
They're really beautiful!

71
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,230
Thank you, Miss Le Ning!

72
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,580
They're just a bit too small.

73
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,180
That's because I made them for Xiangjiu.

74
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,240
It doesn't matter.

75
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,350
They'll stretch out if I wear them.

76
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,700
Miss Le Ning, you're truly skilled and clever.

77
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,300
This is the best gift

78
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,200
I've ever received in my life.

79
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,260
Then...

80
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
Then, I'll give it to you, Guard Mao.

81
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,659
Miss Le Ning is skilled and clever,

82
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,820
gentle and adorable.

83
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,659
Unlike my master,

84
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,980
who's always wearing a stern face

85
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,940
and scolding me.

86
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,980
Prioritizing his woman over me.

87
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,240
Master...

88
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,490
Why are you out here?

89
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,960
Aren't you injured?

90
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,200
I truly envy

91
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,220
Qiaoru for having such a good, loyal dog.

92
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,160
Master,

93
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,440
what do you mean?

94
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,360
I'm a loyal dog too.

95
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,960
I was worried about your injuries,

96
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,090
so I specially went to the Imperial Medical Bureau to get medicine for you.

97
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,120
Master, please let me explain.

98
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,320
It's a long story,

99
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,280
but I'll t-try to

100
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,840
m-make it short.

101
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,120
But it's hard to explain...

102
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,180
in just a few words.

103
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,420
Mao Jin.

104
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,900
I no longer plan to ascend.

105
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,040
Not ascending?

106
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,320
You've cultivated for thousands of years

107
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,480
and endured so many tribulations.

108
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,120
If it were me who met my ferryman,

109
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,200
I'd have ascended long ago.

110
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,320
Then I'd be ranked among the immortals, standing alongside

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,220
the Lord Howling Celestial Dog, the Supreme of our Canine Realm,

112
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,540
guarding the Southern Heavenly Gate together.

113
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,860
What glory

114
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,470
and splendor that would be.

115
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,570
That's where we differ.

116
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,120
I

117
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,980
don't cultivate to join the ranks of immortals.

118
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,460
I know.

119
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,130
You're doing it for her.

120
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,830
But you're running out of time.

121
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,240
Your tribulations now occur once a month.

122
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,900
Next will be every half month,

123
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,160
then every week,

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,500
then every three days,

125
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,570
and finally, daily tribulations.

126
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,660
Perhaps...

127
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,600
I can endure all the tribulations.

128
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,220
But I can't bear to see you suffer like that.

129
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,330
Then go find yourself a new master.

130
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,760
What are you talking about?

131
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,919
I'm a loyal dog.

132
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,960
Not to mention you're still here—

133
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,480
even if one day you ascend,

134
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,140
I'll guard you just like Xiaofu guarded Qiaoru.

135
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,919
Don't forget,

136
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,039
I'm a loyal dog.

137
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,780
Hurry up.

138
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,580
Ms. Xiang.

139
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,440
Do you know

140
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,560
how to

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,000
avoid running into that thing at night?

142
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,700
Not sure.

143
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,640
Usually, it shows up in the courtyard.

144
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,620
Last time it was at...

145
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,460
Help me...

146
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,120
Forget it, forget it!

147
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,920
Stop talking!

148
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,940
It's so creepy!

149
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,900
Well...

150
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,370
Let me show you something good.

151
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,700
What is it?

152
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,690
Then I...

153
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
I'm telling you,

154
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,880
this is Her Highness's secret treasure.

155
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,400
I heard

156
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,660
it was left by the former Emperor of Muxi State.

157
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,720
I only let you see it

158
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,080
because you're clever.

159
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,040
Shocking...

160
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,000
Shocking...

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,860
and thrilling.

162
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,360
Is this something you people are allowed to look at?

163
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,580
Quickly prepare the water

164
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,310
so Her Highness can bathe soon.

165
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,800
Yes,

166
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,080
Madam Chen.

167
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,400
Get the bucket!

168
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,080
Hurry!

169
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,960
Your Majesty,

170
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,600
are you still thinking about the Princess Consort's matter?

171
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,200
Divorce.

172
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,060
My son wants to divorce his wife.

173
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,640
If this news gets out,

174
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,000
we'll become the laughingstock of the common people.

175
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,640
Please don't take it to heart.

176
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,720
I'm sure the Princess Consort must have spoken

177
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,640
in a moment of confusion.

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,060
You want a divorce?

179
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,820
Dream on.

180
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,420
Father will never agree to it.

181
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,280
I know.

182
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,400
I just want Father to understand

183
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,760
that if he truly wants to help me,

184
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,940
divorce is the best way.

185
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
You...

186
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,040
You will never escape my grasp in this lifetime.

187
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,980
What are you laughing at?

188
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,380
At how pitiful you are.

189
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,860
Besides keeping me trapped,

190
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,390
you can't do anything else.

191
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,720
Father has decreed

192
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,830
that if you hit me again,

193
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,710
it will be considered the same as hitting him.

194
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
You're so pitiful.

195
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,480
You can't even hit me now.

196
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,160
What else can you do?

197
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,700
You'll see

198
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,700
how I take everything.

199
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,980
A ghost!

200
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,100
Madam Chen!

201
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,040
Last night,

202
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
why couldn't I see that thing?

203
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,260
If Old Fox had been there,

204
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,120
he would definitely have seen it.

205
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,400
That stinking old fox,

206
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,140
always hanging around me whether there's a reason or not,

207
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,480
but at the crucial moment, he's nowhere to be found.

208
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,540
It's not nice to speak ill of people behind their backs.

209
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,340
Am I hallucinating?

210
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,160
True.

211
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,620
How would he dare to appear openly

212
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,960
in Ningshuang Palace?

213
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,270
Why wouldn't I dare?

214
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,520
What?

215
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,900
I'm on the orange.

216
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,660
You've turned into a moth?

217
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,000
A butterfly.

218
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,060
You should've shown up earlier.

219
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,350
You have no idea.

220
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,340
Last night,

221
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,820
Princess Ningshuang's bathwater suddenly turned blood red.

222
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,780
It must be that thing causing trouble again.

223
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,340
I was outside the door all night.

224
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,020
I didn't see anything unusual

225
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,600
entering or leaving Princess Ningshuang's chamber.

226
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
That's impossible.

227
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,540
Unless...

228
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,800
that thing

229
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,060
has been inside Princess Ningshuang's chamber all along.

230
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,160
I'm going to bring food to Princess Ningshuang now.

231
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,690
Come with me and take a look.

232
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,970
Greetings, Your Highness.

233
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,040
Your Highness?

234
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,660
That's strange.

235
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,120
Nothing unusual here.

236
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,840
Please f-f-forgive me, Your Highness!

237
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,180
What are you doing,

238
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,180
Huo Xiangjiu!

239
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,280
Huo Xiangjiu,

240
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,880
do you have a death wish?

241
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,500
Where did this moth come from?

242
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,820
Catch it!

243
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,480
Where did this moth come from?

244
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,060
It flew away!

245
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,520
Anything that dares harm Her Highness,

246
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,620
I'll make it...

247
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,780
disappear.

248
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,060
My nurse,

249
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,820
you're so powerful.

250
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:33,880
He...

251
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,800
Your Highness,

252
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,580
she is so kind.

253
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,860
She cried over just a butterfly.

254
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,620
Huo Xiangjiu,

255
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,180
why are you crying?

256
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,700
It wasn't an ordinary butterfly.

257
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,340
My nurse killed a butterfly,

258
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,200
not your husband.

259
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,940
It wasn't an ordinary butterfly.

260
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,400
It...

261
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:52,840
It...

262
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,960
It flew away.

263
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,380
It f-flew away...

264
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,020
You just said

265
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,000
it wasn't an ordinary butterfly.

266
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,960
What do you mean?

267
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,319
I...

268
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,119
I...

269
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,280
I once

270
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,140
heard a story like this.

271
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,500
There was a pair of lovers

272
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,430
who loved each other desperately.

273
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,520
But the woman's family

274
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,640
kept blocking them at every turn

275
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,570
and wouldn't let them be together.

276
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,800
In the end...

277
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,360
they were driven to desperation.

278
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,440
They both died for love

279
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,010
and turned into a pair of butterflies,

280
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,480
flying away.

281
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,780
Ever since,

282
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,840
whenever I see butterflies,

283
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,440
I think of this story.

284
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,240
You simpleton,

285
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,000
you actually believe a story like that?

286
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,680
Yes!

287
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,460
I

288
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,780
lack common sense.

289
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,120
People's hearts are treacherous.

290
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,920
In the future,

291
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,880
you should be more careful.

292
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,960
Yes.

293
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,800
Thank you, Madam Chen.

294
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

295
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,180
Your Highness,

296
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,180
let's go.

297
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,280
We should go pay respects to the Old Madam.

298
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
I don't want to go.

299
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,980
Why are you acting like a child again?

300
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,060
Every time I go,

301
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,640
she shuts me out.

302
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,800
Why should I humiliate myself?

303
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,960
The Old Madam isn't so firm anymore.

304
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,560
She should see you this time.

305
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,820
Come on,

306
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,020
let me help Your Highness change.

307
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,520
Third Uncle,

308
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,500
time to eat.

309
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,860
Third Uncle,

310
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,910
there's news about Third Aunt.

311
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,900
What?

312
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,300
Someone saw her

313
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,430
swatting moths at Ningshuang Palace.

314
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,670
Ningshuang Palace?

315
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,540
That wily fox was telling the truth.

316
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,220
Don't go,

317
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,980
Third Uncle!

318
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,460
We're about to go on duty.

319
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,180
You're never around when the Chief is here.

320
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,480
Don't make things difficult for me this time,

321
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,420
please?

322
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,100
Once I find your Third Aunt,

323
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,580
I'll give you all the money.

324
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,820
It's not about money!

325
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,220
You're my real uncle.

326
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,660
How about this?

327
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,580
Eat before you go.

328
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,840
Right.

329
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,300
Xiangjiu can't get anything good to eat at Ningshuang Palace.

330
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,760
I'll go to the Imperial Kitchen to get her some food.

331
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,300
Hey, well,

332
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,700
there's food right here!

333
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,460
Is that woman

334
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,480
more tempting than the food?

335
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,740
I really want to go to Ningshuang Palace to see Xiangjiu.

336
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,740
It's been so long.

337
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,440
I miss her so much.

338
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,620
Alright.

339
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,580
I'll arrange it for you later.

340
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,420
Then you have to hurry!

341
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,900
Chef Xue!

342
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,140
Make me some delicacies.

343
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,520
I need to take them with me.

344
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,400
It's him...

345
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,600
Attendant Bai.

346
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,480
Mutt?

347
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,380
Rare to see you alone.

348
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,080
Trash.

349
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,240
You? As if!

350
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,520
You demon,

351
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,600
how arrogant.

352
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,400
Attendant Bai.

353
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,560
How dare you dine in the Imperial Kitchen?

354
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,890
Do you have a death wish?

355
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm going to teach you a lesson now

356
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,280
on behalf of Chief Steward Sun!

357
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,120
Bai Yu, Bai Yu!

358
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,560
Mr. Bai, Mr. Bai.

359
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,620
This way, this way.

360
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,300
Mr. Bai. Mr. Bai?

361
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,780
Can we settle our grudges

362
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,580
without involving anyone else?

363
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,600
I'm the 30th-generation descendant of the Bai Clan of Bronze County.

364
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,000
Eliminating demons and upholding righteousness is my duty.

365
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,280
You side with evil

366
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,810
and assist in wicked deeds.

367
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,420
I'll take you down right now.

368
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:32,900
Bai Yu,

369
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,900
do you know

370
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,840
who she is?

371
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,970
Who cares who she is?

372
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,920
She's Huo Xiangjiu's close friend.

373
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,360
Is it good?

374
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,800
Mm.

375
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,080
Not good.

376
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,290
Don't be afraid.

377
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,760
Mao Jin.

378
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
How can you let her eat

379
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,480
in such a smoky, dirty place?

380
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,810
If you want to eat...

381
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,800
let's find a proper place.

382
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,980
No one comes here.

383
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,480
From now on, when it's mealtime,

384
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,180
Miss Le Ning,

385
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,920
you can bring your food here to eat.

386
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,860
The Imperial Kitchen is full of smoke and fire.

387
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,000
If your lotus-like face becomes darkened by the smoke,

388
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,330
Xiangjiu will blame me.

389
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,240
Come on.

390
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,760
Eat more.

391
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,040
This is "Spread Your Wings."

392
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,440
"Smooth Sailing."

393
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,290
"Heart-Stirring."

394
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,840
And "Swift Running."

395
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,720
Alright, that's enough!

396
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,360
Mr. Bai,

397
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,900
don't you have other matters to attend to?

398
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,030
You should go ahead.

399
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,120
My business was to bring some food for Xiangjiu.

400
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,460
But Miss Le Ning is Xiangjiu's good friend.

401
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,640
Taking good care of Miss Le Ning

402
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,520
will definitely make Xiangjiu very happy

403
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,580
when she finds out.

404
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,720
Attendant Bai,

405
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
are you going to bring food to Xiangjiu?

406
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,360
Yes.

407
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,900
I miss her so much.

408
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,100
Attendant Bai, I wonder

409
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
if you could take me to see Xiangjiu.

410
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,100
Let me go scout things out first.

411
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,040
If it won't cause trouble,

412
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,860
I'll take you with me.

413
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,420
Mm.

414
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,380
I'll go to the Imperial Kitchen first

415
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,310
to prepare some food for Xiangjiu.

416
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,220
Mao Jin,

417
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,380
take good care of Miss Le Ning for me.

418
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,300
If there's any negligence,

419
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,430
I'll have your head.

420
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,080
He's so considerate.

421
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,720
Can't see me.

422
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:20,780
Can't see me...

423
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,160
Where are Xiangjiu and Princess Ningshuang going?

424
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,080
Gongsun Hao.

425
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,080
This is the palace, not your home.

426
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Don't think that just because your father

427
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,680
has great power in court, you're something special.

428
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,960
I am the Crown Prince's brother-in-law,

429
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,300
the Princess Consort's own brother,

430
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,090
and the future Imperial Uncle.

431
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,120
As the old saying goes, a brother-in-law is like half a son.

432
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,840
No.

433
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,460
It's "a son-in-law is like half a son."

434
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,000
No.

435
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,640
It's "the Crown Prince is like half my son."

436
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,920
The Crown Prince is like half my brother!

437
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,650
I don't care who your father is.

438
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,320
In this domain,

439
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,810
even bird droppings that fall from the sky

440
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,650
must answer to the Song family.

441
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,170
Did you hear what I said?

442
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,840
Why are you in such a hurry?

443
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,780
Are you rushing to your next life?

444
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,240
Why are you in such a hurry?

445
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,780
Yes, sir.

446
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,640
Did you understand

447
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,000
what I just told you?

448
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,380
I heard it.

449
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,060
When your superior speaks to you, you respond with "understood."

450
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,680
Come on,

451
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,780
say it.

452
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,340
Understood.

453
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,600
-Greetings, Your Highness,
-Greetings, Your Highness,

454
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,420
-Madam Chen.
-Madam Chen.

455
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,760
Go quickly and announce our arrival,

456
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,600
and say that Princess Ningshuang and Madam Chen

457
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,200
are here to pay respects to the Old Madam.

458
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,440
The Old Madam has ordered

459
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,900
that she will only see you today, Madam Chen.

460
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,520
I knew it would be like this.

461
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,480
I shouldn't have come.

462
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,540
Please wait, Your Highness.

463
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,500
Give me a moment.

464
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,380
Let me speak to the Old Madam.

465
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,600
Don't trouble yourself anymore.

466
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,200
If she truly wanted to see me,

467
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,180
why would she give such an order?

468
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,340
Since we're already here,

469
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,100
what's the rush to leave?

470
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,180
Let me persuade the Old Madam

471
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,020
to see you.

472
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,150
If it still doesn't work, we'll leave.

473
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,320
Your Highness,

474
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
please listen to me.

475
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,170
If you keep being this willful,

476
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,880
I really will get angry.

477
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,960
Fine, fine.

478
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,640
Don't be angry.

479
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,240
I'll wait here.

480
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,560
But let me be clear—

481
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,800
I'll only wait for half an hour.

482
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,080
Alright,

483
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,680
it's settled then.

484
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,120
Half an hour it is.

485
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,240
Don't leave.

486
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,800
Wait for my good news.

487
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,000
That is the girl who defied Brother Fuying.

488
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,440
She's right here.

489
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,440
After searching high and... and...

490
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,720
Seize her!

491
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,360
Go!

492
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,840
I am Princess Ningshuang.

493
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,570
What do you think you're doing?

494
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,440
Oh,

495
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,860
Princess Ningshuang.

496
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,040
I am the Crown Prince's brother-in-law,

497
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,100
the Princess Consort's own brother,

498
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,720
and the future

499
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,890
Imperial Uncle,

500
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,740
and the Captain of the Eastern Palace Guard.

501
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,820
This woman

502
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,660
has offended my Brother Fuying.

503
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,540
She is a wanted criminal of the court.

504
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,140
I'm taking her into custody!

505
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,720
People from my Ningshuang Palace

506
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,920
are not yours to mess with—

507
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,120
not even for the Crown Prince.

508
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,600
Put away your swords!

509
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,640
All of you!

510
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,860
I'm just carrying out orders for Brother Fuying.

511
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,620
Besides,

512
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,260
I'm the Crown Prince's brother-in-law,

513
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,860
and you're his sister.

514
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,220
We're relatives, after all.

515
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,260
This is called...

516
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,160
we've turned off our own.

517
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,220
I mean...

518
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,860
we've turned over our own!

519
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,020
We're family,

520
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,420
Your Highness,

521
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,180
aren't we?

522
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,940
We won't even be in the same ancestral hall after death.

523
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,600
What kind of relatives are we?

524
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,660
Your Highness really has a sense of humor.

525
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,240
I can also crack skulls open.

526
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,280
Want to try?

527
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,380
No, no! Don't!

528
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,300
Weapons are dangerous!

529
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,620
Take it easy, Your Highness.

530
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,820
Get out of here.

531
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,600
Tell the Crown Prince:

532
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,740
Huo Xiangjiu works for me,

533
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,260
and don't you dare lay a finger on my people.

534
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,960
If you provoke me,

535
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,000
I'll take every single person from your Eastern Palace

536
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,040
and slaughter them one by one.

537
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,680
Your Highness, by doing this,

538
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,610
you're opposing the Crown Prince.

539
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,760
Then go back and ask him

540
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,870
whether he dares to be my enemy.

541
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,440
Alright,

542
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,740
I'll go back and relay your message.

543
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,640
I take my leave.

544
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,340
Let's go!

545
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,880
Stop!

546
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,380
Your Highness,

547
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,780
what else may I do for you?

548
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,720
Get lost.

549
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,460
Attendant Bai!

550
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,860
Greetings, Your Highness.

551
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,780
Get over here.

552
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,970
Yes, Your Highness.

553
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,540
Attendant Bai,

554
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,940
how have you been lately?

555
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,460
Thanks to Your Highness's grace,

556
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,300
very well.

557
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,660
You're doing well,

558
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,980
but I'm not.

559
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,520
Then...

560
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,280
Shall we summon the imperial physician?

561
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,240
You're sick.

562
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,600
Yes,

563
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,840
this servant is sick.

564
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,530
Why are you carrying a food box?

565
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,900
Chief Steward Sun ordered me to bring it to His Majesty.

566
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,040
Open it.

567
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,640
What?

568
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,840
My father can eat it,

569
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,160
but I can't?

570
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,520
Your Highness can.

571
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,120
Of course.

572
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,360
Can't I eat it?

573
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,640
No, no.

574
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,700
What...

575
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,740
What I mean is

576
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,180
if Your Highness eats too much,

577
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,740
it might upset your digestion.

578
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,500
You're just afraid that if I eat them,

579
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,960
you won't be able to report back, aren't you?

580
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,220
I'll make things difficult for you.

581
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,020
Ms. Xiang,

582
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,820
share the food with everyone.

583
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,320
Come, Xiangjiu.

584
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,860
Eat.

585
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,220
Come on,

586
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,120
everyone, have some.

587
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,760
Come on.

588
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,810
Why are you smiling?

589
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,700
No.

590
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,320
I just...

591
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,080
Seeing Your Highness makes me happy.

592
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,940
Whenever I see Your Highness, I'm happy!

593
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,140
I'm extremely happy.

594
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,900
So I...

595
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,560
Are you flirting with me?

596
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,980
How shameless!

597
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,690
Thank you for saving me today, Your Highness.

598
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,720
I didn't do it to save you.

599
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,160
It's just

600
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,320
that you're from my Ningshuang Palace.

601
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,580
If the Eastern Palace people harmed you,

602
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,380
wouldn't I lose face?

603
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
Regardless,

604
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,280
I still must thank Your Highness for saving my life.

605
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,320
Why does

606
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,960
the Crown Prince want to kill you?

607
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,500
You work for Feng Mochen.

608
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,200
You schemed your way into my palace—

609
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,320
what are you after?

610
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,310
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

611
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,500
They say that

612
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,520
when the Old Madam was giving birth to Princess Ningshuang,

613
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,920
she almost died.

614
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,600
So she came to resent the Princess,

615
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,400
and as a result,

616
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,520
she sent her to be raised by her lady-in-waiting,

617
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,720
Madam Chen.

618
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,160
When the Princess grew up,

619
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,060
she often went to Kunning Palace to pay her respects.

620
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,020
But the Old Madam

621
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,400
refused to see her even once.

622
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,360
As time went by,

623
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,020
she naturally grew close to Madam Chen and resented the Old Madam.

624
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,460
Your Highness,

625
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,340
would you like to reconcile with the Old Madam?

626
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,000
What's that to you?

627
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,980
I...

628
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,340
lost my mother at a young age,

629
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,420
so I understand the pain of being separated from one's mother.

630
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,260
Therefore,

631
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,420
I wish to help Your Highness reconcile

632
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,620
with the Old Madam.

633
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,960
Such grand words,

634
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Huo Xiangjiu.

635
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,219
Since you came to work in my palace,

636
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,380
not a single word from your mouth has been true.

637
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,980
I despise those who deceive me.

638
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,739
Anyone who dares deceive me

639
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,820
deserves no mercy!

640
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,120
You know... martial arts?

641
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,020
As expected of someone

642
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,320
sent by Feng Mochen.

643
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,060
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

644
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,760
This servant

645
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,360
truly only wanted

646
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,160
to help Your Highness and the Old Madam

647
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,460
reconcile

648
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,300
and restore family bonds.

649
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,220
A person who's ignored her child for over 20 years—

650
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,630
why would I want to reconcile with her?

651
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,180
No matter your intentions,

652
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,140
if your mind isn't on your duties,

653
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,740
they're ill intentions.

654
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,920
Put away those schemes of yours

655
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,940
and get out of my palace.

656
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,920
From now on,

657
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,180
you are forbidden to set foot here again.

658
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,860
Otherwise,

659
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,280
even Feng Mochen won't be able to save you.
