1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,640
I don't know the content

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,040
of those two pages at all.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,800
What?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,660
Back then, I...

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,800
Back then, I just wanted
to reconcile with Mother sooner.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,730
That's why I hastily promised you.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,820
Do you know how important this is to me?

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,480
How could you
treat such a thing as a joke,

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,240
Ningshuang?

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,880
I'm sorry, Mentor!

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,000
Calm down.

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,360
If this matter is related
to my Ningshuang Palace,

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,290
I will investigate it thoroughly.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,080
But Mentor,

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,200
why did you think

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,690
that it was me
who tore out those two pages?

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,920
I don't...

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,540
smell anything.

19
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,380
Your Highness,

20
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,280
His Grace's sense of smell
is extremely keen.

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,840
At first, I didn't believe it either.

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
Later, when I saw them
locate Sorcerer Yu by scent,

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,940
I came to believe

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,470
they truly are impressive.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,880
Of course.

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,040
Any scent

27
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,100
can't escape our noses.

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,440
To him, that is

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,620
as easy as winking.

30
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,380
Greetings, Your Grace,

31
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,180
Mentor.

32
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:10,500
Your Highness,

33
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,920
Old Madam said she misses you.

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,780
She requested your presence
at the Kunning Palace.

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,160
Alright. I got it.

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,920
I'll come back later.

37
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,000
Be careful, Your Highness.

38
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,640
Wait.

39
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,880
The scent on you

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,300
is similar to the scent
on the Ganquan Register.

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,000
Have you been here before?

42
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,890
This is His Grace's residence.

43
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,039
How could someone like me come here?

44
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,100
This kind of scent—

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,040
I've never smelt it on other servants

46
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,140
of the Ningshuang Palace.

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,720
I understand now.

48
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,440
This is datura.

49
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,360
This is the scent.

50
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,940
That's not right.

51
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,160
I heard datura is toxic,

52
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,640
so its cultivation
is forbidden in the palace.

53
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,560
There is indeed such a rule in the palace.

54
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,480
However,

55
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,500
I found the datura too beautiful,

56
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,980
so I requested Father

57
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,580
to allow me to cultivate 5 plants
in the palace.

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,880
Usually, Ms. Xiang tends to them.

59
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,300
Only Ms. Xiang and Princess Ningshuang
have access to these flowers.

60
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,430
So only the two of you carry this scent.

61
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,320
Wait.

62
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,740
Five plants?

63
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,240
But aren't there only four here?

64
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,500
One is missing.

65
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,300
Missing?

66
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
When did it go missing?

67
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,640
About 2 years ago.

68
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,480
Two years?

69
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,560
That's around the time
my father disappeared.

70
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,880
After it went missing,
I sent people to investigate,

71
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,940
but we couldn't find out who stole it.

72
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,760
Old Fox, can you smell who stole it?

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,360
In the matter of Sorcerer Yu before,

74
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,580
even after so long,
you could still track it, right?

75
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,380
Although it's only been 2 years,

76
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
there are too many flowers here.

77
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,380
The thief's scent has long been masked.

78
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,900
Moreover, the mysterious person
in the palace before

79
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,030
seems to have always been
hindering our investigation.

80
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,280
If we could find the flower thief,

81
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,340
we should be able to find my father
and that mysterious person.

82
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,340
But now...

83
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,260
all leads have gone cold.

84
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,580
If the thief

85
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,700
is still cultivating datura in the palace,

86
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,460
we only need to find the person
who carries this scent

87
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,060
other than Princess Ningshuang
and Ms. Xiang.

88
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,760
Okay.

89
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,020
Mentor,

90
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,060
stay for a meal today.

91
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,860
You've done me a great favor.

92
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,460
I haven't had the chance
to thank you properly.

93
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,140
People need food to survive.

94
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,800
Skip a meal and you'll feel it.

95
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:59,420
If you collapse from hunger,
how will you find your father?

96
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,220
But now I don't have the mood to eat.

97
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,460
Eat first.

98
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,080
Leave the rest to us.

99
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,160
Mm.

100
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,060
Thank you all

101
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,190
for helping me reconcile with Mother.

102
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,100
Today,

103
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,420
regardless of status,

104
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,280
let us simply drink freely.

105
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,600
Mm.

106
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,660
Your Highness,
you usually look quite fierce.

107
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,060
I never expected
you're also kind and gentle.

108
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,980
I'm fierce?

109
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
Did I say something wrong?

110
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Everyone,

111
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,220
pardon the intrusion.

112
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,800
Princess Consort, what brings you here?

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,100
Truly a rare guest.

114
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,060
Prince Fuying heard of
Ningshuang's reconciliation with Mother,

115
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,720
so he specially sent me here
to pay a visit.

116
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,060
These fabrics were previously bestowed
upon Prince Fuying by Father.

117
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,780
He asked me to bring them
to Princess Ningshuang and Miss Xiangjiu.

118
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,580
No need. Take them all back.

119
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,260
I lack nothing here.

120
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,100
Okay.

121
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,060
Then I'm going back.

122
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,460
Have you...

123
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,680
eaten yet?

124
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,690
Why are you asking her that?

125
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,440
She kindly brought us gifts.

126
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,280
It's hard to stay mad
at someone who's smiling.

127
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,860
But...

128
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,960
she's Prince Fuying's woman.

129
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
A woman is a woman.

130
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,920
Why care about whose woman she is?

131
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,760
Then...

132
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,000
whose man are you?

133
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,960
What does Prince Fuying's wrong
have to do with her?

134
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,890
Why should we vent our anger on her?

135
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,040
That's right.

136
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,420
Princess Ningshuang,

137
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,360
when you hurt Old Madam before,

138
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,280
the Princess Consort
spoke up for you many times

139
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,720
in front of His Majesty.

140
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,260
I heard

141
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,659
the Princess Consort once saved Xiangjiu.

142
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,790
That makes her Xiangjiu's friend.

143
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,760
If you don't mind,

144
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,440
stay and eat with us.

145
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,760
Why are you still standing there?

146
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,080
You're not a pillar.

147
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,320
Come and sit down.

148
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,920
Everyone's waiting for you.

149
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,640
Please go back and report

150
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,500
that the Princess Consort
is here drinking with us.

151
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,660
Your Highness,

152
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,660
can you drink?

153
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,820
A drink or two is fine.

154
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,060
Drinking is for
cultivating leisurely moods.

155
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,140
Follow the moment's inspiration.

156
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,470
No need to overindulge.

157
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,400
Well, I'll be damned.

158
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,440
I've never seen His Grace

159
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,440
being so considerate to another woman

160
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,140
aside from Mentor before.

161
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,740
D-Don't just drink.

162
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,860
Why don't we... play...

163
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,980
a drinking game?

164
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,420
Y-Yes, yes.

165
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,940
I know a fun drinking game.

166
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,640
We split into 2 teams.

167
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,860
Each team selects one person
to perform an action.

168
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,320
If someone from the opposing team
can replicate it, they win.

169
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,220
The team that sets the challenge
drinks 3 cups as penalty.

170
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,040
If they can't replicate it, they lose.

171
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,120
The losing team

172
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,060
drinks 3 cups as penalty.

173
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,520
What do you think?

174
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,160
Good.

175
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,700
How about the four of us girls
being in one team?

176
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,180
I don't want to be on a team with Bai Yu.

177
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,240
I... I don't want
to be on a team with Bai Yu either.

178
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,770
I don't want to be on a team
with you two either.

179
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Are you playing a game or playing me?

180
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,320
Great!

181
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
We are a team.

182
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,190
I'm on a team with Xiangjiu.

183
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
I'll go first.

184
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,140
One bite.

185
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,160
Impressive.

186
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,240
Your turn.

187
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,140
You go.

188
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,300
You go.

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,900
You go.

190
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
Your mouth is bigger.

191
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,400
You can't replicate it?

192
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,560
Then drink.

193
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,010
Alright, drink.

194
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,520
Wait.

195
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,120
Not these 3 cups.

196
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,500
Someone!

197
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,490
Bring them here!

198
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,760
These aren't wine cups.

199
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,560
They're practically wine jars!

200
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,700
What?

201
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,560
Are you scared?

202
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,280
Master.

203
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,760
Lord Howling Celestial Dog

204
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,480
might be watching from above.

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,120
Is he crazy?

206
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,440
He's simply a mad dog.

207
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,240
How can I lose to a mad dog?

208
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,880
I...

209
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,740
I'll drink for you.

210
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,160
No need. There are 3 cups.

211
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,240
I'll do it myself.

212
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,580
Your Highness.

213
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,880
I'll also drink a cup for you.

214
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,520
Mm.

215
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,020
What are you two doing?

216
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,760
We're all friends here.

217
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,800
This is called... "united we stand."

218
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,920
"Nothing can stand in our way."

219
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,340
Mm.

220
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,760
Then how can I be left out?

221
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,270
Give me a cup too.

222
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,140
Mao Jin.

223
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,860
I'll drink a cup for you too.

224
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,330
This is outrageous!

225
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,120
I want revenge!

226
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,260
We...

227
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,100
will take revenge...

228
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,840
on you!

229
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,940
Mao Jin, sit down.

230
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,180
Don't embarrass yourself.

231
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,420
How dare you! You wily fox.

232
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,960
How dare you speak like that
to the divine dog

233
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,760
who guards the South Heavenly Gate
with Lord Howling Celestial Dog!

234
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,160
If I don't drink you
under the table today,

235
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,540
you'll never know

236
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,160
who the master is!

237
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,480
Are you crazy?

238
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,700
What... is he talking about?

239
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,380
He's drunk.

240
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,420
Just ignore him.

241
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,420
Huo Xiangjiu.

242
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,260
You...

243
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,580
You...

244
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,720
You dare ignore me?

245
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,560
Ever since you appeared,

246
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,320
Master has favored only you.

247
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,420
I've fallen out of favor.

248
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,180
He doesn't favor me anymore!

249
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,640
Mao Jin,

250
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,160
you are too insolent!

251
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,920
Shut up!

252
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,500
Don't speak of my good brother like that.

253
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,900
The two of us...

254
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,380
-The two of us...
-The two of us...

255
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,980
-are kindred spirits.
-are kindred spirits.

256
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't worry,

257
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,340
Your Highness.

258
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,180
This time,

259
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,780
we

260
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,620
absolutely

261
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,020
will not lose!

262
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,080
Mao Jin.

263
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,360
Go!

264
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,300
Tell me,

265
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,560
who dares to replicate that?

266
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,660
Such an awkward move—

267
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,780
how did he even do that?

268
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,480
Instinct.

269
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,380
Stop dawdling.

270
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,440
If you can't replicate it,

271
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,240
just drink!

272
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,680
You do it.

273
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,460
Your Highness,

274
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,500
may I know your name?

275
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,080
Song Lian.

276
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,000
Lian.

277
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,320
You must be like the lotus flower

278
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,560
and love yourself well.

279
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,980
If we don't even love ourselves,

280
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,340
who will love us?

281
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,619
Your Grace,

282
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,500
it's your turn.

283
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,260
Move aside.

284
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,420
Are you going to be like this forever?

285
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,880
It's impossible for us to be together.

286
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,080
Why is it impossible?

287
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,680
We can leave together.

288
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,210
We won't implicate anyone.

289
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,280
We can't go back to the past.

290
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,180
I've been defiled.

291
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,200
It doesn't matter, Lian.

292
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,440
Back then,

293
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,080
I didn't have the courage
to stop you from marrying him.

294
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,220
If I had been braver...

295
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,700
Do you know why I married Prince Fuying?

296
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,060
He raped me.

297
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,920
I won't let you help me up.

298
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,880
I'm...

299
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,800
perfectly sober now.

300
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,520
Who...

301
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,520
put 2 stalks of sugarcane here?

302
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,090
Probably left here
by the Ministry of Works for repairs.

303
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
Let me taste it and see if it's sweet.

304
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,380
This isn't sugarcane.

305
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,750
How do I eat
such a long stalk of sugarcane?

306
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,860
Start eating from the top!

307
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,540
Come on! Come up here!

308
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,960
Have we... met somewhere before?

309
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,220
Are you hiding something from me?

310
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,180
Little White Fox,

311
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,040
look what delicious food I brought you.

312
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,280
They're really tasty.

313
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,980
These chicken feet are super delicious.

314
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,780
Qinghua!

315
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:11,900
Father.

316
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
You little beast!

317
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,700
You let it go?

318
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,040
Just you wait, I'll catch you!

319
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
You little beast!

320
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,220
Little White Fox, run!

321
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,980
You little beast!

322
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,700
Father!

323
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,540
You little beast!

324
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,820
Little Qinghua,

325
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,740
get out of my way!

326
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,000
No!

327
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,200
How dare you use the chicken feet
I prepared for Master Li

328
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,540
to feed that little beast!

329
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,860
I'll beat you to death!

330
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,720
Move aside!

331
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,780
Little White Fox!

332
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,720
Run!

333
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,160
Don't let my father catch you!

334
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,780
Little Fox,

335
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,160
come here.

336
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,320
Come and chase me.

337
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,380
Little White Fox.

338
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Little White Fox,

339
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,500
this is what I just made.

340
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,120
Try it.

341
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,140
My father...

342
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,960
has betrothed me to...

343
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,500
Landlord Li's son.

344
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,700
Their home is very far from here.

345
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,580
From now on,

346
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,920
I'm afraid I won't be able to come
play with you anymore.

347
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,500
Don't worry about me.

348
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,140
I heard his son is very kind.

349
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,740
Take good care of yourself.

350
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,340
I will also...

351
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,500
live a very happy life.

352
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,820
Don't follow me.

353
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,540
If they discover you,
they'll beat you to death.

354
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,340
Go back now.

355
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,420
Go back now!

356
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,600
I wonder if it has come back.

357
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,980
Little White Fox,

358
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,020
you...

359
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,560
seem upset.

360
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,160
Did something...

361
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,140
She got married?

362
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,320
Listen to me.

363
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,120
You've just begun your cultivation.

364
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,720
If you two are meant to be,

365
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,620
you might meet again somewhere, someday.

366
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Little White Fox.

367
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,040
Leave.

368
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,830
If my father sees you,
he'll beat you to death.

369
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,120
Leave now!

370
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,040
You...

371
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,600
You really are...

372
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,140
Little White Fox,

373
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,320
if only...

374
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,460
you were human.

375
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,580
That way,

376
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,340
you could take me away.

377
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,640
Qinghua!

378
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,240
Landlord Li's wedding procession
is almost here!

379
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,600
Oh!

380
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,740
Why haven't you changed your clothes yet?

381
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,820
I-I'll...

382
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,420
change my clothes right away.

383
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,480
What are you doing?

384
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,800
Nothing.

385
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
You little beast!

386
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,640
This little beast!

387
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,020
Move aside!

388
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,660
Go!

389
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,220
No!

390
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:39,880
Move aside!

391
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,340
It's been pestering my daughter
for 10 years!

392
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:42,720
Go!

393
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,480
Today, I...

394
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,060
Go!

395
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,200
Move aside!

396
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,630
Or I'll beat you too!

397
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,720
I won't!

398
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:49,900
You...

399
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,320
I...

400
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,800
Move aside!

401
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,520
Move aside!

402
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,440
Go!

403
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,100
Go!

404
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,940
I'll beat you to death!

405
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,280
Move aside!

406
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,680
You little beast!

407
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,360

It seems...

427
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,620
you and Huo Xiangjiu

428
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,100
are getting along quite well.

429
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,780
She's a very good girl.

430
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,260
Since you like her so much,

431
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,070
why not bring her to the Eastern Palace

432
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,900
for our use?

433
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,820
You think you're worthy?

434
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,860
Xiangjiu is my friend.

435
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,220
If you dare hurt her,

436
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,260
I will kill you.

437
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,900
Father has issued a decree.

438
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,100
You dare touch me?

439
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,700
Father, Father!

440
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,120
Do you really think

441
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,700
Father can protect you?

442
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,760
Look at yourself.

443
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,790
You are more cowardly than anyone.

444
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,180
You've never dared to hit me in the face,

445
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,690
because you're worried
Father and Mother would notice.

446
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,780
Father values benevolence and virtue,

447
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,780
so you act benevolent and virtuous.

448
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,160
Father dotes on His Grace,

449
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
so you want to become like His Grace.

450
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,000
You want to be respected.

451
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,040
You want to gain Father's favor.

452
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,340
Shut up.

453
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,880
What?

454
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,120
Did I touch a nerve?

455
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,460
You use a facade of benevolence and virtue
to wrap your cowardly heart.

456
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,790
You use vicious methods
to conceal the weakness within you!

457
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:53,420
Wake up! Wake up!

458
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,380
Don't you dare die.

459
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,080
I... don't permit you to die.

460
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,900
See? You're still afraid.

461
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,960
You're still afraid.

462
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,620
You fear my death.

463
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,700
If I die,

464
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,720
you'll never gain Father's favor again.

465
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,180
I...

466
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,620
will make you watch with your own eyes

467
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,980
how I trample them underfoot.

468
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,460
Lian,

469
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,800
you must be like the lotus flower

470
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,820
and love yourself well.

471
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,340
If we don't even love ourselves,

472
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,860
who will love us?

473
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,180
So it's you.

474
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,840
You've caused me such misery.

475
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,820
We finally meet.

476
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,300
Stay away from her!

477
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,340
Feng Mochen,

478
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,400
you should know

479
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,120
I'm not afraid of you.
