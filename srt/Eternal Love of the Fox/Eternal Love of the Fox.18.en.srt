1
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,440
As expected, he wants blood on your hands.

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,000
Yet you are weak by nature.

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,320
How could you possibly do it?

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,240
Tomorrow,

5
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,260
I'll beg Prince Fuying

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,940
to choose someone else.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,080
Father,

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,080
does Huo Zhongren's disappearance

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,680
have anything to do with you?

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,120
Lian.

11
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,760
Come.

12
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,560
Xiangjiu.

13
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,400
I'm so glad to see

14
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,200
that you're safe.

15
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,840
Mm.

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,079
Sit.

17
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,440
Lian,

18
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,200
does my father's disappearance

19
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,360
have anything to do with Prince Fuying?

20
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,320
I'm not sure,

21
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,920
but I heard Prince Fuying
and Gongsun Wugui mention your father.

22
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,160
Your father's entrance into the palace

23
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,960
seems...

24
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,280
to be related to them.

25
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,730
Your father reported them?

26
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,980
In our Bronze County,

27
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,200
there's a Young Master Gao,

28
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,240
who abducted women

29
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,570
and acted like a tyrant.

30
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,760
My father, as the registrar,

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,160
arrested him a few times,

32
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,340
but the county magistrate
always ordered him to release him.

33
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,220
That's why...

34
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,160
he entered the palace
to file an accusation.

35
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,040
Could it be...

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,480
that Prince Fuying and Gongsun Wugui

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,600
were backing Young Master Gao

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,140
and then took your father?

39
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,760
From their conversation,

40
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,860
they just don't want you

41
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,540
to continue to investigate.

42
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,660
But regarding your father's disappearance,

43
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,590
they seem to know nothing about it.

44
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,420
Mentor's father disappeared in the palace.

45
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,860
Between these two,

46
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,460
if one of them

47
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,079
is related to your father's disappearance,

48
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,280
Prince Fuying is surely more suspicious.

49
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,079
After all,

50
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,600
compared to Gongsun Wugui, an official,

51
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,480
Prince Fuying can act more freely
in the palace.

52
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,020
I should be able to hear
what they're saying from the back door.

53
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,900
What are you doing?

54
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,840
I need to use the toilet.

55
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,280
Nature calls.

56
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,460
Can you please take me to the latrine?

57
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,300
The latrine of our Ningshuang Palace

58
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,760
is too good for your filth.

59
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,360
Go to the Eastern Palace.

60
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,940
The two palaces are so far apart.

61
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,800
How can I possibly make it in time?

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,440
Dear sister,

63
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,520
please help me.

64
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,120
We're both servants.

65
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,450
Why make things difficult for each other?

66
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,680
If I wet myself,

67
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,409
wouldn't that
defile the Ningshuang Palace?

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,820
Come on.

69
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,080
Where is it?

70
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,480
T-T-There?

71
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,140
Stop rushing me.

72
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,680
H-Here?

73
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,480
Is this it?

74
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Be quick.

75
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,600
Don't keep me waiting.

76
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,420
I need to find a way to sneak out quickly.

77
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,580
W-Well...

78
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,670
Why am I back here again?

79
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,340
This is crazy!

80
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,480
Will this never end?

81
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,540
Seriously?

82
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,260
Let her learn a hard lesson.

83
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,340
Master.

84
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,940
Master.

85
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,010
Tomorrow is your tribulation.

86
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,600
After this tribulation,

87
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,460
the cycle will shorten to 15 days.

88
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,520
After that, it will be 7 days.

89
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,560
The daily tribulation is not far away.

90
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,420
Are you still not going to ascend?

91
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,040
Mao Jin,

92
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,560
your first tribulation in 1,000 years

93
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,680
is approaching too, right?

94
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,480
Yes.

95
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,900
It's almost been 1,000 years.

96
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,940
If I'm counting right,

97
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,620
it should be another 10 days or so.

98
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,340
Are you scared?

99
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:35,800
Scared.

100
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,060
Scared...

101
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,020
of what?

102
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,500
Lord Howling Celestial Dog
went through all this back in the day.

103
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,780
Since he could endure it,

104
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,700
of course I won't disgrace him.

105
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,960
If the pain is truly unbearable,

106
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,040
you can tell me.

107
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,560
I can help you dissolve the tribulation.

108
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,090
Dissolve the tribulation?

109
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,280
That means
all my cultivation would dissipate.

110
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,940
Then my 1,000 years of cultivation
would be for nothing.

111
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,060
Then I can only hope

112
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,100
you can find your ferryman soon

113
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,160
to help you ascend.

114
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,320
Don't worry about me.

115
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,160
Let's talk about you.

116
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,860
Your tribulation's cycle
is getting shorter.

117
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,220
Your ferryman is right before you.

118
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,280
Why won't you let her help you ascend?

119
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,700
I have my own plans.

120
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,380
Master,

121
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,280
you've been with her for a few lifetimes.

122
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,500
Isn't that enough?

123
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
I've been with you for nearly 1,000 years.

124
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,680
Is that enough for you?

125
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,940
It's more than enough.

126
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,980
Of course... it's not enough.

127
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,360
You're my master.

128
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,200
Even if I stay with you
for a few thousand more years,

129
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,600
it would never be enough.

130
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,090
Then between me and Le Ning,

131
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,480
who would you choose?

132
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,340
How...

133
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,540
H-How am I supposed to make that choice?

134
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,110
Choose with your heart.

135
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,440
Then between me and Huo Xiangjiu,
who would you choose?

136
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,880
Huo Xiangjiu.

137
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,160
You didn't even hesitate?

138
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,980
Is it difficult?

139
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,380
It's nothing difficult.

140
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,300
You've hurt my feelings.

141
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,660
Alright, alright.

142
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
Tomorrow during the tribulation,

143
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,800
you must always stay by Xiangjiu's side

144
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,460
to prevent anything from happening to her.

145
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:04,980
Mm.

146
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,720
Don't worry, Master.

147
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,980
I'll take good care of your precious one.

148
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Good.

149
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,100
What kind of place is this?

150
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,800
I don't believe I can't...

151
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,570
climb out of here today!

152
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,860
I sent Gao Wei to investigate

153
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,500
the days
when Huo Zhongren infiltrated the palace.

154
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,680
During that period, a breach occurred
in the river embankment south of the state.

155
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,410
Father decided
to handle it with utmost urgency.

156
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,920
He summoned your father
to the Ganquan Palace

157
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,250
to discuss it all night.

158
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,580
If Huo Zhongren
wanted to file an accusation,

159
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,740
he would definitely run into your father.

160
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,900
But even so,

161
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,250
we can't conclude my father did it.

162
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,180
The person Huo Zhongren wanted to report

163
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,920
was precisely someone who worked for me.

164
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,780
And your father was also involved.

165
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,880
He climbed to his current position

166
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,690
from the descendant of a lowly person.

167
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,480
You should know

168
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,280
your father is capable of anything

169
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,280
to keep his wealth and status.

170
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,340
We need to find a way

171
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,100
to test Prince Fuying.

172
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,900
Let me handle this matter.

173
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,940
No.

174
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,680
You're in danger right now.

175
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,120
Since Prince Fuying has confined you,

176
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,200
it means he's begun to suspect you.

177
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,800
How would he possibly take the bait then?

178
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,160
So the priority now

179
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,240
is for you to extricate yourself quickly

180
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,900
and leave the Eastern Palace.

181
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,140
Don't worry.

182
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,660
I'm on your side.

183
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,540
Only beasts

184
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,580
would shield a man who abuses women.

185
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,320
But why did you marry him back then?

186
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,820
Your Highness,

187
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,680
why do you have so many questions?

188
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,120
What's wrong with asking?

189
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,450
We're all friends here.

190
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,880
Among good friends,

191
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,410
there should be no secrets.

192
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,500
Your Highness.

193
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,180
Never mind.

194
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,840
To be honest, Princess Ningshuang,

195
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,600
back then, I saved His Majesty
when he fell into the river by the cliff.

196
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,520
I've always been grateful to His Majesty.

197
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,120
It was because of His Majesty

198
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,000
that I met my beloved.

199
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,980
Gongsun...

200
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,500
Your Highness?

201
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,760
Your Highness!

202
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,220
Father!

203
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,660
Yicheng!

204
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,020
Father!

205
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,920
Daughter!

206
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,320
Daughter!

207
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,680
Father!

208
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,380
Your Highness!

209
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:41,760
Father,

210
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,080
save me!

211
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,880
Get lost!

212
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,360
Father,

213
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,940
help me!

214
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,500
Father.

215
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,640
Gold beans.

216
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,560
The price of gold has soared recently.

217
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,820
We're going to be rich!

218
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,480
Let go!

219
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,140
Father!

220
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,360
Father!

221
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,540
Father!

222
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,200
Bastards!

223
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,580
Prince Fuying and this father-son duo

224
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,620
are all jerks!

225
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,390
What happened next?

226
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,300
I was trapped at home
by my father and younger brother.

227
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,040
One kept watch over me day and night,

228
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,940
while the other went to negotiate terms
with Prince Fuying.

229
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,940
Prince Fuying was worried
that the matter of him raping me

230
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,340
would reach His Majesty's ears,

231
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,060
so he agreed to marry me.

232
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,220
At that time,

233
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,660
I discovered I was pregnant.

234
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,340
What?

235
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,560
What about the one you loved then?

236
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,380
We rarely meet in life.

237
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,340
We're as distant as the stars in the sky.

238
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,160
He...

239
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,780
is Gongsun Hao?

240
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,780
Gongsun Hao?

241
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,820
How did you know?

242
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,820
He came to me.

243
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,940
Why did he go to you?

244
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,860
He doesn't want you
to fight against Prince Fuying.

245
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,190
He's worried Prince Fuying will harm you.

246
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,400
He wants me to help you.

247
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,260
Gongsun Hao

248
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,820
is quite affectionate.

249
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,740
But given your current situation,

250
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,070
are you willing to live like this forever?

251
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,780
I was before.

252
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,560
But not anymore.

253
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,640
Why?

254
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,200
I'm pregnant.

255
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,120
I don't want my child

256
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
to be born into such an environment.

257
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,120
And I don't want him
to have a father like that.

258
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,460
I want to escape,

259
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,210
not just for myself,

260
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,780
but also for my child.

261
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,780
After I help Xiangjiu find the clues,

262
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,800
I'll leave.

263
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,600
No.

264
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,100
If you lose your life because of this—

265
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,280
looking for one person
only to harm another—

266
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,230
how could I be at peace in this life?

267
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,040
That's right.

268
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,080
About Mentor's father,

269
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,410
I'll also think of a way.

270
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,400
Now we need to find a way to help you

271
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,200
escape from the palace quickly.

272
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,150
You've done nothing wrong.

273
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,100
A person without fault

274
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,380
shouldn't live a life in hiding.

275
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,600
Since you're leaving,

276
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,220
leave openly and honorably.

277
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,060
Divorce him.

278
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,580
I support you.

279
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,040
But my maid, Yuan Xiang,

280
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,600
was placed by my side
by Prince Fuying to watch me.

281
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,880
She knows my every move.

282
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,100
I'll handle it.

283
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,280
You can't be serious!

284
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,440
You're having a lot of fun!

285
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,859
Doesn't the Eastern Palace

286
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,180
have a latrine?

287
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,420
Yes!

288
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,420
Here. Here.

289
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,819
Thank you.

290
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
Song Yicheng has been brought back.

291
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,780
Strip him of his position.

292
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,140
Send him away to find a job outside.

293
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,920
If he continues to stay in the palace,

294
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,600
he might cause more trouble.

295
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,040
By then,

296
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,210
you will surely be implicated.

297
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,310
Song Yicheng is your younger brother.

298
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,940
Can you bear to do that?

299
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,720
I can't ease your burdens,

300
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,080
but at least

301
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,640
I shouldn't be your burden.

302
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,930
It's good that you think

303
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,880
this way.

304
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,490
Where is Yuan Xiang?

305
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,480
Didn't she go with you?

306
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,000
When I arrived at the Ningshuang Palace,

307
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,720
to humiliate me, Princess Ningshuang

308
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,180
treated me like a servant.

309
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,740
When I waited for her anger to subside
and came out,

310
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,070
she was no longer there.

311
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,360
I thought

312
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,000
she came back early.

313
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,980
Aren't you...

314
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,100
the Princess Consort's maid?

315
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,820
What happened to you?

316
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,760
It's you.

317
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,630
Greetings, Mentor.

318
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,280
Please rise.

319
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,060
Mentor, why are you crying?

320
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,160
Forget it.

321
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,880
Well...

322
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,980
how has the Princess Consort been lately?

323
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,820
I haven't seen her for a long time.

324
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,280
She's been doing very well.

325
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Don't worry about her, Mentor.

326
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,520
Plain.

327
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,280
Too plain.

328
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,280
What's plain?

329
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,760
The Eastern Palace...

330
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,340
treats people rather poorly.

331
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,580
Come.

332
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,180
Look.

333
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,160
I heard...

334
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,960
this is a rare luminous pearl,

335
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
a tribute from another state.

336
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,240
A luminous pearl?

337
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,780
Mm.

338
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,600
It really glows!

339
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,400
Of course!

340
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,040
It glows at night.

341
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,240
You don't even need
to light candles at night.

342
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,570
His Grace gave you this?

343
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,420
As you know,

344
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
His Majesty

345
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,340
dotes on His Grace

346
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,900
more than on Prince Fuying.

347
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,580
These things are nothing at all.

348
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,300
His Grace often rewards me.

349
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,540
He always rewards me.

350
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,580
I have so much jewelry
that I need a box to store them.

351
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,040
You like it?

352
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,560
No.

353
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,280
I don't like it.

354
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,960
This is nothing.

355
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,200
It's quite ordinary.

356
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,240
If you like it, take it.

357
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,500
You're giving it to me?

358
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
This isn't proper.

359
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,120
But it's your kind gesture, Mentor.

360
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,480
If I refuse,

361
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,520
I would seem too ungrateful.

362
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,800
Thank you, Mentor.

363
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:58,920
Come.

364
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,480
Beautiful.

365
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Truly beautiful.

366
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,440
Then I'm going back.

367
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,920
Goodbye, Mentor.

368
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,760
What are you doing here?

369
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,020
I came to take you home.

370
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,300
You're helping the Princess Consort again?

371
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,680
It's not that I want to help people.

372
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,720
It's that the immortals
don't care about the mortal world.

373
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,780
They receive offerings from mortals,

374
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,430
yet they turn a blind eye...

375
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,140
to mortals' suffering!

376
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,520
Don't litter.

377
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,340
Yet so many people
insist on becoming immortals.

378
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,540
Just like you.

379
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,000
Tell me,

380
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,130
why do you cultivate immortality?

381
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,180
What's 1,000 years of cultivation for?

382
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,880
I ask for nothing...

383
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,160
but my daily bread.

384
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,620
I didn't expect

385
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,220
that you're quite selfish.

386
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,700
The radical
of the character Xian (immortals)

387
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,660
is Ren (human).

388
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,400
Humans naturally put themselves first.

389
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,760
Then what about the suffering
in the mortal world?

390
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,290
You just stand by and watch?

391
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,820
If the mortal world had no suffering,

392
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,300
it wouldn't be the mortal world anymore.

393
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,620
It's better to decide your own fate

394
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,950
than turning to immortals or divination.

395
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,430
No wonder immortals are indifferent.

396
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,080
So those who cultivate immortality

397
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,260
are all indifferent people like you!

398
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,040
Everyone

399
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,720
has their own destiny.

400
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,980
You...

401
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,000
Watching others suffer,
unable to extricate themselves,

402
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,530
you stand by and do nothing.

403
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,200
And you call that destiny?

404
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,280
Then...

405
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,520
Then it's like...

406
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,640
I'm your ferryman,

407
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,880
but I refuse to help you ascend,

408
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,680
and I tell you

409
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,240
this is your destiny.

410
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
If it were you,

411
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,380
could you accept that?

412
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,680
Indifference is indifference.

413
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,570
Don't use destiny as an excuse.

414
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,040
Oh, right,

415
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,300
you need to help me with something later.

416
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,490
I can't help you.

417
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,680
I'm indifferent.

418
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,800
You're

419
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,730
not just indifferent!
You also hold grudges easily!

420
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,160
Hurry up.

421
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,500
Your Highness.

422
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,920
Your Highness.

423
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,500
Where did you go?

424
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,440
I was delayed in the latrine
for some time.

425
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,640
Did you fall into the latrine?

426
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,920
When you went out today,

427
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,040
it seems you weren't wearing this hairpin.

428
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,380
On the way back,

429
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,540
I ran into Mentor.

430
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,620
She sent her regards to you,
Your Highness.

431
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,480
And she just gave me this hairpin.

432
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,740
Huo Xiangjiu is quite generous.

433
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,640
Your Highness,

434
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,580
I'll take my leave.

435
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,040
Today, at the Ningshuang Palace,

436
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,440
was there anything unusual?

437
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,600
Nothing unusual.

438
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,820
You saw Huo Xiangjiu?

439
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,800
What was her mood like?

440
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,600
A bit sad.

441
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,900
She's probably
still grieving her father's death.

442
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,360
Do you like this hairpin?

443
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,320
Mm.

444
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,860
Haven't I given you anything?

445
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,680
Why did you accept something
from the Fucang Palace?

446
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,720
I know my mistake!

447
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,160
Your Highness, please don't be angry!

448
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,760
This hairpin can't compare
to what you gave me!

449
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,940
What are you doing?

450
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,400
Something so precious—

451
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,200
it's only natural that you like it.

452
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,220
Throwing it like this

453
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,620
is truly a waste.

454
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,390
Since you like it...

455
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,500
eat it.

456
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,500
I was wrong!

457
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,900
I won't dare do it again!

458
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,980
I won't dare do it again!

459
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,820
Do you want me to feed you?

460
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,160
Eat it.

461
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,340
Eat.

462
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,900
What happened to your mouth?

463
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,720
Where's your luminous pearl?

464
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,820
Such a precious thing.

465
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,980
It was ruined just like that.

466
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,060
Stop crying.

467
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,390
I've been to the Fucang Palace.

468
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,860
Things like that—

469
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,360
the Fucang Palace has plenty of them.

470
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,860
Huo Xiangjiu told me the same.

471
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,940
But so what?

472
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,460
They're not mine.

473
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,350
Pick a couple of pieces from my things.

474
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,740
These ordinary things of yours

475
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,340
can't compare
to those from the Fucang Palace.

476
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,160
They're not for you.

477
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,950
They're for you to give as gifts

478
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,500
to Huo Xiangjiu.

479
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,940
Although these

480
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,400
can't compare to hers,

481
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,360
she values the gesture more.

482
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,980
People from the Fucang Palace
attach great importance to dignity.

483
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,340
If you use these to return the courtesy,

484
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,070
she'll surely
give you something more valuable.

485
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,860
Really?

486
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,980
Of course.

487
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,830
Why else would I
befriend someone like Huo Xiangjiu?

488
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,460
Then I'll...

489
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,260
take a couple more.

490
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,500
You want me to seduce her?

491
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,460
That is utterly ridiculous!

492
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,680
It isn't seduction.

493
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,400
It's called a beauty trap.

494
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,320
You're going too far.

495
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,740
I have no other choice.

496
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,400
Yuan Xiang
is Prince Fuying's trusted maid.

497
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,780
If we can use Yuan Xiang,

498
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,380
we can help Song Lian escape her misery,

499
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,500
and perhaps

500
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,180
we can find clues
about my father from her.

501
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,260
Killing two birds

502
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,820
with one stone.

503
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,500
Nonsense.

504
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,280
These past few days,
my hounds have been searching the palace.

505
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,540
I've been searching the Eastern Palace.

506
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,320
More than half is already done.

507
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,720
Wait a little longer.
We'll have news soon.

508
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,600
But they aren't mutually exclusive.

509
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,360
Mao Jin takes care of the Eastern Palace.

510
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,040
We take care of Yuan Xiang.

511
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,920
A two-pronged approach—

512
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,450
wouldn't it be much faster?

513
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,460
No matter what,

514
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,020
I'll never engage in seduction.

515
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,820
You...

516
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,180
Mentor.

517
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,980
Mentor?

518
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,140
He truly is a wily fox.

519
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,700
He said he won't engage in seduction?

520
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,220
He's practically a soul-snatching envoy.

521
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,220
How dare you not bow

522
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,700
before me?

523
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,430
Greet...

524
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,790
Greetings, Your Grace.

525
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,060
You're a maid from the Eastern Palace.

526
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,120
What brings you to the Fucang Palace?

527
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,140
At noon,

528
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,540
I ran into Mentor.

529
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,140
She gave me a luminous pearl hairpin.

530
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,940
I'm deeply grateful,

531
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,380
so I prepared some gifts

532
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,980
and came to return the courtesy.

533
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,420
Although these pieces of jewelry

534
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,740
aren't worth a fraction
of what Mentor gave me,

535
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,740
gaining Mentor's appreciation

536
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,280
fills me with gratitude.

537
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,420
I only wish to express my gratitude.

538
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,660
I never expected a maid like you

539
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,380
to understand etiquette so well.

540
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,180
This...

541
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,640
This...

542
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,140
This...

543
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,560
This is a luminous pearl?

544
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,920
This guy...

545
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,360
Don't tell me what I'm wearing

546
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,690
was also transformed from a toilet stick.

547
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,470
Raise your head.

548
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,360
This...

549
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,740
is yours.

550
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,760
Mine?

551
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
You don't like it?

552
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,520
I like it!

553
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,780
How could I not like it?

554
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,120
Do you want me
to deliver it to you personally?

555
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,080
A precious hairpin...

556
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,280
for a beautiful lady.

557
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,080
Let me...

558
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,760
put it on for you personally.

559
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,880
How disgusting!

560
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,240
Utterly disgusting!

561
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,780
I never expected
that there's such a beauty

562
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,060
from the Eastern Palace.

563
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,880
Your Grace, I'm flattered.

564
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,760
What a pity.

565
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,530
Why do you sigh, Your Grace?

566
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,000
Such a beauty

567
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,280
is not from my Fucang Palace.

568
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,280
It's truly regrettable.

569
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,739
How could I be so fortunate

570
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,600
to serve you, Your Grace?

571
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,860
Never mind.

572
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:33,920
Life

573
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,440
is full of regrets.

574
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,520
Go back.

575
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,880
If you don't mind, Your Grace,

576
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,810
I'm willing to stay at the Fucang Palace
to serve you.

577
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,720
Do you truly mean that?

578
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,360
Absolutely.

579
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,780
But I

580
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,180
have a quirk.

581
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,100
I wonder if you can accept it.

582
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,300
Actually,

583
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,740
Prince Fuying also has quite a few quirks.

584
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,840
It doesn't matter.

585
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,460
As long as I can stay to serve you,

586
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,100
no matter what quirks you have,

587
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,740
I can accommodate them all.

588
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,620
My quirk is

589
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,120
I loathe servants with former masters.

590
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,650
What does that mean?

591
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,560
Former masters

592
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,960
are like ex-lovers.

593
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,480
Better dead than alive.

594
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,860
Moreover,

595
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,500
I'm not asking you
to take action against Prince Fuying.

596
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,560
You're the Princess Consort's maid.

597
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,620
You just need to think of a way

598
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,220
to drive her...

599
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,060
out of the palace.

600
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,700
Then you won't
miss your former master in the future.

601
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,230
Drive her out of the palace?

602
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,620
But

603
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,420
she is the Princess Consort.

604
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,760
Just wait for the right opportunity.

605
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,340
Once you drive away your former master,

606
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,620
I will have you...

607
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,070
transferred to the Fucang Palace.

608
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,830
You are so nice, Your Grace.

609
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,820
But

610
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,700
how long do I have to wait?

611
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,380
How about...

612
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,220
just killing her?

613
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,060
Absolutely not.

614
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,200
This woman

615
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,940
is truly ruthless.

616
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,700
Your Grace, you care about her?

617
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,340
No.

618
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,740
I simply...

619
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,660
care about a beauty like you.

620
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,480
These fair, jade-like hands

621
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,760
should not be stained with blood.

622
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,900
You are so nice, Your Grace.

623
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,420
But

624
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,580
I was just saying.

625
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,300
I usually don't even dare to speak loudly.

626
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,580
Go back.

627
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,820
When...

628
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,500
the time is right,

629
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,180
I'll tell you what to do.

630
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,260
Okay.

631
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,460
Your Grace, wait for my good news.

632
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,820
I'll... come to serve you soon.

633
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,300
You are so nice, Your Grace.

634
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,430
You won't engage in seduction?

635
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,380
Was that seduction just now?

636
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,980
That wasn't seduction?

637
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,780
You were practically
a soul-snatching... envoy.

638
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,260
Y-You've completely bewitched Yuan Xiang!

639
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,580
You even helped her put on a hairpin.

640
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,940
A precious hairpin for a beautiful lady.

641
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,260
Bah!

642
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,860
What's beautiful about her?

643
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,420
Didn't you tell me to seduce her?

644
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,700
Did I tell you... Did I tell you...

645
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,060
Did I tell you to seduce her like that?

646
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,790
Did I tell you to touch her chin?

647
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,420
Then teach me

648
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,830
how I should seduce her.

649
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,300
How would I know how to seduce someone?

650
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,230
I've never seduced anyone before.

651
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,360
Who says you haven't seduced anyone?

652
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,940
Then who... did I seduce?

653
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,100
Oh, right.

654
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,900
Why didn't you ask her about my father?

655
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,140
Asking now

656
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,240
will make her suspicious.

657
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,820
When the time is right,

658
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,060
I will ask her.

659
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,940
No wonder they say foxes are cunning.

660
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,880
It's true indeed.

661
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,320
Foxes are cunning—

662
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,850
that is what you humans say.

663
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,240
If foxes are truly cunning,

664
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,280
how would you humans be able to tell?

665
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,120
That means we humans

666
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,560
are

667
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,000
even

668
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,530
smarter.

669
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,610
You pride yourselves on being clever,

670
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,400
yet you look down on us for being cunning.

671
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,040
Tell me,

672
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,760
who's more cunning?

673
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,800
But not everyone is cunning.

674
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,450
Otherwise, there wouldn't be
unfortunate people like the Princess Consort.

675
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,960
You

676
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,640
always think of others.

677
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Aren't you tired?

678
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,640
Not thinking of others—

679
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,650
does that make life more carefree?

680
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,400
When I help others,

681
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,400
the body may be tired,

682
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,440
but the heart

683
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,560
is at peace.

684
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,210
You haven't changed at all.

685
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,060
You're still as kind-hearted

686
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,260
as before.

687
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,700
Why does it sound like you knew me before?

688
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,980
You're so practiced at seducing people.

689
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,060
How many women have you seduced before?

690
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,680
None.

691
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,800
Not a single one?

692
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,430
I don't believe you.

693
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,580
Then for the past few thousand years,

694
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,910
have you never fallen in love
with a woman?

695
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,780
I have.

696
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,180
Then how many?

697
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,700
You could say many

698
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,860
or just one.

699
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,490
What does that mean?

700
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,260
Clear streams trickle by jade-like leaves.

701
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,240
Longing drips like dew,
brushing past seal-script incense.

702
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,640
I don't understand.

703
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,320
Master.

704
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,810
Tomorrow is your tribulation.

705
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,400
The daily tribulation is not far away.

706
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,260
Are you still not going to ascend?

707
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,640
By the way,

708
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,240
tomorrow, I need to go out of the state

709
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,080
to find a medicinal herb for His Majesty.

710
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,760
You're leaving the state tomorrow?

711
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,360
Will you come back tomorrow?

712
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,370
You won't spend the night outside?

713
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
That's good then.

714
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,320
Don't worry.

715
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,900
I'll have Mao Jin watch over you.

716
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,440
Listen carefully.

717
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,280
Don't run around.

718
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,010
Just stay in the Fucang Palace.

719
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,380
As for you,

720
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,180
don't flirt with anyone.

721
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,520
Will you miss me?

722
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,120
I will think of you all day long.

723
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,100
You are so nice, Your Grace.
