1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,580
Your Highness.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,700
Your Highness!

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,680
Your Highness.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,140
Lord Gongsun

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,200
has sent a message—

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,820
at tonight's royal family banquet,

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,820
he has

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,200
arranged for a poisoner.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,240
The poison is

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,320
Death Powder,

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,840
mixed with

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,840
Heart-Severing Grass,

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,400
and

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,360
Thunder God Vine,

15
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,000
and arsenic,

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,560
and...

17
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,680
What was it again?

18
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,120
Yes.

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,960
Anyway,

20
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,439
he'll be dead for sure!

21
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,440
Even God himself couldn't save him!

22
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,660
Feng Mochen, oh, Feng Mochen.

23
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,380
What a pity.

24
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,660
What a pity.

25
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,860
Working so hard every day.

26
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,860
The more I sleep, the more tired and weak I become!

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,420
I must be dreaming again...

28
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,220
There's no way I'm really inside this body!

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,740
I need to wake up now!

30
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,520
Wake up now! Wake up!

31
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,340
Stop!

32
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,060
I don't need your concern.

33
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,060
I don't care about you.

34
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,700
I just care that if this handsome body of mine gets scarred,

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,220
I won't know what to do.

36
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,060
You demon!

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,820
What sorcery have you cast?

38
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,420
Change us back immediately!

39
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,180
Are you...

40
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,740
having a fit?

41
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,340
I'm casting a spell.

42
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,420
Why isn't anything happening?

43
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,420
You think just waving your hands around

44
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,820
will make things appear?

45
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,550
How could that be possible?

46
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,700
I get it now.

47
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,750
You're in my physical body,

48
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,740
so you have my cultivation and technique.

49
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,659
I'm in your physical body,

50
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,460
so I've gained your...

51
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,280
dull-wittedness.

52
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,130
So that means...

53
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,220
I can control wind and rain now?

54
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,020
Mm.

55
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500

What is this?

73
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,300
This is...

74
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,180
This is...

75
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,440
Looks like

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,420
you're not all-knowing after all.

77
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,340
How could I not know this?

78
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,140
This is...

79
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,100
a fish tank.

80
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,190
It's a fish tank?

81
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,350
The fishing rod.

82
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,430
Really impressive.

83
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,780
Impressive.

84
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,580
No, no, don't!

85
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,020
Casting spells requires unity of mind and intent.

86
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,560
You're a mortal after all.

87
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,380
Reckless spellcasting will severely damage your vital energy.

88
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,320
If things go wrong,

89
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,840
it could be fatal.

90
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
That serious?

91
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,740
I'll find a way

92
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,620
to switch us back as soon as possible.

93
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,140
If you want your body back,

94
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,500
first hand over my dad!

95
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,700
Your dad?

96
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,040
My dad secretly entered the palace to meet the Emperor two years ago.

97
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,740
After that, there was no news of him.

98
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,740
He just disappeared.

99
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,860
I heard

100
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,990
that some palace maids disappeared from Fucang Palace.

101
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,220
You must be behind that.

102
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,580
So what if it was me?

103
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,020
And what if it wasn't?

104
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,740
If I die,

105
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,150
your powers disappear with me.

106
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,780
Hand over my dad now!

107
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,940
You dare threaten me?

108
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,820
I am openly

109
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,820
and blatantly threatening you.

110
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,580
And what if I refuse?

111
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,700
That powerful?

112
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,860
You!

113
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,640
Are you having fun?

114
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,140
Yeah.

115
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,540
Hand over my dad now!

116
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,300
When did your dad enter the palace to meet the Emperor?

117
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,080
If he entered Ganquan Palace,

118
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,860
there must be a record in the Ganquan Register.

119
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,980
I found the date.

120
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,100
But you tore out the two pages around that date ages ago.

121
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,580
You just wanted to secretly erase

122
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,840
the traces of my dad meeting the Emperor.

123
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,280
Where did Xiangjiu go?

124
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,990
How could she disappear for no reason?

125
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,020
Could it be...

126
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,600
that wily fox took her?

127
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,080
Third Uncle!

128
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,740
Third Uncle,

129
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,780
get up.

130
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,580
Time to work.

131
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,200
His Majesty and the others will arrive soon!

132
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,700
Hurry up.

133
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,560
My dear nephew,

134
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,660
can't you do the work without me?

135
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,740
No.

136
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,200
Third Uncle,

137
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,800
the Chief assigned this task to both of us.

138
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,640
How can I manage it all by myself?

139
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,140
The Chief is so old now.

140
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,860
He doesn't have much time left.

141
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,660
Who do you think the chief steward position will go to in the future?

142
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,860
I'm your third uncle.

143
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,780
Would I compete against you?

144
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,820
If you want the position,

145
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,780
shouldn't you prove yourself?

146
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,820
If the Chief finds out

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,620
that you managed the royal family banquet alone,

148
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,500
wouldn't he

149
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,740
see you in a new light?

150
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,780
When that time comes,

151
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,510
the chief steward position...

152
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,280
will be none other than yours.

153
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,160
Third Uncle,

154
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,520
your words

155
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,900
are like a revelation!

156
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,920
Well then,

157
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,450
I'll do all the work myself.

158
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,060
You can just show up later, for appearances.

159
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,060
I'm off!

160
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,670
Where on earth did Xiangjiu go?

161
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,980
You sly old fox.

162
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,640
I don't trust you one bit!

163
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,120
Hand over my dad now!

164
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,960
Aren't you afraid

165
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,660
I'll eat you?

166
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,100
You wouldn't dare.

167
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,840
Watch it.

168
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,040
You're using my body!

169
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
It's dislocated.

170
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,020
Bear with it.

171
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,400
Master!

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,280
Master!

173
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,240
Master!

174
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,440
It's time for the royal family banquet!

175
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,760
Mao Jin, you may leave first.

176
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,520
I'll be there shortly.

177
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,320
Insolent!

178
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,160
You reckless maid, who do you think you are?

179
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,880
How dare you order me around as if you were my master?

180
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,040
No manners!

181
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,180
This is outrageous!

182
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,300
Look carefully.

183
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,480
Can't you recognize me?

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,800
Master.

185
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,880
Who is she?

186
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,970
She won't even look at me properly!

187
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,960
You pride yourself on being a loyal dog,

188
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,490
yet you can't even recognize your own master?

189
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,640
Xiangjiu loved apples when she was little.

190
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,960
Third Uncle,

191
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,840
you mustn't.

192
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,400
These are for the royal family banquet.

193
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,480
Look,

194
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,680
there are five apples here,

195
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,460
representing the five blessings.

196
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,280
Taking one away would break the blessing.

197
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,210
What do you know?

198
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,320
I'm doing this for your own good.

199
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,080
His Majesty likes things to be auspicious.

200
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,410
Four apples mean "all wishes fulfilled."

201
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,340
When His Majesty sees this, he will surely

202
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,670
reward you generously.

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,300
"All wishes fulfilled."

204
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,860
That actually makes sense.

205
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,840
When Xiangjiu sees this,

206
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,080
she'll be very happy.

207
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,080
I...

208
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,920
-Greetings, Princess Ningshuang.
-Greetings, Princess Ningshuang.

209
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,840
Attendant Bai, you're quite bold,

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,520
even daring to steal fruit from the royal family banquet.

211
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,120
This servant wouldn't dare.

212
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,060
This servant

213
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,860
only noticed there was

214
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,400
a wormhole in this fruit.

215
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,080
I was worried it would displease His Majesty,

216
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,000
so I took it.

217
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,700
Where is the wormhole?

218
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,200
It's right...

219
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,480
Darn it,

220
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,970
what a coincidence.

221
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,960
Your Highness's arrow went right through the wormhole!

222
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,500
Your Highness's archery is truly exceptional—

223
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,780
like Li Guang of our time,

224
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,980
Hou Yi reincarnated!

225
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,180
Having a princess like you

226
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,760
is truly our kingdom's great fortune

227
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,560
and a blessing for all citizens!

228
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,060
Yes, indeed!

229
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,140
Our kingdom's fortune!

230
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,940
The citizens' blessing!

231
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,280
Right?

232
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,520
-Our kingdom's fortune.
-Our kingdom's fortune.

233
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,450
-The citizens' blessing.
-The citizens' blessing.

234
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,240
Attendant Bai,

235
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,900
don't think you can distract me with flattery.

236
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,620
This fruit

237
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,180
was carefully selected by the palace servants.

238
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,110
If you say there's a wormhole on it,

239
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,120
then I'll find those servants

240
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
and punish them.

241
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,780
Your Highness,

242
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,500
every year, the palace is extremely busy preparing for the royal family banquet.

243
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,980
It's hard work for them.

244
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,620
Even if there are some mistakes,

245
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,500
they're understandable.

246
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,520
Madam Chen, you're so considerate of us servants.

247
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,440
It's truly a blessing for us.

248
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,680
So you're making veiled accusations,

249
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,800
implying that I'm not considerate of you?

250
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Your Highness is overthinking this.

251
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,400
This servant wouldn't dare.

252
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,780
Attendant Bai, then

253
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,540
you're saying I'm paranoid.

254
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,640
Your Highness,

255
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,170
please forgive this servant for my poor choice of words.

256
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,540
Please have an apple

257
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,400
and calm down.

258
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,760
Outrageous.

259
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,620
Father!

260
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,900
Father.

261
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,040
Who!

262
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,880
Who's so blind

263
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,420
as to throw apples around?

264
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,680
Lord Gongsun!

265
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,770
How could you insult Her Highness Princess Ningshuang?

266
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,560
Ning...

267
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,560
What a great throw!

268
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,200
So it was Your Highness who threw it.

269
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,680
I must say,

270
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,480
after that apple hit me,

271
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,119
I

272
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,280
suddenly felt refreshed

273
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,920
and full of energy.

274
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

275
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,800
This is a family banquet.

276
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Lord Gongsun,

277
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,880
why are you here?

278
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,300
Don't tell me Father

279
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,040
has adopted you as his son.

280
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,800
It was His Majesty

281
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,599
who ordered me to attend the banquet with my son.

282
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,859
Your son

283
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,020
is entering the palace for the first time, right?

284
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,500
Yes.

285
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,360
Tell your son

286
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,160
that the palace is heavily guarded—

287
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,860
he must not wander around carelessly,

288
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,920
lest he stumble into forbidden areas

289
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,160
and lose his head.

290
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,400
This minister will remember.

291
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,130
Ningshuang!

292
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,580
How can you speak like that to an important court official?

293
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,540
Greetings to Your Highnesses the Crown Prince and the Princess Consort.

294
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,600
Greetings to Your Highnesses the Crown Prince and the Princess Consort.

295
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,540
Your Highness,

296
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,150
quickly greet His Highness and Her Highness.

297
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,260
So many people are greeting them already.

298
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,340
One less greeting from me

299
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,500
won't hurt them.

300
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,140
Madam Chen,

301
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,020
forget it.

302
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,260
Let her be.

303
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,220
My sister

304
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,160
has been spoiled by Father since childhood.

305
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,400
It's not Her Highness's fault.

306
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,440
It's all this old servant's failing.

307
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,920
Madam Chen, don't say that.

308
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,380
Ningshuang didn't grow up by Mother's side.

309
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,760
Thanks to you, her wet nurse, for taking such good care of her.

310
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,220
Your Highness is too kind.

311
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,780
This is all this old servant's blessing.

312
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,600
Ningshuang,

313
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,850
it doesn't matter how you treat me.

314
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,880
But when Lord Feng arrives,

315
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,440
you should restrain yourself.

316
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,600
Lord Feng won't indulge you as we do.

317
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,920
I don't know what methods he used

318
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,040
to make Father trust him so much.

319
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,240
You're afraid of him,

320
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,160
but I'm not.

321
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,120
When he arrives,

322
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,640
I'll show him who's boss.

323
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,500
I'd like to see what he can do to me.

324
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,480
How could this happen?

325
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,500
What should we do now?

326
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:34,980
Mas...

327
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,980
Master.

328
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,740
I want my dad.

329
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,180
Where have you been hiding my dad?

330
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,280
Why are you asking my master

331
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,560
where your dad is?

332
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,180
He took my dad.

333
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,800
My master doesn't need another dad.

334
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,760
Why would he capture yours?

335
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,960
Then why did he tear out these two pages from the Ganquan Register?

336
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,520
My master treasures books above all else.

337
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,720
He would never tear them carelessly.

338
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
Moreover, the Ganquan Register

339
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,420
documents the Emperor's...

340
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,220
Give it to me!

341
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,500
The Ganquan Register documents

342
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,380
the Emperor's summons of his ministers to Ganquan Palace.

343
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,310
How could anyone tear it up at will?

344
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,630
There is indeed a strange fragrance on this book.

345
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,640
Master.

346
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
I only smell ink.

347
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,620
Impossible.

348
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,520
Your sense of smell is even better than mine.

349
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,980
How could you not smell it?

350
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,700
Useless people say useless things.

351
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,060
Worthless things just yap.

352
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,860
Of course, a book only smells of ink.

353
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,660
What other scent could there be?

354
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,700
There really is a fragrance.

355
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,050
You can smell it?

356
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,200
It's very obvious.

357
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,550
Different from your scent.

358
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,760
I told you, it couldn't have been my master's doing!

359
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,020
Looks like...

360
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,780
you've even acquired my sense of smell.

361
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,580
That's right.

362
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,460
Foxes have keen senses of smell.

363
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,160
But why can you smell it too?

364
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,780
Focus your attention

365
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,740
and direct your intention toward him.

366
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,180
I'm not telling you to strain your eyes.

367
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,700
It's about your mind.

368
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,040
Clear your mind of distractions.

369
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,900
Unite your thoughts and intent.

370
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,400
You're a mutt!

371
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,820
I'm a dog.

372
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,340
I'm a

373
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,160
Chinese Pastoral Dog!

374
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,560
What's the difference between a mutt and a dog?

375
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,040
They're definitely different!

376
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,240
Would you dare call the Lord Howling Celestial Dog a mutt?

377
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,630
My dad's disappearance

378
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,680
really has nothing to do with you?

379
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,140
If you waste your energy on me,

380
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,030
you'll never find your father.

381
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,480
In that case,

382
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,380
I'll have to go ask the Emperor myself

383
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,540
what exactly happened that day.

384
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,340
It's useless.

385
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,860
The Emperor's memory is very poor now.

386
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,940
He forgets even what just happened,

387
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,700
let alone something from two years ago.

388
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,150
What am I supposed to do now?

389
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,700
Mao Jin,

390
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,620
do you know who has this scent?

391
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,660
This scent...

392
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,960
does seem familiar.

393
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,160
I think I've smelled it in the palace before.

394
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,960
Who was it?

395
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,380
I can't

396
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,780
remember clearly.

397
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,840
No.

398
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,040
You have to remember.

399
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,120
There are so many people in the palace.

400
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,780
How am I supposed to find them?

401
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
Don't worry.

402
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,400
Only a handful of people in the palace are qualified to burn incense.

403
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,200
Right!

404
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,120
Usually, only those of high status burn incense!

405
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,920
Oh.

406
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,700
Tonight's the royal family banquet.

407
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,160
Everyone of rank in the palace will be there.

408
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,300
This is a good opportunity.

409
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,900
I'll know once I take a sniff.

410
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,000
Your manners and behavior

411
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,530
don't resemble mine at all.

412
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,140
Aren't you afraid of being exposed?

413
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,540
Doesn't seem so hard to me.

414
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,220
Why hasn't Lord Feng arrived yet?

415
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,900
How long do we have to wait?

416
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,580
What's the rush?

417
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,070
Mochen must be bathing and changing his clothes before coming.

418
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,400
That alone shows

419
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,860
how seriously he takes this family banquet.

420
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,870
Let's wait a bit longer.

421
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,500
Ningshuang.

422
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,580
-Greetings, Your Grace.
-Greetings, Your Grace.

423
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,000
See?

424
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,320
I told you.

425
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,720
I wouldn't show any flaws.

426
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,860
Let's hope so.

427
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,540
You must always remember

428
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,460
you are the supreme Lord Feng above all others.

429
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,340
Such a nag.

430
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,420
Relax.

431
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,060
Nothing will go wrong.

432
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,960
Heaven-Mandated

433
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,680
Celestial Emperor

434
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,120
of Supreme Purity

435
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,640
and Ultimate...

436
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,040
He's not finished yet!

437
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,060
-Greetings, Your Grace.
-Greetings, Your Grace.

438
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,300
Xiangjiu.

439
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,180
Xiangjiu.

440
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,020
Xiangjiu.

441
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,820
Let's go.

442
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,020
Mochen,

443
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,200
what's wrong with you?

444
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
What's...

445
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,240
What's wrong?

446
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,120
What are you doing?

447
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,800
I need to go back quickly,

448
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,300
or something bad will happen.

449
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,500
If you go back, that's when something bad will happen.

450
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,320
Let's go!

451
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,200
Bai Yu!

452
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,700
Lord Feng, you

453
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,620
seem rather unusual tonight.

454
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,740
Unusual,

455
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,380
very unusual.

456
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,340
His Majesty loves...

457
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,780
turtle soup!

458
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,080
It makes your skin glow,

459
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,340
lengthens your life,

460
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,820
and even helps you

461
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,360
sire more children!

462
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,220
Then I'll accept your good wishes.

463
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,700
May I have a few more sons.

464
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,100
Father.

465
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,220
Father.

466
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,140
Is Lord Feng usually like this?

467
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,660
He seems like a completely different person tonight.

468
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,540
Please, everyone, take your seats.

469
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,100
All the nobles are here.

470
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,000
So who exactly tore out those two pages from the Ganquan Register?

471
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,900
Mochen,

472
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,640
please take your seat too.

473
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,020
I need to find a way

474
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,140
to smell them.

475
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,780
Lord Feng,

476
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,560
could it be that you feel apologetic

477
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,960
for arriving late today?

478
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,380
Ningshuang,

479
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,430
watch your manners.

480
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,120
What?

481
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,500
Did I say something wrong?

482
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,380
I've got it!

483
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,300
That's right!

484
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,380
Indeed!

485
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,140
Princess Ningshuang is absolutely right!

486
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,380
I'm late.

487
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,660
I should indeed apologize.

488
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,460
Your Majesty,

489
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,440
may I propose a toast to everyone in turn

490
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,840
to express my apologies?

491
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,100
Very well, very well.

492
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,780
Mochen, it's rare for you to want to socialize with everyone.

493
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,660
I'd

494
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,540
be delighted.

495
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,060
Let go of me!

496
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,460
Bai Yu!

497
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,340
What are you doing?

498
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,700
It's all my fault.

499
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,300
I got you into this.

500
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,550
What are you talking about?

501
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,140
There are some things you may not know.

502
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,880
If I tell you,

503
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,410
I'm afraid it'll scare you.

504
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,300
Feng Mochen captured you

505
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,420
to get to me.

506
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,220
What?

507
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,020
See?

508
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,950
You're scared, aren't you?

509
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,840
He must know about our relationship.

510
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,180
So he's using you to threaten me.

511
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,660
What...

512
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,920
are we?

513
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,740
We were betrothed as children.

514
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,460
You're my Xiangjiu,

515
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,520
and I'm your Yu.

516
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,110
We were betrothed as children?

517
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,100
Bai Yu,

518
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,860
this engagement

519
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,060
is off.

520
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,180
Why?

521
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,220
I...

522
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,900
Xiangjiu.

523
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,940
How could you have such poor taste?

524
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,300
What's so good

525
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,360
about Feng Mochen?

526
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,520
He's plain-looking

527
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,720
and incredibly ugly!

528
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,920
Compared to me...

529
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,060
we're worlds apart.

530
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,500
What do you even see in him?

531
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,120
Plain-looking...

532
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,720
and incredibly ugly?

533
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,000
Of course.

534
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,460
Bai Yu!

535
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,920
Among all the men

536
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,100
I've ever seen,

537
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,000
Lord Feng's appearance

538
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,320
is unmatched.

539
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,500
His beauty

540
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,760
is rare in this world!

541
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,560
To be by his side

542
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,160
is the lifelong dream of countless women!

543
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,560
How could someone like you...

544
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,890
with such rat-eyed, shifty features, ever compare?

545
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,520
From now on,

546
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,810
don't mention yourself in the same breath as him,

547
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,460
lest you tarnish his name.

548
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,060
This is outrageous.

549
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,620
Calling me ugly?

550
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,460
What a sheltered brat.

551
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,100
Trash.

552
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,260
Could Xiangjiu

553
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,080
have been bewitched by Feng Mochen

554
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,210
and lost her senses?

555
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,460
Impossible.

556
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,460
No normal woman would leave me.

557
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,820
Could it be

558
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,400
that she knows about my feud with that wily fox

559
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,440
and doesn't want me trapped in hatred

560
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,100
or facing any danger,

561
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,900
so she's saying that on purpose?

562
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,580
I will never let that wily fox hurt you.

563
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,800
For you,

564
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
I'm willing to submit myself to him.

565
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,660
Is it really worth it,

566
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,980
just for me?

567
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,780
Yu,

568
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,580
you don't know how precious you are in this world.

569
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,740
You're handsome and dashing,

570
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,420
unrivaled under heaven.

571
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
You're gentle and considerate,

572
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,580
attentive to every detail,

573
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,500
and absolutely adorable.

574
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:22,900
You're funny...

575
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,960
Don't say any more.

576
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,620
I have so many merits.

577
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,350
You can't list them all.

578
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,760
Mm.

579
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,620
Yu.

580
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,420
Xiangjiu.

581
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,300
Yu!

582
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,420
Xiangjiu!

583
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,340
Yu!

584
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,540
That's right.

585
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,020
It must be so.

586
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,200
A man

587
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,340
should never let his beloved woman get hurt.

588
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,260
Feng Mochen,

589
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,140
just you wait.

590
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,270
I'll destroy you with my own hands!

591
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,420
Then I'll first

592
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,180
toast to the Crown Prince and the Princess Consort.

593
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,380
To show my closeness,

594
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,390
I'll go over to drink with them.

595
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,060
Yes, yes, yes.

596
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,500
Fuying,

597
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
you should learn more from Lord Feng.

598
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,030
Look how good he is at getting close to people.

599
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,740
Yes, Father.

600
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,950
I'll keep it in mind.

601
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,940
I can tell

602
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,160
from the smell of this baijiu.

603
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,800
This is sauce-aroma baijiu!

604
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,740
Lord Feng...

605
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,260
You know your baijiu.

606
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,580
Come on, cheers.

607
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,400
Come on,

608
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,730
let's have another cup.

609
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,200
I'll drink...

610
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,720
the light-aroma type.

611
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,300
Cheers.

612
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,780
The Crown Prince smells so nice.

613
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,620
It's not him.

614
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:26,199
Come on,

615
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,320
Your Highness the Princess Consort.

616
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,780
Not her either.

617
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,420
Lord Feng, do you want to

618
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,120
whisper something to my consort?

619
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,350
You misunderstood.

620
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:42,460
It's...

621
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,179
It's like this.

622
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,719
I've recently been studying a technique

623
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,780
known as Scent Divination.

624
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,179
It's about

625
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,699
smelling a person's scent

626
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,980
to predict their fate.

627
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,340
Oh?

628
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,140
Such a technique exists?

629
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,260
Yes,

630
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,820
it's that magical!

631
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Well then, Lord Feng,

632
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,560
tell us about the fortunes of the Crown Prince and his wife.

633
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,540
They're both

634
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,220
destined for wealth and honor.

635
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,950
Destined for wealth and honor!

636
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,600
Then...

637
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,080
smell Lord Gongsun and his son too.

638
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,020
Your Majesty,

639
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,000
there's

640
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,540
no need to smell us, right?

641
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,380
We're just enjoying ourselves.

642
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,280
It's all for fun.

643
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,760
Don't take it seriously.

644
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,120
I have to smell you.

645
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,020
Come on.

646
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,040
It's just for fun.

647
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,890
Let me smell you.

648
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,740
Ginseng, deer antler,

649
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,500
curculigo,

650
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,400
epimedium,

651
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,280
cynomorium,

652
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,360
cistanche,

653
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,040
more deer antler,

654
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,960
astragalus seeds,

655
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,960
morinda root,

656
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,960
and dodder seeds.

657
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,880
My goodness!

658
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,660
This old man

659
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,160
is taking way too many tonics.

660
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,200
Lord Gongsun...

661
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,760
Do take care not to overexert yourself.

662
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,870
Lord Feng, what do you mean by that?

663
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,180
I mean,

664
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,980
Lord Gongsun's body is...

665
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:12,960
robust.

666
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,200
This scent is so familiar.

667
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,620
I think I just smelled it.

668
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
It's not him.

669
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,030
Lord Feng, you're behaving like a dog.

670
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,860
Ningshuang,

671
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,060
watch your words.

672
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,940
This is the scent.

673
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,330
Why are their scents

674
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,980
so similar?

675
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,640
Could they possibly...

676
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,360
I wonder if that girl

677
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,760
will cause any trouble.

678
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,820
One Bam,

679
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,140
you went to relieve yourself

680
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,580
and were gone the whole day.

681
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,660
Did you fall into the latrine and eat your fill before coming back?

682
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,220
Was it tasty?

683
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,840
Are you full now,

684
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,400
huh?

685
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,660
How dare you!

686
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,460
One Bam,

687
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,020
you've grown quite bold!

688
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,880
I'll beat you to death today!

689
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,140
My hand...

690
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,760
My hand...

691
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,620
My hand!

692
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,080
What a weak body.

693
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,140
One Bam,

694
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,220
you dare to mess with me?

695
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,040
I'll deal with you properly when we get back to the Imperial Servants Bureau!

696
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,380
Go!

697
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:05,840
Let go of me!

698
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,240
I'll teach you a lesson today!

699
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,040
Let go!

700
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,860
Mochen,

701
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,180
are you alright?

702
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,380
I'm not feeling very well.

703
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,260
Look at you,

704
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,160
you went to the latrine for a whole day!

705
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,060
You had me

706
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,340
searching everywhere for you!

707
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,140
I'll make you pay for this today!

708
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,670
I'll finish you off!

709
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,820
Damn One Bam?

710
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,740
One Bam?

711
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,700
I didn't...

712
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,380
I didn't even touch you.

713
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:50,960
Stop trying to frame me.

714
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,160
It's her.

715
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,100
Something happened to her.

716
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,340
One Bam?

717
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,300
Summon the royal physician now!

718
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,100
No need.

719
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,940
The old fox's body must have gone wrong.

720
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,580
I can't let anyone discover this.

721
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,040
I need to find him quickly.

722
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:09,980
But...

723
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,840
I haven't smelled Princess Ningshuang and the others yet.

724
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,640
Forget it.

725
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,180
There will be another chance.

726
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,380
Your Majesty,

727
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,820
I'm feeling unwell

728
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,260
and would like to take my leave

729
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,300
to rest.

730
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,340
Chief Steward Sun,

731
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,020
find someone to escort him back immediately.

732
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,100
Take good care of him.

733
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,220
There must not be the slightest mistake!

734
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

735
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,340
Attendant Bai!

736
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,100
Go follow His Grace now!

737
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:47,980
Yes.

738
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,380
Wily fox,

739
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,780
heaven truly has eyes.

740
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,680
This time, I'll settle things with you once and for all.

741
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,300
Old Fox,

742
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,360
where are you?

743
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,420
There really is a fragrance.

744
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,540
It's that scent.

745
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,420
Feng Mochen,

746
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,950
you never thought you'd end up like this, did you?

747
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,980
You've committed too many sins.

748
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,300
Even Heaven can't bear to watch anymore!

749
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,100
Yu...

750
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,780
Pah!

751
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,860
Disgusting.

752
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,660
How dare you call me "Yu"?

753
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,600
Help me chase...

754
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,100
You want me to help you chase after Huo Xiangjiu?

755
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,140
Dream on!

756
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,160
A truly loving couple

757
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,700
will never be easily separated!

758
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,280
Huo...

759
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,320
Huo...

760
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,140
Huo Xiang...

761
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,480
jiu...

762
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,020
Your filthy mouth

763
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,480
doesn't deserve to speak such a sacred name!

764
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,840
Feng Mochen...

765
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,980
The thousand-year feud between my Bai Clan of Bronze County and you

766
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,140
ends here today!

767
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,440
Ancestors of the Bai Clan of Bronze County above,

768
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,960
I, Bai Yu, the 30th generation disciple,

769
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,420
am here to vanquish evil and protect our way!

770
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,080
By Heavenly Thunder, Earthly Fire,

771
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,010
Five Elements, and Six Harmonies—

772
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,880
vanquish evil and subdue demons!

773
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,000
Follow my command!
