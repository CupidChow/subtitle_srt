1
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,460
You've remembered all my words?

2
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,560
You're a promising student.

3
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,220
Whether in the past or in the future,

4
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,220
helping those in need is crucial,

5
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,979
just like...

6
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,880
Wonderful!

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,620
Astonishing!

8
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,400
Miraculous!

9
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,759
I never thought

10
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,720
it would only take you 500 years

11
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,680
to shapeshift into human form.

12
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,720
How does it feel

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,700
to be human?

14
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,740
I'm being foolish.

15
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,660
He has only just become human

16
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,940
and hasn't learned to speak yet.

17
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,300
No need to rush.

18
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,900
With your talent,

19
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,420
given some time,

20
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,980
you'll surely learn it.

21
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,180
That will be very difficult.

22
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,820
500 years have passed.

23
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,079
We have no clue

24
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,100
who she is now,

25
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,680
or where she dwells.

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,740
Besides,

27
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,000
in the mortal world,

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,700
there are too many people.

29
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,780
How could you ever find her?

30
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,360
Exactly.

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,160
How could you possibly find her?

32
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
If you search everywhere, you'll find her?

33
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,880
Easier said than done.

34
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,360
Come back!

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,120
You're not even wearing any clothes!

36
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,160
You're stark naked.

37
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,980
How indecent!

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,260
For heaven's sake…

39
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,040
Don't go!

40
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,980
It's indecent!

41
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,440
Don't go!

42
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,180
What are you looking at?

43
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,940
Get lost!

44
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,180
Little White Fox,

45
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,180
guess what tasty treat I've brought you!

46
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,180
They're really tasty.

47
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,900
These chicken feet are super tasty!

48
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,700
Qinghua!

49
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,080
Father.

50
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
You little beast!

51
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
I'm gonna catch you.

52
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,560
You little beast!

53
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,640
Little White Fox, run!

54
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,840
Don't let my father catch you!

55
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,280
Little White Fox,

56
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,020
how wonderful it would be
if you were human.

57
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,500
If you were human,

58
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,220
you could take me away.

59
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,320
Now,

60
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,080
I've become human.

61
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,180
Where are you?

62
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,760
Miss.

63
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,880
Here, eat this.

64
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:58,460
Go on.

65
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,240
Eat it.

66
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,340
Quite an appetite for someone your size.

67
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,440
Miss,

68
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,940
were you

69
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,620
abandoned by your lover?

70
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,580
Go to Muxi State.

71
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,780
There are lots of people.

72
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,700
Perhaps

73
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,429
you can find the person
you're looking for there.

74
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,240
-Move aside!
-Move aside!

75
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,640
♪ If dreams reverse
to the moment we first met ♪

76
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:24,820
♪ I can still caress your brows and eyes
and chase on ♪

77
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,980
♪ How many times I've searched for you
among the crowds ♪

78
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,660
♪ Thinking it was a chance encounter
and instant affinity ♪

79
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,100
Miss,

80
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,660
are you hurt?

81
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,220
Miss?

82
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,500
Miss?

83
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,360
General Hua,

84
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,300
this young lady

85
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,440
must have fallen head over heels for you!

86
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,460
Look at her eyes.

87
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,800
She hasn't even blinked once!

88
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,580
Miss,

89
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,260
our General Hua is a woman too.

90
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,500
She can't marry you!

91
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,440
Stop laughing!

92
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,260
What...

93
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,300
does she mean?

94
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,720
She says

95
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,120
you bumped into her face.

96
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,580
Miss,

97
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,040
did I bump into you?

98
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,900
What?

99
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
You want 5 taels?

100
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,700
Miss,

101
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,280
I didn't even bump into you,

102
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,010
yet you're directly demanding
5 taels of silver?

103
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,920
10 taels?

104
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,280
Miss,

105
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,840
you're going too far.

106
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,760
Miss,

107
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,640
do you have any idea
who this person beside me is?

108
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,120
She is the famous General Hua Xi

109
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,920
of our Muxi State.

110
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,120
She just repelled the Xuanyue Army
at the border

111
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,450
and is returning to the capital to report.

112
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,560
I never thought

113
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,440
that after evading the enemy's ambush,

114
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,970
I'd walk right into a trap
set by my own people.

115
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,820
I only have one tael of silver.

116
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,000
Take it and go.

117
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,690
Let's go!

118
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,900
General Hua,

119
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,720
for lots of money.

120
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:28,500
it looks like she's setting you up

121
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,040
Her convulsions

122
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,660
look so fake.

123
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,700
Just leave her here.

124
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,500
We should hurry back to the capital
to report.

125
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,260
No!

126
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,020
What if she has really fainted

127
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,380
and gets carried off

128
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,340
by wild beasts in the wilderness?

129
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,240
How about this?

130
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,780
You go back to the capital
to report first.

131
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,540
I go check on her.

132
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,340
Yes, General.

133
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,260
Miss!

134
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,580
We soldiers on the march

135
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,140
don't carry silver with us.

136
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,560
If you're still trying
to extort money from me,

137
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,690
I don't have a single coin left for you.

138
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,820
Miss?

139
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,080
Miss?

140
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,940
Miss?

141
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,820
I'm warning you.

142
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,800
If you dare to pull that scam again,

143
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,840
I'll kill you.

144
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,380
Uh...

145
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,920
Why do you keep saying "uh" like that?

146
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,060
Uh...

147
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,640
What's next? Gonna start a nursery rhyme?

148
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Enough. Don't play games with me.

149
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,340
Speak up!

150
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,940
Are you...

151
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,240
mute?

152
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,040
I'm sorry, Miss.

153
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,710
I didn't know you were mute.

154
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,440
How about this?

155
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,420
You come back to the state with me.

156
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,480
I'll see to it that you get treatment.

157
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,640
So, a fox spirit after all.

158
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,240
My horse!

159
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,220
We'll walk back to the state!

160
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,820
After fighting at the border
for half a year,

161
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,820
I thought I'd finally get back
and wash up properly.

162
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,280
But unexpectedly,

163
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,980
I am sleeping
in the wilderness again.

164
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,220
You strange girl,

165
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,140
why do you keep staring at me
with that smile?

166
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,630
I really can't handle this.

167
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,400
You...

168
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,740
How long has it been since you bathed?

169
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,880
I didn't bathe

170
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,690
because I didn't have the time.

171
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,480
But why didn't you bathe?

172
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,930
You're not going

173
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,700
to tell me you have no family or friends,
are you?

174
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,820
It's because of the war, isn't it?

175
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,560
Now Muxi and Xuanyue

176
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,320
have been at war for a long time.

177
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,500
People are displaced,

178
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,260
their families torn apart.

179
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,400
I wonder when this war will ever end.

180
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,599
Now that we've met,

181
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,660
I'd call that fate.

182
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,609
Come back to Muxi State with me.

183
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,420
You can

184
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,079
stay and work in my household.

185
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,000
I can't promise you wealth and glory,

186
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,740
but I can guarantee you

187
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,040
all the necessities of life.

188
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,900
What do you say?

189
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,160
But first things first,

190
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,220
you need to take a bath right away!

191
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,840
Let's go!

192
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,640
Come on!

193
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,760
Don't be shy.

194
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,660
Let's go!

195
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,140
You lied to me.

196
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,820
You're not a woman.

197
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,180
How dare you deceive me!

198
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,700
You scoundrel!

199
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,880
Stop right there!

200
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,440
How dare you run!

201
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,680
I don't need your help.

202
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
That way.

203
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,180
That way.

204
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,240
No.

205
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,080
It's that way.

206
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,040
No.

207
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,760
This way!

208
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,360
No!

209
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,880
This way!

210
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,920
You're so obedient.

211
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,160
How come you don't have a name?

212
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,060
I'll give you a name.

213
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,040
I like...

214
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,360
I like the wind.

215
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,720

217
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,800

By the way,

262
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,040
my father said

263
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,120
you did me a great service by carrying me.

264
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,840
From now on,

265
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,800
you'll stay at our Hua residence.

266
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,860
This is your room.

267
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,400
I specially arranged the best guest room
in our residence for you.

268
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,280
Do you like it?

269
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,100
What's wrong?

270
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,520
It's alright.

271
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
I'm not leaving.

272
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,940
I've brought you something good.

273
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,070
Come with me.

274
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,440
Come on.

275
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,680
Look!

276
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,420
Sit down.

277
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,400
This is an incense burner.

278
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,920
You'll use it every day
from now on.

279
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
It will make you smell really nice.

280
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,960
Let me teach you how to use it.

281
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,400
This one.

282
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,800
It's fragrant, right?

283
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,520
Smell it.

284
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,660
This is sandalwood.

285
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,060
It's my favorite scent.

286
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,320
General Hua Xi

287
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,300
answered the call of duty
in the bloom of her youth.

288
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,340
During her decade in military service,

289
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,700
she fought valiantly
across countless battlefields,

290
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
achieved numerous merits,

291
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,360
and guarded our home and country.

292
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,620
Her contributions are beyond measure.

293
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,420
Now she has reached the prime of her life,

294
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,380
yet her marriage remains unsettled.

295
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,180
I am deeply concerned about this.

296
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,140
I hereby bestow upon her a good marriage.

297
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,020
She shall wed the Crown Prince
and become his consort.

298
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,580
A distinguished general deserves be paired
with a noble man.

299
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,920
This union shall manifest the boundless
grace of the throne.

300
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,450
We thank His Majesty
for the royal betrothal.

301
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,240
General Hua Xi,

302
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,440
you may now accept the decree
and express your gratitude.

303
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,040
Hua Xi,

304
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,300
hurry and accept the decree with thanks!

305
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,460
To marry the Crown Prince

306
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,760
is such a great honor!

307
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,720
Do you know

308
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,740
that defying an imperial decree

309
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,860
is a grave crime?

310
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,880
Hua Xi,

311
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,630
this would bring ruin
upon our entire family!

312
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,680
I...

313
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,800
thank His Majesty for the royal betrothal.

314
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,320
Esteemed Eunuch,

315
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,800
please come in.

316
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,920
Congratulations!

317
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,800
Let's have a few drinks.

318
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,280
In the future, you'll be the father-in-law
of the Crown Prince.

319
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,280
I hope I can count on your patronage.

320
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,400
Of course.

321
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,060

354
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,180
Then you could take me away.

355
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,500
I can't run away.

356
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,970
I really can't run away.

357
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,780
If I were to run away,

358
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,160
it would be a direct defiance

359
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,960
And then,

360
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,530

364
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,520
The Emperor of Xuanyue
has suddenly led his troops in person

365
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,380
to attack our border!

366
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,100
What?

367
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,640
If I can capture
the Emperor of Xuanyue alive,

368
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,980
achieving a feat of extraordinary glory,

369
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,780
then

370
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,850

to rescind the marriage decree.

00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,680
Saddle up!

372
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,360
March out!

373
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,040
Yes!

374
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
You stay home

375
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,850
and wait for my triumphant return.

376
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,440
Do as I say!

377
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,540
If you were on the battlefield,

378
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,360
I would have to protect you.

379
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,220
I cannot allow that distraction!

380
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:48,840
You...

381
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,640
If you keep this up,

382
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,520
I'll be angry!

383
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,920
I'm serious!

384
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,020
Don't worry.

385
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,440
I'll be back soon.

386
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,320
Wait for me.

387
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,640
Little demon,

388
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,560
I've been following you in secret
for days.

389
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,240
Finally, I've got my chance.

390
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,980
So, you're just a little fox demon
who has just learned to shapeshift

391
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,640
into human form
and can't even speak our tongue.

392
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,600
Today, you've come up against me, Bai Chi,

393
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,930
the third-generation heir
of the Bai Clan of Bronze County.

394
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,980
Well, that's just your rotten luck.

395
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,700
Pleading won't help you.

396
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,540
Our Bai Clan of Bronze County has always
taken vanquishing demons as our duty.

397
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,100
No matter how long you've cultivated

398
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,430
or how powerful you are,

399
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,380
once you encounter
our Bai Clan of Bronze County,

400
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,940
none of you can escape.

401
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,940
Ancestors
of the Bai Clan of Bronze County,

402
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,520
I, Bai Chi, the third-generation heir,

403
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,720
am here to purge this demon
and uphold the righteous path.

404
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,100
Just blame yourself for being a demon.

405
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,900
Humans and demons are fated
to walk separate paths.

406
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,830
Close your eyes.

407
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,520
I'll make this quick for you.

408
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,440
Heavenly Thunder. Earthly Fire.

409
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,400
Five Elements. Six Harmonies.

410
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,520
Vanquish evil and subdue demons!

411
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,580
Follow my command!

412
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,080
You despicable fox demon,

413
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,640
how dare you trick me!

414
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,020
Our Bai Clan of Bronze County

415
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,260
will never let you get away with this!

416
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,400
Descendants of the Bai Clan
of Bronze County, heed my command!

417
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,400
My life is ended
by a cruel and cunning nine-tailed fox.

418
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,500
All future generations

419
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,720
must spare no cost
to punish evil and eradicate wickedness

420
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,380
and swear to slay this nine-tailed fox!

421
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,440

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,120
to use your 500 years of cultivation

453
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,840
to bring her back to life?

454
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,800
You...

455
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,680
To meet her again,

456
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,960
you endured 500 long years!

457
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,480
But her time has run out in this life.

458
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,920
You only need wait
for her next incarnation.

459
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,640
Why waste your 500 years of cultivation?

460
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,600
You...

461
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,040
You...

462
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,400

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,560
I...

464
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,940
understand you now.

465
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,080
Your fear stems from love.

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,800
stems from love.

468
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,040
If you can detach from love,

469
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,360
you will be

470
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,720
free of sorrow and fear.

471
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,200
I've used your cultivation

472
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,240
to bring her back to life.

473
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,360
I've also erased
all her impressions and memories

474
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,720
of you,

475
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,080
so she will not have to suffer the pain
of missing you.

476
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,240
A little white fox?

477
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,780
You really are a little fox?

478
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,840
Where did you come from?

479
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,140
So beautiful.

480
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,220
They say

481
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,960
I'm getting married today.

482
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,840
But I feel like

483
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,720
I've forgotten many things.

484
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,040
I'll beat you to death!

485
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,270
You can't hit it!

486
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,600
Where did it go?

487
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,780
You can't hit it!

488
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,200
Hua Xi,

489
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,080
hurry and get ready.

490
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,600
The Crown Prince will come to fetch you
for the wedding soon.

491
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,200
Come here.

492
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,740
Hua Xi,

493
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,540
it's just a fox.

494
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,940
Why are you staring at it?

495
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,860
I don't know.

496
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,080
I just feel like

497
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,350
I've seen it somewhere before.

498
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,140
Old Fox,

499
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,020
I've been feeling refreshed lately.

500
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,820
Let's go outside
and practice our fist form again!

501
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,200
Old Fox.

502
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,800
What's wrong?

503
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,140
It's so good to see you again.

504
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,660
What nonsense are you talking?

505
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,380
Didn't we just see each other
a moment ago?

506
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,780
By the way,

507
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,520
today,

508
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,460
you skipped the incense, right?

509
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,780
Why are you just standing there?

510
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,640

are the other organ spirits

543
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,840
doing?

544
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,560
Especially the Heart Spirit—

545
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,720
is she doing well?

546
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,500
Everyone is doing well.

547
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,620
As for the Heart Spirit,

548
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,740
now she can walk freely too.

549
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,640
Sometimes,

550
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,820
she even dances with the Spleen Spirit.

551
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,320
Really?

552
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:51,940

So that means...

554
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:56,840
I...

555
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,680
don't have...

556
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,540
to die?

557
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,220
Yes.

558
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,860
The sky has cleared.

559
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,500
The rain has stopped.

560
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,740
I feel

561
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,780
full of energy again.

562
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,000
Don't celebrate too soon.

563
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,760
You need to keep it up.

564
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,240
Mm.

565
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,600
Always cherish your life,
no matter what.

566
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,080
Your life doesn't just belong to you.

567
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,580
In this world,

568
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,240
there are others who care for you
more than you care for yourself.

569
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,240
Mm.

570
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,640
I know.

571
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,800
My father, right?

572
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,480
It's just

573
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,280
that I don't know

574
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,160
where he is now.

575
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,520
Not just your father.

576
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,720
There are others too.

577
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,480
Three begets all things.

578
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,700
Change comes with seven.

579
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,780
A love connection in one lifetime

580
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,980
is hard to come by.

581
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,580
Once you meet your fated person,

582
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,460
you should cherish the connection dearly.

583
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,720
If you lose it,

584
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,240
there's no need to cling too tightly.

585
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,500
Sometimes a single loss

586
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,500
is precisely

587
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,580
for the next connection.

588
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,880
You're being...

589
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,640
so mysterious.

590
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,210
What are you talking about?

591
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,160
Nothing.

592
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,920
I just hope we'll never

593
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,480
have to meet again.

594
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,320
Mm.

595
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,820
Your Highness, everything you instructed

596
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,820
has been arranged.

597
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,980
Huo Xiangjiu will soon

598
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,980
find her father.

599
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,740
It's just too easy on her.

600
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,380
She was meant to die.

601
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:01,000
But at least it saves us the trouble
of dealing with her ourselves.

602
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,460
Those who are fated to die

603
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,720
cannot escape their end.
