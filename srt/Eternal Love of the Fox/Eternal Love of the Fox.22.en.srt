1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,600
My Lord.

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,880
The drug has been administered.

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,080
Don't mess it up.

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,360
Rest assured, My Lord.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,100
Don't worry.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,680
My Lord,

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,940
thanks for handling that.

8
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,020
But I remember

9
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,140
I clearly locked you up back then.

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,360
A mere lock

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,480
could never contain me.

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,700
Then why didn't you save her?

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,100
If I had acted,

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,100
what would have become of you, Father?

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,180
What would have become
of our Gongsun family?

16
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,620
If I had saved her,

17
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,340
how could she
have married Prince Fuying?

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,340
If she hadn't married Prince Fuying,

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,700
how could my child

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,120
ever hope to smoothly inherit the throne?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,039
But previously,

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,140
the Princess Consort had a miscarriage...

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,880
How

24
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,680
could she carry someone else's child?

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,800
The story that follows

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,120
is that after my attempted suicide,

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,039
I still can't stop thinking about Lian.

28
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:33,860
And you, Father,

29
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,780
to put an end to my obsession,

30
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,740
will even take your own life
to wake me up.

31
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,420
From then on,

32
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,740
the kind-hearted Lian will feel
even more guilty about my suffering.

33
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,800
She will raise our child well.

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,180
In the end,

35
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,000
my child will ascend to the throne!

36
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,980
And our Gongsun family

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,480
will reach its pinnacle

38
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,100
in my generation.

39
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,680
Father,

40
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,300
you are a successful father.

41
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,200
You've always taught me that each
generation must be crueler than the last.

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,000
I...

43
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,700
did it.

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,420
You're even more vicious than I expected.

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,500
With your little demon magic,

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,880
you can't even be bothered
to use the door.

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,240
How utterly rude.

48
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,900
You're even more vicious than I expected.

49
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,860
With your little demon magic,

50
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,120
you can't even be bothered
to use the door.

51
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,400
How utterly rude.

52
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,500
If people know you killed your father,
you'll be guilty of a grave crime.

53
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,560
I killed my father?

54
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,480
Who would ever believe it?

55
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,680
You really are two-faced.

56
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,020
Aren't you the same?

57
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,430
One is the face of a human being.

58
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,900
The other

59
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,200
is the face of a nine-tailed fox.

60
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,100
So you know I am a nine-tailed fox?

61
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
I know much more than that,

62
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,260
including that you cannot kill.

63
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,000
If a cultivating demon

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,460
kills recklessly,

65
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,740
its power will be completely dissipated,

66
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,340
its body and soul perishing.

67
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
I indeed cannot kill you.

68
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,640
But ruining you

69
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
shouldn't be difficult.

70
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,020
The Bai Clan of Bronze County?

71
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,900
So you were the one

72
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,980
who could use magic in the palace.

73
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,420
Surprised?

74
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,140
Shocked?

75
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,200
What's your connection
to the Bai Clan of Bronze County?

76
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,460
You need not know that.

77
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,120
You only need to know

78
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,040
that you'll soon ascend to immortality.

79
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,920
Nothing in the mortal world
will matter to you anymore.

80
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,800
If you and I can avoid
even the slightest offense to each other,

81
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,760
after you become an immortal,

82
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
I promise

83
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,000
that Huo Xiangjiu
will remain safe and sound.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,440
You're threatening me?

85
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,570
This isn't a threat.

86
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,080
It's a deal.

87
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,000
What's between Lian and me

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,200
has always been our own private matter.

89
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,490
If you just mind your own business,

90
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,090
it won't cost you anything.

91
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,980
It's not that I want to meddle.

92
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,860
You've dragged us into this.

93
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,440
I had no choice.

94
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,900
That silly girl Lian wants
to take down Prince Fuying.

95
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,230
If Prince Fuying falls,

96
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,400
how can my son inherit the throne?

97
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,320
You kept saying you would take her away.

98
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,780
That was also a lie?

99
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,840
Only in this way

100
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,440
could I make that silly girl Lian

101
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,500
truly believe my affection for her.

102
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
She gave you her heart so sincerely,

103
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,620
yet you hurt her like this.

104
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,780
If the lie is never exposed,

105
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,659
how can there be any hurt?

106
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,460
I have cultivated for thousands of years,

107
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,880
but I've rarely known someone

108
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,400
as despicable as you!

109
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,360
Don't flatter me like that.

110
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,600
I might get proud.

111
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,960
Where is Huo Xiangjiu's father?

112
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,260
You tried everything to stop her before,

113
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,060
because you were afraid
she would find out, right?

114
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,980
If you must blame someone,

115
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,980
blame the whims of cruel fate.

116
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,160
Back then, Lian was pregnant
with Prince Fuying's child.

117
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,290
To prevent this child from being born,

118
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,740
I slipped datura into Lian's teacup.

119
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,800
I even specifically went
to Princess Ningshuang's place

120
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,080
to get the datura.

121
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,980
Even if someone had found out,

122
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,110
they would only have

123
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,400
suspected Princess Ningshuang.

124
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,700
But I never expected

125
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,659
he would witness it.

126
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,120
He also saw me meeting secretly with Lian.

127
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,840
Tell me!

128
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,970
How could I dare to let him live?

129
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,040
You killed him.

130
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,170
He forced me to do it.

131
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,580
You attempted to assassinate Xiangjiu,

132
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,900
claiming Prince Fuying coerced you.

133
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,220
It was just an excuse.

134
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,260
Prince Fuying wanted her dead anyway,

135
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,740
so I gave it a helpful push.

136
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,340
Then why did you tear out

137
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,560
those two pages from the Ganquan Register?

138
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,680
Because I found out

139
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,400
that he wasn't from the palace.

140
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,500
After questioning him,

141
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,920
I found out
he had come to see the Emperor.

142
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,300
I was worried

143
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,780
there might be a record of his audience
with the Emperor,

144
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,580
so

145
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,040
I tore out those two pages.

146
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,480
How did you find the clothes I buried?

147
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,100
I buried them so deep.

148
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,190
When you buried
those two pieces of clothing,

149
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,100
you buried the datura with them too.

150
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,840
Its seeds broke through the soil

151
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,300
and grew into new flowers.

152
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,370
So that's how it was.

153
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,720
I've been meticulous in every way,
yet I still made this one mistake.

154
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,000
Where is his body?

155
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,539
After my son inherits the throne,

156
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,559
I'll tell you.

157
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,090
Since you've dared to confess
to killing him,

158
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,340
why not just tell me where the body is?

159
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,400
It wouldn't be fun
if I told you everything.

160
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,200
I can tell you
that I killed Huo Xiangjiu's father,

161
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,960
because I know perfectly well

162
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,360
that even if you learn the truth of this,

163
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,160
you'll never tell Huo Xiangjiu.

164
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,880
Because that girl has a fiery temper.

165
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,520
Once she learns the truth,

166
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,300
she'll come to take revenge on me.

167
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,480
When that happens,

168
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,180
she'll die a horrible

169
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,020
death.

170
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,840
Harder.

171
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,320
Kill me.

172
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,020
Your body and soul

173
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,660
will also be destroyed.

174
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,680
And that's not all.

175
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
The moment I die,

176
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,200
someone will kill

177
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,180
Huo Xiangjiu.

178
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,320
You're a fox.

179
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,600
I'm human.

180
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,420
What makes you think you can fight me,

181
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,520
huh?

182
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,460
So you're just a coward after all.

183
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,220
Little fox.

184
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,460
Huo Xiangjiu really is a good card.

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
I must hold on to this card tight.

186
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,820
Only the incompetent indulge
in blind rage.

187
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,140
You've proven with your actions

188
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,800
just how incompetent you are.

189
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,500
Now I remember.

190
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,220
Two years ago,

191
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,880
shortly after I married
into the Eastern Palace,

192
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,780
Gongsun Hao

193
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,840
once came to see me.

194
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,540
I didn't want to drag him into trouble,

195
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,500
so I sent him away.

196
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,220
But unexpectedly,

197
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,060
someone saw us.

198
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,400
That person seemed
to have sneaked into the palace.

199
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,220
Lian,

200
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,560
tell me where that person is!

201
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,960
Where is that person now?

202
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,660
Gongsun Hao told me

203
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,640
he had sent that person out of the palace.

204
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,900
Since both of them had sneaked in,

205
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,020
that person didn't dare to speak out.

206
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,460
Otherwise, it would have meant death
for them both.

207
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,300
Then how do you explain these
two bloodstained garments?

208
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,700
How do you explain them?

209
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,620
I...

210
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,470
I don't know either.

211
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,540
Xiangjiu,

212
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,220
why do you care so much about this?

213
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,080
What does this have to do with you?

214
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,500
This is…

215
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,220
my father's clothing.

216
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,460
Gongsun Hao, he...

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,680
Xiangjiu,

218
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,060
don't panic.

219
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,820
I'll definitely help you find out
your father's whereabouts.

220
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,220
Your father will be fine.

221
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,080
It's no use.

222
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,170
When you firmly believe
someone won't lie to you,

223
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,970
no matter what they say,

224
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,360
you'll believe them.

225
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Xiangjiu, trust me!

226
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,820
Xiangjiu, I will help you!

227
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,700
For the sake of the child,

228
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,980
he will never lie to me!

229
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,520
What did you say?

230
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,320
The child I'm carrying

231
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,440
is Gongsun Hao's.

232
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,600
When did this happen?

233
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,760
That night,

234
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,140
when I got drunk at Ningshuang Palace...

235
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,600
If that's the case,

236
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,360
you should know even better

237
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,360
what kind of person

238
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,180
Gongsun Hao really is.

239
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,660
I have a way

240
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,280
to test Gongsun Hao's true nature.

241
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,220
Are you willing to try it?

242
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,160
Huo Xiangjiu,

243
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,700
what are you doing?

244
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,050
Lian has always considered you
her close friend.

245
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,860
You recognize these

246
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,260
two garments, don't you?

247
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,580
One belonged to my father.

248
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,640
and the other to you.

249
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,300
I've never seen them.

250
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,740
Gongsun Hao,

251
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,580
I remember one of them was yours.

252
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,560
People can look alike.

253
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,560
Clothes can be similar too.

254
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,760
That's quite normal.

255
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,020
Do you remember that two years ago,

256
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,380
an elderly man who sneaked into the palace

257
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,200
saw you coming to see me?

258
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,530
You said
you had sent him out of the palace.

259
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,820
Yes.

260
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,190
That did happen.

261
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,580
I remember

262
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,860
that after I sent him out of the palace,

263
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,160
I even gave him some money.

264
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,620
He was Xiangjiu's father.

265
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,560
Really?

266
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,440
It's such a coincidence that we have

267
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,360
this connection with Miss Xiangjiu.

268
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,640
Gongsun Hao,

269
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,500
why did you lie to me?

270
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,140
How could I ever lie to you, Lian?

271
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,780
Everything I said is true.

272
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,800
I heard you wanted to see me.

273
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,340
I came to you despite my wounds.

274
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,640
I didn't even have time

275
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,850
to handle my father's funeral.

276
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,210
What did you say?

277
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,160
My father...

278
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,510
killed himself.

279
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,480
How could

280
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,080
Lord Gongsun...

281
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,210
These past few days,

282
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,060
I was still planning how to take you away.

283
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,200
But my father found that out.

284
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,140
He threatened to kill himself to stop me.

285
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,340
I thought he was just trying to scare me.

286
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,080
But last night,

287
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,870
he really took his own life.

288
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,120
Do you know how grieved I was

289
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,620
when I saw his body this morning?

290
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,460
But even so,

291
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,500
I never meant to tell you this.

292
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,270
Because I was afraid

293
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,140
that once you knew this,

294
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,600
you would feel guilty,

295
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,980
and that you would blame yourself

296
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,620
for my father's death.

297
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,300
I cared for you so deeply,

298
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,840
yet now you're doubting me.

299
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,080
How could that not break my heart?

300
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,400
Gongsun Hao.

301
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,560
Where the hell

302
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,800
did you hide my father?

303
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,520
I said I don't know!

304
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,800
After I sent him out of the palace,

305
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,480
how could I possibly

306
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,200
know where he went?

307
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,740
Fine!

308
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,490
If you don't tell me,

309
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,460
then I'll kill her.

310
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,120
I don't believe

311
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,240
you would kill her.

312
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,200
What about this then?

313
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,600
Xiangjiu!

314
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,800
Do you only care about your child?

315
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,760
You and the child are one and the same.

316
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,670
By caring for the child,

317
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,800
am I not caring for you as well?

318
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,820
Take your woman and leave now.

319
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,780
I've had enough of her.

320
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,100
Old Fox,

321
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,119
he's connected
to my father's disappearance.

322
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,450
Please help me find out
where my father is!

323
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,000
Feng Mochen.

324
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,599
For her safety,

325
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,930
you'd better watch your words.

326
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,880
He killed your father.

327
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,260
Feng Mochen,

328
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,990
are you really going to do this?

329
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,880
How could you do such a thing?

330
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,720
You trust him

331
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,900
but not me?

332
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,920
That's not all.

333
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,800
Back then, when you were violated
by Prince Fuying,

334
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,260
it was also because of him.

335
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,160
He wanted you to marry Prince Fuying.

336
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,800
Shut up!

337
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,440
Then he could arrange for you
to conceive his child.

338
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,620
But unexpectedly, you got pregnant
with Prince Fuying's child first.

339
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,940
So he slipped datura into your teacup

340
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,470
to cause your miscarriage.

341
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Feng Mochen!

342
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,400
Do you know what you're saying?

343
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,280
Xiangjiu's father saw this,

344
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,760
and it cost him his life.

345
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,240
To gain your trust,

346
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,840
Gongsun Hao pretended to be devoted,
promising to take you away.

347
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,300
He even went so far as to stage
his own suicide to make you feel guilty.

348
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,540
To achieve his end,

349
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,600
he even killed his own father.

350
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,480
Gongsun Hao,

351
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,980
you monster!

352
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,740
Shut up!

353
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,150
Why didn't you kill him?

354
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,710
Why didn't you kill him?

355
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,980
Why didn't you kill him?

356
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,300
Why didn't you kill him?

357
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,260
Why didn't you kill him?

358
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,020
From now on,

359
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,280
I have no family left.

360
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,500
I have no family left!

361
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,500
Lian.

362
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,060
You actually believe him?

363
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,240
Do you know what he is?

364
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,900
He's a fox.

365
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,220
Foxes are the most cunning creatures.

366
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,460
You'd rather trust a fox

367
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,940
than your own kind!

368
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,960
Gongsun Hao.

369
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,040
Did you plan to use me
from the very first moment

370
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,960
you saw me?

371
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,180
I never meant to use you.

372
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,500
But I know full well

373
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,000
that you and I are not
the same kind of people.

374
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,900
What we see

375
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,540
is naturally different.

376
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,060
But all I see is you!

377
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,100
And what you see

378
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,080
is only wealth and glory.

379
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,360
It's not what you think,

380
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,080
Lian.

381
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,720
Be good.

382
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,640
Go back
to Prince Fuying's side obediently.

383
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,480
I promise you

384
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,680
I'll let our child

385
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,280
inherit the throne soon.

386
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,920
Then you can do whatever you want!

387
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,980
Is this okay, Lian?

388
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,940
Gongsun Hao.

389
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,540
So the one who hurt me the deepest

390
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,960
was you.

391
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,720
Why speak with such sorrow?

392
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,460
Isn't love about mutual sacrifice?

393
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,780
If you love me,

394
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,580
you should sacrifice for me too!

395
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,300
Then do you love me?

396
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,100
Of course I do.

397
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,600
It's precisely because I love you

398
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,730
that I want to give you a bright future.

399
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,940
Do you think you were the only one in pain

400
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,700
when Prince Fuying violated you,

401
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,020
when you married him,

402
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,550
and when he humiliated you?

403
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,660
My pain was worse

404
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,190
than yours beyond measure!

405
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,800
But what could I do?

406
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,940
I could do nothing.

407
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,140
I couldn't protect you.

408
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,860
So,

409
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,340
I had to do all these things.

410
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,480
For our future,

411
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,840
this was the price I had to pay.

412
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,020
You're right.

413
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,530
All these years,

414
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,480
you've suffered so much.

415
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,240
It's alright,

416
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,960
Lian.

417
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,400
For our future,

418
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,820
it was all worth it.

419
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,840
From now on,

420
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,090
you won't have to struggle
like that anymore.

421
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,940
Lian...

422
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,120
You killed your own child
with your own hands.

423
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,460
For the rest of your life,

424
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,260
you'll never get what you want.

425
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,800
Lian...

426
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,480
Huo Xiangjiu!

427
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,980
Feng Mochen!

428
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Guards!

429
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,740
Huo Xiangjiu and Feng Mochen
killed the Princess Consort!

430
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,740
Guards!

431
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,680
Huo Xiangjiu

432
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,210
and Feng Mochen
killed the Princess Consort.

433
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,780
My child...

434
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,920
Feng Mochen!

435
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,740
Huo Xiangjiu!

436
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,180
They meant to end my bloodline!

437
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,060
Feng Mochen

438
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,540
also killed my father.

439
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,020
Utterly evil!

440
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,820
Lian...

441
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,300
They are truly vile.

442
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,560
I have never seen

443
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,780
such vicious people.

444
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,840
If not for His Majesty

445
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,780
always favoring that demon,

446
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,780
how could we have ended up like this?

447
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,620
Feng Mochen is a fox demon in human form.

448
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,260
He must have bewitched His Majesty!

449
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,590
That's why His Majesty favors him so much.

450
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,600
You're right.

451
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,240
Feng Mochen

452
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,120
is a demon.

453
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,320
Father must have been bewitched by him.

454
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,300
Now,

455
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,630
half of the imperial guards in the palace
are under our control.

456
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,520
Gongsun Hao!

457
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,840
Yes!

458
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,400
You shall accompany me

459
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,160
in ushering in a brand-new

460
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,540
prosperous era for our state.

461
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,880
Yes.

462
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,880
Gongsun Hao!

463
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,480
How dare you come here again!

464
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,480
You ran off with my sister

465
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,580
and cut off my source of wealth!

466
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,100
You!

467
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,300
Your source of wealth

468
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,660
was already cut off
by Huo Xiangjiu and Feng Mochen.

469
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,640
How could that be?

470
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,620
Your sister

471
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,540
is dead.

472
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,140
Your sister was killed
by Huo Xiangjiu and Feng Mochen.

473
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,620
Huo Xiangjiu...

474
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,580
Feng Mochen...

475
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,240
They...

476
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,980
Damn them!

477
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,540
Do you want revenge?

478
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,300
Damn Huo Xiangjiu!

479
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,080
I'll kill your entire family!

480
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,960
Your Majesty,

481
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,780
it's absolutely true.

482
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,720
I've verified it myself.

483
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,140
I am the one to blame.

484
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,820
She saved me,

485
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,480
yet I brought her to ruin.

486
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,460
Your Majesty,

487
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,480
you must not blame yourself.

488
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,920
You arranged her marriage,

489
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,320
only because you wanted her
to live in glory and wealth.

490
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,780
That is merely self-deception.

491
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,600
She was right.

492
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,560
If she had been my daughter,

493
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,960
how could I have let her
marry such a person?

494
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,600
Truth be told,

495
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,960
it was my own selfishness.

496
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,240
Gongsun Hao!

497
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,900
This is Ganquan Palace.

498
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,480
Who gave you permission to enter?

499
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,040
Chief Steward Sun, please forgive us.

500
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,280
Feng Mochen and Huo Xiangjiu

501
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,580
killed the Princess Consort.

502
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,880
To prevent His Majesty
from being harmed,

503
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,940
His Highness specially sent us
to protect His Majesty.

504
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,040
Mochen would never do such a thing.

505
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Summon Prince Fuying at once.

506
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,900
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

507
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,720
His Highness

508
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,120
is busy apprehending Huo Xiangjiu
and Feng Mochen.

509
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,760
Later,

510
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,720
he will come to pay his respects
to Your Majesty.

511
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,920
Where's your father?

512
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,440
Summon your father at once!

513
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,600
Your Majesty,

514
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,600
my father

515
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,290
was also killed by Feng Mochen.

516
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,980
You were the one
who found your father's body?

517
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,420
Yes.

518
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,340
And you were also the one who found

519
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,380
the Princess Consort's body?

520
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,140
Yes.

521
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,220
I've...

522
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,700
misjudged.

523
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,300
Gongsun Hao,

524
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,540
you are the one who's truly ruthless.

525
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,840
Xiangjiu!

526
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,280
Wily Fox!

527
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,760
Xiangjiu!

528
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,080
Le Ning,

529
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,080
do you know
where Xiangjiu and Wily Fox went?

530
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,810
I don't know.

531
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,600
What's wrong?

532
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,660
Search this place!

533
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,700
Find and seize Feng Mochen
and Huo Xiangjiu!

534
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,360
-Yes!
-Yes!

535
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,500
Hurry!

536
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,620
Come with me!

537
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,440
Where are we?

538
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,330
The Illusory Flower Woods.

539
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,940
This should be a barrier realm
established by Feng Mochen.

540
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,960
Master!

541
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,470
What is going on?

542
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,720
I want to bury my father

543
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,820
here.

544
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,370
It was Gongsun Hao's doing.

545
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,480
He killed Xiangjiu's father,
the Princess Consort,

546
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,720
and Gongsun Wugui.

547
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,120
Oh my God!

548
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,500
Xiangjiu.

549
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,040
Bai Yu.

550
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,510
Gongsun Hao used the magic
of your Bai Clan of Bronze County.

551
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,220
He's from your Bai Clan of Bronze County?

552
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,060
That's impossible.

553
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,020
I don't know him.

554
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,520
Wait.

555
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,700
I remember now.

556
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
When I was a child,

557
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,150
my father did take on a final disciple.

558
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,070
He was a few years older than me.

559
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,700
My father praised his talent every day,

560
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,880
while scolding me for being useless.

561
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,420
He studied under my father
for perhaps 2 or 3 years,

562
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,350
and then he left.

563
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Could that disciple be Gongsun Hao?

564
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,000
If it's truly him,

565
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,860
he's a total disgrace to our clan.

566
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,400
Xiangjiu.

567
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,580
Don't worry,

568
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,350
I will definitely avenge your father.

569
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,440
Gongsun Hao...

570
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,600
Junior,

571
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,520
finally I can call you that openly.

572
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,720
Don't call me Junior.

573
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,800
You're a disgrace
to the Bai Clan of Bronze County.

574
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,620
If my father had known
that he had taken in a scoundrel like you,

575
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,620
he would never have rested in peace!

576
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,760
You...

577
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,700
are the scoundrel.

578
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,440
You're the disgrace
to the Bai Clan of Bronze County!

579
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,940
There's a blood feud between Feng Mochen
and the Bai Clan of Bronze County.

580
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,120
You stayed by his side for so long,

581
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,720
yet you failed to subdue him.

582
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,140
You're the worthless one.

583
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,320
Do you know why your father
took me as his disciple?

584
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,000
Because he knew

585
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,360
that the reputation
of the Bai Clan of Bronze County

586
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,320
would one day be ruined by you.

587
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,480
But I'm different.

588
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,040
I will surely subdue Feng Mochen,

589
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,420
fulfill your father's final wish,

590
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,140
and bring glory

591
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,480
to the Bai Clan of Bronze County.

592
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,920
You?

593
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,040
Look at you!

594
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,840
Look at how incompetent you are!

595
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,850
If your father saw this,

596
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,040
how heartbroken he would be.

597
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,820
Junior,

598
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,620
don't say I didn't give you a chance.

599
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,700
I've searched the entire palace,

600
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,560
but found no trace of Feng Mochen.

601
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,470
He must have hidden himself
inside a barrier.

602
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,740
Tell me

603
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,150
the incantation for that barrier.

604
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,480
I know you like Huo Xiangjiu.

605
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,440
Let's join forces

606
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,380
and eliminate Feng Mochen together.

607
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,640
I'll send Huo Xiangjiu to you,
and she'll be safe and sound.

608
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,780
Once I hold power,

609
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,260
I'll posthumously confer the title
of Imperial Advisor on your father.

610
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,320
When that time comes,

611
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,400
the glory of the Bai Clan of Bronze County

612
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,820
will be brought to its zenith

613
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,120
by you.

614
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,239
Bai Yu,

615
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,600
you tried hard to prove to the ancestors
of the Bai Clan of Bronze County

616
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,929
that you were not a disgrace
to the family,

617
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,400
but rather

618
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,840
the glory of the Bai Clan

619
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,320
of Bronze County.

620
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,900
You've helped so many people,

621
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,780
yet this is how you end up.

622
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,179
You once said good deeds
would bring good fortune.

623
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,500
Can I still believe that?

624
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,380
Is that all it takes

625
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,160
for your belief to crumble?

626
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,020
Is that not enough?

627
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,780
My father is dead.

628
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,080
He died helping people
who meant nothing to him.

629
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,340
And those who caused his death

630
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,660
still live in glory and wealth.

631
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,380
You were right before.

632
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,980
The deaths and sufferings of others

633
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,180
have nothing to do with us.

634
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,440
We should just be selfish.

635
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,790
We should just be indifferent.

636
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,340
People choose
to be selfish and indifferent,

637
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,400
because it's the easiest thing to do.

638
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,620
But helping those in need

639
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,000
requires tremendous courage.

640
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,040
I've lived for a thousand years.

641
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,000
I have indeed seen good people in misery

642
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,760
and evil ones in prosperity.

643
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,820
But this is absolutely not
the Way of Heaven.

644
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,060
Out of a hundred good people,

645
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,400
if one suffers miserably,

646
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,310
people say good deeds bring no reward.

647
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,460
Out of a hundred evil people,

648
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,800
if one lives in prosperity,

649
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,570
people say evil people have a good end.

650
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,640
We cannot draw such a careless conclusion
about the rule of life.

651
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
A good person meeting misfortune
is an exception.

652
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,940
An evil person having a good end
is also an exception.

653
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,070
We cannot take exceptions as the rule.

654
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,040
Nor can we take them as our creed!

655
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,620
As long as sunlight

656
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,500
still shines upon this vast land
for even one day,

657
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,130
the Way of Heaven

658
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,840
will never stand on the side of evil.

659
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
Old Fox,

660
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,750
the Way of Heaven

661
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,020
is on our side, right?

662
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,980
I will show you

663
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,780
that evil people never come to a good end.

664
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,360
I will let you know

665
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,110
that what you and your father stood for

666
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,940
has always been right.

667
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,380
Old Fox.
