1
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,590
It's me, Seong-Jin.

2
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,910
A little surprised ?

3
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,760
At first i wanted to
talk you in person, but

4
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,770
seeing your face, would
break my resolve so ...

5
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,200
I‘m leaving again

6
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,030
to Berlin.

7
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,200
I don‘t know either.

8
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,233
Our relationship,

9
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:20,146
makes me insecure.

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,039
I don‘t understand you.

11
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,740
So I get angry,

12
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,320
be paranoid then
worry about it.

13
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,610
It torments me.

14
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,960
I'm so miserable right now.

15
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,870
As expected, I don't deserve to get married.

16
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,530
It sounds right.

17
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,080
I‘m a weirdo.

18
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,190
It‘s my fault.

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,170
Not yours.

20
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,320
So i will be the one who leaves.

21
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,630
The time we spent together.

22
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,350
I was truly happy.

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,910
So I hope, you can remember like that aswell.

24
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Goodbye.

25
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,850
Seong-Jin
Watch the video

26
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,060
The first movement, second section.

27
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
Get ready.

28
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,960
One, two, three.

29
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,560
Conductor.
Manager.

30
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,170
You look depressed.

31
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,290
Do I?

32
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,810
Anyway, I have to say
something about work.

33
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,940
It‘s about the cellist.

34
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,510
We can‘t keep practicing
with an empty seat, can we?

35
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,920
Ensemble balance isn't working.

36
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,880
Everyone pretending like it's okay
but you can tell from their glances.

37
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,659
I know, we should
wait for Soo-Yeon to return.

38
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,429
But there‘s been a
lot of whispering behind.

39
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,660
I thought you should at least know about it.

40
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,710
I‘ll handle it as soon as possible.

41
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,610
Understood? good.

42
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,060
Geisha Coffee.

43
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,030
Take a sip.

44
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Okay.

45
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,320
It's the twelfth day.

46
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,840
Yeah, almost.

47
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,760
I‘m certain she didn‘t go to Berlin.

48
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,020
She left her cello too

49
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,329
and barely took any clothes.

50
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,590
Don‘t worry too much.

51
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,240
She‘ll come back.

52
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,020
Rumbling nonsense.

53
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Acting like a mad.

54
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,780
She believes as long as she behaves
like that she can do whatever.

55
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,420
I‘m sorry.

56
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:49,000
What are you apologizing for?

57
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,170
She‘s probably stuck in some hotel
enjoying room service right now.

58
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,280
It‘s my fault for not disciplining her.

59
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,980
I‘ve spoiled her, which led to this...

60
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,800
Or maybe I did discipline her,

61
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,610
but she ended up just like me.

62
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
Either way, it‘s my fault.

63
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,760
No it's mine.

64
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,350
By the way,

65
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,120
a cellist is coming for an audition today.

66
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,990
She‘s probably waiting in your office now.

67
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,330
A cellist?

68
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,720
Yes, looks like she contacted
her junior to fill in vacant spot.

69
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,970
She at least has some conscience.

70
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,940
But shouldn‘t we wait for few more days?

71
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,150
Should we?

72
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,519
If she comes back suddenly
and finds her position replaced,

73
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,100
she might feel very hurt.

74
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,750
Sweety,

75
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,350
I heard you told the manager
we can‘t wait any longer.

76
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,590
That we need a substitute.

77
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,700
Orchestra was out of sync.

78
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,870
I think you‘re right. After
all, you‘re the conductor.

79
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,710
However, that doesn't mean i like hearing

80
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,550
this things from other people.

81
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,090
Director.

82
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,970
- Well…
- Go to the audition.

83
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,740
Your resume ?

84
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,540
Yes.

85
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,879
I heard you‘re Soo-Yeon ‘s junior,

86
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,500
but you didn‘t attend the same school.

87
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,480
We had the same teacher,
Professor Park Hyun-seong.

88
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,049
And when I was preparing
for the entrance exam,

89
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,610
Soo-Yeon was an assistant at the school.

90
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,910
She told me there was an opening
here and suggested I apply.

91
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,200
Did she tell you anything else?

92
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,120
I just got her call suddenly,
so I‘m a bit confused.

93
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,270
Should I not have come?

94
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,450
No.

95
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,810
Let‘s hear you play.

96
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,699
Actually, my cello was acting
up a little bit today.

97
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,159
If possible, could you listen
what i recorded for now?

98
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,650
Okay.

99
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,310
Schubert‘s Arpeggione Sonata.

100
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,350
Did you just randomly choose
a favorite piece to record?

101
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,899
What do you mean by that?

102
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Well.

103
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,330
How can you apply with such a simple piece?

104
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,030
I love Schubert the most.

105
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,760
Because his music is the saddest.

106
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,100
When I listen to sorrowful music,

107
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,230
I don‘t feel as sad myself.

108
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,500
So I really like him.

109
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,609
I‘ll leave my resume here.

110
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,050
Please throw it in the trash for me.

111
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,919
I‘ll leave the USB too.

112
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,559
You can clear its memory
or use it for something else.

113
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,730
Or just throw it away.

114
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,800
Anyway, it was nice meeting you, Conductor.

115
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,760
I love Schubert the most.

116
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,480
Because his music is the saddest.

117
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,690
Do you need something?

118
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,610
Ah,

119
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,440
Saw here in your profile.

120
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,360
I hope it's not weird.

121
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,860
Well.

122
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,280
I was too rude earlier today.

123
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,870
I was upset about something else,

124
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,080
and I took it out on you.

125
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,670
I came to apologize.

126
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,420
I‘m sorry.

127
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,090
Okay.

128
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,300
I understand.

129
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,710
Your performance.

130
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,130
I really liked it too.

131
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
Please join our orchestra.

132
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,350
Really?

133
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,060
This

134
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,560
for me,

135
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,310
is definitely a good thing.

136
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,950
It's Schubert.

137
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,370
Yes, that's right.

138
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,870
It's Schubert.

139
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,000
It's the piece for our performance.

140
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,220
Everything else is more or less ready.

141
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,710
Please practice and come over.

142
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Ah.

143
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,350
Also, actually,

144
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,930
I like Schubert the most too.

145
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,140
The reason?

146
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,440
Same as yours.

147
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,500
Ah, well...

148
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,500
First of all,

149
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,080
it feels really cheap.

150
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,630
When the sounds mixed together,

151
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,130
difference becomes very noticeable.

152
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,760
You know this too, conductor.

153
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,180
Although she has done
quite a bit of practice.

154
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,220
She's still very unpolished.

155
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,850
This rehearsal
really needs Soo-Yeon.

156
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,890
Concert

157
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,140
has to wait for Soo-Yeon.

158
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,109
What did you think of that person's

159
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,110
performance today?

160
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,610
Today was the first one so.

161
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,780
We need to see more.

162
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,870
But at least

163
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,080
there should be some
kind of intuition, right?

164
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Or perhaps, a feeling.

165
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,500
You could say she's
someone who works very hard.

166
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,460
Given her practice time, her level
of completion exceeded my expectations.

167
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,430
Her attitude is also very good.

168
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
So, you're saying

169
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,480
there's nothing to complain
about as a conductor.

170
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,520
Exactly.

171
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,900
He is saying,

172
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,530
it‘s just acceptable
as a replacement, right?

173
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,216
That‘s what you mean, isn‘t it?

174
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Isn‘t it?

175
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,150
Isn‘t it?

176
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,120
Conductor himself said he was satisfied.
Why are you keep assuming things?

177
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,006
Didn't he say she's hardworking
and has a good attitude?

178
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,410
Isn't that more than enough?

179
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,810
She doesn't need to come.

180
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,910
That crazy girl.

181
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,130
It used to happen often.

182
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,469
If I tried a few more
times, I could start it.

183
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,180
But now, it won't ignite at all.

184
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,010
Alright.

185
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,480
This is Goyang City.

186
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,480
What?

187
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,230
Can you come quickly?

188
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,740
What happened to the car?

189
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,360
It broke down.

190
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,490
Are you off work?

191
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,950
Yes.

192
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,640
The cello looks so small.

193
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,100
It seemed so big in the backseat of my car.

194
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,980
But at least.

195
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,150
It can fit your backseat.

196
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,950
When did you see it?

197
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Ah.

198
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,320
That day...

199
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,756
The day you came for the interview.

200
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,490
I happened to see it from the window.

201
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,410
Really?

202
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,750
It‘s a bit embarrassing.

203
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,830
Well.

204
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,500
Want to grab dinner?

205
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,220
I would love it.

206
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,190
But I also enjoy grilling meat myself.

207
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,310
I used to avoid touching the tongs.

208
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,480
It made me feel insecure.

209
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,820
Insecure?

210
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,940
I‘m the son of a diner owner.

211
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,410
If I grill too well,

212
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,060
people will say, "No wonder
he's the son of a diner owner."

213
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,220
It's raining.

214
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,800
Oh no, we don't have an umbrella.

215
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,890
But it's nice that it's raining.

216
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,490
By the way,

217
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,990
I heard from other members that
something happened between you two.

218
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Did you have a fight?

219
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,461
- They said the girl ran away from home.
- Can we not talk about this?

220
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,210
I don‘t really want to discuss it.

221
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
Okay.

222
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,760
Oh, right. I have something
I‘m insecure about too.

223
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
What is it?

224
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,260
I‘m an orphan.

225
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,810
When I was in high school,

226
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,640
my parents had an accident.

227
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,600
A car accident.

228
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,730
They passed away together.

229
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,980
My mom and dad,

230
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
both of them.

231
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,700
So I have insecurities
about being an orphan.

232
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,860
Cheers.

233
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,170
Thank you.

234
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,210
Alright, good work.

235
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,380
Alright, alright.

236
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,880
Let‘s go.

237
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,140
Should I sit in the back?

238
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,770
I‘m smaller than you.

239
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,810
No need, like i said.

240
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,150
Once the driver arrives,

241
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,610
we'll take you home first

242
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,950
drop you and cello off.

243
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,530
Then, I'll go and sit in the front anyways,
it makes sense right?

244
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,290
You‘ve said that five times already.

245
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Really?

246
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,970
Because it's raining,

247
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,510
you can hear every sound so clearly.

248
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,320
Ah, I still want to drink more.

249
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,550
The stores must all be closed by now.

250
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,460
Mi-joo.

251
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,670
Yes.

252
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,090
Let‘s go for another drink.

253
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,510
To where ?

254
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,310
My place ?

255
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,120
Actually, I don‘t understand
the taste of wine at all.

256
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,040
This wine must be good, right?

257
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,850
Honestly, I don‘t understand it either.

258
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,720
You don‘t have to agree with me.

259
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,200
You clearly know a lot about it.

260
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,180
I really don‘t. I just drink it like this.

261
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
And then I...

262
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,810
When it comes to detailed
descriptions of wine and coffee,

263
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,560
I despise it.

264
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,900
Like what?

265
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,570
Smells like the earth in August.

266
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,240
Something that‘s tasted the sun in May.

267
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,990
It‘s ridiculous.

268
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,990
Well then,

269
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,250
let‘s toast as people who
don‘t really understand.

270
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,030
This house is amazing.

271
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,380
I‘m completely drunk.

272
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,250
I always get drunk when I drink wine.

273
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,510
I feel dizzy. Even after washing
my face, it‘s still the same.

274
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,020
Drunk, rained on. I'm such a mess.

275
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,130
Don‘t do this.

276
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,380
In this room,

277
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,250
we shouldn't do in this room.

278
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,170
Don‘t do this.

279
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,590
How will I face her after this?

280
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,150
Wait a second.

281
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,770
I did that because I like you.

282
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,860
We shouldn't do it.

283
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,680
I heard it‘s made from the poop of
civet cats after they eat coffee beans.

284
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,640
Amazing, right?

285
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,350
Yeah.

286
00:25:46,351 --> 00:25:48,309
It‘s all about how you package it.

287
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,360
Even shit can be turn into something
desired and expensive.

288
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,359
It looks pretty decent, doesn‘t it?

289
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,440
The actual content doesn‘t really matter.

290
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,160
What matters is how others perceive it.

291
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,280
How you look is key.

292
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,870
That‘s why people need to
learn to package themselves.

293
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,460
People are also just a
product of packaging, right?

294
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,380
But...

295
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,970
Soo-Yeon ...

296
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,300
Don‘t you think it‘s weird?

297
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,270
I thought she was acting this way
because of your marriage.

298
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,190
But something is strange.

299
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,730
Do you know what‘s the weirdest thing is?

300
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,530
She‘s not using her card.

301
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,699
Soo-Yeon is the kind of person

302
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,820
who would use her card
even if it kills her.

303
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,330
But she hasn‘t been using it at all.

304
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,620
I think that‘s strange.

305
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:47,960
It‘s probably her way of
showing how angry she is.

306
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,630
Like she wants

307
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,090
to act as if she has
completely disappeared.

308
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,100
That‘s what it seems like, right?

309
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,260
I‘m starting to worry about her.

310
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,890
She‘s not someone with such strong resolve.

311
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,990
Yeah.

312
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,860
It rained a lot yesterday.

(Green Bubble) Sorry for not driving you in the morning

314
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,320
That wasn‘t my fault.

315
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:21,610
Everything else was my fault.

316
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,909
Drinking,

317
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,200
going to your place,

318
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,500
especially going into the bedroom.

319
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,210
To avoid making any more mistakes,

320
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,129
I won‘t reply to your messages anymore.

321
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,500
I hope you understand me.

325
00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:18,753
<i>Hello?</i>

326
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,380
<i>Hello?</i>

327
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,190
I'm a crazy bitch, aren't i?

328
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,030
I wasn‘t supposed to come here.

329
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,790
But I‘ve come here twice already.

330
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,340
You played the piano
and made me come here.

331
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,680
Twice, can you believe it?

332
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,890
In her bedroom.

333
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,130
What‘s wrong?

334
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,879
The shower only has hot water coming out.

335
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,999
- It‘s okay.
- Water? What happened?

336
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,920
It‘s really fine.

337
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:29,761
- Not a drop splashed on me.
- Are you alright?

338
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:30,970
You should go.

339
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,170
<b>Three months ago</b>

340
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,670
What the heck? So annoying.

341
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,170
I was planning to hug you at the gate.

342
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,520
Is there anything more urgent than me?

343
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,170
I don‘t know.

344
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,089
Seong-Jin , Mom said she couldn‘t come.

345
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,210
She just sent Uncle.

346
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,169
I‘ll ask Uncle to come here.

347
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,749
We‘ve got way too much luggage.

348
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,840
It‘s fine. No worries.

349
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,119
Seong-Jin , let‘s grab a hot Americano.

350
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,640
I smelled it,
and now I want some too.

351
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,330
Do we have to?

352
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,130
Uncle, it‘s me.

353
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,920
Please come to Gate 3.

354
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,130
Okay.

355
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,790
I wasn‘t expect you to see in the airport.

356
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,550
I was just bored and
came to drop off the keys.

357
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,210
Also, to welcome you.

358
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,670
Forget the welcome.

359
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,630
Didn‘t we agree to leave
the keys at the door?

360
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,630
Here you go.

361
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,420
About the renovation,

362
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,590
even though it‘s done,

363
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,670
- I‘m not sure if it suits your taste.
- Hey.

364
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,380
I kept watching the video
throughout the process.

365
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,919
I said it was fine while watching

366
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
and proceeded.

367
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,540
Of course, it‘s my style.

368
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,670
Why would you even think that?

369
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
Right.

370
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,290
The one thing I don‘t like

371
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,750
is you showing up at the airport like this.

372
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,490
Don‘t you think it‘s inappropriate?

373
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,470
You‘re right.

374
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,540
I appreciate it,
but gratitude is just gratitude.

375
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,240
What‘s not okay remains not okay.

376
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,210
Right?

377
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,010
Got it.

378
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,510
Coffee. Thanks.

379
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,130
Let‘s go.

380
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,090
Are you satisfied?

381
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:19,260
It‘s really nice.

382
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,710
Back in school when i was student

383
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,419
I‘d wonder why my teacher lived in

384
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,590
such a creepy house.

385
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,896
But as I got older,
I kept thinking about this place.

386
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,840
It‘s nice, isn‘t it?
Everything‘s been redone.

387
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,170
Do you like it?

388
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,920
Of course, I like it.

389
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,010
You can listen to loud music here.

390
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,170
There‘s a beautiful garden.

391
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,170
It‘s my dream house.

392
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,570
Dream achieved without much effort.

393
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,630
What‘s wrong?
Don‘t you like it?

394
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,260
I said I like it,
but I‘m a little nervous.

395
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,580
Can I really live here?

396
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,330
You‘ll need to get used to it.

397
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,670
What?

398
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,910
You‘ll do everything.

399
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,830
All the things that you‘ve never done.

400
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
Do you know why?

401
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,340
Seong-Jin.

402
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,500
You‘re a conductor.

403
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
A conductor.

404
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,670
For a conductor,
everything is meant to be.

405
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,840
For my mom,

406
00:35:36,841 --> 00:35:39,050
getting a house like this ready
is no big deal.

407
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,220
Don‘t feel burdened.

408
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,920
It‘s not a burden.

409
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,960
I‘m just not used to it.

410
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,980
Everything is natural for you, Seong-Jin.

411
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,310
Now you know, my dear conductor.

412
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,799
I went to a place once.

413
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
Was it nice?

414
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,130
The Han River is amazing.

415
00:36:01,131 --> 00:36:03,839
Jungle at the back, ocean in the front.

416
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,420
- Really?
- Yeah.

417
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,090
Beautiful.

418
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,430
Jungle at the back, ocean in the front.

419
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,090
Seong-Jin, see this.

420
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,169
Amazing.

421
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,260
Don't look at her bikini.

422
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,590
That's too...

423
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,210
- Too good, right?
- Seriously.

424
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,049
Five nights cost 30 million won.

425
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,129
It is expensive.

426
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,260
But it's worth it.

427
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,380
It's really beautiful?

428
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,060
Sis, you'll hold the ceremony
right after your performance, right?

429
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,700
Yes, but it's peak season then.

430
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,380
So the price will increase a bit more.

431
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,590
It's okay.

432
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,520
Wow, that's great.

433
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Sweety.

434
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,170
I can smoke here, right?

435
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,580
Yes, of course.

436
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,480
But why wash the dishes?

437
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,270
We don't have enough cups.

438
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,540
It really suits you.

439
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,910
By the way, have your mom
said anything after we met?

440
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,340
She was really happy.

441
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,470
She said you were very elegant.

442
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,480
She‘s glad I‘m marrying into a good family.

443
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,010
But after the meeting,

444
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,890
I got to know you again.

445
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,300
You really are a remarkable person.

446
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,790
Having that much determination

447
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,570
While being very clear
about your own goal.

448
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,549
I can tell you have put

449
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,640
so much effort into your image.

450
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,420
Why suddenly…

451
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,800
I really felt that way.

452
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,300
One really can tell, you managed to
improve yourself without any help.

453
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,640
I like you more now.

454
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,170
I was really worried about
the housewarming party.

455
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:07,350
But it's done really well.

456
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Right?

457
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,200
Did you like there?

458
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,050
There?

459
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,010
The resort we saw in the pictures.

460
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,310
I really like it.

461
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,840
Didn't we agree that you'd
handle those things yourself?

462
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,100
Honey, you're not in a good mood.

463
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
Maybe...

464
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,700
Is it because of what they said ?

465
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,310
What did they say?

466
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:39,469
I said I did the first move.

467
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,130
Everyone got surprised by that.

468
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,509
Everyone was thinking

469
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,549
it was you who approached me first…

470
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,990
I didn‘t have that intention at all.

471
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Alright.

472
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,840
Okay.

473
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,430
Then let‘s settle it there.

474
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
That resort.

475
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,180
Five nights, 30 million won.

476
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,850
Do you think it‘s expensive?

477
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,930
Anyway, mom is paying.

478
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,750
Also, Honey,

479
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:11,850
I really hate that atmosphere.

480
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,160
How should I put it?
It‘s that cheap, mocking atmosphere.

481
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,540
I like the best.

482
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,930
The most luxurious, the most cozy.
That‘s my preference.

483
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,330
The atmosphere with criticism
and sarcastic remarks ..

484
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,500
is what I hate the most.

485
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,140
Let‘s get rid of that, okay?

486
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,610
Okay, I got it.

487
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,800
You go ahead and sleep.

488
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,980
Kiss me before you leave?

489
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,410
Well.

490
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,010
- How is it?
- What?

491
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,080
Isn't it getting better?

492
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,190
I feel like you're much
more at ease now than before.

493
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,970
Can't you just give
a straightforward compliment?

494
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,390
Let‘s skip that.

495
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,500
Look at this.

496
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,070
<b>Performance Plan</b>

497
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:58,071
The planning department gave it to me.
We need to make a decision together.

498
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,500
They insist on opening
with "Unfinished Symphony."

499
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,600
Let‘s settle on that.

500
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,850
After that, it should be more lyrical.

501
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,030
This is the performance program
arranged by Venus this time.

502
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,630
I think it's quite good.

503
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,920
Of course, it will be very successful.

504
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,960
- The opening must go smoothly.
- Of course.

505
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,110
By the way, what were you talking
with that violinist ?

506
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
The violinist?

507
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,920
Weren't you talking to
her on stage just now?

508
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,810
You two looked so happy talking.

509
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,520
Did we?

510
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,800
The violinist reached out to you, and you
looked at her with such a kind expression.

511
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,510
Really?

512
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,826
She said her fingers become
weak and made her worry.

513
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,370
She said she often drops things.

514
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,280
I see.

515
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,290
What's wrong?

516
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,550
What?

517
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,680
You've changed since you came to Seoul.

518
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,040
How have I changed?

519
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:21,310
Not only are you kind to the violinist,
but you're also considerate to everyone.

520
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:25,040
Why am i getting different treatment?

521
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,480
What I do is either met
with sarcasm or indifference.

522
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,540
Why is that?

523
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,040
Well, let me say a few words too.

524
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,020
What do you want to say?

525
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,500
Why are you making me so embarrassed?

526
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,160
Who? Me?

527
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,090
Should you have a private meeting

528
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,380
in front of all the members?

529
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,390
Say something.

530
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,310
Do you really have to let everyone
know the conductor is just a puppet?

531
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,990
No, it's because

532
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,680
Mom discussed with me first
before planning to decide with you.

533
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,340
So does first discussion

534
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,350
really have to take place
when everyone is around?

535
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:21,810
Is it really that

536
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,080
embarrassing to you?

537
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,950
Should I be proud to
be treated like a puppet?

538
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,690
You‘re wearing a bracelet today.

539
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:12,320
I was too much at the airport last time.

540
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,680
I want to apologize to you.

541
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,280
That‘s understandable.

542
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,390
By the way, why didn‘t you
come to the housewarming party?

543
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,390
You didn‘t invite me.

544
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,030
Am I crazy?
I thought I invited you.

545
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,080
That's exactly your style.

546
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,210
You are indeed very straightforward.

547
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:45,670
That's great.

548
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,140
I‘m really going crazy because of Seong-Jin .

549
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,390
He‘s good-looking,
and as a conductor, he‘s famous.

550
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,890
Although his family is not well-off,
it doesn‘t matter.

551
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:59,740
But one thing bothers me.

552
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,690
What is it?

553
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:03,570
He doesn‘t seem to like me.

554
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:08,640
And you, enjoy that ?

555
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,730
Are you out of your mind?

556
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,990
But he can't not like me.

557
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,160
Even if I don't like him,
he still has to like me.

558
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,400
That's only natural.

559
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:20,570
How is that natural?

560
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,100
It is.

561
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,350
So, are you here to seek advice from me?

562
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,830
Mi-Joo.

563
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:48,440
Do you remember the day I
kissed you for the first time?

564
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,500
When was it?

565
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:01,210
In teacher's place
when we met secretly.

566
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:08,120
Since that day,
I haven‘t liked anyone else but you.

567
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,240
You feel the same, right?

568
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:24,230
Even though I‘m betraying you now...

569
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,020
Yes, I'm betraying you.

570
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,370
But I will never betray our memories.

571
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,530
I hope you understand that.

572
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,360
I understand.

573
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,240
Okay.

574
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,620
While interior being changed
you have been in the house, right ?

575
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,070
Yes.

576
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,870
That means you have the key.

577
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,610
So you decided to decorate like this.

578
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,390
It looks really good.

579
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:15,130
Well, what‘s the use
of a pretty house?

580
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,020
Without good relationship.

581
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,270
Come over here.

582
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,560
Did you bring the key?

583
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,390
OK.

584
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,410
Do we really have to go this far?

585
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,780
It makes me so angry.

586
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,570
I saved him.

587
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,660
I saved someone who had
no money and no decent job.

588
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,780
He doesn‘t even appreciate it and
dares to play hard to get with me.

589
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,550
Before marriage,
I must keep him in check.

590
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,000
If i keep play along.

591
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,280
He might take it for granted.

592
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,370
I hate that phrase the most.

593
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,160
What? Playing along?

594
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,410
Anyway...

595
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,210
I want to see what his
attitude is when I‘m not around.

596
00:49:17,466 --> 00:49:20,166
Where do we go in from?
Is it here?

597
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:21,910
Is it?

598
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,900
What are you doing?
Come over here.

599
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,130
Are you really going in?

600
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,160
Push it.

601
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,040
Open the door.

602
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,790
So cold.

603
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,120
Wow, this place hasn't changed at all.

604
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,330
Seeing me here again
reminds you old times, right?

605
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:50,960
It's a bit scary.

606
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,500
Fool, what are you afraid of?

607
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,270
I'm here.
What are you scared of?

608
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,100
From now on,

609
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,850
if I signal you with my chin,

610
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:08,370
come in and wait for me,

611
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,970
okay?

612
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,300
Like your subordinate.

613
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,770
Subordinate,

614
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,620
and slave.

615
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:21,850
You like me?

616
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,320
Yeah.

617
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,470
Then obey.

618
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,820
Understood?

619
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,550
Yes.

620
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,450
Kiss me.

621
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,620
What?

622
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,520
I thought you said you like me.

623
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,900
Okay, close your eyes.

624
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,350
Fine.

625
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:49,900
Closing my eyes.

626
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,520
As expected,

627
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,520
I don't deserve to get married.

628
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,120
It sounds right.

629
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,420
It‘s my fault..

630
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,120
Not yours.

631
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,520
So,

632
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,770
i will be the one who leaves.

633
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:32,220
The time we spent together.
I was truly happy.

634
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,750
Goodbye.

635
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,800
Sad, huh?

636
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:47,870
Yeah.

637
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,720
You really

638
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,145
won't know what to do
when you watch this video.

639
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,520
It's so sad.

640
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,730
<b>Seong-Jin watch the video</b>

641
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,820
Watch the video.

642
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,520
Is this one too much?

643
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,470
Forget it, it's cold.

644
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,250
But.

645
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,820
Is it Schubert?

646
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,250
Yeah.

647
00:53:14,251 --> 00:53:16,900
Oh, you have no idea
how stubborn he is.

648
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,420
He says Schubert's the saddest.

649
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:21,150
He says that's his favorite.

650
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,920
Right.

651
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,249
Gotta make it messy.

652
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,820
Like I left suddenly.

653
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:37,450
He says it makes him not sad
because Schubert is too sad.

654
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,100
Are you done packing?

655
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,820
Yeah.

656
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Okay.

657
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,750
So heavy.

658
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,370
Give me the key.

659
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,850
How long are you going to stay there?

660
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,670
I don't know. Three days, tops.

661
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,360
Because there's still practice,

662
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,330
and I'm losing weight in the process.

663
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,670
I'll get in.

664
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:22,850
Put the bookcase back.

665
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,150
Sis.

666
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,350
I'll head off.

667
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,470
Okay.

668
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,290
<b>No signal</b>

669
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:53,800
It's me, Seong-Jin.

670
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,520
A little surprised ?

671
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,170
I‘m leaving again

672
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,720
to Berlin.

673
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,000
I don‘t know either.

674
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,500
Our relationship,

675
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,850
makes me insecure.

676
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,300
I don‘t understand you.

677
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,420
So I get angry,

678
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,920
be paranoid then
worry about it.

679
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,750
Save me.

680
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,670
I'm sorry.

681
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,720
Let me go home, please.

682
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,150
Help.

683
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:25,170
So sad.

684
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,770
Let me see.

685
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:02,820
Seong-Jin, I'm here.

686
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,720
Seong-Jin, here.

687
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,120
Seong-Jin.

688
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,600
I'm here! Inside!

689
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,000
I'm locked.

690
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,050
Hey!

691
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,070
Seong-Jin!

692
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,300
I'm locked in here.

693
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,100
Seong-Jin.

694
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,500
I'm locked in here.

695
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:38,000
Seong-Jin, Seong-Jin!

696
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,000
Seong-Jin! Seong-Jin!

697
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,150
Shit.

698
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:55,050
What took you so long?

699
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,920
I thought it was locked up.
It gave me a fright.

700
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,970
Are you there?

701
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:10,850
How did you get in?

702
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:18,170
How did you get into my house?

703
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,880
I'm drunk.

704
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,220
Seong-Jin kept making me drink.

705
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,339
I told him I can't,

706
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,800
but he just couldn't let me go.

707
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,570
I think he's trying to get laid.

708
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:34,570
Are you out of your mind?

709
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,400
I changed the key.

710
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:42,220
I'm trying to get under your skin.

711
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,540
Are you mad?

712
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:48,200
Scared?

713
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,250
Want me to get you out?

714
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:11,940
Can you forgive me if I let you out?

715
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,770
Oh you are gonna forgive me.

716
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,480
Then i will do something that you can't forgive.

717
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:36,370
What?

718
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:39,740
What?

719
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,370
What's wrong...

720
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,200
Mi-joo.

721
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,340
I'm drunk.

722
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:02,400
I just can't drink wine.

723
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,050
What are you doing Mi-joo.

724
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:09,020
Stop, don't.

725
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,600
Mi-Joo.

726
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,450
We shouldn't.

727
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,400
Stop!

728
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:20,770
Don't!

729
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:24,310
Mi-Joo, don't you hate it
when people touch you?

730
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:26,570
Mi-Joo, please don't.

731
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,680
Don't touch...

732
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,250
Stop Mi-Joo!

733
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,250
No!

734
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,450
Good.

735
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:40,140
Well done.

736
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,110
It's fucking crazy.

737
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:53,310
Are you crazy.

738
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:55,850
Mi-joo.

739
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,400
No.

740
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,310
Stop!

741
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,000
Stop!

742
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,600
Stop! Don't do that!

743
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,820
Stop.

744
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,850
No, no!

745
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:22,430
<b>7 months ago</b>

746
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,360
I miss you

747
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:38,740
I thought you hated this place.

748
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:40,970
Why?

749
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,680
I was very strict

750
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:46,420
when you were training here.

751
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:51,020
It's thanks to you that
I'm able to live off my cello.

752
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,220
Of course I want Soo-Yeon
to buy this place.

753
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,850
Nothing changed here.

754
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:01,740
Yeah.

755
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:03,540
The bookshelves are really pretty.

756
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:07,480
Did you leave that in there too?

757
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:09,710
What?

758
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,080
You think I didn't know?

759
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:15,799
You two were go in there ..

760
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,620
I knew from the beginning.

761
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:20,340
Sorry.

762
01:06:20,341 --> 01:06:21,940
Don't be.

763
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:26,250
I thought it was just a kid's game,

764
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:29,000
I wasn't expecting
you would date for so long

765
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,800
and even look for a new house together.

766
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:36,650
What's the space in here for?

767
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,650
I was curious before.

768
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:45,850
My father did it when
he was building the house.

769
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,310
My father...

770
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:50,940
During the Japanese rule
era that bad unit, Unit 731,

771
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,600
he was the medical officer there,

772
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,140
so he did some bad things,

773
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,339
and just kept getting very upset,

774
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,510
always trying to hide.

775
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,380
After work, he would be in here

776
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,370
peeking at mom and us
sisters through the mirror

777
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:13,770
and would call in

778
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,200
to handcuff us.

779
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:18,050
Right.

780
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:21,370
You still have the
handcuffs in here, don't you?

781
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,280
What?

782
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,600
How's that?

783
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,200
I like it.

784
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:42,340
It's amazing. It's exciting.

785
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:45,020
I always wanted to try it.

786
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,850
Give me the key.

787
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,770
Hey, what are you doing?

788
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:05,110
Sister, bring it here and untie it for me.

789
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,510
What if I don't?

790
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:13,850
You will.

791
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,710
I trust you.

792
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:24,600
Trust me?

793
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:27,370
Yes.

794
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:30,340
Only you.

795
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:42,200
I won't.

796
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:47,910
Yes, you will.

797
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:51,819
I'm yours.

798
01:08:57,149 --> 01:08:59,029
She

799
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,399
Hello.

800
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:03,569
<i>It's me.</i>

801
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,595
<i>What's up?</i>

802
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,739
Finished.

803
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:08,140
I was gonna send you,
what i'm recording.

804
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,880
<i>Thank you.</i>

805
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,600
<i>I have to say something.</i>

806
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,600
What's it?

807
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:22,020
<i>To Seoul, do you know 
who i will go with.</i>

808
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,019
With who?

809
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,600
<i>A man.</i>

810
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,819
<i>Want to marry him.</i>

811
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:30,710
<i>I met him here.</i>

812
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,510
<i>We'll go back together.</i>

813
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:41,450
<i>What is the..
wow for?</i>

814
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,220
What about me?

815
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,000
<i>Yeah.</i>

816
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
<i>Yeah ?</i>

817
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,880
<i>Congratulate me.</i>

818
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,080
<i>I'm getting married.</i>

819
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:06,080
<i>And will live with a man.</i>

820
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:10,600
<i>To live a real life
that others recognize.</i>

821
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,800
Real life.

822
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,310
<i>It's real life.</i>

823
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,510
<i>From now on.</i>

824
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:19,200
Now is the time to start living.

825
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,480
So how about me?

826
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,000
I'm your fake life?

827
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,250
<i>Let's be honest, okay.</i>

828
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:41,675
<i>You are, there for me to get</i>
<i>pleasure and get off.</i>

829
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,031
<i>Tool.</i>

830
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:44,740
<i>You are just a tool</i>

831
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,970
<i>We both knew, don't we?</i>

832
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:50,740
<i>Let's end it nicely.</i>

833
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:54,770
<i>Also.</i>

834
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:13,030
I'm a crazy bitch, aren't i?

835
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:15,950
I wasn't supposed to come here.

836
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,750
But i've come here already twice.

837
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:09,216
When you are out.

838
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:13,447
Are you going to hand
me over to the police?

839
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,426
No.

840
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,560
I won't.

841
01:12:17,585 --> 01:12:20,215
No, it's not.
I'm the one who made the mistake.

842
01:12:20,572 --> 01:12:22,519
I will make sure you
will have no problem.

843
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,109
I won't take it seriously.
Please open the door.

844
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:26,360
Please... Open the door.

845
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:30,570
Yeah, well, there's
nothing I can say about that.

846
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,660
But...

847
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:42,000
I understood what you said.

848
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:46,210
About real life.

849
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:49,589
''The real'' isn't ''the real'' real,

850
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:52,340
it's what everyone thinks it is.

851
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:53,550
Right?

852
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:58,060
I got that.

853
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,560
Also.

854
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:03,400
It seems like I also need

855
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:07,860
that life.

856
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,320
What does that mean?

857
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:16,070
I'll have that man.

858
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:21,120
Let me have the real life.

859
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:25,170
What?

860
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:27,500
Sorry.

861
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:34,760
You are gonna stay there forever.

862
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,089
What are you doing?

863
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:37,090
Mi-Joo.

864
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,260
Mi-Joo, Mi-Joo!

865
01:13:38,261 --> 01:13:40,269
Mi-Joo, there's no such thing.

866
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:41,639
I'm sorry.

867
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,440
I was wrong.

868
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:58,990
What happened?

869
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,700
Hot water came
out of the nowhere.

870
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Water?
It's fine.

871
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:04,960
What's wrong.

872
01:14:04,961 --> 01:14:06,209
Don't worry.

873
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:07,210
I'm fine.

874
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:08,670
Okay.
Alright.

875
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:18,050
We can remove all the tiles

876
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,140
then depending on the pipe structure,

877
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,690
we can seal the original pipe
build a new one and

878
01:14:26,192 --> 01:14:28,219
connect rest to that,
which is quite a big project,

879
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,470
but it will be better that way.

880
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:34,780
But this house isn't a bomb shelter.

881
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:38,159
The walls are extra thick.

882
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:41,029
Here, here, and here.

883
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:42,289
There's someone here.

884
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:43,120
Hey.

885
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:44,290
Hey!

886
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,960
Seal off the original pipes?

887
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,460
No, no.

888
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:51,499
Looks like no other way.

889
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,629
When can we start?

890
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:54,670
Today, or now.

891
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:57,009
No, no.

892
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:58,129
No!

893
01:14:58,130 --> 01:14:59,130
No.

894
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:06,680
But can't you hear
the whimpering?

895
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:09,099
Whimpering.

896
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,770
No, no!

897
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,570
Oh, my God. I'm so scared.

898
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,910
Shit.

899
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:28,620
So creepy.

900
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:30,210
I'm heading off.

901
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:34,300
Seong-Jin, it's me, it's me.

902
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,090
So weird.

903
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,420
There's no immigration records,

904
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,930
so she hasn't been abroad,

905
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,559
no record of her bank card,

906
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,189
her cell phone's been turned off,

907
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:52,020
she hasn't contacted me once.

908
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,610
I'm her mom.

909
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,149
I know Soo-Yeon.

910
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:59,150
This isn't the kind of
thing Soo-Yeon would do.

911
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:00,660
Something must happened.

912
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:07,200
Her disappearing like this
it doesn't makes sense.

913
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:10,249
Right? Sweety.

914
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,460
Don't you think so?

915
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:13,330
Yeah.

916
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,300
So.

917
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:20,800
I called the police.

918
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,720
I should have called the police earlier.

919
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,100
Right.

920
01:16:27,101 --> 01:16:29,020
The police will be at
your house tomorrow.

921
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:30,980
My place?

922
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:33,650
Don't be irritated.

923
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,440
They're not doing this
because they suspect you,

924
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:40,530
they're just confirming it.

925
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:43,820
Anyway.

926
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,910
Are you suspicious of me now?

927
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:56,630
Suspicious?

928
01:16:57,630 --> 01:16:59,260
About what?

929
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:05,260
Ahh, He is searching
so half heartedly.

930
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:07,930
You are civil servant.

931
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,785
Half heartedly looking,

932
01:17:10,809 --> 01:17:11,880
for something

933
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:13,990
a buried body?

934
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:16,150
Well.

935
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,230
Don't take it personally.

936
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:21,070
We do what we're told.

937
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:23,489
In fact, while doing it,

938
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:25,740
watching how your expression
and reaction change

939
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:28,990
is one of our technique.

940
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:32,410
How's my reaction?

941
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:35,580
Clear.

942
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:37,170
Clean.

943
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,130
Pure.

944
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,180
Don't make fun of
me because it's small.

945
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:20,551
Is it because the place is
too small and you feel stuffy?

946
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,980
It's more comfy.

947
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:26,610
My place is too big.

948
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:32,070
I don't like it.

949
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,280
My place.

950
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:48,880
1117

951
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:51,930
What?

952
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,890
The password is 1117.

953
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:59,560
Why?

954
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:02,770
The password is the same
as Soo-Yeon's birthday.

955
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,820
Oh really?

956
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:11,860
I just, didn't change the password
when i moved in this place.

957
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:14,580
What a coincidence.

958
01:20:14,581 --> 01:20:15,790
It's her birthday?

959
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:20,210
I was never very good at these things.

960
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:34,970
Check this.

961
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:38,889
Director,
I've seen this a hundred times.

962
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:40,270
Check first.

963
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:44,360
Oh here.

964
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,690
Check the mirror behind Su-yeon.

965
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,030
A hand.

966
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,330
There was someone else.

967
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,999
I didn't see it before

968
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,520
because I only noticed Su-yeon's face,

969
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:06,290
but today I suddenly felt weird,

970
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:08,130
so I looked and

971
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:09,750
found a hand.

972
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:11,010
Can you see it?

973
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:14,340
Yes.

974
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:20,140
Someone was with her when she left.

975
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,560
What's up.

976
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,900
You miss me?

977
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:31,740
Yeah.

978
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,490
You're so romantic.

979
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:38,330
Don't ring the doorbell.
Just enter the code.

980
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:39,990
1117

981
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,510
No one's been particularly mean to me.

982
01:21:57,090 --> 01:22:00,260
Everyone's been very nice.

983
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:04,890
I've gotten to know the
cello group really well,

984
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,860
and last time I had
dinner with the manager.

985
01:22:09,610 --> 01:22:11,650
I was really impressed.

986
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,530
That's the way to lose your temper.
That's the way to be a leader.

987
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:18,030
I should learn from him.

988
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,870
Yeah. There's someone.

989
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,079
The conductor.

990
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,540
You know her.

991
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,089
It's only the winds that are wrong,

992
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:32,090
but she gets mad at the strings,

993
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:36,549
If it wasn't for her, we'd have a
really good orchestra atmosphere, right?

994
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:37,550
Yeah.

995
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,600
Are you not eating?

996
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:53,440
I have a question.

997
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:55,570
What?

998
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,400
You were with Soo-Yeon when
she ran away, weren't you?

999
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:03,370
What are you talking about?

1000
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:05,450
I saw your wrist in the mirror.

1001
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:09,210
The bracelet.

1002
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,790
Bracelet with blue stones

1003
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:14,340
you didn't wear it.

1004
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:18,130
Blue stones?

1005
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:33,770
This one?

1006
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:45,830
Yeah.

1007
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,000
I was in her room the day she ran away.

1008
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:57,920
So you've been lying all this time?

1009
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,179
You lied about Soo-Yeon
contacting you the day she left,

1010
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:02,340
about not knowing her well,

1011
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:04,680
and about coming to our house

1012
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:06,930
for the first time.

1013
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:10,190
Sorry.

1014
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:14,940
But can you not say it's your house?

1015
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:16,190
What?

1016
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:25,530
What's the reason?

1017
01:24:25,531 --> 01:24:26,691
What are you hiding?

1018
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:29,790
She wanted this.

1019
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:32,540
She asked me to help her
remodel the house, so I did.

1020
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:35,880
She said she wanted me to
help her run away, so I did.

1021
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:38,880
It was also because she
asked me to fill in for her.

1022
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:42,760
I just did what she told me to do.

1023
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:44,170
What are you talking about?

1024
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,800
Are you a gonna do
whatever she tells you to do?

1025
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:49,150
Do you have a will?

1026
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:51,480
Do I have a will?

1027
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:55,400
The only thing I've decided to do on my own

1028
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:57,650
was sleeping with you.

1029
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,530
Where is Soo-Yeon?

1030
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:08,410
You must know.

1031
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:10,290
I really don't.

1032
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,080
Stop lying.

1033
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:17,500
You two like each other, don't you?

1034
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:18,960
Like?

1035
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:25,260
I saw the photo.

1036
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,010
You two.

1037
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:31,270
What do you mean?

1038
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:36,020
It's like a child's joke,

1039
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:38,400
akin to a friendship pledge.

1040
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:40,570
Stop.

1041
01:25:42,990 --> 01:25:44,240
Tell me.

1042
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:46,120
Where is she?

1043
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:48,330
I don't know.

1044
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:54,040
Really. I don't know.

1045
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:13,520
I turned the water off.

1046
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,020
It's me.

1047
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,080
It's me.

1048
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:42,550
Turn on the water.

1049
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:44,920
Okay.

1050
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,040
Here.

1051
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:23,300
Soo-Yeon?

1052
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:31,510
Turn it off.

1053
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:46,240
Soo-Yeon, are you in this house?

1054
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:49,950
Are you locked up?

1055
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,619
I'm being held captive.
Get me out of here.

1056
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,580
Get me out of here, Seong-Jin.

1057
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:56,700
Soo-Yeon.

1058
01:27:58,460 --> 01:27:59,500
Are you there?

1059
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:01,330
Soo-Yeon...

1060
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:03,919
Seong-Jin, here.

1061
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,919
Right in front of you.

1062
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,470
Just here. Hey!

1063
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:20,390
I'm here!

1064
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,600
Soo-Yeon.

1065
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:24,650
Are you in？

1066
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:27,740
Yes! I am!

1067
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:38,040
You are there.

1068
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:40,830
Yes.

1069
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:04,650
Why?

1070
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:07,190
Oh.

1071
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:09,740
Don't go.

1072
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:18,620
What's wrong?

1073
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:22,660
What's wrong?

1074
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,880
So you saw it all there, too.

1075
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:33,010
Right?

1076
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:35,890
What I did with Mi-Joo.

1077
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:39,640
You saw it all.

1078
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:43,940
It doesn't matter.
Just get me out of here. I don't care.

1079
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,269
I don't care anymore.
Let me out of here.

1080
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:47,649
Help me.

1081
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:54,569
Mi-Joo came here because she knew about it.

1082
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:55,570
Right?

1083
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:59,490
To show you.

1084
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:02,660
Yeah?

1085
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:06,630
She knew you were watching.

1086
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,130
I don't care.

1087
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:12,339
Really, I don't.

1088
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,509
- Ah, fuck!
- It really doesn't matter.

1089
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:16,180
I won't take it in mind.

1090
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,930
You...

1091
01:30:18,970 --> 01:30:20,179
What's wrong?

1092
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:21,889
Please save me.

1093
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:23,309
Seong-Jin, help me.

1094
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:24,480
Please, help me.

1095
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:26,190
Please, please.

1096
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:30,270
Help me out.

1097
01:30:33,490 --> 01:30:35,860
Please get me out.

1098
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,870
It's her fault.

1099
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:44,460
She used me and then dumped me.

1100
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:46,310
And that's why you're imprisoning her?

1101
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,250
It's not me.

1102
01:30:49,330 --> 01:30:51,130
She walked in there.

1103
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:54,880
But something went wrong.

1104
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:58,890
I just didn't release her.

1105
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:02,619
That's the same.

1106
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:03,620
No.

1107
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,470
Imprison is crime.

1108
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:14,860
To get her out.

1109
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,120
I need the play along.

1110
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:21,020
I don't want to that for her anymore.

1111
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:27,430
She's a bitch.

1112
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,810
Only uses people,

1113
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:32,090
and dump them.

1114
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:35,820
So what are you going to do?

1115
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:38,119
Just lock her up?

1116
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,430
What if she dies from hunger?

1117
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:40,940
That's the point.

1118
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:43,060
There shouldn't be any food.

1119
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:46,950
Mi-Joo.

1120
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:49,110
This like murder, no.

1121
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:51,620
It is murder.

1122
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:53,930
What do you want me to do?

1123
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,390
Get her out.

1124
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:59,370
And say sorry, I'm kidding?

1125
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:02,530
She will say, it's okay,
I made mistakes.

1126
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,040
And that's it?

1127
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:05,759
But it's not right.

1128
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,240
You know her.

1129
01:32:07,650 --> 01:32:09,040
Not just me.

1130
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:12,200
She's gonna make us both accomplices

1131
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:16,300
and put us in jail together.

1132
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:18,710
That's why you came here, isn't it,

1133
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:20,699
because you're scared,

1134
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:24,100
or you'd have called the police
or a professional to save her.

1135
01:32:24,690 --> 01:32:25,740
Then what do you want?

1136
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,840
You're gonna keep her
in there until she dies?

1137
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,860
I don't know.

1138
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:45,120
Now that you know about it, I feel good.

1139
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:47,620
You make the decision.

1140
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:49,210
I'll follow it.

1141
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:50,890
No matter what.

1142
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,460
You won't forgive me.

1143
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:23,190
It's been really hard for
me to get here, damn it.

1144
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:31,600
The moment you come out,
you're gonna wipe me out.

1145
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:38,490
You're gonna crush me.

1146
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:42,660
Right.

1147
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,550
I'm guilty.

1148
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:49,570
Yeah.

1149
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:53,860
Shit.

1150
01:33:58,570 --> 01:33:59,740
But Soo-Yeon.

1151
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:02,300
You lied.

1152
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:04,950
You like women.

1153
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:08,610
Don't you?

1154
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:58,050
Wonderful, Wonderful.

1155
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:01,610
Wow, today's general
rehearsal was really good.

1156
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,120
We still need more work.

1157
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:05,320
Sit.

1158
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:10,660
But I think it's great.

1159
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:16,160
I thought today was the day of the show.

1160
01:35:16,970 --> 01:35:18,970
But why do you have such
a dark look on your face?

1161
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Me?

1162
01:35:23,410 --> 01:35:27,010
Are you hiding something?

1163
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:29,320
No.

1164
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:38,380
Have you heard anything about Soo-Yeon?

1165
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:42,830
No.

1166
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:44,710
Ah.

1167
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:50,640
You guys were just getting your act
together, and it's a real pain in the ass.

1168
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,580
Soo-Yeon

1169
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:55,980
left because she doesn't like you.

1170
01:35:56,770 --> 01:35:58,710
But as her mom, I'm hiring you.

1171
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:02,060
No, I gave you promotion.

1172
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:05,030
I don't think she'll come
back if we keep this up.

1173
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:06,960
A thought.

1174
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:11,760
If Su-yeon won't come back in this way,

1175
01:36:12,610 --> 01:36:15,010
how am I going to handle
my relationship with you?

1176
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:16,420
Frustrating.

1177
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:20,400
Right?

1178
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:24,710
It was supposed to be a fun day.

1179
01:36:45,230 --> 01:36:48,740
<b>Soo-Yeon(2)</b>

1180
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:53,870
<b>Soo-Yeon
...it's me</b>

1181
01:37:01,370 --> 01:37:03,580
<b>She
Are you happy without me?</b>

1182
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:13,849
What are you going to do?

1183
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:16,110
Mi-Joo, don't worry.

1184
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:19,650
If she's gone, that means she's alive.
We haven't committed a serious crime.

1185
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:22,490
That's works for you.

1186
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,420
But.

1187
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:25,970
I've committed a great crime.

1188
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,820
That's better than killing someone.

1189
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:36,140
I checked.

1190
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:39,510
The keys are in my bag.
They're intact.

1191
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,140
I doubted you.

1192
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,240
What?

1193
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:46,860
Yeah.

1194
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,230
I mean.

1195
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,500
Let's just

1196
01:37:54,190 --> 01:37:55,330
wait and see.

1197
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,180
It's not an easy place to get out.

1198
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:02,209
Calm down.

1199
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,210
No.

1200
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,240
Open it.

1201
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,430
Or I'll call the police.

1202
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:24,089
The conductor suddenly had an emergency

1203
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:25,770
and had to cancel the afternoon rehearsal.

1204
01:38:26,630 --> 01:38:27,730
And, cellist Kim Mi-Joo,

1205
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:30,249
has gone to the hospital

1206
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:32,830
because she's not feeling well.

1207
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:34,430
That's all.

1208
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:37,410
Off you go.

1209
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,520
So scary.

1210
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,500
What was it?

1211
01:38:45,470 --> 01:38:46,480
After reading the text,

1212
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:49,460
he'll come running to this room
if he hasn't committed a crime,

1213
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:51,040
or leave early if he has.

1214
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:53,130
Wow.

1215
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:55,639
So an agent can open the same phone number

1216
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,399
as long as they have a copy

1217
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,800
of their ID card.

1218
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:02,150
They must have never dreamed

1219
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:04,750
of falling into a trap.

1220
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:10,550
I'm... scared.

1221
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:13,860
What have they done?

1222
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:15,860
I'm so scared.

1223
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,150
Is this the enter?

1224
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,590
Behind here is the secret room.

1225
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,660
How do you open this?

1226
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:30,880
Seong-Jin.

1227
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:33,540
There's no way out of here.

1228
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:36,960
How do you open it?

1229
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:39,030
I told you there's no way out of here.

1230
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:40,240
Mi-Joo.

1231
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:09,270
Soo-Yeon.

1232
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:12,920
Soo-Yeon, are you okay?

1233
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:15,760
See?

1234
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:18,790
There's no easy way out of here.

1235
01:41:21,860 --> 01:41:23,730
What the hell was that text message about?

1236
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:31,530
Soo-Yeon.

1237
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:37,740
Are you alright?

1238
01:41:40,690 --> 01:41:41,690
She's alive.

1239
01:41:45,370 --> 01:41:46,370
Soo-Yeon.

1240
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:51,170
Wake up.

1241
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:55,680
Su-yeon.

1242
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:56,730
Soo-Yeon, enough.

1243
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:59,100
Soo-Yeon, enough.

1244
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:02,260
She lost her mind.

1245
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:03,020
She's crazy.

1246
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:04,730
- Let go of me.
- Let's get out of here.

1247
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:05,790
- She's crazy.
- Let go of me.

1248
01:42:05,791 --> 01:42:07,129
Seong-Jin, let's get out of here.

1249
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:08,800
- Let go of me.
- She's out of her mind.

1250
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:10,850
- Let's get out of here.
- Let go of me.

1251
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:12,300
Let me go.

1252
01:42:16,570 --> 01:42:17,570
Soo-Yeon .

1253
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:28,250
Get up.

1254
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:30,850
Are you okay?

1255
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:33,740
Let's go out, Seong-Jin.

1256
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:35,510
Let's move.

1257
01:42:57,670 --> 01:42:59,720
Get some rest. Eat something.

1258
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:02,060
I'm going to the police.

1259
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:04,020
No need.

1260
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:08,880
Don't.

1261
01:43:11,330 --> 01:43:12,330
I'm hungry.

1262
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:14,710
Order some food.

1263
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:17,040
Kimchi soup.

1264
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:27,500
Okay.

1265
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:33,840
I'll take a shower first.

1266
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:37,310
I really want to take a shower.

1267
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:46,730
Help me take it off.

1268
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:17,970
Mi-Joo.

1269
01:44:20,490 --> 01:44:21,970
You are there.

1270
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,360
I'm gonna take a shower now.

1271
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:30,610
Hot shower.

1272
01:44:35,890 --> 01:44:36,890
Hey.

1273
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:39,020
Try being an idiot like me.

1274
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:40,510
You know.

1275
01:44:41,050 --> 01:44:42,070
I won't give you water.

1276
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:47,460
I'll tell you the rest

1277
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:50,170
when I've had a shower, Mi-Joo.

1278
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:54,990
Hey.

1279
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:56,700
Hey!

1280
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,250
I was worried when you never contacted me.

1281
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:13,040
I didn't expect you to show up
and give me the rest of the money.

1282
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:14,790
That's Shin Soo-Yeon.

1283
01:45:15,490 --> 01:45:17,090
How's Mi-Joo?

1284
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:18,860
Teacher

1285
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:20,520
You knew right?

1286
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:22,160
About you two?

1287
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,430
I'm the teacher.

1288
01:45:26,530 --> 01:45:27,890
I'm getting married with Seong-Jin.

1289
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:30,110
And our relationship has gotten weird.

1290
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:31,750
But.

1291
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:34,350
I'm still not going to break it off.

1292
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:38,130
I can't lose her.

1293
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:42,540
I used to look at you and think,

1294
01:45:44,010 --> 01:45:46,250
“No one can win her possessiveness."

1295
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:48,750
You got everything.

1296
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,500
My house is yours.

1297
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,230
Well, that's true.

1298
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:09,570
But.

1299
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:13,540
Did you say something bad

1300
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,630
about me to Mi-Joo,

1301
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:19,930
Like, I will use her
use and then throw away?

1302
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:25,270
I liked you before.

1303
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:37,880
Flowers are pretty.

1304
01:46:39,690 --> 01:46:40,690
And teacher,

1305
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:43,800
I really love your house.

1306
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:46,080
So much.

1307
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:47,680
Really.

1308
01:46:48,730 --> 01:46:50,450
It's a house that brings happiness.

1309
01:47:04,770 --> 01:47:12,110
<b>Alarm</b>

1310
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:38,820
Do you go golfing?

1311
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:42,420
I woke you up.

1312
01:47:42,730 --> 01:47:43,730
No.

1313
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:45,680
I gotta get up.

1314
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:50,090
Looks like you're totally into golf.

1315
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:52,690
It's fun.

1316
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:55,130
Mom,

1317
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:58,160
asks me to go next week.

1318
01:47:58,800 --> 01:47:59,800
I know.

1319
01:48:01,230 --> 01:48:01,870
Get more sleep.

1320
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:03,190
I'll be back.

1321
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:04,760
Have fun.

1322
01:48:52,090 --> 01:48:53,090
Locked up?

1323
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:07,600
Give me the key.

1324
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:48,800
You look pretty.

1325
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:03,610
Were you waiting for me?

1326
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:06,110
Yeah.

1327
01:50:17,690 --> 01:50:18,690
Take it off.

1328
01:50:58,104 --> 01:51:07,624
