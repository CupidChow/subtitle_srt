1
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,120
[Danger in Hair. Stay away from it.]

2
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,680
Wu Ke Ran.

3
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,720
Wu Ke Ran.

4
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,760
Wu Ke Ran.

5
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,960
It's a porridge.

6
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,720
Wu Ke Ran.

7
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,920
Captain Cao.

8
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,920
Captain Cao.

9
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,760
What's going on?

10
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,280
In order to investigate her father's case,

11
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,560
to investigate her father's case.

12
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,640
I'm afraid she'll be in danger.

13
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's look for her. Okay.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,480
Okay.

15
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,800
Marco Lu.

16
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,320
Evidence bag.

17
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,160
Here.

18
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,480
[It's dangerous. Stay away from it.]

19
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,640
This is Wu Ke Ran's phone.

20
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,280
Yes.

21
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,320
It should be when Wu Ke Ran was taking a shower.

22
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,040
when she was bathing.

23
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,160
and aroused suspicion.

24
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,320
Then the porridge found

25
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,839
Wu Ke Ran was Wu Fei's daughter.

26
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,839
So I kidnapped her.

27
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,880
Wu Ke Ran is now in danger.

28
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,720
in the restaurant.

29
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,079
And I found a cup

30
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,240
in the restaurant.

31
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,160
I guess

32
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
was taken away after being unconscious.

33
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,240
Now the porridge knows

34
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,440
Wu Ke Ran is Wu Fei's daughter.

35
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,040
I also know why she approached him.

36
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,120
Based on the character of porpoise,

37
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
it's very likely that

38
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,240
to Wu Fei's burial site.

39
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,600
and end everything there.

40
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,360
Marco Lu.

41
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Call Tao Zi.

42
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,600
Check the nearby surveillance cameras.

43
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
Let's go check it out.

44
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,520
Okay.

45
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,720
I'll take a shower.

46
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,600
Okay?

47
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,240
Go.

48
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,640
[It's dangerous. Stay away.]

49
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,320
What are you doing?

50
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,520
You crazy woman!

51
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,840
Let me go!

52
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,600
Where is my dad?

53
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,480
Where is your dad?

54
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,400
How would I know?

55
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,320
Go home and find it yourself.

56
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,080
My name is Wu Ke Ran.

57
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,760
My dad is Wu Fei.

58
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,800
Did you bury my dad here?

59
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,280
Why is it Wu Fei again?

60
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,160
The police asked me many times.

61
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,600
I know nothing.

62
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,440
When Wu Fei completed the mission,

63
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,960
after finishing the payment,

64
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,600
after the final payment.

65
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,440
What does it have to do with me

66
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,680
What does it have to do with me?

67
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,520
You're lying.

68
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,360
My dad would never kill someone for money.

69
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,159
It's been so long,

70
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,520
for so long,

71
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,920
But he has no trace of life.

72
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,280
There's no way he didn't contact me at all.

73
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,240
So it must be you.

74
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,720
You killed Jin Jie and my dad

75
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,960
you killed Jin Jie and my dad

76
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,800
and put the blame on my dad.

77
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,640
Am I right?

78
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,400
You're crazy.

79
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,560
How...

80
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,760
How can you imagine everything?

81
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,880
Don't force me.

82
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,600
Where did you bury my dad?

83
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,800
Tell me.

84
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,200
Where is my dad?

85
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,640
Tell me.

86
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,520
Put the knife down.

87
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,919
Untie the rope.

88
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,880
I'll take you there.

89
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,320
Why are you still here?

90
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,040
It's been too long.

91
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,680
I can't remember.

92
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,640
Don't play any tricks.

93
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,280
Let's go.

94
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Why don't you beg me?

95
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,880
Maybe I can remember.

96
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,760
Don't force me.

97
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,360
Or I...

98
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,560
Or what?

99
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,800
Kill me.

100
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,920
I'll die if you kill me.

101
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,600
Tell me where your dad is buried.

102
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,200
We're all dead.

103
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,280
What am I afraid of?

104
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,560
But if you kill me,

105
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,640
you will never know

106
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,520
where your dad is.

107
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,040
You became a murderer.

108
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,280
Your father will always be a murderer.

109
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,040
The body was buried in the ground.

110
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,640
and slowly devoured by bugs.

111
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,680
No.

112
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,800
My dad is not a murderer.

113
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,920
Don't say my dad is a murderer.

114
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
He's not a murderer.

115
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,480
Tell me now.

116
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,040
where you buried my dad.

117
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,080
Tell me now.

118
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,920
where to bury him.

119
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,720
Tell me.

120
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,000
Say something.

121
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,480
Speak.

122
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,720
Wu.

123
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,760
Get up.

124
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,920
Your daughter is here to see you.

125
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,040
Get up.

126
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes.

127
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,680
Dig like this.

128
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,360
Dig hard.

129
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,240
Wu.

130
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,000
I come alone every year.

131
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,560
Look who I brought here today.

132
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,040
Wu.

133
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,880
Shut up!

134
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,840
Wu Ke Ran.

135
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,960
Wu Ke Ran, dig!

136
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,360
Yes.

137
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,280
What if your dad

138
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,560
in there?

139
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,680
Just find a place and you'll believe it.

140
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,960
If you keep thinking like this,

141
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,520
I'll grant your wish.

142
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,160
It's Jiang Xun's car.

143
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,760
They really came here.

144
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
They should be nearby.

145
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,640
Search.

146
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,320
Wu Ke Ran.

147
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,400
Wu Kedye.

148
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,720
Wu Kedye.

149
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,320
Wu Kedye.

150
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,240
Wu Kedye.

151
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,400
Wu Kedye.

152
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,400
Wu Kedye.

153
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,280
Kedye.

154
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,640
I've been doing good deeds all my life.

155
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
I come here to see you every year.

156
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,080
I've fulfilled my merits.

157
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,000
I'll let you two reunite.

158
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,480
Why did you kill my dad?

159
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,840
Why?

160
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
Go down and ask him.

161
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,760
The flute.

162
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,240
You're a monster.

163
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,200
You'll get what you deserve.

164
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,800
So what?

165
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,480
You're just a dying prey.

166
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,960
The real prey is not me.

167
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,920
but you.

168
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,480
The flute.

169
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,760
Put down the knife.

170
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,200
Wu Ke Ran.

171
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,680
Wu Ke Ran.

172
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,640
Don't move.

173
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,920
Kedye.

174
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,680
Are you okay, Ke Ran?

175
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,040
The porpoise...

176
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,640
My dad.

177
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,520
My dad was buried here.

178
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,920
Who?

179
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,760
I'll go take a look.

180
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,440
Okay.

181
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,240
Abyss.

182
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,680
Abyss?

183
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,280
Who are you?

184
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
My dad was killed.

185
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
My mom went missing.

186
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,440
Was it you who killed Lu Zheng?

187
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,800
Did you kill Li Kun and Zhang Jianmin?

188
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,640
Do you want to know who I am

189
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,280
or the truth behind all the cases?

190
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,280
If you choose the former,

191
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,880
the latter will be forever sealed.

192
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,360
We'll meet again.

193
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,000
Abyss.

194
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,960
Abyss?

195
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,440
I almost caught him.

196
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,080
Are you sure who he is?

197
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,000
Abyss.

198
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,240
Captain Cao.

199
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,000
I found it.

200
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,880
All right.

201
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,760
Cao.

202
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,720
I'll get the result done as soon as possible.

203
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,120
Thank you.

204
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,720
Okay.

205
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
The forensic will take your blood sample back.

206
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,920
and compare the body we found.

207
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll tell you when the results are out.

208
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,400
Rest assured.

209
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,040
Leave the rest to us.

210
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,200
Captain Cao.

211
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,320
The DNA test results are out.

212
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,880
Yes.

213
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,280
The victim is Wu Fei.

214
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,560
Can we confirm the time of his death?

215
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,480
Wu Fei's body has been severely disintegrated.

216
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
The specific time of death

217
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,880
We need to check how active micro-biology is

218
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,560
to confirm.

219
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,080
We also found

220
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,360
Wu Fei's ID and phone.

221
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,720
Wu Fei's phone.

222
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,120
Can the data be recovered?

223
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,320
Yes.

224
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,760
There's no clue.

225
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,840
In this case,

226
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,800
other than the porridge who knows

227
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,720
Wu Fei's burial site,

228
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,600
there is no direct evidence that

229
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,240
that Jiang Ji killed Jin Jie and Wu Fei.

230
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,400
Let's interrogate them first.

231
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,080
What if we find a way out?

232
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,720
What about the missing persons case related to him?

233
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,360
There is no evidence

234
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,680
these two cases are related.

235
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,200
or two cases?

236
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,080
Let's look into it first.

237
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,560
We caught you red-handed.

238
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,440
Tell me.

239
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,160
How did you kill Jin Jie and Wu Fei?

240
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,480
and shift the blame to Wu Fei?

241
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,080
Please change another room for me.

242
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,120
A room with a bigger window.

243
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,560
The conditions are limited.

244
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,560
Please make do with it.

245
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,160
I’m also a victim.

246
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,280
The one who killed Wu Fei and Jin Jie

247
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
were Li Kun and Zhang Jianmin.

248
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,520
The two of them?

249
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,560
Yes.

250
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,800
15 years ago,

251
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,480
I've prepared 500,000 yuan

252
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,480
to redeem the list of our clients.

253
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,080
But because Jin Jie keeps changing his mind,

254
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,160
I wanted to take Li Guokun and Zhang Jianmin

255
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,240
to scare her.

256
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,920
I didn't expect Wu Fei to arrive before us.

257
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,120
Say it.

258
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,520
Pretend to be a troublemaker.

259
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,600
He has talked to Jin Jie.

260
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,560
As long as he pays the money in one go,

261
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,600
I promise I won’t blackmail the company again.

262
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,760
I didn't expect it was them.

263
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,600
colluded with each other.

264
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,720
I remember it was not

265
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,560
called Du Jun.

266
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,680
went to Wu Fei on behalf of the company to solve this.

267
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,560
How did it become their conspiracy?

268
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,120
You went to the scene?

269
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,520
Sir.

270
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,200
People like him

271
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,000
can do anything for money.

272
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,520
In the end, he still colluded with Jin Jie.

273
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,040
took the ransom money

274
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,280
and the commission.

275
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,720
Otherwise, Jin Jie

276
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,400
from the first 200,000

277
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,600
from the beginning?

278
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,480
I have no choice.

279
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,040
I have to clean up the mess for the company.

280
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,800
So,

281
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,080
you killed

282
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,640
Wu Fei and Jin Jie.

283
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,280
right?

284
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Don't talk nonsense.

285
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,360
I did give them money.

286
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,400
I went back to the car with the company's client's name.

287
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,040
I found

288
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,240
Li Guokun and Zhang Jianmin didn't follow us.

289
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,000
When I went back, I found that

290
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,520
they killed Wu Fei and Jin Jie.

291
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,880
They said as long as we get this done,

292
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,600
I'll give you the 500,000.

293
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,920
You even threatened me.

294
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,680
If I don't cooperate,

295
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,680
kill me too.

296
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,480
And then?

297
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,000
Then...

298
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,000
Zhang Jianmin.

299
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,720
wearing Wu Fei's clothes

300
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,040
and drove Wu Fei's car

301
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,960
with Wu Fei's car.

302
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,480
Li Guokun threatened me

303
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,360
to take care of Wu Fei's body.

304
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,640
How did you know

305
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
met each other?

306
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,120
When the company is busy,

307
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,280
when I'm busy.

308
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,160
15 years ago,

309
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,920
you transferred 50,000 yuan

310
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,840
to Zhang Jianmin.

311
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,800
What happened?

312
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,520
That money was the money

313
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,640
to get back the client list.

314
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,520
You have to be responsible

315
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,200
you have to take the main criminal responsibility.

316
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,480
What evidence do you have

317
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,880
that I hired a murderer?

318
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,280
What evidence do you have

319
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,320
that you didn't hire a murderer?

320
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,560
50,000 won won won't be enough.

321
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,760
What if it's deposit?

322
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,840
Cao Jin.

323
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,080
Do you have to

324
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,320
a murderer?

325
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,000
Okay.

326
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,680
If I have to be convicted,

327
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,320
it's just a cover-up.

328
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,280
and destroying evidence.

329
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,720
right?

330
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,280
If it's just a cover-up,

331
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,400
and destroying evidence,

332
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,920
Why when you found out

333
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,280
Wu Fei's biological daughter,

334
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,200
you wanted to kill me.

335
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,240
I almost died there.

336
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,640
Wu Ke Ran wanted to kill me.

337
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,160
I'm sorry.

338
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,200
She...

339
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,400
She insists that

340
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,560
I killed her father.

341
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,440
She approached me

342
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,040
and dragged me to the so-called corpse hideout

343
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
to avenge her father.

344
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,880
I almost died there.

345
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,160
You all saw it.

346
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,080
She forced me with a knife.

347
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,920
I'm just self-defense.

348
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,760
My lawyer will be here soon.

349
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,960
I won't let her off

350
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,520
I won't let her off.

351
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,560
Captain Cao.

352
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,760
He has been caught red-handed.

353
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,760
How could he put the blame on the dead?

354
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,440
Liu.

355
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,120
Han.

356
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Have a rest.

357
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,400
Okay, Captain Cao.

358
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,520
There is no direct evidence.

359
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,080
direct evidence.

360
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,840
It's been so many years.

361
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,240
where can we find direct evidence?

362
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,280
Wu Ke Ran took such a big risk

363
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,600
and pushed the case further.

364
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,720
What should we tell her?

365
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,240
The flute fits the conditions for the guarantor pending trial.

366
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,760
His lawyer is working on relevant procedures.

367
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,920
If it goes well, the result will come out in three days.

368
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,680
So we have less than three days

369
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,400
for less than three days.

370
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,400
We found something.

371
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,960
At least we've confirmed

372
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,040
between Li Guokun and Zhang Jianmin.

373
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,800
Both of them

374
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,840
are related to the naked corpse case in Kubei.

375
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,320
They all died in the abyss.

376
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,880
Ning Zhen.

377
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,360
You know what I mean, right?

378
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,080
I understand.

379
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,880
I was transferred here because of the naked body case in Kubei.

380
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,000
But the naked body case in Kubei

381
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
may be related to the abyss.

382
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,800
So Marco and I

383
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,680
should quit.

384
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,560
Captain Cao.

385
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,360
I can't quit.

386
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,520
I didn't say it's coming.

387
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,400
But...

388
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,720
let you

389
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,200
to be prepared.

390
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,960
If the abyss was really killed

391
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,640
because of the naked body case in the warehouse,

392
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,960
Then,

393
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,440
his real target

394
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,640
is the real murderer behind this case.

395
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,040
The flute has flowed out,

396
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,120
but he wasn't executed.

397
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,400
When he is released,

398
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,000
Tao Zi will keep an eye on him.

399
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,400
Once the abyss appears next to him,

400
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,600
and wait for the chance to take revenge,

401
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,000
Then we can be sure

402
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,600
the abyss is related to the naked corpse case in Kubei.

403
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,520
You have to leave then.

404
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,640
Before that,

405
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,160
you can do whatever you want.

406
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,440
Leave the rest

407
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:56,960
to me.

408
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,400
Marco Lu.

409
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,200
If we can catch the abyss because of this,

410
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,880
the result will be good.

411
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,320
Auntie.

412
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,000
How can I help you?

413
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,960
Officer,

414
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,120
I have something to tell you.

415
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,000
Nothing.

416
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,760
I was just passing by.

417
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,000
Any result?

418
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,440
Yes.

419
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,040
After DNA comparison,

420
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,440
we found

421
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,000
is your father, Wu Fei.

422
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,400
Where's the flute?

423
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,040
Did the porridge confess?

424
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,960
We don't have enough evidence.

425
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,720
We can't convict him.

426
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,320
and lack of evidence.

427
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,800
Wu Ke Ran.

428
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,160
The prosecution

429
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,120
The case of your kidnapping

430
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,880
in the investigation.

431
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,680
I didn't do anything.

432
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,360
I just want to know

433
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,680
where my dad was buried.

434
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Can't I do that?

435
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,680
He kidnapped me.

436
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,040
Why didn't you arrest him?

437
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,960
Trust me.

438
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,160
He kidnapped me.

439
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,440
Wu Ke Ran, we trust you.

440
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,560
You know that

441
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,680
it was all his doing.

442
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,560
Why didn't you arrest him?

443
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Why are you asking me here?

444
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,720
Why didn't you catch him?

445
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,400
Kedye.

446
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,160
It's proved that

447
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,000
your father

448
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,320
is not a murder suspect.

449
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,440
We'll look into the rest.

450
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,840
Get some rest.

451
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,480
My dad is not a murderer.

452
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,720
He's a cop.

453
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,400
He's a good cop.

454
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,960
Mom.

455
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
I'm here to see you.

456
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,160
[Fang Fei.]

457
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,840
You can finally reunite here.

458
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,760
Wait for me.

459
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,840
I will come to reunite with you.

460
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,360
Trust us.

461
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,720
We will do our best

462
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,320
to find out the truth

463
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,440
and bring the murderer to justice.

464
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
15 years.

465
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,440
It's been too long.

466
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,920
My dad was cleared of murder,

467
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,960
he wouldn’t

468
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,240
for money.

469
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,520
I really hope

470
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,680
without any stain.

471
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,960
Why is the murderer

472
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,520
is still at large?

473
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,320
When will he be executed?

474
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,440
Ke Ran.

475
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,440
I promise you

476
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,480
no matter what the truth is,

477
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
the police will find out.

478
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,080
Wu Ke Ran.

479
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,800
When I was the darkest,

480
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,680
a man told me this.

481
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,560
Don't always look down at the shadow under your feet.

482
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,160
Look up to the sun.

483
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,880
You have a long way to go.

484
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,000
Live well

485
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,600
to break the darkness.

486
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,240
Did the person who gave you the watch tell you?

487
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,720
But Uncle Lu is gone.

488
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,240
Ning Zhen.

489
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,280
It's you.

490
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,640
Fan Fan

491
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:57,920
It's you

492
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:58,800
right?

493
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,120
Answer me.

494
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,760
Yeongjin.

495
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:10,880
It's me.

496
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,880
I'm the little boy

497
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,000
who called the police.

498
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,560
Ning Zhen.

499
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,240
Cao Jin.

500
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,560
You kept it from me

501
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,200
Are you afraid I'll go crazy?

502
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,000
You're afraid I'll make a scene?

503
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,920
Do you think

504
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,560
I will blame my father

505
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,480
my father's death.

506
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,000
Really?

507
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,800
Am I not as unclear as you think?

508
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,280
Am I as fragile as you think?

509
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,080
I'm Lu Zheng's daughter.

510
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,840
I know what's wrong.

511
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,320
I'm a police officer.

512
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,120
We're trying to protect you.

513
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,600
We...

514
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,000
So from the beginning to now,

515
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,520
in your eyes,

516
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,600
in your eyes.

517
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,680
Protect.

518
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,080
I don't need it.

519
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:58,920
Marco Lu.

520
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,240
(Leave the rest to me.)

521
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,240
Wine.

522
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,240
Ms. Jiang.

523
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
Let’s go home.

524
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,880
My sister is back.

525
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,920
Ms. Jiang...

526
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,920
is coming back soon.

527
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,120
Still thinking about Marco Lu?

528
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,720
I should have told her earlier.

529
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,160
This has been in her heart for many years.

530
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,920
She needs some time to adjust it.

531
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,440
But back then,

532
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,040
I did call Uncle Lu

533
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,080
and asked him to come to me.

534
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,360
Even if it's not you,

535
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,120
another person,

536
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,440
my master would do the same.

537
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,239
He will go to the crime scene as soon as possible.

538
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,960
Because he's a police officer.

539
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,239
In the past,

540
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
they always laughed at me.

541
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,520
They said I was like a follower.

542
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,800
I always follow my master.

543
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,480
I'll go wherever he goes.

544
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,760
But on that day,

545
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,600
I didn't follow her.

546
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,280
My mom asked me to go on a blind date.

547
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,320
Then I thought

548
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,199
it would be great if I followed him.

549
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,000
My master would be fine.

550
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,240
So I'm still alone.

551
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,680
Scared?

552
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,880
Only when I solve the case,

553
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,800
I think my master is with me.

554
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,760
Every time I solve a case,

555
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,080
I feel less guilty towards him.

556
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
But all these years,

557
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,600
what I can't let go is

558
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,000
the day my master died.

559
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,000
There's no clue

560
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,560
for so many years.

561
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,320
Until you showed up,

562
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,680
the case had a new breakthrough.

563
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,320
How do you think a police officer

564
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,160
whether his choice is right or wrong?

565
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,360
A good cop.

566
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,120
It depends on whose interests you put first.

567
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,080
Some people

568
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,920
always

569
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,640
for the rest of my life.

570
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,360
Yeongjin.

571
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,440
Do you have something to tell me?

572
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,200
No.

573
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,440
Really.

574
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,120
You're smart.

575
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,520
and talented in solving cases.

576
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,520
and persistence.

577
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,200
You have a clear goal.

578
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,440
is to find out the truth

579
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,480
and the missing mother.

580
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,360
But have you ever thought

581
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,600
when you find out the truth

582
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,640
and your mother,

583
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,960
do you still have the motivation to be a police officer?

584
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,600
I never thought about that.

585
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,880
Think about it.

586
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,400
I don't know.

587
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,480
On the day your father was killed,

588
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,800
what were you thinking

589
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,480
in front of your father.

590
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,920
I don't know

591
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,920
how much my master's sacrifice affected you.

592
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,360
However,

593
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,880
I hope

594
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,040
you can make a good choice.

595
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,040
Abyss.

596
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,800
Who are you?

597
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,600
Do you want to know who I am

598
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,440
or the truth behind all the cases?

599
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,800
If you choose the former,

600
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,520
the latter will be forever sealed.

601
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,280
We'll meet again.
