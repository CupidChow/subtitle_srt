1
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,759
Captain Cao, Mo Bei kidnapped Lu Fan.

2
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,320
I'll send you the exact location.

3
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,440
Marco Lu, Ning Zhen.

4
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,840
You two must hold on.

5
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,600
Kid.

6
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,880
Are you okay?

7
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,880
I'm fine.

8
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,920
Kid.

9
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,760
Wait for me here.

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Uncle go in

11
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,560
If you don't come out in ten minutes,

12
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,520
call the police for me,

13
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Okay?

14
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,079
Nine.

15
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,880
595.

16
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,680
596.

17
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
597.

18
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,920
598.

19
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,240
599.

20
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,480
600.

21
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,840
Dad.

22
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,120
This time,

23
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
I'll make it through time.

24
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
Looks like he still has no choice

25
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,560
to save you.

26
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,960
He chose the right thing.

27
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,680
Marco Lu.

28
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,160
What are you doing here?

29
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,960
Mo Bei.

30
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,240
I've brought you what you want.

31
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,600
Let him go.

32
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,959
Hand him over.

33
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,839
Let him go first.

34
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,680
Who are you to bargain with me?

35
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,560
I've sent

36
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,600
in the USB.

37
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,280
If you don't let her go,

38
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,680
I'll post it.

39
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,280
You have no chance to upload it.

40
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,360
You can try.

41
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,520
Marco Lu.

42
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,200
Run!

43
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,440
Are you okay?

44
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,120
Marco Lu.

45
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,000
Leave me alone.

46
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,040
Cut the crap. Let's go.

47
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,280
Jiang Yan.

48
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Hello, officers.

49
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Are you done?

50
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,720
Yes.

51
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,800
There are only two left.

52
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,120
Hurry up.

53
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,480
Don't delay my meeting in the South District tomorrow morning.

54
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,280
I don't know what I've done to you.

55
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,680
and my family.

56
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Now you come to my company

57
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
in my company.

58
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,680
Stop acting.

59
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,920
All our cases are related to you.

60
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,920
What have you done?

61
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
It has something to do with me.

62
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,040
Where is the evidence?

63
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,520
Ning Zhen.

64
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,000
I investigated you.

65
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,560
So you are

66
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,440
the son of that cleaner.

67
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,680
has grown up.

68
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,160
I deeply regret

69
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,840
for your parents' death.

70
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,480
I came here to see you today.

71
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,080
Was my family case

72
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,520
related to you?

73
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,000
When Jin Jie stole my stuff,

74
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,360
not only did your mother not call the police,

75
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,200
but helped her escape.

76
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,400
I'm the victim.

77
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,960
As for your mother's death,

78
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,680
you shouldn't ask me.

79
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
You should ask the police.

80
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,600
You didn't find anything?

81
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,760
So...

82
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
you killed my mother.

83
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,039
Really?

84
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,320
Ask her later.

85
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,880
Jiang Yan.

86
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,880
Guys,

87
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,400
Tell me.

88
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,840
How do you want to go?

89
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,840
There are cameras all the way.

90
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,960
If we die,

91
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
you can't escape either.

92
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Why should I?

93
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,760
He's suspended.

94
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,640
Tomorrow's news will say

95
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,200
two policemen who were suspended

96
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,280
During the escape,

97
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,080
he was desperate.

98
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,880
The car was destroyed.

99
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,720
Mo Bei.

100
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Who did you kill for Jiang Yan?

101
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,320
What did you do?

102
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,680
You can't escape.

103
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,240
How should I put it?

104
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,200
You should know

105
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,120
Marco Lu.

106
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,400
Captain Cao.

107
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,040
Hurry. Split up.

108
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,200
Go after him.

109
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,120
He went that way.

110
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,880
Okay.

111
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,720
You two.

112
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,680
Come with me.

113
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,600
What are you two doing?

114
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,160
I'll arrest you.

115
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,080
And you.

116
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,920
Ning Zhen.

117
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,080
Why did you take the risk with Lu Fan?

118
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,680
Mo Bei burned the evidence of Jiang Yan's crime.

119
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,280
Let's find it first.

120
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,480
Let's restore the data first, okay?

121
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,960
What did you promise me?

122
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,840
Have you considered the consequences?

123
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,640
What are you doing, LICE?

124
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,520
What are you doing?

125
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,440
We almost lost our lives.

126
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,720
We almost died because of you.

127
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,440
What if we were one step late?

128
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,520
If anything happens to you,

129
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,840
if anything happens to you?

130
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,200
How should I explain to myself?

131
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,920
Sorry.

132
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,560
We need to restore the data first.

133
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,520
I've reported this to my superiors.

134
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,120
I agree with your plan.

135
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
But it's a secret.

136
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
We have other arrangements for Mo Bei.

137
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,320
Thank you, Captain Cao.

138
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,400
Lu Fan and I passed by Jiang's Group yesterday.

139
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,520
and they called the police.

140
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,920
They said they were robbed.

141
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,160
So we decided to help.

142
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,360
to catch thieves with Jiang's employees.

143
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,920
But we were kidnapped

144
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,760
we were kidnapped.

145
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,000
Fortunately, Jiang's employees are safe.

146
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
They have escaped.

147
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,920
Which employee are you talking about?

148
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,800
Mo Bei.

149
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,800
Do you remember how many robbers

150
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
look like?

151
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,240
We were all knocked out.

152
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,200
We don't know how many of them were there.

153
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,440
And they're all covered.

154
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,440
They can't see their faces.

155
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,520
We'll check with Jiang's Group.

156
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,640
Have a good rest.

157
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,080
Thank you.

158
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,120
Will Mo Bei...

159
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
I don't think Mo Bei wants any more trouble.

160
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,760
He'll keep it under control.

161
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,880
Here.

162
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,280
I made a copy of my phone card.

163
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,600
The number is the same as before.

164
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,640
Thank you.

165
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,440
Stop being dramatic.

166
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,600
I'll get some water.

167
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,840
Where is Jiang Yan?

168
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,480
How would I know?

169
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,800
It was so remote yesterday.

170
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,840
Only you and I know where Jiang Yan is.

171
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,440
Now she's missing.

172
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,280
Jiang Yan is missing.

173
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,160
Is there anyone else involved?

174
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,440
What are you doing to Jiang Yan?

175
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,960
Mo Bei.

176
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,640
I have nothing to do with Jiang Yan's disappearance.

177
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,920
I only know how to

178
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,280
to bring the criminal to justice.

179
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,440
Only the abyss can punish him.

180
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,360
Abyss?

181
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,600
How does the Abyss know the whereabouts of Jiang Yan?

182
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,160
Are you two in collusion?

183
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,840
The disappearance of Jiang Yan.

184
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,400
If it was really done by the abyss,

185
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,880
her situation would be in danger.

186
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,080
Instead of wasting your time here,

187
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,240
you should call the police.

188
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,880
I’ll keep an eye on you, Ning Zhen.

189
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,920
Ning Zhen.

190
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,440
Why is Mo Bei here?

191
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,760
Are you okay?

192
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,080
Jiang Yan is missing.

193
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,280
I suspect the abyss did it.

194
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Abyss?

195
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,840
How did he know about Jiang Yan's whereabouts?

196
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,400
You only told Captain Cao, right?

197
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,480
The death of Jiang Xun

198
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,520
could be him.

199
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,040
has something on Jiang Yan.

200
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,000
Jiang Yan?

201
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,880
is actually the mastermind

202
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,760
behind this.

203
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,000
The one who killed my dad

204
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,840
is Jiang Yan.

205
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,760
Wu Ke Ran was there that day.

206
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,080
But how could she be related to the abyss?

207
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,120
Wu Ke Ran.

208
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,440
And Joien.

209
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,360
Between Wu Ke Ran and Joien,

210
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,640
Already?

211
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,640
Were you waiting for me?

212
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,480
I thought you were coming.

213
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,520
so I prepared a small gift for you.

214
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,000
[Wish you luck.]

215
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,440
What's wrong?

216
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,560
Marco Lu.

217
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,760
I'm not feeling well.

218
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,960
Take a break.

219
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,320
[Do you have Kang-yeon?]

220
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,319
[I can do more.] I want to see him die.

221
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,920
[Did you catch the goose?]

222
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,560
[You said]

223
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,560
[You said you'd catch Kang Yeon last night.] How is it now?

224
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,320
[Do you have the goose now?]

225
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,960
Captain Cao.

226
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,240
You got up so early.

227
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,040
I didn't sleep well.

228
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,280
No.

229
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,920
What took you so long?

230
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,480
Is there a new case?

231
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,720
I bought steamed buns and fried dough sticks.

232
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,160
I don't know what you like.

233
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,640
Thank you.

234
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,840
What's wrong?

235
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,200
Did you cry?

236
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,240
No.

237
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,160
I had a nightmare.

238
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
(Dad)

239
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,120
Well...

240
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,400
Captain Cao.

241
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,240
You eat first.

242
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,840
I'll go get changed.

243
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,280
(Yes.)

244
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,640
What are you doing?

245
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,840
You haven't recovered yet.

246
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,960
I'm fine now.

247
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,800
I want to be alone.

248
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,640
Let's go.

249
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,840
Where is Jiang Yan?

250
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,640
What?

251
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,600
Only you know

252
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,120
only you know where Jiang Yan is.

253
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,960
This has something to do with you.

254
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,320
I'm just providing you some technical help.

255
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,560
I know nothing else.

256
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,120
Did you put a tracker

257
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,040
on the USB?

258
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,240
You used me to find Jiang Yan

259
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,040
to make people think I'm your accomplice.

260
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,440
Yeongjin.

261
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,240
Are you serious?

262
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,080
I'm a cripple.

263
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,000
You said I gave you a tracker in the USB.

264
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,000
Where is the evidence?

265
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,040
Joien.

266
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,480
I don't care if you're related to Jiang Yan

267
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,040
or if it's related to the abyss.

268
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,760
I will find out

269
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,320
to the end.

270
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,680
I hope you can find out the truth

271
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,560
and clear your doubts about me

272
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:34,560
Luo Fu

273
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
Jiang Yan

274
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,600
[He was eager to get the company's ginger from his father.]

275
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,240
To prove himself,

276
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,640
to prove myself.

277
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,440
When something goes wrong in the clinical trial,

278
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Jiang Yan changed

279
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,400
all the experiment reports.

280
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
At this moment,

281
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,600
the researcher Jin Jie

282
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,880
took all the experimental reports

283
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,840
and was taken in by his mother.

284
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,040
In order to get the evidence back,

285
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,040
to get the evidence back.

286
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,080
Hello.

287
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,320
Hello.

288
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,480
I'm Wu Fei, the person in charge here.

289
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,520
Who are you?

290
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,480
I'm Du Jun from Jiang's Group.

291
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,120
But when Wu Fei found out the truth,

292
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,840
he felt guilty.

293
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,120
and chose to give all the evidence to the police.

294
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,640
[And the porpoise with a selfish motive]

295
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,800
killed Wu Fei

296
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,800
for evidence.

297
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,240
and Jin Jie.

298
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,040
fabricated the scene

299
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,440
and made Jang Geon-min testify.

300
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,720
In the end, Kang Woo and Kang Yeon

301
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,960
reached an agreement.

302
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,800
to kill

303
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,720
related to the case.

304
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,920
As an insider,

305
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,880
as an insider.

306
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,360
Jiang Yan.

307
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,280
What is the truth?

308
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,960
It's dyed.

309
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,640
Have some water.

310
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,480
I

311
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,200
a popular dessert shop downstairs.

312
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,400
I took a card to join the fun.

313
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,680
I bought some begonia pastry.

314
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,440
Have one.

315
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,320
It's really delicious.

316
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,120
Dad.

317
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,840
Eat.

318
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,360
You eat first.

319
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,600
We'll split it.

320
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,160
Sorry to bother you so late.

321
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,200
Sorry.

322
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,360
Don't mention it.

323
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,480
You can come anytime.

324
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,160
I'm really happy that you came.

325
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,520
I'm here because...

326
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,120
I've been really anxious lately.

327
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,360
The murderer who killed my dad is dead.

328
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,840
But now I know

329
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,280
someone else is behind it.

330
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,040
My heart is hanging again.

331
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,280
The police are investigating.

332
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,360
It's the same as before.

333
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,520
There's no evidence.

334
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,920
Dr. Na.

335
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,040
Why is this world so unfair?

336
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,920
Why can a bad person like her

337
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,440
can live well?

338
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,520
My dad is a good man, but he wants to die.

339
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,280
If possible,

340
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,240
I really hope I can use the murderer's life

341
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,720
with the murderer's life.

342
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,480
Kedye.

343
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,280
Since the police didn't give up on the investigation,

344
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,200
you should trust them.

345
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,160
Trust.

346
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,120
I know you're in pain.

347
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,800
What I'm going to tell you

348
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
may be cruel,

349
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,040
but it's a fact.

350
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,720
In this world,

351
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,640
love

352
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,400
or hatred,

353
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,920
or a person?

354
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,760
or things.

355
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,680
Once you lose it,

356
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,960
I will never come back.

357
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,680
Forever.

358
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,040
This is reality.

359
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,920
You need to learn to accept the reality

360
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,920
and live a good life.

361
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,400
and love yourself.

362
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,040
Think about it.

363
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,520
If Dad were still alive,

364
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,640
he would never want to see

365
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
to see you being sad.

366
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,400
No.

367
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,280
No.

368
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,200
Dr. Na.

369
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,800
My heart is full of hatred.

370
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Do you know?

371
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,520
When I found out that he disappeared last night,

372
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,680
I really hope it was done by the abyss.

373
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,600
If it was really made by the abyss,

374
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,720
I want her to be tortured to death

375
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,760
little by little.

376
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,720
I really want her to die.

377
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,000
Ke Ran.

378
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,240
You can't live in hatred forever.

379
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,120
Because hatred always brings pain.

380
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,320
Do you want to suffer forever?

381
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,280
I don't want to.

382
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,400
Even if I don't live in hatred,

383
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,880
even if I don't live in hatred.

384
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,360
After I was discharged,

385
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,720
she sent her men to hurt me.

386
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,680
Dr. Na.

387
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,120
I'm in pain every day.

388
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,040
I'm afraid every day.

389
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,720
I can't control myself.

390
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,640
I dare not go out.

391
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,440
I dare not sleep.

392
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,440
I have nightmares when I sleep.

393
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,160
I really can't control myself.

394
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,360
My only solution

395
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,800
is to control her.

396
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
is to let her die.

397
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,920
She must die.

398
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,160
Kedye.

399
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,560
She must die.

400
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,600
It's dyed.

401
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,200
I understand.

402
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,760
Trust me.

403
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,160
Through the abyss,

404
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,440
or through the police,

405
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,560
That person will be punished.

406
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,120
I will.

407
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,640
Just wait patiently.

408
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,160
Will she really be punished?

409
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,200
Of course.

410
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,600
This is

411
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,840
a sleeping monitoring bracelet.

412
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,000
I bought it for my daughter.

413
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,160
She said she didn't like it.

414
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,920
I kept it there for a long time.

415
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,400
I want to give it to you.

416
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,600
I hope it'll help your sleep.

417
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,760
Have a good dream every day.

418
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,040
Thank you.

419
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,120
Dr. Na.

420
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,840
I want to know if your wife

421
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
had taken the special drug developed by Jiang's Group.

422
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,720
The special drug of Jiang's Group.

423
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,520
I know every medicine

424
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,960
I know it very well.

425
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,720
But there's no such thing.

426
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,200
I've checked the test report

427
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,920
to relevant institutions back then.

428
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,360
My mother's name

429
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,720
is not on the list.

430
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,240
But I'm very sure

431
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,240
my mother was involved in the clinical trial of the medicine.

432
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,120
So I want to know

433
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,440
if

434
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
whether your wife

435
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
with my mother.

436
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,920
You mean...

437
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,920
That's why I became an abyss.

438
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,200
Jiang Yan is missing now.

439
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,080
It could be in the hands of the abyss.

440
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,280
If Jiang Yan was killed,

441
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,000
then all the truth

442
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,720
all the truth will be sealed away.

443
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,200
Doctor Na.

444
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,480
Even if you're not an abyss,

445
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,520
you must be connected to him.

446
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,160
I just want to know where Jiang Yan is locked up.

447
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,160
Have you ever thought

448
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,280
why the abyss didn't kill Jiang Yan

449
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,320
instead of killing Jiang Yan?

450
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,920
because he had another purpose.

451
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,240
Delivery.

452
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,560
Coming.

453
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,280
Wait.

454
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,000
Hello?

455
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,440
I believe you already know

456
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,640
the truth of that incident.

457
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,080
Do you want to see Jiang Yan?

458
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,600
Joien.

459
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,560
I know it's you.

460
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,640
Abyss can be anyone,

461
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
or you.

462
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,000
I'll give you a chance now.

463
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,520
a chance for your revenge.

464
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,520
This

465
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,280
is my gift to you.

466
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,480
You didn't kill Jiang Yan

467
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,680
because you were waiting for me.

468
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,320
Are you going to watch Jiang Yan

469
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,680
get away with the lack of evidence?

470
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,080
Don’t you want to know

471
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,080
the truth?

472
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,880
Don't you want to take revenge?

473
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,400
If you accept my gift,

474
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,880
I'll welcome you here.

475
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,400
If you don't accept it,

476
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,560
I'll kill Jiang Yan myself.

477
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,280
Joien.

478
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,240
I also want to know the truth.

479
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,640
I also want the murderer to be punished.

480
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,240
But it's not a personal punishment.

481
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,840
She should be punished by the law.

482
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,000
Give me some time.

483
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,400
I will find the evidence

484
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,080
to bring Jiang Yan to justice.

485
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
I'm still struggling

486
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,200
with my only rationality.

487
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,160
I can give you time.

488
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
Only three days.

489
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,240
Within three days,

490
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,320
if you can't find

491
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,240
that can convict Jiang Yan,

492
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,360
I'll kill Jiang Yan.

493
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,240
Okay.

494
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,000
Three days.

495
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,560
Within three days,

496
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,560
if I find you calling the police,

497
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,600
or find anything else,

498
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,440
I'll kill Jiang Yan.

499
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,360
At that time,

500
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,160
and justice.

501
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,920
The evidence has been destroyed.

502
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,000
Li wants to prove that Jiang Yan is guilty.

503
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,560
To prove that Jiang Yan is guilty,

504
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,920
we must find the bodies of those missing people.

505
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,320
But it's been 15 years.

506
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,640
Where are they?

507
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,320
Mom.

508
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,200
Are you one of them?

509
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,000
You didn't sleep all night?

510
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,960
You're injured.

511
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,040
Let's eat first.

512
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,440
I brought you sweet foam with seaweed rib bun.

513
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,920
Come and eat.

514
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,360
Stop eating.

515
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,920
Did you find anything?

516
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Come with me.

517
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,760
When did you do this?

518
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:29,920
May 26, 2024.

519
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,320
May 26, 2024.

520
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,440
Did you clean this up?

521
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,800
If you can't find the body,

522
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,120
we can't define the case as murder.

523
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,680
But after so many years,

524
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,280
it's really hard to find the place.

525
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,720
The one who knows where the body was hidden

526
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,000
Du Jun.

527
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,720
I'm afraid the murderer is the only one.

528
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,920
The murderer himself?

529
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,360
