1
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Who are you?

2
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,000
We can get out of Hongwan.

3
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,720
It's only a matter of time to find you.

4
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,000
Is this 401 package?

5
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,240
You are?

6
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,040
Mr. Luo.

7
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,800
0286.

8
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,280
Here.

9
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,120
Thank you.

10
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,480
Why are you so rude to Dr. Na?

11
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,760
You have a gift.

12
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,560
Give me the present.

13
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,040
You went to find my daughter?

14
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,640
It's easy to find you.

15
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,080
Looking for your daughter

16
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,920
to find your daughter.

17
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,680
But it's okay.

18
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,200
Her home address

19
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
the location of the school,

20
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,480
Including who I meet every day.

21
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,880
the activity track

22
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,960
of the activity.

23
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,400
Listen carefully.

24
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,159
If you touch my daughter,

25
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,080
I won't let you off!

26
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,400
Don't worry.

27
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,159
For now,

28
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,000
I won't touch her.

29
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,280
The premise is your result.

30
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,640
You have to satisfy us.

31
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,840
The package is here.

32
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,040
Please sign here.

33
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
The package is here.

34
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,640
Please sign here.

35
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,680
Mr. Mo.

36
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,280
I don't see anyone outside.

37
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,480
Dr. Na.

38
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
You know that man outside, right?

39
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,440
I can let him in.

40
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,920
You should know what to do.

41
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,400
Pay.

42
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,800
You must sign it yourself.

43
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,920
Officer Ning.

44
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,880
Why are you here?

45
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,880
Officer Ning.

46
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,680
Officer Ning.

47
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,160
Officer Ning.

48
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,560
Hongwan is so far from here.

49
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,000
Why are you here?

50
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,640
No one came to you?

51
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,800
Yes.

52
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,960
My wife's

53
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,000
relatives, friends,

54
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,400
And you.

55
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,000
Jiang Yan's men didn't come to you.

56
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,920
I told you.

57
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,200
Hongwan is so far from here.

58
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,600
Why did they come to me?

59
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
You...

60
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,920
worried about this.

61
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,760
If there's nothing else,

62
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,360
please leave.

63
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,240
Excuse me.

64
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,840
What happened to your hand?

65
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,600
Nothing.

66
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,320
It's just

67
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,400
I twisted it when playing basketball.

68
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,640
Dr. Luo.

69
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,640
Aren't you hiding something

70
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,000
to leave Hongwan at this time?

71
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,880
You think too much.

72
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Every year at this time,

73
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,520
I come to my wife's hometown

74
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
to mourn my dead wife.

75
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,920
I'll be back tomorrow.

76
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,080
Excuse me.

77
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,840
Stop!

78
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,280
Don't move.

79
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,040
Police!

80
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,320
Get down!

81
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,040
Officer Ning, right?

82
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,360
We are local police.

83
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,720
Here.

84
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,840
Thank you.

85
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,320
Captain Cao has informed us.

86
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,160
Thank you for coming.

87
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,160
Thank you.

88
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,560
Come back with us to make a statement.

89
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,560
and tell us what's going on.

90
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,160
Detective.

91
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,400
There might be a misunderstanding.

92
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,280
I'll cooperate with your testimony.

93
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
It's all handcuffed.

94
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,320
Officer Ning.

95
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,400
Thank you.

96
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,720
You came so far for this.

97
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,880
Don't worry.

98
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll make it clear

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,920
to the local police.

100
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,920
Let's go.

101
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,840
Officer.

102
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,760
I put my ID in the car.

103
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,520
Take it.

104
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,480
Officer Ning.

105
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,720
You came here for nothing.

106
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,040
I've achieved my goal.

107
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,840
Mo Bei.

108
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,720
Luo Yin.

109
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,800
Mo Bei is here for you.

110
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,160
Did you finish the deal?

111
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,760
I don't understand why you did that.

112
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,280
The person who was killed by the porpoise

113
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,440
will never rest in peace.

114
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,200
Tell me the truth before the trial.

115
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,280
It's not too late.

116
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,720
I always suspected that you had something to do with the abyss.

117
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,760
Even when you were questioned,

118
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
during the interrogation,

119
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,120
I still suspect you.

120
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,120
But now it seems

121
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,920
you are the only one

122
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,960
You've cleared your name.

123
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,760
Chief.

124
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,560
Yeongjin.

125
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,440
Are you going back to the station tomorrow?

126
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,560
Yes.

127
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,440
I'll be back tomorrow.

128
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,520
Do you need a few days off?

129
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,840
No.

130
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,360
I can go back tomorrow.

131
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Ning-jin.

132
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,760
Actually, you played a great role

133
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,560
you did a great job.

134
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,320
You found the key evidence.

135
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,440
These

136
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,840
are precious experiences

137
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,000
as a police officer.

138
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,720
You're still young.

139
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,800
Take your time.

140
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,360
There will be another chance.

141
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,880
Don't worry, sir.

142
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,520
When I go back,

143
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,240
I'll do my best.

144
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,320
Okay.

145
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
If you need anything,

146
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,040
if you need anything.

147
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,080
Okay.

148
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,120
Dr. Luo is back

149
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,080
Xiaoqiao

150
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,800
Do you have many reservations recently?

151
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,720
If not,

152
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
go to the back.

153
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,960
I don't feel well here.

154
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,640
Okay.

155
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,120
I've arranged it for you.

156
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,680
But one patient

157
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,960
made many reservations.

158
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,440
She keeps asking when you'll be back.

159
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,320
What do you think?

160
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,560
As usual.

161
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Okay, Dr. Luo.

162
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,840
025196.

163
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,760
Yeongjin.

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,800
Director.

165
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
You look good.

166
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,680
Take a few days off.

167
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,720
and check

168
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,880
in the district.

169
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,280
Okay.

170
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,920
Welcome back.

171
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,560
I'll go first.

172
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,240
Ning Zhen.

173
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,520
You're back.

174
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,640
How is the police? 025196.

175
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:13,880
How is the police team 25196?

176
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,320
How is the police team?

177
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,640
It's a big case, right?

178
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,680
I just went to help.

179
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
I didn't do anything.

180
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,760
Okay.

181
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,640
I'll leave you to it.

182
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,120
025196.

183
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,680
If someone comes to me these days,

184
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,320
just tell them I'm not back yet.

185
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,840
Okay.

186
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,160
Hello.

187
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,320
Hello.

188
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,600
I'm Lu Fan from the Criminal Investigation Unit.

189
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,040
Is Ning Zhen here?

190
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,440
He's not back yet. 025046.

191
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,280
If he comes back,

192
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,480
please ask him to find me.

193
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,440
Okay.

194
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,400
Thank you.

195
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,840
Bro.

196
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,000
Such a beautiful girl.

197
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Are you sure you won't meet her?

198
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,600
If it were me, I would have gone after him.

199
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,520
Stop gossiping.

200
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,560
Go to work now.

201
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,440
Okay.

202
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,720
Ms. Jiang.

203
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,080
The trial will be held at the end of the month.

204
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,880
The former Judge Yoo

205
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,400
has been suspended.

206
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,320
We have a new judge.

207
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
and new evidence.

208
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,320
have been submitted to the court.

209
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,320
As long as we have new evidence,

210
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,200
It doesn't matter who the judge is.

211
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,760
Just finish it by the end of the month.

212
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
OK, Ms. Jiang.

213
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,120
Well done.

214
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,480
Come here and I'll reward you.

215
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,200
The time for the corporate retrial is confirmed.

216
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,320
When the result is out,

217
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,600
I’ll tell you immediately.

218
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,560
Why is there another trial?

219
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,080
Did Kang-yeon do something again?

220
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,960
The investigation of the case is over.

221
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,800
Leave the rest

222
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,080
to the prosecution and court.

223
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,720
Hello, ma'am.

224
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,840
How can I help you?

225
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,680
This is my first time here.

226
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,280
I've been asking you out.

227
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
But your assistant said you were on a business trip.

228
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,360
Yes.

229
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,480
I've been busy lately.

230
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,280
I just came back.

231
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,160
Tell me about your situation.

232
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,760
What are you...

233
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,840
You're an expert in my daughter's psychiatric appraisal.

234
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,120
My daughter will be

235
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,200
for intentional assault.

236
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,640
So please

237
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,960
please forgive me.

238
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,520
If the money is not enough,

239
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,480
tell me your number.

240
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,960
You know that

241
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,280
He has a serious mental illness.

242
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,200
I didn't kill anyone.

243
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,760
And...

244
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,800
I can get out soon.

245
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,600
I don't understand why you did that.

246
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,080
The person who was killed by the porpoise

247
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,240
will never rest in peace.

248
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,880
Please help me this time.

249
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,360
She's still young.

250
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,160
and immature.

251
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,480
Dr. Na.

252
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,040
Sister Li.

253
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Yes, I'm Nid.

254
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,640
It's okay.

255
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
It's just a visit.

256
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,880
Thank you.

257
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,600
Thank you.

258
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,480
(The trial is today. Don’t you want to know the result?)

259
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Excuse me.

260
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,440
According to your judgment,

261
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,160
if the flute

262
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,200
when he committed the crime?

263
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,800
Yes.

264
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,920
Liar.

265
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,320
Silence!

266
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,360
The early stage of the disease didn't treat in time.

267
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,040
So the fluid schizophrenia

268
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,240
is very serious.

269
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,040
(Luo Yin testifies for the porridge.) [A mental patient who restricts criminal responsibilities]

270
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,680
Doctor Na.

271
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,160
Hello, Detective.

272
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,760
Why did you do that?

273
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,680
Because of your paper evaluation,

274
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,000
all our efforts will be in vain.

275
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
What did I do?

276
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,640
There's no schizophrenia at all.

277
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,160
Why did you help him?

278
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,160
Did Jiang Yan threaten you?

279
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
You can tell us.

280
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,040
Tell us.

281
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,200
We can help you.

282
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,240
I'm not threatened by anyone.

283
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,520
You did it voluntarily.

284
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,400
to stand with Jiang Yan.

285
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,400
Ning Zhen, that fool.

286
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,320
He thought you were threatened

287
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,920
and went to you desperately.

288
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,440
How stupid.

289
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,960
Detective.

290
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
I did what I should do.

291
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,280
If you don't understand, read more.

292
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,640
If you can't figure it out,

293
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,200
think about it again.

294
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,680
Bye.

295
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:30,840
The committee is investigating

296
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,200
According to the report Zhang Hua submitted on June 15, 2024, History.

297
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,040
1. While he was a forensic psychologist,

298
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,360
Human property, psychiatric report, violation.

299
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,320
The trial continues.

300
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,600
We will now begin the trial.

301
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,480
The facts found in court

302
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,440
is the same as the prosecution's accusation.

303
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,720
The court believes

304
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,760
the defendant, Kang Woo, committed intentional murder,

305
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,520
will be punished according to the law.

306
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,320
Based on the criminal nature and plot of this case,

307
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,800
social threat,

308
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,920
and the opinions of both defenders.

309
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,880
According to the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China,

310
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,080
Article 57,

311
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,440
Article 48,

312
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,000
Article 232,

313
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,320
The verdict is as follows.

314
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,440
All rise.

315
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,400
[Defendant Kang Woo committed a intentional murder,]

316
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,760
sentenced to death.

317
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
and deprive of political rights for life.

318
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Okay.

319
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,600
Fluffy.

320
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Stop it.

321
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,360
Officer.

322
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,520
Where is the key?

323
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,600
Can you give me the key?

324
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,160
Please.

325
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,000
Officer,

326
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,120
Give me the key.

327
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,880
Where is the key?

328
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,400
Jiang Yan.

329
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,880
Tell the police.

330
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,520
Hurry!

331
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,800
I'm innocent.

332
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,000
Fluffy, stop it.

333
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,680
I will find a way.

334
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,760
Officer, I'm sorry.

335
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,680
Give me the key.

336
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,840
I'll talk to them, okay?

337
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,480
Sister.

338
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,600
Tell them

339
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,040
Sister.

340
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,840
Tell them.

341
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,200
Sister.

342
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,040
What happened?

343
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,880
Luo Yin was reported

344
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,800
is suspected of fabricating the psychiatric evaluation report.

345
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,680
At the same time,

346
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,880
the analysis report

347
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,840
is also fake.

348
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,040
Ning Zhen.

349
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,200
Why are you avoiding me?

350
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,000
Why are you here?

351
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,480
Are you giving up?

352
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,040
I have good news.

353
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,640
My borrowing period is over.

354
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,440
Go back.

355
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,960
Stop!

356
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,200
What do you mean?

357
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,400
Your mother's case

358
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
and the abyss

359
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,480
and the abyss.

360
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,960
This is my personal matter.

361
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,400
How is it your own business?

362
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,080
Have you forgotten

363
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,800
Have you forgotten?

364
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,680
Marco Lu.

365
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,800
This is not as simple as you think.

366
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,120
Kang Woo got a report from the psychiatric evaluation.

367
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,760
He'll soon escape from the law.

368
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,880
and the abyss will appear again.

369
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,400
And now I think

370
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,160
is more dangerous than the abyss.

371
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,520
Captain Cao is right.

372
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,000
What are you talking about?

373
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,280
Kang Woo was sentenced to death.

374
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,440
What?

375
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,840
The porpoise was sentenced to death.

376
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,680
Luo Yin was reported

377
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,920
of another case.

378
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,880
[Suspected of fabricating a psychiatric analysis report]

379
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,960
and found out the psychiatric analysis of porpoise.

380
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,920
was also forged.

381
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,360
I asked about the investigation.

382
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,320
It was actually Luo Yin.

383
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,880
who made the opponent's lawyer report.

384
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,840
Because of the confession,

385
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,920
and it didn't cause any actual impact.

386
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,520
Luo Yin should be fine.

387
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,360
But his job and medical qualification

388
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,480
to practice medicine.

389
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,320
Alright.

390
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,880
Think about it.

391
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,360
If you still don't understand,

392
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,760
think again.

393
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,280
Officer Ning.

394
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,680
Dr. Luo.

395
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,960
Were you threatened

396
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,720
because

397
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,840
to sign that document.

398
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,600
If I had found out earlier,

399
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,080
I wouldn't be like this.

400
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,440
At that time,

401
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,160
I had no choice.

402
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,200
Can you stop caring about it?

403
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,640
But now,

404
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,600
back to

405
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,680
the list of suspects in the abyss?

406
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,520
In this world,

407
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,040
love and hatred

408
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,720
for no reason.

409
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,280
To catch the abyss,

410
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,880
you need to know

411
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,680
how he became an abyss.

412
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,640
Everyone related to the naked body case

413
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,960
Everyone.

414
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,760
If one appears, he will kill one.

415
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,400
In the end,

416
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,680
the police

417
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,200
to the naked body case in Kubei.

418
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,520
So I believe

419
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,200
the real identity of the abyss

420
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,600
is hidden in this case.

421
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,560
I know what you're thinking.

422
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,040
My wife died of illness.

423
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,960
and no family was killed.

424
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,800
Do I have a reason to be an abyss?

425
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,440
I want to know the truth too.

426
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,360
Dr. Na.

427
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,240
The naked body case in Kubei is over.

428
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,400
I've been transferred back to the police station.

429
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,440
When we were kids,

430
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,040
we...

431
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,680
There are always a few kids in our class.

432
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,520
Every time the teacher announced the correct answer,

433
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,680
they would raise their hands and say,

434
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
I have different solutions.

435
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,080
There are many ways to solve one question.

436
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,200
With Officer Ning's personality,

437
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,600
he won't give up.

438
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,280
Sometimes we are only

439
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,040
to success.

440
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,760
Who is the one hiding it?

441
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,480
Jin Jie has no immediate family.

442
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,240
And for so many years,

443
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,120
no one has ever cared about the progress of the case.

444
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Wu Ke Ran appeared at the same time with the abyss.

445
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,360
So it can't be her.

446
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,800
Who is this person?

447
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,920
Why?

448
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,400
Why is this happening?

449
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,760
I'm going to succeed.

450
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,120
You could do anything before

451
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,520
Why not now?

452
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,920
Ms. Jiang,

453
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,160
We did our best.

454
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,800
No one knew something would happen to him.

455
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,520
I understand.

456
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,520
You just want me to die.

457
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,520
If I die,

458
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,200
my sister will be free.

459
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,880

463
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,880
don't do anything stupid.
