1
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,000
Ms. Jiang, drink more.

2
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,120
Here.

3
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,920
For what?

4
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,720
Freedom.

5
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,920
Are you okay?

6
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,080
Fluffy.

7
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,000
Where are you?

8
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,440
What?

9
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,760
I can't hear you.

10
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,720
Did you go to a club again?

11
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,280
Come back.

12
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't make trouble during this time.

13
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,280
Don't worry.

14
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,760
Sister.

15
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,000
He's out.

16
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,360
Driver.

17
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,280
Follow me.

18
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,760
The car in front.

19
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,279
Move!

20
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,839
Get out of the way!

21
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,440
I’m talking to you.

22
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,200
Brother Tao.

23
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,080
Where are you going?

24
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,840
Xiaoyu.

25
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,159
Check it for me.

26
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,520
SeaB 78500.

27
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,760
The road of the car.

28
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,640
Hurry.

29
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,760
You're driving the wrong way.

30
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,120
Hello?

31
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,720
I've reached the place you asked for.

32
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,560
Where are you?

33
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,520
Sir.

34
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,000
Pull over.

35
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,720
I want to go to the toilet.

36
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,240
Sir.

37
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:29,960
Sir.

38
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:45,920
Captain Cao.

39
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,000
We lost the porpoise.

40
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,800
But Xiaoyu has found out

41
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,840
the road of the car.

42
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,120
We're on our way.

43
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,040
Okay.

44
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,080
Report to me as soon as possible.

45
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,240
Got it.

46
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,160
Tao lost him.

47
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,640
Tell me.

48
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,920
the abyss

49
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,880
will appear next to the pores?

50
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,400
If the target of the abyss

51
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,200
is the culprit of the naked body case in Kubei,

52
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,480
Then he will definitely show up.

53
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,920
Who are you?

54
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,480
Brother.

55
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,120
I have plenty of money.

56
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,880
How much do you want?

57
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,280
I'll give you all.

58
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,000
Please let me go.

59
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,160
Please.

60
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,880
Please let me go.

61
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,040
Please.

62
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,720
Please let me go.

63
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,200
Can you buy people to die?

64
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,880
Can you buy life?

65
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,120
I don't know anything.

66
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I know nothing.

67
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,080
I didn't do anything.

68
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,200
Who do you want to bet on?

69
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,440
Don't you want to kill me?

70
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,800
And you.

71
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,280
I almost died just now.

72
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,920
You know what?

73
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,600
Ms. Jiang asked me to take you home.

74
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,960
My sister is back.

75
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,760
She came back early.

76
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,400
How did she know I was here?

77
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,440
I smell something.

78
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,320
Tracker.

79
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,720
The police and the abyss are looking for you.

80
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,080
You know.

81
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,720
Ms. Jiang

82
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,120
cares about you.

83
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,320
With you,

84
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
and my sister

85
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,080
behind me.

86
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,600
What am I afraid of?

87
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,360
Let's go home.

88
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,560
Go home.

89
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,840
Hello, Captain Cao.

90
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,280
I found the porridge.

91
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,160
He's with Mo Bei, Jiang Yan's driver.

92
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,880
I lost Mo Bei because of him.

93
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,400
Maybe they found me

94
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,240
when I was following him.

95
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,120
Got it.

96
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,280
Keep an eye on him.

97
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,920
Roger.

98
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,480
Found it.

99
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,280
We both guessed wrong.

100
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,080
The abyss didn't appear.

101
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,080
I want to tell you

102
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,040
if one day

103
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,320
you can't continue investigating,

104
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,280
But please trust me.

105
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,880
I will

106
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,680
this case.

107
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,480
If one day

108
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,560
I stand on that line,

109
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,720
and have to make some choices,

110
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,640
will you believe me?

111
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,320
It's late.

112
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,960
Get some rest.

113
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,480
Answer me, Ning Zhen.

114
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,240
I'm the little boy

115
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,400
who called the police.

116
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,480
We're trying to protect you.

117
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,720
I'm a police officer.

118
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,080
Marco Lu.

119
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,120
Marco Lu.

120
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,960
I know it’s not your fault.

121
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,400
You didn't do anything wrong.

122
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,200
But I just can't control myself.

123
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,560
I hate everyone who made me lose my father.

124
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,960
will find the truth.

125
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,600
The truth?

126
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,840
Easy for you to say.

127
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,280
My father's case...

128
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,080
Your parents' case?

129
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,000
Li Guo Kun was killed.

130
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,920
Li Guo Kun's ex-wife was murdered.

131
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,080
Zhang Jianmin was murdered.

132
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,400
The naked body case in Kubei.

133
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,760
The flute.

134
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,440
Abyss.

135
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,120
[The nightmare that has been over for 15 years]

136
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,200
is still going on.

137
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,720
Tell me.

138
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,240
how should I find it?

139
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,360
Let's investigate together.

140
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,120
You're early.

141
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,560
Captain Cao.

142
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,600
I found something about the naked body case.

143
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,920
I didn't sleep last night.

144
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,760
I couldn't sleep.

145
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,200
There's something I don't understand.

146
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,240
According to the porpoise's previous statement,

147
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,400
his purpose is to find the company.

148
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,120
of the company.

149
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,840
And Li Kun and Zhang Jianmin

150
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,560
for money.

151
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,400
Then why is Jin Jie naked?

152
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,800
According to our understanding of porpoise,

153
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,240
he seems to have

154
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,360
a professional woman.

155
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,800
On the day Wu Ke Ran was kidnapped,

156
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,800
Marco Lu found

157
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,640
in Jiang Yi's bedroom bed.

158
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,320
a professional dress.

159
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,080
But it smells like detergent

160
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,960
Obviously it's just washed

161
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,040
No one has worn it.

162
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,280
But the size

163
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,680
is not Wu Ke Ran's size.

164
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,040
So I guess it was prepared by

165
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,480
for the woman who brought home.

166
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,040
A club girl went missing.

167
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,760
That day, she was wearing professional clothes.

168
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,160
The same goes for Wu Ke Ran.

169
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,000
Jin Jie was

170
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
working in Jiang’s Group.

171
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,440
So I'm thinking

172
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,280
if there is

173
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,480
between them?

174
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,880
We haven’t found the missing girl.

175
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,800
The case of Jin Jie has been too long.

176
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,960
Li Kun and Zhang Jianmin died.

177
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,560
These details are more unimaginable.

178
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,720
And the porpoise is not committed

179
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,520
because of Wu Ke Ran.

180
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,680
If you want to use this as a breakthrough to investigate the case,

181
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,280
to investigate the case.

182
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,920
I think we can

183
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,400
start with girls from clubs.

184
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,280
I checked the CCTV last night.

185
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,920
The CCTV in front of the club.

186
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,280
When the girl left the club,

187
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,600
the car in the porridge appeared too.

188
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,640
There was no CCTV

189
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,600
on that road,

190
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,040
whether the girl got into the porpoise car.

191
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
But if we assume

192
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,120
the girl got into his car,

193
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,480
Where would Kang Woo drive the car?

194
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,160
I checked all the street surveillance cameras last night.

195
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,000
After the car left

196
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,320
the road without CCTV,

197
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,440
he went straight home.

198
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,160
I think we should

199
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,080
his house.

200
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,360
What about you?

201
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,080
Go back and rest.

202
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,800
I'll go.

203
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,600
I'm fine.

204
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,760
Then go to the property management.

205
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,320
I'll get a warrant.

206
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,120
Okay.

207
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,600
What are you thinking?

208
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,240
Let's go.

209
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,560
Why isn't there

210
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,760
at the entrance of Jiang Xun's house?

211
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,720
Some owners pay more attention to privacy.

212
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,800
They want us to

213
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,680
not to film their house.

214
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,440
And the villa area

215
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,960
in the villa area.

216
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,160
Did the Jiang Family ask your property management

217
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,440
not to cover the CCTV in their house?

218
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,120
I've been here for two years.

219
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,520
I was like this when I came here.

220
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,920
Could you please copy

221
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,360
near Jiang Yi's house.

222
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,440
Okay.

223
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,000
Thank you.

224
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,200
How is it?

225
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,880
We've checked the property surveillance.

226
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,480
but we didn't get any footage of

227
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,040
The surveillance range of the neighbors

228
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,240
is limited to our own courtyard.

229
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,960
Is the porpoise at home?

230
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,720
I lost him

231
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,600
I lost him for a while.

232
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,720
But it didn't take long before the porpoise went home.

233
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,720
He never came out again.

234
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,000
Whatever.

235
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,760
Let's go in and meet him.

236
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,640
So many people.

237
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,160
Captain Cao.

238
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,160
Welcome.

239
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,160
What can I do for you?

240
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,520
The flute.

241
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,560
We suspect you

242
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,960
related to a missing person case.

243
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,160
This is a warrant.

244
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,200
Please cooperate with us.

245
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:43,960
Cao Jin.

246
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,160
Are you targeting me?

247
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,120
How can you get involved with me

248
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,520
in any case?

249
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,840
You have to be responsible for what you say.

250
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,160
I'm very responsible.

251
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,200
Captain Cao is here.

252
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,320
Come in.

253
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
Thank you.

254
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,360
I prepared some gifts for you.

255
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,680
Hope you like it.

256
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,960
What's wrong?

257
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,840
Why are you unhappy here alone?

258
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,480
This is for you.

259
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,280
Hold it.

260
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,520
Cheer up.

261
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,800
Ms. Jiang.

262
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,120
We found that your brother, Jiang Fei,

263
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,800
is related to a missing case.

264
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,560
This is our warrant.

265
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,520
Please cooperate with us.

266
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,600
Please cooperate.

267
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,680
Thank you.

268
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,280
Hurry up.

269
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Don't break anything.

270
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,600
Yes.

271
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,440
Captain Cao.

272
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:18,960
This way, please.

273
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,520
Go upstairs.

274
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,360
Captain Cao, this way please.

275
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,840
Ms. Jiang.

276
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,200
Such a big house.

277
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,640
in such a big house?

278
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,240
You police are here.

279
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,120
can we live and work in peace.

280
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,360
CCTV.

281
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,680
It's only available when something happens.

282
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,360
Thank you for your trust in us.

283
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,680
It's a porridge.

284
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,800
Do you know this girl?

285
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,400
Have you been to a bar

286
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,920
called "The Live SHOW"?

287
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,520
I remember

288
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,960
at 9:30 on May 30,

289
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,680
this girl went missing

290
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,480
she went missing.

291
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,320
We found her in the CCTV.

292
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,200
In the end, she got into your car.

293
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,520
Are you kidding me?

294
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,640
There are no surveillance cameras on that road.

295
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,440
There was no CCTV on that road.

296
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,000
How did you know?

297
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,960
I've been driving that road for many years.

298
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,000
How could I not know?

299
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,480
The flute.

300
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,120
After walking for many years,

301
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,160
will you know there are no surveillance cameras on that road?

302
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,960
Cao Jin.

303
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,200
Can't you find evidence of the naked body case in Kubei?

304
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
You just find a random case and you want to kill me?

305
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,760
Fluffy.

306
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,200
Don't talk like that.

307
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,800
We police

308
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,360
only talk about evidence.

309
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,160
All the clues point to this.

310
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,840
That's why we're here to investigate.

311
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,320
The police only hire suspects.

312
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,760
Are you?

313
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,320
Cao Jin.

314
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,080
Do you have evidence?

315
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,920
If you have evidence,

316
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,920
come and catch me anytime.

317
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,560
Really?

318
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,000
Captain Cao.

319
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,680
The house has just been cleaned.

320
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,440
Thank you, Ms. Jiang.

321
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,720
The house is so big.

322
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,640
It should be troublesome to clean.

323
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,960
Take care, Captain Cao.

324
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,320
Let's go.

325
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,000
Take care.

326
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,640
Captain Cao.

327
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,360
Remember to close the door.

328
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,560
Did you really kill someone?

329
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,320
Is there any question?

330
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,640
I told you to behave.

331
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,200
Why did you still cause this trouble?

332
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,360
With you as my good sister,

333
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,760
to help me out.

334
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
What am I afraid of?

335
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,120
This porpoise is so despicable.

336
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,960
I knew it was him,

337
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,120
but there's nothing I can do.

338
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,400
I think you're not tired enough.

339
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,400
Go.

340
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Make me some noodles.

341
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,840
What's the flavor?

342
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,840
No.

343
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,080
Okay.

344
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,680
Wait.

345
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,120
What?

346
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,080
I think I've seen him somewhere.

347
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,280
When?

348
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,360
I remember

349
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,280
came to the guarantor pending trial,

350
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,920
I saw an old lady.

351
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,120
I have something

352
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,720
I think she wanted to tell me something.

353
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,880
but she tried to stop.

354
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,400
It's okay.

355
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,160
Then I left.

356
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,120
I was just passing by.

357
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,120
Do you think this old man

358
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,080
the insider?

359
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,360
She's here to report a case.

360
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,280
This is the footage

361
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,960
on the day she went missing.

362
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,400
It can't be recorded directly,

363
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,320
in front of the porpoise's house,

364
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,520
But we can see that

365
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
someone went in and out.

366
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,600
She wore cleaning clothes.

367
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,360
to the household office.

368
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,200
Let's go.

369
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,400
Tao Zi.

370
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,800
Send me the video screenshot.

371
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:46,560
70.A4.

372
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,920
Take a look.

373
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,120
Does he work at your household company?

374
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,120
Aunt Liu.

375
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,880
She's from our place.

376
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,080
Aunt Liu.

377
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,880
Does she have a client

378
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,120
a customer named Jiang Yu or Jiang Yan

379
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
Clean his house.

380
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,680
Yes.

381
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,400
They want

382
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,800
to clean every Thursday.

383
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,680
Every time?

384
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,200
for about two to three hours.

385
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,640
to go there.

386
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,560
It's such a big house.

387
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,040
They only ask for cleaning once a week.

388
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,400
I also think their family is quite rich.

389
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,160
I recommended a housemaid.

390
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:19,920
But

391
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,320
they only need a part-time worker.

392
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,280
Where is Aunt Liu?

393
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,800
She seems to be sick these days.

394
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,680
She's on leave.

395
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,720
Do you know her address?

396
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,520
Yes.

397
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,840
On the day the girl went missing,

398
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,720
Aunty Liu was cleaning on Thursday.

399
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,280
She must have seen something.

400
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,800
I wanted to call the police,

401
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,160
but it was found by someone from Jianghu.

402
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,720
Marco Lu.

403
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,000
Drive faster.

404
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,680
Hello?

405
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,640
Aunt Liu.

406
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,200
Hello?

407
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,360
Aunt Liu.

408
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,840
Aunt Liu.

409
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,520
Aunt Liu.

410
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,000
Who are you?

411
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,760
Police.

412
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,560
Officer.

413
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,080
Why are you here?

414
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,240
Don't worry.

415
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,560
We've been investigating a missing woman case.

416
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,440
We found that you might be a witness.

417
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,720
so I came to get some information.

418
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,640
A missing person case?

419
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,160
Yes.

420
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,280
I don't know anything.

421
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,040
You're a part-time worker at Jiang Xun's house, right?

422
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,360
On Thursday,

423
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,680
did you see anything

424
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,240
or anything unusual?

425
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,920
That day,

426
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,560
Just like usual.

427
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,440
I'll leave after I'm done.

428
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,480
Then why did you go to the police station?

429
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,520
Is there something

430
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,640
to tell us?

431
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,440
Don't be afraid.

432
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,720
We will protect the witness.

433
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,120
Sorry, officer.

434
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,400
I really don't know anything.

435
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,760
Aunt Liu.

436
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,440
This is a photo of the missing girl.

437
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,880
Have you seen her at the porridge house?

438
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,400
Her life is unknown.

439
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,880
The other girl was also hurt by the flute.

440
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,080
She's still in the hospital.

441
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,200
If you know anything,

442
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,360
please tell us.

443
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,400
Officer.

444
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,120
Please leave.

445
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,680
If this girl is really in danger,

446
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,400
and the murderer is still at large,

447
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,840
If you really know

448
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,320
Marco Lu.

449
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,240
Thank you for today.

450
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,720
Aunt Liu.

451
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,320
If you remember anything later,

452
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,120
if you remember anything,

453
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,280
if you want to tell us.

454
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,040
Thank you.

455
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,640
Thank you.

456
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,320
I asked the nurse.

457
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,280
Aunt Liu has been living with her granddaughter.

458
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,760
Unfortunately,

459
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,560
her granddaughter has leukemia.

460
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,760
Aunt Liu is so old and she works so hard to make money.

461
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,240
But the cost of bone marrow transplant is too high.

462
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,320
And there's no suitable matching.

463
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,400
So the surgery was delayed.

464
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
But a few days ago,

465
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,240
I suddenly paid the surgery fee.

466
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
and found a suitable match.

467
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,560
Do you think

468
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,920
was it because of the porpoise?

469
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,720
Aunt Liu must have been caught by the flute.

470
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Now she wants Aunt Liu

471
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,400
tell the truth that day,

472
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,160
will kill her granddaughter.

473
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,560
It's hard.

474
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,800
What should we do?

475
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,680
Are you going to expose Kang Woo bribing the witness?

476
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,600
We don't have enough evidence.

477
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,800
Let's think of another way.

478
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,080
Who are you?

479
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,440
Hello.

480
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,240
I'm Jiang Yan, the sister of the porridge.

481
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,280
I'm here to see you today.

482
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,720
You are not welcome here.

483
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,640
Please leave.

484
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,160
How's the wound?

485
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,840
Do you have anything to say?

486
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,280
Get out.

487
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,640
I heard you're Wu Fei's daughter.

488
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,120
Your father

489
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,520
was killed

490
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,600
to find important documents.

491
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
So you came to me today

492
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,040
because of my dad?

493
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,560
Yes.

494
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,720
At first, when he accepted the request,

495
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,960
everything went well.

496
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,200
But he went missing

497
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,080
he went missing.

498
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,160
When we got in touch again,

499
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
he told us

500
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,120
Jin Jie wanted more money.

501
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,400
My brother suspected

502
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,520
your father and Jin Jie

503
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,680
wanted more money.

504
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,280
That's why he looked for Li Guokun and Zhang Jianmin.

505
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,440
But those two

506
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,480
can do anything for money.

507
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,800
He killed your father and Jin Jie.

508
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,920
But this

509
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,800
has nothing to do with Fly.

510
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,000
You are so timid.

511
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,640
How could he kill someone?

512
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,960
Besides, he has no reason to do it himself.

513
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,480
Do you think I'll believe you?

514
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,480
The naked body case in Kubei.

515
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,800
My brother is also a victim.

516
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,320
I'm sure you know.

517
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,440
If you promise to let it go,

518
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,639
I can ask my brother

519
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,000
to testify against you.

520
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,840
I'm here today

521
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,719
to apologize to you on behalf of my brother.

522
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,679
I won't give up on finding the truth.

523
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
Don't rush to reply.

524
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,199
You still have time to think.

525
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,760
Goodbye.

526
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,880
Wait.

527
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,040
Little girl,

528
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,720
Why are you eating here alone?

529
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,200
Your family

530
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,400
Grandma delivers food to me every day.

531
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,400
I have to go to work.

532
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,680
Who are you?

533
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,560
I

534
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,440
I'm a patient

535
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,120
in your next ward.

536
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,000
What's your name?

537
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,520
Liu Xiao.

538
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,680
Xiao Xiao.

539
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,120
What's your name?

540
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,040
I'm Wu Ke Ran.

541
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,880
I'll play with you every day if you're free.

542
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,400
Okay?

543
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,120
Sure.

544
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,160
I'll be your good friend.

545
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,920
Marco Lu.

546
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
We are here to donate too.

547
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,720
What's wrong?

548
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,200
Xiao Xiao.

549
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,360
What are you looking at?

550
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,000
If

551
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
can be like the book says,

552
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,400
let me and my grandma

553
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,760
live happily together.

554
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,920
My illness

555
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
has recovered.

556
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,760
Grandma won't be so tired.

557
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,040
By then,

558
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,680
I'll take care of her.

559
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,800
Xiao Xiao is so smart.

560
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,920
and obedient.

561
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,600
I'm sure you'll recover.

562
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,920
Trust me.

563
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,000
After that,

564
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,520
you'll always

565
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,120
always

566
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,240
forever and ever.

567
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,280
Xiao Xiao.

568
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,720
Grandma is here.

569
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,320
Grandma.

570
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,280
Grandma, look.

571
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,880
Xiao Xiao folded it well.

572
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,120
This is...

573
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:54,960
Grandma.

574
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,160
This is Miss Wu.

575
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,040
My patient.

576
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,000
She has been with me these days.

577
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,720
Thank you.

578
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,320
