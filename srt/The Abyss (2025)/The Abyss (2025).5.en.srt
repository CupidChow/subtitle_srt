1
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
The naked body case in Kubei.

2
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,880
Send me his contact information

3
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,840
and address.

4
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,560
Got it.

5
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,520
We have new clues.

6
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,240
Have you made up your mind?

7
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,200
Dear guests,

8
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,040
media friends,

9
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,480
and readers.

10
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,680
Hello.

11
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,760
I'd like to express

12
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,480
sincere gratitude and warm welcome.

13
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,360
Psychology.

14
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
Tracing the source

15
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,280
is exploration.

16
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,400
the secret of life

17
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,200
the secret of our lives.

18
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,120
I've been studying and studying psychology.

19
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,000
for more than 20 years.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,960
I wrote some of my experience

21
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,880
into a book.

22
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,440
Especially in my career,

23
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,520
in my career.

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,920
Of course, the names of the person involved were hidden.

25
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,360
It's all written in it.

26
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,960
The psychologist, Luo Yin,

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,440
is the person we are looking for.

28
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,040
I know him.

29
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,280
In some legal programs,

30
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,080
he analyzed criminal psychology.

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
Everyone is talking about emotions.

32
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,480
There's a story

33
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,440
called Airship Effect.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,680
It's a river boat.

35
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,160
Mr. Luo Yin, right?

36
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,160
Detective Cao Jin.

37
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,960
I need to know something.

38
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,960
Hello, officers.

39
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,000
Please have a seat.

40
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
Li Guokun.

41
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,720
Do you know him?

42
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,840
Yes.

43
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,400
It was a patient of mine.

44
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,320
Look.

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,600
Is it the same person?

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,720
It's him.

47
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,320
During his sentence,

48
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,320
I gave him psychological counseling.

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,120
and actively coordinated with the treatment.

50
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,480
After he was released,

51
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,520
after he was released?

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,880
No.

53
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,280
Look at this number.

54
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,280
Do you remember?

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,160
The last one, right?

56
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,360
We found that

57
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,399
how many times

58
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,519
this number?

59
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,120
Do you know this owner?

60
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,560
Look.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,560
I don't have this number on my contact list.

62
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,160
There are many

63
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,360
with me.

64
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,600
So I really don't remember.

65
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,560
Okay.

66
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,960
Thank you for your cooperation.

67
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,920
Thank you.

68
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,440
You're welcome.

69
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,240
Mr. Luo.

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,280
You were a witness

71
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,200
in a case.

72
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,680
You provided clues to the police?

73
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,040
No.

74
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,320
Do you remember

75
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
the naked body case 15 years ago?

76
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,200
The naked body case in Kubei.

77
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,159
The police have confirmed

78
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,520
someone used my identity

79
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,120
to provide an untrustworthy testimony.

80
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,880
I won't forget such an important thing.

81
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,400
Okay.

82
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,960
Thank you.

83
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,080
Okay.

84
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,840
This boat is well folded.

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,280
Can you give it to me?

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,120
Sure.

87
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,520
Thank you.

88
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,480
I have something to do.

89
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,360
Go back first.

90
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,160
Wait for my news.

91
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,120
Okay.

92
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,400
We haven't found any clues about Li Guo Kun's murder.

93
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,640
We couldn't find him,

94
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,280
but there are doubts about another case.

95
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,640
Is there

96
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,280
Did someone deliberately

97
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,080
to lead the police to this case?

98
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,440
The last call record of Li Guokun

99
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,840
used a temporary number.

100
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,200
That means he has planned

101
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,440
for a long time.

102
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,600
to hide his identity

103
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,840
and he insists on

104
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,760
in his phone number.

105
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,440
It seems a little contradictory.

106
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,640
If this last contact

107
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,160
is the culprit who left a mark,

108
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,640
He must want to

109
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,440
through this way.

110
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,880
He wants us to investigate

111
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,960
the naked body case 15 years ago.

112
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,440
This case is the same place

113
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
the same place and time of the crime.

114
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,680
were found in the North District 15 years ago.

115
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,280
Maybe two cases

116
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,360
between the two cases.

117
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,040
15 years ago,

118
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,240
at the scene of Li Guo Kun's murder of Lu Zheng,

119
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,840
the mysterious man left a mark.

120
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
But he disappeared again.

121
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,120
Now, Li Guo Kun's death

122
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
because of Li Guo Kun's death.

123
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,560
and led us to the naked body case.

124
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,600
If you're so obsessed with the related cases,

125
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,960
It means this person is related to what happened back then.

126
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,520
The provisional number has been cut off.

127
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,560
If you want to know who left the mark,

128
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,680
then

129
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,560
we have to follow this lead.

130
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,080
Yeongjin.

131
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,120
What is it?

132
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,160
Nothing.

133
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,320
I know you know more about the files.

134
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,280
I want to ask you a case.

135
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,440
What case?

136
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,920
Do you know the naked body case in Kubei?

137
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,720
The naked body case in Kubei.

138
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,960
Why are you suddenly asking about this case?

139
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,440
I heard it by chance.

140
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
So I want to know more.

141
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,040
This case was one of the last cases

142
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,720
my father investigated before he died.

143
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,720
Do you know

144
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,760
the case back then?

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,080
He must have just joined the police force.

146
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,320
I'm not sure if he's been in touch.

147
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,040
Can we get the files out now?

148
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,440
I've read all the files

149
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,520
I've read it countless times.

150
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,440
If you just want to know more about the case,

151
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,080
I can tell you first.

152
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,320
Uncle Xiao.

153
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,160
Coming.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,760
Tea

155
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,320
Thank you.

156
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,200
Li.

157
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,520
Captain Lu.

158
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,840
Tell me.

159
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,120
About what?

160
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,640
The victim was a woman.

161
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,080
There are many cuts on her body.

162
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,280
This morning when an old man went up the mountain for morning exercise,

163
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,240
and called the police.

164
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,760
This could be the heavy rain

165
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,920
the body rushed out.

166
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,400
There was no evidence

167
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,520
nothing can prove

168
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,600
that can prove her identity.

169
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,800
Her fingerprints and teeth were also damaged.

170
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,520
The culprit has strong anti-detection ability.

171
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,280
When was the time of death?

172
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,320
The body was too rotten.

173
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,440
The surrounding environment has a great impact on the body.

174
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,840
Currently, we've concluded that

175
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,240
for about a week.

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,600
Cao Jin.

177
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,600
Go check it out.

178
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,440
In this city,

179
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,200
within a week,

180
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,360
in a week.

181
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,160
Yes, Master.

182
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,640
Sister-in-law.

183
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,400
Officer Lu.

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,880
Sorry to bother you.

185
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,200
Is there any news

186
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
Any news?

187
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,480
Sister-in-law.

188
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,760
Calm down.

189
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,760
We've sent the police

190
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,800
to search.

191
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,800
Besides,

192
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,720
have you found

193
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,440
Have you found it?

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,560
Yes.

195
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,680
It's in his office.

196
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,960
I'll send it to you.

197
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,280
Don't bother.

198
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,520
Take care of yourself.

199
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,120
It's in his office.

200
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,600
I'll go get it myself.

201
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,440
The key is

202
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,960
under the flower pot at the door?

203
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,920
The document is on the desk.

204
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,200
The store is a mess.

205
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,120
I don't know.

206
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,840
if it's related to his disappearance.

207
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,160
I didn't dare to clean it up.

208
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,440
Please go over there.

209
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,960
Captain Lu.

210
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,200
Don't worry, sister-in-law.

211
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,760
What's wrong?

212
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,360
Master.

213
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,320
Before this,

214
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,680
a detective colleague

215
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,840
who resigned

216
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,880
he resigned.

217
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,920
He started a information consultation company

218
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,520
to do some information consultation business.

219
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,000
He called me

220
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,960
He said he had something important for me.

221
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,200
But that day,

222
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,080
he didn't show up.

223
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,200
He's not answering his phone either.

224
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
About a week

225
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
about a week.

226
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,120
Let's go.

227
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,480
Captain Lu.

228
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,160
You're back.

229
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,440
After you left,

230
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,320
we received

231
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,840
a tip-off call related to the case.

232
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,920
The informant said

233
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
he accidentally saw a man

234
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,480
he accidentally saw a man

235
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,640
a silver Nissan Heyi

236
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,840
at Road A3.

237
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,360
There's blood on his body.

238
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,440
The face and characteristics described

239
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,120
looks like the missing Wu Fei.

240
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,040
Who is the informant?

241
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,040
He doesn't want to reveal his real name.

242
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,640
To be safe,

243
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,880
I tried my best to convince him to report it.

244
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,320
But he didn't want to cause any trouble.

245
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,840
he just left a ID number

246
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,800
He doesn't want to come out.

247
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,440
I can't get in touch with him.

248
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,760
Did you check his ID number?

249
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,920
Yes.

250
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,280
a psychologist named Luo Yin.

251
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,160
But we can't

252
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,480
we can't get in touch with him.

253
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,480
Let's check the CCTV footage of A3.

254
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,600
and see if the informant

255
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,520
is real.

256
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,080
Okay.

257
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,560
The autopsy report is out.

258
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,160
The time of death was around seven.

259
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
I looked into

260
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,760
there were three missing women

261
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
in the last week.

262
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,120
But all three of them

263
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,600
over 60 years old.

264
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,680
According to the forensic,

265
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,520
The victim's bone age

266
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,200
between 30 to 35.

267
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,280
The time doesn't match.

268
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,960
Expand the search area.

269
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,200
Since there are no requirements in this city,

270
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,320
then expand to the neighboring city.

271
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,160
Time period.

272
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,720
to the missing women within two weeks.

273
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,160
If we still can’t find the source of the body,

274
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,160
turn around and check the suspect.

275
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,160
Okay.

276
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,080
Wait.

277
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,320
Check Wu Fei's call history.

278
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,800
and his bank account.

279
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,360
Okay.

280
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,200
I'll check it now.

281
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,080
Master.

282
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,520
This road A3

283
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,240
is only 1 km away from the corpse dumping site.

284
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
And Wu Fei showed up

285
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,720
at this time.

286
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,280
Then Wu Fei went missing.

287
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,200
That means...

288
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,760
Before it's confirmed,

289
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,920
before we confirm.

290
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,080
I'm not.

291
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:11,920
You mean this?

292
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,640
Captain Lu.

293
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,800
[There's a number]

294
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,680
one of the numbers

295
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,000
contacted him frequently recently.

296
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,840
After the incident, this number has lost contact and powered off.

297
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,680
The contact is Jin Jie.

298
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,520
is a researcher

299
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,320
who works in my city.

300
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,600
His family reported a case in his hometown.

301
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,240
we didn't find anything

302
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,120
we didn't find anything.

303
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,800
The missing time matches the time of death.

304
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,840
The staff unit.

305
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,800
Why didn't you report it?

306
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,200
They said they've resigned 25751.

307
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,960
They said they've resigned.

308
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,720
They said they've resigned 25751.

309
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,520
Wu Fei's ID

310
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,840
and bank account.

311
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,720
I've checked.

312
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,560
Wu Fei's ID and bank account 751.

313
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,640
I haven't used 5751 for a while.

314
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,040
I haven't used it for a while.

315
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,440
Look.

316
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,120
It's been a week. It's been a week.

317
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,520
a 100,000 won cash

318
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,920
into his account.

319
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,640
Master.

320
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,800
Master.

321
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,000
Look.

322
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,040
The model and plate number

323
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
matches Wu Fei's.

324
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,400
He did stop here for a while.

325
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,120
But

326
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,480
wearing a hat all the way.

327
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,520
I can't see his face.

328
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,400
We need to find Wu Fei's car as soon as possible.

329
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,040
Wu Fei

330
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,400
did everything for money.

331
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,240
What's wrong, master?

332
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,080
Wu Fei is so bold.

333
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,880
He even dares to be a private detective.

334
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,280
A detective?

335
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
You broke the law.

336
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,200
Look again.

337
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,920
to see if there's anything useful.

338
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,880
Hello?

339
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
Hello. Hello.

340
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,640
Hello.

341
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,640
I'm from the car repair shop.

342
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,440
When will you get the car

343
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,160
when will you get it?

344
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,320
We really have no place to put it here.

345
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,160
Hello

346
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Repairing or washing?

347
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,200
Police.

348
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
We just talked on the phone.

349
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,280
Where is the car?

350
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,160
Officer,

351
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,320
This is the car.

352
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,600
After the owner drove here,

353
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,240
since the owner came.

354
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,280
I said to call.

355
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,120
I couldn't reach him either.

356
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,320
Didn't the owner tell you where to fix it?

357
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,280
I cleaned the car's accessories,

358
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,360
and paint.

359
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,080
I think this car is quite nice.

360
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,920
He spent money.

361
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,960
So I didn't ask much.

362
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,800
The car owner didn't say when he'll pick it up.

363
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
He said he'd call him when it's fixed.

364
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,920
But we haven't been in touch.

365
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,400
Cao Jin.

366
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,480
Open the trunk.

367
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,640
This trunk

368
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,240
We also cleaned it carefully.

369
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
This is the customer's stuff

370
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,640
We won't touch it.

371
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,680
Find Wu Fei

372
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,640
to find Wu Fei as soon as possible.

373
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:14,760
Yes.

374
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,400
Master.

375
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,000
It's clean.

376
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,680
Captain Lu.

377
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,880
The blood sample

378
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
from Wu Fei's car

379
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,240
and the DNA of the victim of the naked corpse case.

380
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
and the DNA sample of Jin Jie,

381
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,640
have been sent over for comparison.

382
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,800
It will take about two to three weeks.

383
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,840
Okay.

384
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,680
Got it.

385
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,080
When can the technology develop?

386
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,720
It only takes two or three hours.

387
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,240
Master.

388
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,000
According to the CCTV,

389
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Wu Fei's car went to the old residential area first.

390
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,440
Then he went to the dumping site.

391
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,560
and then went to the garage.

392
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,280
Is it possible

393
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,080
could be

394
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,840
where the deceased lived?

395
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,600
Let's go.

396
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,520
Let's take a look.

397
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,960
Maybe we'll find something new.

398
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,960
This family

399
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,880
went out of town.

400
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,880
A few days ago,

401
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,440
a woman appeared.

402
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,680
I don't know if it's her family

403
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,920
or friends.

404
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,880
Probably.

405
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,560
On the night of the 7th,

406
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,760
the house caught fire for no reason.

407
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,040
Where is the girl?

408
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,080
I can't find her.

409
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,600
What should we do?

410
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,760
Who should pay for it?

411
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,560
What do you mean?

412
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,520
Director Zhao.

413
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,960
While investigating Li Guokun's murder,

414
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,240
I found a link to the naked body case in Kubei.

415
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,200
The naked body case of Kubei is one of the cases...

416
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
one of the cases that Captain Lu didn't solve back then.

417
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,080
Now we have new clues.

418
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
I want to ask

419
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,800
if you can

420
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,840
restart the investigation?

421
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,160
All the clues were gone back then.

422
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,240
If

423
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,800
if there is any new clue,

424
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,560
we can try.

425
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,840
Maybe Lu

426
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,440
wants to see.

427
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,960
Also,

428
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,560
when I was investigating Li Guokun's case,

429
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
I found a very talented civilian police officer.

430
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,760
I want to transfer him here

431
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,800
to help solve the case.

432
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,880
Can I?

433
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,320
If you really have good potential,

434
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,120
we can cultivate him.

435
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,280
Thank you, Director Zhao.

436
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,880
Go back to work.

437
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,280
Two weeks later,

438
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,280
the blood sample

439
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,480
from Wu Fei's car.

440
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,960
The test results are out.

441
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,200
and the DNA of the naked body

442
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,920
and the missing Jin Jie’s DNA

443
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,960
are identical.

444
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,240
The first suspect, Wu Fei, is wanted.

445
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,120
We haven’t found him yet.

446
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,680
Jin Jie’s temporary residence

447
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,120
was burned in a fire.

448
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,280
All the clues were gone.

449
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,120
So this case has not been closed.

450
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,000
All the clues in this case

451
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,080
is pointing to Wu Fei.

452
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,080
We have witness and evidence.

453
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,120
But Wu Fei disappeared

454
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,960
He's missing.

455
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
The witness can't be counted.

456
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,320
It can only be considered

457
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,200
to the police anonymously.

458
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,280
A few days later,

459
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,000
the police contacted Luo Yin.

460
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
He denied

461
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,080
He called the police.

462
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,480
and compared his wrinkles later.

463
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,960
It's not him.

464
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,280
All the clues make sense now.

465
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,600
But why didn’t he tell the police

466
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,040
why didn't he tell us

467
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,160
his real identity?

468
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Are you afraid of trouble

469
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,160
or Wu Fei?

470
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,600
But he can say

471
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,000
Luo Yin's ID information.

472
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,880
This person may know him.

473
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,400
Why do you suddenly ask about this case?

474
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,520
Marco Lu.

475
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,080
I have a new task for you.

476
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,200
Captain Lu's naked body case that wasn't closed...

477
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,240
We're restarting the investigation.

478
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,640
You and Yeongjin will take charge.

479
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
You knew it?

480
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,520
Let's go.

481
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,360
Let's go to the evidence room.

482
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,640
and meet someone.

483
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,480
Have some water.

484
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,200
Thank you.

485
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,320
Detective, we meet again.

486
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,520
We meet again.

487
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,840
Have a seat.

488
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,800
Sorry for disturbing you today.

489
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,880
We're here today

490
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,560
to ask you about

491
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,800
15 years ago, someone used your identity

492
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,400
to the police 15 years ago.

493
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,400
This is the recording.

494
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,920
I hope you can

495
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,720
recall some clues.

496
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,320
According to our analysis,

497
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,520
this person can accurately report your identity.

498
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,960
may be someone close to you.

499
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,520
Hello?

500
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,520
Hello. Hello.

501
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,680
I know something.

502
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,400
I don't know if I should tell the police.

503
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,960
I didn't really care.

504
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,200
But I saw the news today

505
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,560
a female body was found in the mountain behind Kubei District.

506
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,120
I think it might have something to do with this.

507
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,840
This voice...

508
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,040
Do you remember it?

509
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,200
No.

510
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,680
I don't think it's someone I know or relatives.

511
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,160
If it's a patient,

512
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,960
there have been too many patients these years.

513
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,480
I need to get the medical records.

514
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,200
One by one.

515
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,440
How about this?

516
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,480
I'll finish these comparisons as soon as possible

517
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,600
and give you an answer as soon as possible.

518
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,200
Okay?

519
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:40,960
Okay.

520
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:41,880
Okay.

521
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,360
Thank you for today.

522
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,040
You're welcome.

523
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,440
Thank you.

524
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,800
Thank you.

525
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,600
We'll get going.

526
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,680
Hello, Dr. Na.

527
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,240
Dr. Na.

528
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,760
Hello.

529
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,360
Doctor Luo.

530
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,400
Hello.

531
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,160
Hello.

532
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,800
Doctor Luo.

533
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,840
Hello.

534
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,040
Jang Geon-min.

535
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,120
How do you feel?

536
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,640
I feel

537
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,160
Much better.

538
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,280
But

539
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,520
sometimes I feel a little anxious.

540
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,320
A little.

541
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,120
It's okay.

542
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,800
Relax.

543
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
I checked the record.

544
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,640
After taking the medicine,

545
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,960
I'll give you another treatment.

546
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,000
Doctor Luo.

547
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,280
I...

548
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,800
have you approved

549
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Is it approved?

550
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,240
Here's the thing.

551
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,040
Your theft

552
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,800
your anxiety disorder.

553
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,960
When you're in prison,

554
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,640
Take medicine at normal time and look north.

555
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,120
He's getting better. Look north.

556
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,640
This is a good start. Look north.

557
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,720
So I think

558
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,680
after you recover

559
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,640
after you recover,

560
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,760
after you recover.

561
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,280
Okay?

562
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,400
It’s good for you

563
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,280
It's a good thing for you.

564
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,360
Doctor Luo,

565
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,640
I've changed it.

566
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,360
I promise

567
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,480
I will never steal again. I understand.

568
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,400
Listen to me.

569
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,200
Let's make an example.

570
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,840
You're out now.

571
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,320
Look at everything in the prison.

572
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,560
the schedule, daily schedule, and the north.

573
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,840
They're all following the rules.

574
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,040
You can take medicine and rest regularly.

575
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,240
