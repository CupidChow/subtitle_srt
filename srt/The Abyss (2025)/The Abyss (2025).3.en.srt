1
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
Get him! Get him!

2
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,600
Move.

3
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,160
Back.

4
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,079
Thank you 025196

5
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,440
One. Thank you.

6
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,680
Let's go.

7
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,600
Ning Zhen.

8
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,680
Our director

9
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,160
got a call from the police.

10
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,840
saying you caught a thief.

11
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,200
Tell me.

12
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,640
How did you know

13
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,600
That delivery man was also a thief.

14
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,160
I heard someone looking for the key.

15
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,880
And there was no takeout

16
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,360
on the delivery.

17
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,000
When Kylin knocked,

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,320
the people inside didn't open the door.

19
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,960
So I guess

20
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,160
understood some code,

21
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,120
and ran away.

22
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,560
You're amazing.

23
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,720
By the way,

24
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,680
The warden was looking for you.

25
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,240
Take it back for me.

26
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,520
Okay.

27
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:10,760
Go.

28
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,280
Thank you.

29
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,720
Come in.

30
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,160
Chief.

31
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,920
Are you looking for me?

32
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,480
Ning Zhen.

33
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,160
Just now,

34
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,480
two calls just now.

35
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,320
One is to praise you.

36
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,360
But the other one complained about you.

37
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,079
You probably know what happened.

38
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,480
Yes.

39
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,760
You punk.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,680
You're a good detective.

41
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,360
But

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,240
you have to pay attention to the way.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,400
I know what you care about.

44
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,560
I have a task for you.

45
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,840
to visit our community.

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,360
They'll be released soon.

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,400
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,880
Go.

49
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,760
Coming

50
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,840
Hello.

51
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,160
Are you Li Guokun's family?

52
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,640
Officer,

53
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,560
What is it?

54
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,520
I'm Yeongjin from Pyeongsung Street Police Station.

55
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
I'm here to visit

56
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,320
after Li Guokun was released.

57
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,480
He doesn't live here anymore.

58
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,360
Don't be nervous.

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,880
Why are you here?

60
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,680
This is from the city police force.

61
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,040
We came together.

62
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,880
It's just a routine.

63
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,920
It won't take long.

64
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,880
Come in.

65
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
Who's here?

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,880
Police.

67
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,400
Excuse me.

68
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,159
Have a seat.

69
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,320
Thank you.

70
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,480
Thank you.

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,400
There are no tea leaves at home.

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,600
Have some water.

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,720
Thank you.

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,800
We're here to know

75
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,680
after Li Guokun was released.

76
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
Let's eat dumplings tonight

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,720
My mom chopped the stuffing now.

78
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,080
or if he has any difficulties in life.

79
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,480
We also want to help him

80
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,840
into society and family as soon as possible.

81
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,040
After Guokun came back,

82
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,920
he has completely changed.

83
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,440
Talking and doing things amicably

84
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,080
Work hard too

85
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,840
Relax.

86
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,240
He really has completely changed it.

87
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,159
I understand.

88
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,400
How is Li Kun's relationship with his ex-wife?

89
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,159
Did they contact after he was released?

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,120
Don't mention it.

91
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,440
Feng Xiaojuan

92
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,159
is not easy to deal with.

93
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,640
She looks down on my brother,

94
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,920
but she's always with people outside.

95
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,560
If it weren't for her,

96
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,120
would have forced my brother to do this.

97
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
After he was released,

98
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,000
after he was released.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
I came here twice a few days ago.

100
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,400
I came to see my mom.

101
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
When did you come?

102
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,920
The day before yesterday.

103
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,840
I drove my mom

104
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,560
and walked around the city.

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,520
Drive.

106
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,880
Where did he get the car?

107
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
He bought a car?

108
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,600
No.

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,480
He rented the car.

110
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,080
Li Guokun's ID card

111
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,800
has expired during his sentence.

112
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
Even if we do it now,

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,240
we won't be able to get off.

114
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,240
How did you rent it?

115
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,120
He rented it with my ID card.

116
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,520
When did he return the car?

117
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,000
How would I know?

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,240
It's all his business.

119
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,400
Do you know any rental company?

120
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,159
Why?

121
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,159
So detailed

122
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Do you think Guokun stole the car?

123
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,840
If anything happens,

124
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,520
you come to my house and ask.

125
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,440
If anything happens,

126
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:39,880
Don't worry.

127
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,560
Brother.

128
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,120
We want to know about 025196.

129
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,320
after Li Guokun was released 025196

130
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,240
I'm worried that he doesn't have an ID card.

131
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,440
It's hard to find a job.

132
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,440
Seung-ja.

133
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,800
There's no vinegar.

134
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,640
Buy me a bottle of vinegar.

135
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,159
Got it.

136
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,400
Guys.

137
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:55,960
Mr. Li.

138
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,360
One last question.

139
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,680
Go ahead.

140
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,800
When his house was demolished,

141
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,200
Li Guokun hasn't come out yet.

142
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,960
Where are his things?

143
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,640
Now,

144
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,280
Feng Xiaojuan took all the valuable things.

145
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,200
The rest is useless.

146
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,960
I put them in my storage room.

147
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,240
Can we take a look?

148
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,320
Let's go.

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,760
Right here.

150
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,640
Help yourself.

151
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,800
I need to buy vinegar.

152
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,640
Thank you.

153
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,400
Thank you.

154
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,760
Why are you here?

155
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,600
Do you have other intentions?

156
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,920
No.

157
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,880
I'm warning you.

158
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,200
Leave now.

159
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,280
Marco Lu.

160
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,320
Let go of me first.

161
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,360
Are you coming or not?

162
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,560
No.

163
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,760
I know where the body was dumped.

164
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,720
It's a clear place.

165
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,760
The house before Li Guokun demolished

166
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,160
is close to the suburb park near the dumping site.

167
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,760
And the signature location in this photo

168
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,240
is probably

169
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,080
where they used to date.

170
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,400
If Li Guo Kun is the murderer,

171
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,760
he might choose

172
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,360
to dump the body in such a meaningful place.

173
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,280
Where are you going?

174
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,440
To find the dumping site.

175
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,720
The dumping site is by the river.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
The body was thrown into the river.

177
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,000
Other than surveying on the ground,

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,720
we need someone to go down the river to find evidence.

179
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,440
How can you do it alone?

180
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,160
I don't think I need it.

181
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,440
Teach me how to investigate.

182
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,720
This might be the dumping site.

183
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,240
Let's go.

184
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,280
Where are we going?

185
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,480
Didn't you want to check Li Guo Kun's car?

186
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,480
You're trying so hard.

187
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,320
This could be the dumping site.

188
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,160
Team 1.

189
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,120
Follow me.

190
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Hongcheng Rent.

191
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,600
The last one nearby.

192
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,080
Let's go in.

193
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,080
Boss.

194
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,600
Can I ask you about someone?

195
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,760
Police.

196
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,520
Officer,

197
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,080
I was busy just now.

198
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,000
I didn't see you.

199
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,520
What can I do for you?

200
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,280
Please check

201
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,800
if there are any rental records of this person.

202
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,240
Okay.

203
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,400
I still remember this ID.

204
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,680
Not many people come here to rent a car.

205
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,080
If he didn't bring his ID,

206
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,480
I would have looked at him more.

207
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,400
Is it this person?

208
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,160
Yes.

209
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,960
That's him.

210
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,480
025196.

211
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,040
Officer,

212
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,000
I found it.

213
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,800
This is...

214
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,000
the morning of the 21st.

215
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
at 9:28 a.m.

216
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
The day before yesterday.

217
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,880
It was 9 a.m. on the 22nd.

218
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,720
The car.

219
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,920
Where is the car now?

220
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,080
It's rented out.

221
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,080
10 a.m. this morning.

222
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,040
I just rented it out.

223
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,840
Tell him to come back.

224
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,800
Call him now.

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,920
All teams, report the search.

226
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
Team 2 is not here.

227
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,800
Report!

228
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
No one in the third team.

229
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,080
The four teams don't have one yet.

230
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,800
Team 1.

231
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,280
Team 1 speaks.

232
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,040
I'm in the middle.

233
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,320
I suspect this is the dumping site.

234
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,520
Body dumping site?

235
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,000
Captain Cao.

236
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,960
Captain Cao, I can't hear you.

237
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,040
I'm disturbing you.

238
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,280
I’ll talk to you later.

239
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,360
Tao Zi.

240
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Is this the car?

241
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,640
Yes.

242
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,440
This is the car.

243
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,960
Hello, officer.

244
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
I came back immediately

245
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,200
as soon as I got the call.

246
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,160
Is there a problem with this car?

247
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But don't worry.

249
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
We just want to know

250
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,080
where you've been while using the car.

251
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,400
Any other passengers?

252
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,680
I'm here for business.

253
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,520
It's more convenient to rent a car.

254
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,840
It took only a few hours

255
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,240
from 10 a.m.

256
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,080
I only went to the business area in the east of the city.

257
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,560
I just came back from there.

258
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,480
Just me.

259
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,920
No one has ever taken this car.

260
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,240
Okay.

261
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,240
Okay.

262
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,320
Okay.

263
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,880
Let's go.

264
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,080
Yes, sir.

265
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,840
Boss.

266
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,720
I need a car.

267
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,840
Please get me another one.

268
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,600
Okay.

269
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,080
Sorry.

270
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,680
Come on.

271
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,800
Let's change another car.

272
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,520
What do you think?

273
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,400
The car has been cleaned.

274
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,600
Li Guokun is really...

275
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,720
Ask your Tao

276
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,400
to send this car to the technical team.

277
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,080
You teach me again?

278
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,680
Tao Zi.

279
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,120
Sir.

280
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,000
How is it?

281
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,760
Almost.

282
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,000
Get up.

283
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,520
Kris.

284
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:26,960
Kris.

285
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,320
Why are you with him?

286
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,840
Captain Cao asked me to investigate him.

287
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,040
It's time to investigate him.

288
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,480
Go ahead.

289
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,320
Leave me alone.

290
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,360
Put the car here.

291
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,240
I'm leaving.

292
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,160
Why is it so hard for you to help me?

293
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,200
Will you help me?

294
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,520
No.

295
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,160
Sister.

296
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,240
You and Captain Cao...

297
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,880
You two quarreled.

298
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,840
Shut up. Can you...

299
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,320
How's the investigation?

300
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,400
In the river.

301
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,440
There are a lot of garbage and mud.

302
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,320
It takes some time to find out

303
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,360
which are related to the case.

304
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,680
How did you know?

305
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,080
We'll talk after we find it.

306
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,160
How long will this car be tested?

307
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,840
Kris.

308
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,800
I'll apply for an emergency check.

309
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,760
Okay.

310
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,320
This is the place

311
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,120
when I was a kid.

312
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,840
There's something I don't understand.

313
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,440
You'll feel better here.

314
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,880
As the old saying goes,

315
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,720
time is the best medicine.

316
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,680
Some things

317
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
are engraved in life.

318
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,040
It's slowly fermenting

319
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,560
and ferment slowly.

320
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,120
I can't figure it out

321
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,560
and I can't forget.

322
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,440
Me too.

323
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,160
I couldn't let go,

324
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,320
So when something

325
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
hope,

326
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,920
I will try my best to catch it.

327
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,440
Now Li Guokun is released.

328
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,280
is my hope.

329
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,840
What about you?

330
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,240
Why do you hate Li Guo Kun so much?

331
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
My dad's death is related to him.

332
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,120
What time is it?

333
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,360
I need to rush the test results.

334
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't know.

335
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,720
The watch is broken.

336
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,400
Why are you wearing it?

337
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,080
Although the watch is broken,

338
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,320
but it has been working in my heart.

339
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,360
No matter what the truth will be,

340
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,480
I hope you can live well.

341
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,080
You have a long way

342
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,880
a long way to go.

343
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,080
Don't always look down at the shadow under your feet.

344
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,560
Raise your head.

345
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,480
Look at the sun

346
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,040
Because the person who gave me the watch

347
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,880
is a ray of light in my dark life.

348
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,720
My dad has the same watch.

349
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,000
It was repaired and repaired.

350
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,880
It took a long time.

351
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,480
The person who gave you the watch...

352
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,400
any clues?

353
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,400
Kris,

354
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,400
The car has been cleaned thoroughly.

355
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,760
and the car was dismantled.

356
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,720
It's useless.

357
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,720
There's no trace of blood.

358
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,640
and micro substance.

359
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,839
There is no evidence

360
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,560
in this car.

361
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,839
What about the dumping site?

362
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,760
The salvage brought back

363
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,800
are testing one by one.

364
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,720
But

365
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
Don't get your hopes up.

366
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Even if there is evidence,

367
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,360
the river water and garbage might have destroyed it.

368
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,880
Okay.

369
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,800
Lee Kwok-gon.

370
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,000
The bank is poor. [or check the victim's repayment ability.] or pay the cost of the cost,

371
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,960
Aunt.

372
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,840
Take a look at this.

373
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,160
This is a publication.

374
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,120
to prevent cyber fraud.

375
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,160
Just scan the QR code.

376
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,080
Take care.

377
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,720
Aunt.

378
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,120
Aunt.

379
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,800
Take a look.

380
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,680
We're now doing the publication

381
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,800
to prevent telecom fraud.

382
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,000
Come to the police station if you need anything.

383
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,880
Just call me Nid.

384
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,400
Take care.

385
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,920
What are you doing here?

386
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,960
Commercial publicity.

387
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,040
to prevent telecom fraud.

388
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,280
No more investigation?

389
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:33,960
Then...

390
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,480
Scan the QR code.

391
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,320
Real name certification.

392
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Don't fill it up.

393
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,360
Aunt.

394
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,840
Here.

395
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,480
Aunt.

396
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,000
Let's take a look.

397
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,880
Now it's a publication

398
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,320
to prevent telecom fraud.

399
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,480
Hello?

400
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,480
Kris.

401
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,520
You are amazing.

402
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,960
Did you see the photo I sent you?

403
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,080
What photo?

404
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,120
I haven't checked my phone yet.

405
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,320
There was a pair of shoes

406
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
a pair of shoes were detected.

407
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,600
belongs to the victim.

408
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,360
I'm hanging up.

409
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,840
I have to give the report to Captain Cao.

410
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,080
Ning Zhen.

411
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,000
What's wrong?

412
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,120
I found a pair of shoes.

413
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,400
belonged to the deceased.

414
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,360
This isn't the dumping site.

415
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,000
This is the first crime scene.

416
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
This will overthrow

417
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,680
his alibi.

418
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,240
Captain Cao.

419
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,120
We followed what you found.

420
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,360
at 23:15,

421
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,600
The footage of the suspect

422
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,680
When we were checking the suspect's route,

423
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,040
we found the suspect

424
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,120
from the community.

425
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,240
It's an old neighborhood.

426
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,560
There are no cameras in the building.

427
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,240
So we can't prove

428
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,880
the suspect entered the victim's house.

429
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,600
And at night,

430
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,680
at 7:50 p.m.,

431
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,080
the victim went out.

432
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,640
and never came back.

433
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,440
The victim went out an hour before the incident

434
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,720
and never came back.

435
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
but died at his home.

436
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,200
Then,

437
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,120
was dumped in the lake in the suburb park.

438
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,400
The suspect was found dead

439
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,600
at 23:15,

440
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,120
to the crime scene.

441
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,360
The time

442
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,480
are all wrong.

443
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,520
Captain Cao.

444
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,040
I found something.

445
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,200
Our biggest mistake

446
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,320
is Li Guokun's alibi.

447
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,120
The last time

448
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,200
appeared in the fruit supermarket

449
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,840
was 8:35 p.m.

450
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,080
But we estimate the time of death

451
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,360
was between 9:10 p.m.

452
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,720
to 9:30 p.m.

453
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,640
Even if Li Guokun

454
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,040
from the fruit supermarket,

455
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,600
we'll get to the victim's house in the fastest way.

456
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,000
It also takes an hour and a half.

457
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,200
This doesn't match the time of death.

458
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,560
That's the alibi of Li Guokun.

459
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,120
But this premise

460
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,040
is the victim's home.

461
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,160
This must be the first crime scene.

462
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,440
That's all.

463
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,600
The dumping site is the first crime scene.

464
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
The victim's house was fabricated later.

465
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,880
Li Guokun.

466
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,560
There's no alibi.

467
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,600
Look.

468
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,680
If the victim was killed at home,

469
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,960
and thrown into the river,

470
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,080
Then why did she wear the shoes that went out 25196

471
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,160
Let's push it upside down.

472
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,840
If Li Guo Kun used the termination fund

473
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,360
or other ways

474
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,160
to meet the deceased

475
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,120
where he used to date.

476
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
and killed him.

477
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,160
and put it

478
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,840
in the suitcase prepared beforehand.

479
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,000
When we see the suitcase,

480
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,480
we instinctively thought

481
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,000
we moved the body from somewhere else

482
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,160
before dumping the body.

483
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,680
Then Li Guokun took the key to the victim's house

484
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,000
to the victim's house.

485
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,040
and made it look like

486
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,160
the first crime scene.

487
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Li Guo Kun left

488
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,760
from the fruit supermarket.

489
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,440
It only takes 40 minutes

490
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,000
It only takes 40 minutes.

491
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,160
I can do it.

492
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,440
Besides, the car that Li Guo Kun rented

493
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,680
in the car Li Guo Kun rented

494
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,680
because

495
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,120
never got on that car.

496
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,520
Then why did he wash the car?

497
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,600
Because that car can prove

498
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,560
Li Guo Kun went to the first crime scene.

499
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,120
But there is no evidence now.

500
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,280
Ask Tao Zi to check the air conditioning system of that car.

501
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,440
Wait.

502
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,160
If the murderer killed him first,

503
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,720
and set up the scene with the key,

504
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,680
Then why?

505
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
There was only one person's fingerprint

506
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,880
on the key.

507
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,640
You mean...

508
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,080
all the fingerprints

509
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,480
were all taken care of.

510
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,880
But the key

511
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,760
on the key.

512
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,800
That's right.

513
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,880
Go to the neighborhood where the victim lives.

514
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,520
Don't come near me!

515
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,840
Don't come near me!

516
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,320
Don't come near me!

517
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,520
You threatened me.

518
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,320
You threatened me.

519
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,880
Why are you threatening me?

520
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,920
Captain Cao.

521
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,320
This is a camera

522
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,000
near the suburb park.

523
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,080
It's quite remote.

524
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,800
It's night again.

525
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,560
So there were few cars during the crime.

526
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,280
Take a look.

527
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,960
Li Guk-seung.

528
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,120
Li Guo-gon.

529
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,240
Li Guosheng.

530
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,960
Captain Cao.

531
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,160
I have one too.

532
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,440
the air conditioning report of this car.

533
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,040
What are you...

534
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,600
Li Guosheng.

535
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,400
Li Guokun.

536
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,920
I'm just doing my homework.

537
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,640
By the way,

538
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
a small amount of pollen particles

539
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,440
in the air conditioner system

540
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,440
by the river.

541
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,720
by the dumping ground.

542
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,880
is

543
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,360
is 98 percent.

544
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,760
I've checked this flower.

545
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,960
Only a lot of plants in the suburbs park

546
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,840
It's a new species imported from abroad.

547
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,920
There's nothing else.

548
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,800
Good.

549
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,480
You know how to answer.

550
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,640
Now all the evidence proves

551
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,760
Li Guokun

552
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,880
at the first crime scene of the suburb park that day.

553
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,560
We just need direct evidence.

554
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,560
Tao Zi.

555
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,080
Expand the search area.

556
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,080
Check the CCTV footage of the neighborhood.

557
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,560
The knife and keys found at the scene

558
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,680
were the victim's fingerprints.

559
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,680
It was obviously left by the murderer on purpose.

560
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,240
He must have worn gloves.

561
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,880
Check the CCTV.

562
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,800
Find the gloves.

563
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
What are you looking for?

564
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,600
Do you remember

565
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,240
the knife

566
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,440
at the victim's house?

567
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,680
You found the evidence so soon?

568
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,400
The killer left it on purpose.

569
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,560
To fabricate that was the first crime scene,

570
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,280
including the key.

571
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,160
The victim's fingerprints were only left on it.

572
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,640
to forge it.

573
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,560
No one else

574
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,440
no one took the key

575
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,640
