1
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,920
Thank you. Thank you.

2
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,080
Give it to me.

3
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,560
What happened?

4
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,560
The victim, Zhao Weiguo,

5
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,720
The body was found

6
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,880
at 5 a.m. this morning.

7
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,920
According to preliminary analysis,

8
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,200
was stabbed in the heart.

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
and died from excessive bleeding.

10
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,000
The time of death should be

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,440
between 0:00 and 1 a.m.

12
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,640
There's another thing.

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,640
the victim doesn't live in this neighborhood.

14
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,680
If he doesn't live in this neighborhood,

15
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,000
why was he killed here?

16
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,200
Let me introduce our new colleague.

17
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,880
Where are they?

18
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
Maybe they went on a mission.

19
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,120
Just stay here.

20
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,200
It's convenient here.

21
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,960
For what?

22
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,920
Open the door.

23
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,800
Close the door.

24
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,720
Print.

25
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,320
Water.

26
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
It's quite convenient.

27
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Get the interrogation room ready.

28
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,120
I'll be right there.

29
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Let me introduce.

30
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,840
Yeongjin from the police station.

31
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,160
Hello.

32
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,680
Hello, Kris.

33
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,480
Tao Zi.

34
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,760
Ning Zhen.

35
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,880
Welcome.

36
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,079
Your borrowing application

37
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,600
was signed by the deputy director.

38
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,480
Thank you.

39
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,800
What's the rush?

40
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,840
The abyss is killing again.

41
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,080
My name is Li Jing.

42
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm the "obsessive injury" on the abyss website.

43
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,960
You're the one who posted

44
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,440
saying you were raped

45
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,519
and was threatened.

46
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,760
Really?

47
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,600
His name is Zhao Weiguo.

48
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,760
I don't know why

49
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,080
the key to my house.

50
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,120
That night,

51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,720
I was already asleep.

52
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,280
He sneaked into my house

53
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,040
and raped me.

54
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
and threatened me with my photo.

55
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,200
to keep such an unfair relationship with him.

56
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,640
I just wanted to talk to him somewhere.

57
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,120
I didn't expect that demon

58
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,640
was really killed by the abyss.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,080
Where were you last night?

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,000
Did you see Zhao Weiguo?

61
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,880
Why did he die in your neighborhood?

62
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,120
Officer,

63
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,760
I didn't kill anyone.

64
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,120
He texted me yesterday

65
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,160
he would come to me at night.

66
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
I'm so scared.

67
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,800
I locked the door

68
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,680
I locked the door

69
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,880
and never came out.

70
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,840
We didn't say you killed anyone.

71
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,760
How do you usually contact the abyss?

72
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,880
I don't know any abyss.

73
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,040
After I left a message on the website,

74
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,440
since I left a message on the website.

75
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:38,960
Are you new here?

76
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,560
Copy this.

77
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,159
Captain Cao.

78
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,080
Hello.

79
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,040
Hello?

80
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,159
Say something.

81
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
Are you looking for me?

82
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,400
Who are you?

83
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,920
Where are you?

84
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,000
Come and catch me!

85
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,400
Ning Zhen.

86
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,560
We're quite busy.

87
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,560
Get to work.

88
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,240
Captain Cao.

89
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,840
This is the location.

90
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,440
Get up.

91
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,560
Call the Identification Department.

92
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,960
Scarlet inspection.

93
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,480
The culprit used the victim's phone.

94
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,560
called us.

95
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,200
Captain Cao.

96
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,360
Don't move.

97
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,320
This is the girl

98
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,880
who was attacked by the victim this morning.

99
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,600
This victim

100
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,640
is the person

101
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,200
those targeted girls' information.

102
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,080
The girls on the wall

103
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,040
are just like Li Jing.

104
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,920
was threatened for a long time.

105
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,000
I dare not call the police.

106
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,120
So this person and the last victim

107
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,640
the buyer and the seller.

108
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,640
The abyss was found

109
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,280
through the last victim Zhao Weiguo.

110
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,240
What I don't understand now is

111
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,680
why the abyss

112
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,240
with just a message?

113
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,120
Captain Cao.

114
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,280
Don't come in.

115
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,000
The victim is the owner, Kim Hyun.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,040
We also found a laptop here.

117
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,800
Bring the computer back.

118
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,560
Let the technical department crack it as soon as possible.

119
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,600
the contents in the computer.

120
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,280
The abyss may have invaded this computer.

121
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,880
Also, check

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,600
Any other victim?

123
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes.

124
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,720
This is all the clues

125
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,840
of the naked body case.

126
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,800
This case

127
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,000
has finally started again.

128
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,160
But because the case took too long,

129
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,400
the crime scene

130
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,560
was burned down and rebuilt.

131
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,480
We can only rebuild clues

132
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,320
according to the evidence left.

133
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,760
The evidence is the same as the previous evidence.

134
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,160
But we have

135
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
has changed to us.

136
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,520
My dad wrote this.

137
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,480
Don't worry, Marco Lu.

138
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,280
We can definitely complete

139
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,800
that Captain Lu couldn't solve back then.

140
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,000
Look.

141
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
In this case,

142
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,840
I think the most important person

143
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,960
is Jang Gun-min.

144
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,120
But unfortunately,

145
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,680
he was killed by the abyss.

146
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,480
Why did he report it anonymously?

147
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,720
If what he said is true,

148
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,560
why did the abyss kill him?

149
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,880
If he's lying,

150
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,120
why did the investigation result

151
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,720
Everything is as Zhang Jianmin said.

152
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,920
The commission in Wu Fei's account

153
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,320
to clean the car.

154
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,280
The blood stains in the car.

155
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,200
The CCTV footage.

156
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
This case seems to have solid evidence.

157
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,920
Besides these information,

158
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,040
we can also visit

159
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,000
the family members related to the case

160
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,200
to see if we can get any clues.

161
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,720
It's been so long.

162
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,120
Can you still remember?

163
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,280
I won't forget the important things.

164
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,400
This is Wu Ke Ran.

165
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
She's Wu Fei's daughter.

166
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,320
She was only 15 years old when the incident happened.

167
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,200
Later, Wu Fei suddenly disappeared.

168
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,080
Her mother, Du Fang,

169
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,080
died of illness.

170
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
Wu Ke Ran is the only one left.

171
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,080
If we want to find

172
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,120
her contact information,

173
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,080
to check her contact information.

174
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Wu Ke Ran.

175
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,560
Her name and age match.

176
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,200
Then she's Wu Ke Ran who grew up.

177
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,600
Why does she look so familiar?

178
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,440
Why is her information here?

179
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,200
She left a message on an abyss website.

180
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,520
Her ID is "Waiting".

181
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,320
The message is

182
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,640
I think someone is following her lately.

183
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,160
What a coincidence.

184
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,080
Cao.

185
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,760
Cao. Director Zhou.

186
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,000
Lu.

187
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,800
Where is Cao?

188
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,760
Captain Cao went out.

189
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,520
The autopsy report is out.

190
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,480
Give it to him.

191
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,400
Okay.

192
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,360
Busy.

193
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,280
Good work.

194
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,680
She's the victim who was killed in the abyss this morning.

195
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,400
She should be Wu Ke Ran.

196
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,640
Hello.

197
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,800
Hello.

198
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,840
Do you need anything?

199
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,320
We want to know

200
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,840
about the naked body case in Kubei.

201
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,080
Is there any new progress in this case?

202
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,600
I can't tell you now.

203
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,240
but I can see that

204
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,120
you want the case to develop, too.

205
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,440
Ran Ran is back.

206
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,320
Dad.

207
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,280
Why are you back so early?

208
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,839
Something good happened today.

209
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,160
What are you doing?

210
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,040
Yellow croaker.

211
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,520
Smell it.

212
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,560
It smells good.

213
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,440
Hurry.

214
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,640
Wash your hands and eat.

215
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,560
This fish is amazing.

216
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,520
It's fresh.

217
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,520
How is my mom today?

218
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:29,960
She's fine.

219
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,160
I went to bed after taking the medicine.

220
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,560
Guess what I bought for you.

221
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,200
What did you buy?

222
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,720
Begonia pastry.

223
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,560
Thank you, dad.

224
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,840
By the way,

225
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,760
What's the good news today?

226
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
Today,

227
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,720
got a big job today.

228
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
If you do this job well,

229
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,560
you'll have the money for your mom's treatment.

230
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,160
Eat up.

231
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,520
You eat first.

232
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,000
We'll split it.

233
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Don't go with her.

234
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,920
Her father is a murderer.

235
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,760
Let's go.

236
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,160
Her father is a murderer.

237
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,000
Let's go.

238
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:28,480
95 Chinese medicine.

239
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,200
Miss.

240
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,280
What is it? Is something wrong?

241
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,440
Are you a police officer?

242
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,480
I am.

243
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,800
My dad is really not a murderer.

244
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,120
Joon.

245
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,160
The police won't frame a good person, right?

246
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,640
Then why haven't you found the murderer?

247
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,800
Don't cry.

248
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,840
Well...

249
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,480
What's your dad's name?

250
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,280
Wu Fei.

251
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,920
Brother.

252
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,440
Kedye.

253
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,920
Why are you here again?

254
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,800
Brother.

255
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,480
What happened to my dad's case?

256
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,160
We're still looking for your dad.

257
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,480
Only by finding your father

258
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,000
to find out the truth.

259
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,360
What time is it?

260
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,160
Go back.

261
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,200
Captain Cao.

262
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,400
It's dyed.

263
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,920
Don't move. Don't move.

264
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,280
Captain Cao.

265
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,920
Any new progress on my dad’s case?

266
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,480
No.

267
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,520
It's like he disappeared.

268
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,680
No ID card or bank card.

269
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
No trace of life.

270
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,360
When can we

271
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,280
be reinvestigated?

272
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,800
I don't want my dad to be called a murderer.

273
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,200
and being chased by the police.

274
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,720
Reopen the investigation

275
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
we need new evidence and clues.

276
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,280
But there's nothing now.

277
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,680
We can only put it aside.

278
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Delay?

279
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,400
It's been more than ten years.

280
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,880
Why are you still putting it off?

281
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,080
Wu Ke Ran.

282
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,080
Do you remember anything unusual

283
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,720
before your father went missing?

284
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,040
Ran Ran.

285
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,880
I'll go out later.

286
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,560
The meal is ready.

287
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,680
After dinner with your mom,

288
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,280
remind her to take medicine.

289
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,080
You must remind your mom to take the medicine.

290
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,560
School is over.

291
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,920
Mom asked you to bring some food home.

292
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,200
Ran Ran.

293
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,280
I have to go out.

294
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,880
I'll give you some money.

295
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,720
Don't let your mom do it, okay?

296
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,000
Okay.

297
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,160
Are you going home tonight?

298
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,280
I'll call you in advance.

299
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,000
Pay attention to the car.

300
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,440
When are you coming back?

301
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,840
Ran Ran.

302
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,520
I have something to do.

303
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,920
so I can't go back for dinner.

304
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,160
You eat with your mom first.

305
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,280
Tell your mom to take the medicine after dinner.

306
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,520
Okay.

307
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,360
Dad.

308
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,120
Don't worry.

309
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,440
Hello.

310
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,720
[The person you have reached is unavailable.]

311
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,640
[Please try again later.]

312
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,320
Hello.

313
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,840
[The person you have reached is unavailable.]

314
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,720
[Please contact him in the form of a message.]

315
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,920
Bye.

316
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,480
Hello.

317
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,080
[The person you have reached is unavailable.]

318
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,760
[Please try again later.]

319
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,720
Since then,

320
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,600
my dad went missing.

321
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,960
He didn't raise the surgery fee,

322
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,240
and the shock of my dad's disappearance.

323
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,320
my mom's condition worsened.

324
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
and left me.

325
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,920
I was raised by my grandparents.

326
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,960
The reason why

327
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,880
to charge my dad's phone number

328
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,480
I hope one day

329
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,080
on the other side of the phone,

330
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,880
on the other side of the phone.

331
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,800
Did your father tell you

332
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,880
before your father went missing?

333
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,440
about the money in his account?

334
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,840
Yes.

335
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,280
I have a deposit of 100,000 yuan.

336
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,040
But this

337
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,920
is not enough

338
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,760
is far from enough.

339
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,640
Do you remember

340
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,320
Do you remember anything?

341
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,320
I was very young back then.

342
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,920
My mom was sick.

343
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,880
My dad rarely tells us

344
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,840
when he comes back.

345
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,720
What I just said

346
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,840
is everything I know.

347
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,680
Do you have the request?

348
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,880
A request?

349
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,960
I thought it was evidence.

350
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,320
to the police.

351
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,600
Wu Ke Ran.

352
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,240
Did you

353
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,640
on an abyss website?

354
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,320
Someone is following you.

355
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,920
I thought someone was following me.

356
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,840
but it could be my imagination.

357
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,480
Okay.

358
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,120
If you find anything else,

359
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,320
feel free to contact us.

360
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,680
Thank you.

361
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,480
Wait.

362
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,240
I waited 15 years

363
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,600
for 15 years.

364
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,880
I really want you to help me.

365
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,200
to help me find the murderer

366
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,920
and clear my father's name.

367
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,560
Are you okay?

368
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,800
I'm fine.

369
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,640
You two have similar experiences.

370
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,400
Your mother...

371
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,320
Her father

372
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,760
disappeared after the incident.

373
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,520
I understand her.

374
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,880
Let's go to the evidence room.

375
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,360
to get Wu Fei's last request.

376
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
and go to Captain Cao.

377
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,080
The person who knows the most

378
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,200
is Officer Cao.

379
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,160
Just wait.

380
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,760
Xiaoyu.

381
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,160
Who wrote this?

382
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,640
Ning Zhen and Marco Lu.

383
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,560
You're something.

384
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,200
Captain Cao.

385
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,720
Captain Cao.

386
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,680
The encrypted document in the victim's computer

387
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
has been cracked.

388
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,760
What are you waiting for?

389
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,760
Follow me.

390
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,800
Zhao.

391
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,040
Did you find anything?

392
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,800
Captain Cao.

393
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,160
This is the file in the victim's computer.

394
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
He would steal

395
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,680
the girl's wallet and key in advance.

396
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,760
Sell the key with the girl's information.

397
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,720
This includes

398
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,400
sold girl information

399
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,360
and the

400
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,000
Wu Ke Ran.

401
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,160
Open this for me.

402
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,840
Okay.

403
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,680
This girl

404
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,000
apart from the photo,

405
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,920
we also cracked his chatting tool.

406
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,440
This girl's information

407
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,520
was sold before she died.

408
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,400
According to the conversation,

409
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,480
The buyer said he can't wait tonight.

410
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,560
We'll do it tonight.

411
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,640
The abyss must have seen this computer.

412
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,880
He might kill again.

413
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,920
Did you find

414
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,040
of this buyer?

415
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,600
I got it.

416
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,320
Send it to me.

417
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,080
Okay.

418
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,200
Tao Zi.

419
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,920
Take someone to the buyer's house.

420
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,760
I'll go to Wu Ke Ran's house.

421
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,560
Okay.

422
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,440
Hello, Tao Zi.

423
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,440
Captain Cao.

424
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,840
The buyer is not home.

425
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,560
Leave two guards there.

426
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,440
The rest come here.

427
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,360
Coming.

428
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,320
You are...

429
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,680
Captain Cao.

430
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,160
What's wrong?

431
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,080
Did anyone come to see you today?

432
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,200
What happened?

433
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,320
Nothing.

434
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,880
There's a suspect near your house.

435
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,720
Don't go out tonight.

436
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:28,840
Also,

437
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,760
don't open the door when anyone comes to knock.

438
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,760
Call me if anything happens.

439
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,600
Okay?

440
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,440
Okay.

441
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,160
Take care.

442
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,840
Don't worry.

443
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,880
When will you arrive?

444
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:53,960
Captain Cao.

445
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,160
We're on our way.

446
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,280
We'll be there in five minutes.

447
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,040

451
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,880
We have a suspect.

452
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,440
Black hat, black mask.

453

454

Arrest him immediately.

455
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,720
Copy that, Captain Cao.

456
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,840
Don't move.

457
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,040

462

The suspect ran downstairs.

466
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,920
It could be an abyss.

467
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,880
Abyss?

468
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,000
