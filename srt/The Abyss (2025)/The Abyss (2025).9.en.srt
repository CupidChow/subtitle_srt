1
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,759
Go! Go! Go! Go!

2
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,440
Follow her.

3
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
You want to see Jiang Yan?

4
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,000
She didn't want to see us because she was busy.

5
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,560
She came this time,

6
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,840
but she left it in the car.

7
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,520
I guess she knows something.

8
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,440
She might be covering up the crime for the porpoise.

9
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,720
The flute's performance this time

10
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,800
is very suspicious.

11
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
What else?

12
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,360
claustrophobia

13
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,400
as an excuse.

14
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,640
He really has claustrophobia.

15
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,840
Ms. Jiang,

16
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,720
Do you take the elevator?

17
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,600
It's okay.

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,200
You can use it.

19
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,120
So what?

20
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,400
From now on,

21
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
use this as an excuse.

22
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,440
I think they must be hiding something.

23
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,720
What a coincidence.

24
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,040
The researcher Jin Jie

25
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,520
She used to work in Jiang's Group.

26
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,680
The car following Wu Fei back then

27
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,000
belongs to Jiang's Group.

28
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,440
And the real owner

29
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,000
is the porpoise.

30
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,200
Follow their car.

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,079
I'm going to meet Kang-yeon alone.

32
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,280
It's not hard.

33
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,840
It's dyed.

34
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,079
Why are you here?

35
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,280
Captain Cao.

36
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,360
I know you have rules

37
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,240
you can't reveal the progress of the case.

38
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,280
But I really want to know

39
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,800
It's dyed.

40
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,720
We understand how you feel.

41
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,720
When the result is out,

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,000
we need your cooperation,

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,560
if we need your cooperation.

44
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,600
It's possible.

45
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,760
I need your DNA sample.

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,800
DNA sample?

47
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,640
[Is my dad already...]

48
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,520
Wait.

49
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,080
We need an answer.

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,720
Not only that,

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,720
for the victims.

52
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,960
and for those who live.

53
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,920
No matter what the result is,

54
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,640
I want you to be prepared.

55
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,360
Prepare yourself?

56
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,519
It's dyed.

57
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,279
If you believe me,

58
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,519
wait for the notice.

59
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,040
Someone's here.

60
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,840
Those bugs again!

61
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,840
Get rid of them!

62
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,600
No.

63
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
I'm hungry too.

64
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,720
Find a restaurant.

65
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm not going back to the company.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,760
The route is not right.

67
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,080
Follow him.

68
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,400
Sister.

69
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,680
Thank you for letting Attorney Jang pick me up.

70
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,960
We can't waste time

71
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,800
just because of something.

72
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,400
The company is waiting for you.

73
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,840
Besides, you have claustrophobia.

74
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,360
How could I

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,560
let you stay there?

76
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,280
Don't worry.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,880
I won't delay the company.

78
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,760
I just hope those insects

79
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,400
stop bothering me.

80
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,640
You got me.

81
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,720
Bye.

82
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,280
I'm going on a business trip in a few days.

83
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,120
You need to keep an eye on the company and home.

84
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,760
Be good.

85
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,880
Don't worry.

86
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,440
We need your DNA sample.

87
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,480
DNA sample?

88
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,320
[Is my dad already...]

89
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,200
Wait.

90
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,760
We need an answer.

91
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,120
Hello, Aunt Liu.

92
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,800
Ms. Jiang.

93
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,840
Today is Thursday.

94
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,400
I just cleaned up the house.

95
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
Do you need me to cook for you?

96
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,400
No.

97
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,360
Go home early.

98
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,159
Put the money on the account.

99
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:38,920
We'll pay at the end of the month.

100
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,800
Okay, I'll get going.

101
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,960
Thank you. Bye.

102
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,120
Who are you?

103
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
I'll file a complaint.

104
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,720
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,760
You're a girl.

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,920
It's dangerous to walk at night if you're drunk.

107
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,960
Do you need me to take you home?

108
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,360
Don't worry.

109
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,960
I mean no harm.

110
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,720
Okay.

111
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,280
Handsome.

112
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
You're a good person.

113
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,640
My pleasure.

114
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,240
Fasten your seat belt.

115
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,680
Your house is so big.

116
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,800
Your house is so big.

117
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,720
There's a bigger one upstairs.

118
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,560
Do you want to see it?

119
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,320
Sure.

120
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,760
Let's take a shower first.

121
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,840
Wait for me.

122
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,720
Okay.

123
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,040
Put it on.

124
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,880
Is it your girlfriend's

125
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,400
or your wife's?

126
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,360
This is a little

127
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,560
my hobby.

128
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,320
Is it fun?

129
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,840
Where are you?

130
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,800
You said you'd go home for dinner.

131
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,000
It's been so long.

132
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,520
You left me here alone.

133
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,880
Where are you?

134
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,440
Hello.

135
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,080
[The person you have reached is unavailable.]

136
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,200
Hello.

137
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,880
[The person you have reached is unavailable.]

138
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,320
[Please try again later.]

139
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,200
Hello.

140
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,040
[The person you have reached is unavailable.]

141
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,480
[Please try again later.]

142
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,360
Hello?

143
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Wu Ke Ran.

144
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,680
Do you want to know where your dad is?

145
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,840
Jiang's Group.

146
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
[Jiang Hai.]

147
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,480
Hello?

148
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,760
Okay, get the documents ready.

149
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,720
I'll go to the company right away.

150
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,040
Okay.

151
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,680
Bye.

152
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,120
Morning.

153
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,160
Ms. Jiang.

154
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,320
As usual.

155
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,680
Call me when you're done.

156
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,280
OK, Ms. Jiang.

157
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,120
We've searched everywhere.

158
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,200
I couldn't find anything.

159
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,400
Was I wrong?

160
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,080
This is our only breakthrough.

161
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,160
If Wu Fei is not here,

162
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,080
or Wu Fei is here,

163
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,960
we couldn't find him.

164
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,200
our previous inference is not true.

165
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,760
Now the car lost in the porpoise is clear.

166
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,240
and his testimony is fine.

167
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,080
Everything

168
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,760
Back to square one.

169
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,080
After such a long time,

170
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,640
only the murderer knows where to bury it.

171
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,400
By the way,

172
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,920
Did you find anything

173
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,200
Did you find anything?

174
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,880
I got caught.

175
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,080
They're more suitable to be police than you.

176
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,360
Kang-yeon was in the car yesterday.

177
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,600
There was nothing wrong with their private conversation.

178
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,440
But somehow,

179
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,440
we were found.

180
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,920
So their conversation

181
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,480
are meaningless.

182
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,200
No.

183
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,800
But there's something unusual.

184
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,920
Aren't they too vigilant?

185
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,319
How is Wu Ke Ran?

186
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm just

187
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,240
in a low mood.

188
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,359
Captain Cao.

189
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,839
Go on with your work.

190
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,800
We'll watch over here.

191
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,079
Okay.

192
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,920
Thank you.

193
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,880
Kedye.

194
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,800
Where are you?

195
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,320
I'm shopping.

196
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,520
Shopping means you're in a good mood.

197
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,280
It's fine.

198
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,880
I just care about you.

199
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:43,960
It's okay.

200
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,720
Don't worry.

201
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,240
Call me if anything happens.

202
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,240
Hello, Tao Zi.

203
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,440
Captain Cao.

204
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,200
We have new clues.

205
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,960
We were investigating

206
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,280
Zhang Jianmin's bank records,

207
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,400
there was a 50,000 yuan

208
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,480
is related to Jiang's Group.

209
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,400
Who paid the money?

210
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,120
It's a porridge.

211
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,840
You look great in this.

212
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Very elegant

213
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,400
It can also highlight your figure.

214
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:15,920
Okay.

215
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,680
This one.

216
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,360
Okay.

217
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:45,920
Are you okay?

218
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,920
I'm fine.

219
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:50,920
It's okay.

220
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,080
I'm sorry.

221
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,160
I was walking alone.

222
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,320
when I walked alone.

223
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,640
I didn't notice your car coming.

224
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,640
Should I take you to the hospital?

225
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,400
No.

226
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,120
No need.

227
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,240
No need.

228
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,400
How about this?

229
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,520
can I leave your contact number?

230
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,600
If you're not feeling well,

231
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,720
you can call me anytime.

232
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
I'll take responsibility.

233
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,080
This...

234
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,960
Okay.

235
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,080
I'll scan your QR code.

236
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,920
Wu Ke Ran.

237
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,320
Are you really okay?

238
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,160
Really.

239
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,200
I'm sorry.

240
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,600
Hello.

241
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,320
Captain Cao.

242
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,120
Kedye.

243
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,920
Where are you?

244
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,240
I just finished shopping.

245
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
On my way home.

246
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,440
What's wrong?

247
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,760
I just finished shopping.

248
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,720
I saw someone

249
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,560
on the street just now.

250
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,560
It's okay.

251
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,000
Maybe I saw it wrong.

252
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,760
When you were shopping today,

253
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,280
when you were shopping today?

254
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,880
No.

255
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,800
Captain Cao.

256
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,000
Did something happen?

257
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,040
Nothing.

258
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,360
I just want to tell you

259
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,480
no matter what happens,

260
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,000
remember to discuss with me.

261
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,160
Don't take the risk.

262
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,560
Especially about your father.

263
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,800
Don't worry.

264
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,800
I won't do anything stupid.

265
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,680
That's good.

266
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,560
Please trust me.

267
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
I promised you.

268
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,800
I will give you an answer

269
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,520
I will give you an answer.

270
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,560
I know.

271
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,040
All these years,

272
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,040
I have always trusted you.

273
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,120
That's good.

274
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,400
Bye.

275
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,960
[Kang Woo]

276
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
[Are you home?]

277
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,360
[Are you home?]

278
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,080
[Are you home?]

279
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,720
Take care.

280
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,840
Aunt Wang.

281
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,160
Jiang.

282
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,200
What are you doing?

283
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,000
Clean up my basement.

284
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,080
You're much more diligent than my son.

285
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,600
Let's go.

286
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,600
Let's go.

287
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,360
Go ahead.

288
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,120
Be good, little rabbit.

289
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,080
No, no, no.

290
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,360
Mom is not back.

291
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,440
Don't open the door.

292
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,720
You're the best one I've chosen carefully.

293
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,320
You're better than all of them.

294
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,240
I'm sure you'll like it.

295
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,840
[I'm home. I was taking a shower.] I didn't check my phone. I'm sorry.

296
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Is your leg okay?

297
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,040
If anything happens,

298
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,640
I can't forgive myself.

299
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Is your leg okay?

300
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,440
If anything happens,

301
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,040
I can't forgive myself.

302
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,160
[I'm really okay.]

303
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,080
[Look if you don't believe me.]

304
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,800
[So did you forgive yourself?]

305
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,280
I can't forgive myself anymore.

306
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,280
Are you sure I don't need to take you to the hospital

307
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,000
to do a full check-up?

308
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,640
(I really don't need it.)

309
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,080
[If you really break it,] I'll make you responsible for me.

310
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,280
I'll be responsible for you.

311
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,520
So,

312
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,560
What are you doing?

313
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,120
(I'm wiping my body breast. What about you?)

314
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
I'm making dinner.

315
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
I'm making dinner.

316
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,000
[It's so tempting.] [Unfortunately, I can only eat instant noodles at home.]

317
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,360
No one cooks for you?

318
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,400
(No, just me.)

319
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,360
Do you mind

320
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,640
Come to my house and have dinner with me.

321
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,760
(I don't think it's a good idea.)

322
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,760
Don't worry.

323
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,120
Consider it

324
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,320
my compensation to you.

325
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,280
I will send you home safely after dinner.

326
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,200
We will have

327
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,520
a wonderful night.

328
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,680
Am I right?

329
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,640
(Yes, I'll take it then.)

330
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,240
Captain Cao.

331
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,360
The technical team

332
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,120
in the surveillance of a missing case,

333
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,160
in a missing case.

334
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,120
They are not sure if it has anything to do with the porpoise.

335
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,840
But as a doubt,

336
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,800
so I reported it first.

337
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,920
What missing person case?

338
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,320
The last time she met her friend was at a bar.

339
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,640
They went home separately after they got drunk.

340
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,480
There's no taxi record.

341
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,040
But I checked the CCTV in front of the bar.

342
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,960
and found that when the missing person left,

343
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,240
Kang Woo's car appeared.

344
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,760
Hello.

345
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,080
We're the police.

346
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,960
We won't hurt you.

347
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,600
What happened?

348
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,160
He's crazy.

349
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,720
He hit on me at the bar first.

350
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,920
and asked me to go home with him.

351
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,160
I don't know what's wrong with my brain.

352
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,560
He left it here.

353
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,920
You two didn't know each other before?

354
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
If I knew him,

355
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,160
Do I have to be here?

356
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:13,960
Okay.

357
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,960
Okay.

358
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,880
Coming.

359
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,320
Coming

360
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,240
Hold on.

361
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,800
Welcome.

362
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
Dinner is ready.

363
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,000
It's too hot to cook

364
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,800
I'm sweating.

365
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,480
Please come in

366
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,160
Here.

367
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,120
Too old.

368
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,960
Lost cultivation.

369
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,040
This way.

370
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,840
Wine.

371
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,400
The first cup.

372
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,800
The first cup.

373
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,000
Thank you for inviting me.

374
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,440
such a feast.

375
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,920
My pleasure.

376
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,880
Cheers.

377
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,440
Drink slowly.

378
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,520
You haven't eaten anything.

379
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,640
You'll get drunk if you drink like this.

380
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,760
I don't know

381
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,360
I don't know how cooked you like.

382
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,520
But this piece of meat

383
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
half-cooked is the best.

384
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,400
You made it yourself?

385
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,320
Yes.

386
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,240
