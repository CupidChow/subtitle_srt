1
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,080
Marco Lu.

2
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,320
He’s not dead.

3
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,760
Marco Lu.

4
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,400
Forceps.

5
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,720
Evidence bag.

6
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,960
The victim is the owner.

7
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,680
Jang Geon-min himself

8
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
has been sent to the hospital for emergency treatment.

9
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,280
Now only Jang Gun-min knows who the murderer is.

10
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,320
If the killer knows he's not dead,

11
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,600
he'll do it again.

12
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,920
Please protect the victim.

13
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,560
Check this phone card for me.

14
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,600
Okay.

15
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,800
We just found out

16
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,040
who was the witness of the naked corpse case in Kubei.

17
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,040
Someone tried to kill him

18
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,800
before we go there.

19
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,120
Why didn't you kill him before?

20
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,800
at this time?

21
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,400
Luo Yin just told us

22
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,800
the identity of the witness,

23
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,200
we came here right away.

24
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,480
No one knew who this was before.

25
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,760
I didn't kill him before.

26
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,640
If we didn't kill him before,

27
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,280
it's very likely that...

28
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,800
The murderer didn't know who he was.

29
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,600
He found this man

30
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,760
he found this person.

31
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,079
Captain Cao.

32
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,519
Captain Cao.

33
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,440
How long have you been in there?

34
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,440
Less than two hours.

35
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,440
Didn't I ask you to investigate

36
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,480
the naked body case in Kubei?

37
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,560
What happened?

38
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,000
We found the victim

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,159
we found the victim Zhang Jianmin

40
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,400
was the anonymous report

41
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,200
the anonymous report.

42
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,040
That's why we rushed there.

43
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,320
And then?

44
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,600
I suspect the murderer

45
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
left a clue on purpose

46
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,200
to lure us to the naked body case in Kubei.

47
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,800
He wants to use us

48
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,200
to find the witness.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,520
Okay.

50
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,280
I see.

51
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,520
You can go back now.

52
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,840
I'm not leaving.

53
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,880
Captain Cao.

54
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,480
You won't let me investigate Li Guo Kun's case.

55
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,240
I'll listen to you.

56
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,400
But I'm investigating the naked body case in Kubei.

57
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
You have enough evidence

58
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,000
that these two cases

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,160
between these two cases?

60
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,280
Luo Yin.

61
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,040
Captain Cao.

62
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,560
Only Luo Yin

63
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,160
who knew who he was.

64
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,440
Keep an eye on Zhang Jianmin.

65
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,720
Come with me.

66
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,600
Captain Cao.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,200
We found a phone card at the scene.

68
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,880
The number.

69
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,480
It's the same number as Li Guo Kun's last contact.

70
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,120
And there's Zhang Jianmin's fingerprint on it.

71
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,000
It could be him.

72
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,360
This number doesn't belong to Jang Geon-min.

73
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,240
The killer left it at the scene on purpose.

74
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,360
Mr. Luo.

75
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,880
We meet again.

76
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,400
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
for making you wait for so long.

78
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,360
Now you're cooperating with the police.

79
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,200
are all treated like this.

80
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
The conditions are a bit simple.

81
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,720
But in prison,

82
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,960
in prison.

83
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,440
I don't think

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,000
this kind of environment.

85
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,360
It's not shabby.

86
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,720
Wear this and it'll be perfect.

87
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
But you're right.

88
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm quite familiar

89
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,840
this place.

90
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,320
I heard

91
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,120
you spent a night

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,840
from the recording

93
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,320
for over ten years,

94
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,840
I found a real witness.

95
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,880
What gave you so much motivation?

96
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,440
Cooperating with the police

97
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,960
is the duty of every citizen.

98
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
I also want to know

99
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,240
who the informant

100
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,720
who called me many years ago?

101
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,560
I'm curious.

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,280
What time did you find this?

103
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,480
this?

104
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,040
the real witness.

105
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,960
It's late.

106
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,480
When I found that video,

107
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,160
4 a.m.

108
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,120
Four o'clock.

109
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,600
But at around 8 p.m.,

110
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,920
at 8 p.m.

111
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,080
What have you been doing

112
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,600
What are you doing?

113
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,560
Four in the morning.

114
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,600
It's late.

115
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,760
I didn't want to disturb your rest.

116
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,280
so I wanted to tell you in the morning.

117
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,720
I was very tired.

118
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,920
So I slept in the office.

119
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,280
It should be around 7:30 a.m.

120
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,760
The cleaner woke me up.

121
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
We met before.

122
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,880
Have you ever

123
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,200
have you ever told anyone about this result?

124
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,040
No.

125
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,080
Jang Gun-min was killed.

126
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,040
Jang Gun-min is dead.

127
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,480
Yes.

128
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,320
You're the only one who can do it. You're the only one who can do it.

129
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,520
only you

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,320
knew he was a witness.

131
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,280
At 4 a.m.,

132
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,600
to 7:30 a.m.

133
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,480
no one can prove your absence.

134
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,760
Three and a half hours.

135
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,040
You could have killed Jang Geon-min.

136
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,200
Theoretically, that's possible.

137
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,080
But this is just your imagination.

138
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,120
I have no evidence to prove

139
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,280
that I never left the office.

140
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,360
Do you have evidence

141
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,120
I'm at the crime scene?

142
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,920
Captain Cao.

143
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
We just found

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,880
a very strange dark web.

145
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,840
Dark web?

146
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,840
It's called Abyss.

147
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,800
Abyss?

148
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,440
Where is he? Where is he?

149
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,800
Captain Cao.

150
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,040
Can I talk to Luo Yin?

151
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,440
Sure.

152
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,200
Lu Fan.

153
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,960
Zhang Jianmin's surgery is over.

154
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,160
It went well.

155
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,640
But he's still in a coma.

156
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,800
When he wakes up,

157
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,240
when he wakes up.

158
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,880
This seems to be an open letter from the abyss to someone.

159
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,720
There are pictures of

160
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,640
of Li Guokun and Zhang Jianmin.

161
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,600
Block the web.

162
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,640
to avoid negative impact on the website.

163
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,440
Keep spreading.

164
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,600
Track the IP address.

165
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,040
We must find him.

166
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,720
Yes, sir.

167
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,200
Detective.

168
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,400
How can I help you?

169
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,680
Dr. Na.

170
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,400
I want to ask you some psychological questions.

171
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,800
Captain Cao.

172
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,880
There is an Internet expert behind this.

173
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,800
The IP address I found

174
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,720
was Luo Yin's.

175
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,400
But this IP address is fake.

176
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,680
The website wasn't built

177
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,080
by the computer of Luo Yin's house.

178
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,520
but a remote IP

179
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,000
and has been heavily encrypted.

180
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,640
In other words,

181
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,760
was hacked.

182
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,000
Theoretically,

183
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Is there a way to track him?

184
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,200
Let me try.

185
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,600
We can track the hacker's address

186
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,160
to track the hacker's address.

187
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,600
to open an interview for hackers

188
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,160
to create a virtual client.

189
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,760
to deliberately infect this wooden horse.

190
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,920
and then enter the end.

191
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,920
Find the source.

192
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,360
If we find the bug of the hacker firewall,

193
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,040
we'll have a chance to locate them.

194
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,400
Be careful.

195
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay.

196
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,880
Fix it.

197
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,520
Kris.

198
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,000
You two eat first.

199
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,000
I’ll watch.

200
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,080
OK. Thank you, Kris.

201
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,720
I’ll check the equipment operations in each ward.

202
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,680
Stay here.

203
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,080
Okay.

204
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,840
Don't worry.

205
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,200
Nurse.

206
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,960
What was that?

207
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,000
Don't worry.

208
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,280
The power went out because the electricity was unstable.

209
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,600
The backup power has been activated.

210
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,640
The electrician should have gone to repair it.

211
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,960
I need to do my rounds.

212
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,720
Thank you.

213
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,400
It's under repair.

214
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,840
Nurse Station. Nurse Station.

215
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,480
What's wrong with bed 52?

216
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,800
The medicine is running out.

217
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,160
Coming.

218
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,480
What's wrong with bed 34?

219
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,560
Come here.

220
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,560
My dad coughs blood.

221
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay, I'll be right there.

222
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,200
Nothing happened.

223
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,160
Ward 52 has changed the dressing.

224
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,880
Name.

225
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,760
Jang Geon-min.

226
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,120
Doctor!

227
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,080
Doctor!

228
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,240
Nurse.

229
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,960
Go to Room 411 right now.

230
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,760
What is it?

231
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,600
Jang Geon-min is in trouble.

232
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,920
I'm sure nothing happened.

233
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,200
Stop!

234
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,960
Hello.

235
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,040
What is it?

236
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,520
Police.

237
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,520
Take off your mask.

238
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,520
I'm sorry.

239
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,800
I can't let go of my past.

240
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,360
It's like I've been running in the dark,

241
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
but I can't find a way out.

242
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,800
When you were young,

243
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,520
when you were young.

244
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
And this kind of trauma

245
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,160
has a great impact on my life now.

246
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,160
What can I do

247
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,480
escape from the darkness?

248
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,600
Nietzsche said

249
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,360
those who fight against demons

250
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,880
should be careful of becoming a devil.

251
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,880
When you stare at the abyss from afar,

252
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,960
the abyss is also looking at you.

253
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,920
When you look at evil,

254
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,120
evil is like a mirror.

255
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,000
I look at your heart

256
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,680
Relax.

257
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,440
The darkness before dawn

258
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,960
is the darkest.

259
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,000
Just go.

260
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,040
Thank you.

261
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,360
What do you think of this symbol?

262
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,760
It's like a whirlpool.

263
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,960
also like an eye.

264
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,720
The person who drew this symbol

265
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,680
is immersed in endless darkness.

266
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,320
He wants to know the truth.

267
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,840
Revenge.

268
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,200
From a human's point of view,

269
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,520
there is no pure kindness,

270
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,680
nor pure evil.

271
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,720
It's all karma.

272
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,000
But rationally,

273
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,960
people who committed crimes

274
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
should be punished by the law.

275
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,880
It's not about

276
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,680
what you can see in the dark.

277
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,600
I care about what you want

278
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,640
in the dark.

279
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,840
No entry.

280
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:09,960
No entry.

281
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,720
Captain Cao.

282
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,720
It seems to be an overseas entrance.

283
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,360
But it was tracked back soon.

284
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,200
There's nothing we can do now.

285
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,360
Can we find other clues?

286
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,680
Although the website has been blocked,

287
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,440
I can give you a backstage.

288
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,520
You can check all the comments before.

289
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,000
903.

290
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,720
Hello, Lu Fan.

291
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,920
Hello, Captain Cao.

292
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,880
Jang Gun-min is dead.

293
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,560
What?

294
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,680
The culprit hacked the hospital's power

295
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,560
and surveillance system.

296
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,720
and injected cyanide into Zhang Jianmin's medicine.

297
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,080
That means there's no evidence.

298
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,640
No.

299
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,880
Luo Yin,

300
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Thanks for your cooperation.

301
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,560
You can go now.

302
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,680
Why did he take revenge?

303
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,680
Why did you let him go?

304
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,600
Jang Gun Min was murdered at the hospital.

305
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,400
15 years ago,

306
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,400
On the night Officer Lu died,

307
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,800
there was a witness.

308
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,560
saw a mysterious man

309
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,280
entered the crime scene with a weapon.

310
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,720
and left a special symbol.

311
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,960
This symbol

312
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,240
never appeared again.

313
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,560
Until 15 years later,

314
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,800
the crime scene of Li Guokun's murder,

315
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,200
This symbol appeared again.

316
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,040
[Soon,]

317
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,200
was Jang Geon-min's murder scene.

318
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,560
A few different cases

319
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,840
are connected by the same symbol.

320
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,960
The person behind it

321
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,760
is trying to tell us something.

322
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,040
Now,

323
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,120
with this symbol,

324
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
and a website called Abyss appeared.

325
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,120
In its public letter,

326
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,600
in its open letter.

327
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,880
There must be

328
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,960
behind this.

329
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,400
This website called Abyss

330
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,560
Before it was sealed,

331
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,720
before it was sealed.

332
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,160
This is the most important witness.

333
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,920
Jang Geon-min.

334
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,600
was killed

335
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,120
by the murderer.

336
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,560
Now,

337
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,240
the public opinion

338
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,240
is very bad.

339
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
Do you have any new clues

340
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,600
Do you have any new clues?

341
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,680
The suspect is very good at anti-investigation.

342
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,400
He didn’t leave any useful clues

343
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,280
in every crime scene.

344
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,520
But one thing is for sure.

345
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,040
he is an Internet expert.

346
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,640
I think we can start from this point.

347
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,240
Cao Jin.

348
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,600
You have to do everything you can

349
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,640
to find the murderer

350
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,920
to find the murderer.

351
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:15,880
Yes.

352
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,360
Since

353
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,720
his online name is Abyss.

354
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,080
Then...

355
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,400
this series of cases

356
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,880
are officially named

357
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,280
the abyss case.

358
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,160
Captain Cao.

359
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,680
All the clues are gone.

360
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,080
Luo Yin's computer was hacked before the incident.

361
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,840
Zhang Jianmin

362
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,080
He was murdered while he was texted.

363
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,320
we

364
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,240
became his best alibi.

365
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,680
But no matter what the result is,

366
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,080
I always think

367
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,600
Luo Yin is the closest person to the abyss.

368
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,560
Where is the evidence?

369
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,520
The only thing we know now is

370
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
an Internet master

371
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,120
the IP address of Luo Yin

372
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,800
and transferred the police's attention

373
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,080
to him.

374
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,000
That's all.

375
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,640
But he seems to be trying to prove his innocence.

376
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,960
I don't understand his real intention.

377
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,040
But he must have something to do with Luo Yin.

378
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,120
This website called Abyss

379
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,920
Although it's used

380
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,360
to announce its existence and divert the police's attention,

381
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,640
But I think

382
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,760
the real abyss is very likely.

383
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,240
using other IP

384
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,160
with other IPs.

385
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,560
I'll keep investigating in this direction.

386
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,560
You and Lu Fan

387
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,520
continue to investigate the naked body case in Kubei.

388
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,720
Captain Cao.

389
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
The abyss seems to

390
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,600
to lure us to the naked body case in Kubei.

391
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,080
Maybe one day

392
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,520
we will meet at the end.

393
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Protect Marco Lu.

394
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Protect yourself.

395
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,400
Okay.

396
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,600
Tao Zi.

397
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,640
Is the procedure done?

398
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,560
Where are you?

399
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,160
Why are you drinking alone?

400
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,880
I reported it.

401
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,800
Jang Geon-min.

402
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,560
He was killed right under my nose.

403
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,320
I’m so useless.

404
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,400
Marco Lu.

405
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,480
We are facing high IQ criminals.

406
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,120
He's more cunning than we thought.

407
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,640
Jang Gun-min, the only one who knows about him, is dead.

408
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,920
Once he committed a crime,

409
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,320
he will leave evidence.

410
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,800
I'll investigate with you.

411
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,240
Did I disappoint my dad?

412
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,400
Do you know where Hongwan is?

413
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,120
Why do you drink so much without drinking?

414
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,320
Isn't this Hongwan?

415
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,680
The moon has always been facing the earth on the same side.

416
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,080
but on the other side.

417
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,680
that will never be seen.

418
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,040
There's a place called Rain Sea.

419
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,120
The place across the sea of rain

420
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,120
is Hongwan.

421
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,520
You mean

422
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
a rainbow is after the storm?

423
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,920
You are really good at comforting people.

424
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:56,880
Marco Lu.

425
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,200
Actually, I...

426
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,480
I understand.

427
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,880
Light the stars

428
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,600
Light up my door

429
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,760
Let's sing together.

430
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,960
The lost child found the way

431
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,880
The way to come

432
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,480
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,680
If I hadn't called Officer Lu,

434
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,760
your father might not have died.

435
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,600
Marco Lu.

436
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,040
I just received a notice

437
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
I was transferred to your police station

438
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,040
I was officially transferred to your police team.

439
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,840

440

444
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,040
Okay.

446
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,280

447
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,840
Okay. Okay.
