1
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,240
Search from the back.

2
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,400
Over here. Over here.

3
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,320
Look here.

4
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,960
The suspect threw the gloves

5
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,240
he threw the gloves in the trash can.

6
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,880
Public security is usually

7
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,880
garbage cleansing at 6 a.m. every morning.

8
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,960
It's been two days.

9
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,200
Find out which cleaner

10
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
in the trash box.

11
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,120
Tao Zi.

12
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Check this for me.

13
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,320
Okay.

14
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,120
Captain Cao.

15
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
I got the gloves.

16
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,160
Take it back to the station for testing now.

17
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,400
Okay.

18
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,160
(Found it)

19
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,680
I found it.

20
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,880
Let's go.

21
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,840
In the gloves found in the old man's house,

22
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,200
Li Guo Kun's fingerprints were separated.

23
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,880
and the victim's blood.

24
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,680
Let's go now.

25
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,800
Arrest Li Guokun immediately.

26
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,000
Captain Cao.

27
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,080
No one is here.

28
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,720
Hurry up.

29
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,360
Send more men.

30
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,400
Release a warrant.

31
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,800
Train station, train station, highway intersection,

32
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,360
Search thoroughly.

33
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,760
Get Li Kun as soon as possible.

34
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,480
Roger.

35
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,720
Why are you following me?

36
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,000
Go back.

37
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,640
It's nice to swim in the bathtub at home.

38
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,400
I don't want to swim in the bathtub.

39
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,880
Go to the river

40
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,120
Swim in the river.

41
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,880
Didn't I take you to the river?

42
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,320
Brother.

43
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,200
Where are you going?

44
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,320
We've been walking around for a long time.

45
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,800
I'm talking to my wife.

46
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,320
You can drive however you want.

47
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,440
We're on the highway now.

48
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,360
Is this the right way?

49
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,760
Sir.

50
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,960
Do you have a wife?

51
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,320
Yes.

52
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,880
Do you have a bathtub at home?

53
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,560
No.

54
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,560
You have a wife.

55
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,120
You have to buy a bathtub.

56
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,320
Who are you?

57
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Are you here for business?

58
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,480
Well...

59
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,200
Brother.

60
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,560
My car is running out of gas.

61
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,240
The service area is right ahead.

62
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,680
Can we go down and cheer up?

63
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
You can go to the toilet too.

64
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
Take a rest.

65
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,880
Okay.

66
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,160
Okay.

67
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,880
Got it.

68
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,040
Captain Cao.

69
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,320
A black car driver called the police.

70
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,440
saying he met a suspicious person.

71
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,200
Xiaoyu checked the CCTV in the service area.

72
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,120
It looks like Li Guokun.

73
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,720
Let's go.

74
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,200
Come on.

75
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,360
Get in.

76
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,120
Let's go

77
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,800
Hurry up

78
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,960
Keep up

79
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,680
Sit back. Sit back.

80
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,600
Hurry up

81
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,320
Get in the car

82
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,600
Follow me.

83
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,640
Keep up.

84
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,920
What's wrong with you?

85
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,640
How did you walk?

86
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,080
Sorry.

87
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,560
I'm sorry.

88
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:31,960
Seriously.

89
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,919
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,919
Here you go.

91
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,919
Okay.

92
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,679
Where is my ticket?

93
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,320
Did I leave it in the supermarket?

94
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,720
Maybe.

95
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,000
Come on.

96
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,520
Hurry up.

97
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,360
Get in.

98
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,920
Go back.

99
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
One, two, three, four, five, six.

100
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Okay, everyone is here.

101
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,320
Let's go.

102
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Okay.

103
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,560
Stop.

104
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,160
Stop.

105
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,680
Are you sure?

106
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,400
It's similar.

107
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,920
Thank you.

108
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,760
Aunt said a man wearing a hat and mask

109
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,560
lifted her up,

110
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,480
the ticket was gone.

111
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,520
Then the bus took away.

112
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,000
I showed her Li Guokun's photo.

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,080
She said she looks a bit like the one

114
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,840
who helped her up.

115
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,040
It should be Li Guokun.

116
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,600
Where does the bus go?

117
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,560
To Jaga City.

118
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,680
Inform the police of Jaga immediately.

119
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,440
Set up a card at the highway.

120
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
We're on our way.

121
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,160
Okay.

122
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,400
Gather!

123
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,200
Let's go to Cong City.

124
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,760
What are you doing?

125
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,000
No smoking in the car.

126
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Captain Cao.

127
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,680
Where are you going now?

128
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,920
Marco Lu.

129
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
Who asked you to come?

130
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,560
We need help.

131
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,600
I can help.

132
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,840
Li Guokun is

133
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,520
[on the bus to Cong City.]

134
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,640
We're here.

135
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,120
Where am I?

136
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,760
Traffic jam.

137
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,440
Why is there traffic jam on the highway?

138
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,600
What day is it?

139
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,760
The highway ahead.

140
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,160
Maybe we're checking your ID card.

141
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
The team is quite long.

142
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,760
We have to wait.

143
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,800
Let's keep sleeping

144
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
You can't go down now.

145
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,200
I have a bad stomach.

146
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,440
I can't hold it anymore.

147
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,440
Great.

148
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,240
Come on.

149
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,000
Go down.

150
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,800
Zhang, open the door.

151
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,920
Thank you.

152
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,640
Go down.

153
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,960
Thank you.

154
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,880
Gosh.

155
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,880
Okay, Xiaoyu.

156
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,080
Keep in touch if anything happens.

157
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,040
Captain Cao.

158
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,680
The Heavenly Eye caught Li Guo Kun.

159
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
He got off the car

160
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,560
He got off early.

161
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,960
The mountains are all over there.

162
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,760
Let Xiaoyu confirm

163
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,040
Li Guokun's general location.

164
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,360
Request backup.

165
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,200
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,800
Captain Cao.

167
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,880
I'm the captain of Nanzhao Police Station, Zhang Wei.

168
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,640
I'm here to help.

169
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,680
Please assign the tasks.

170
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,600
Thank you, Captain Zhang.

171
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,000
This is the photo of the suspect Li Guokun.

172
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,240
The CCTV caught him getting off at the highway of South Photo.

173
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,160
and disappeared.

174
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,600
It's highly possible to enter the wilderness.

175
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,000
The suspect may have a weapon.

176
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,240
Be careful.

177
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,920
Got it.

178
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,840
Clear the equipment.

179
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,760
Get ready to search the mountain.

180
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,560
Everyone.

181
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,520
Get ready.

182
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,280
Get ready to go.

183
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,040
Why are you here?

184
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,960
The leader asked him to cooperate with the investigation.

185
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,480
He came with me.

186
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,200
I'll do as you say.

187
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,120
Be careful.

188
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,880
Move.

189
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,000
The loose needle is normal.

190
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,160
They are all yellow.

191
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,920
This is obviously human-made.

192
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,360
I think Li Guokun

193
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,760
rubbing his clothes with pine

194
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,600
to remove the smell.

195
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,840
That's why the police dog didn't smell it.

196
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,960
How cunning.

197
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,280
After all, he spent 15 years

198
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,360
for 15 years.

199
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,680
He must have thought of

200
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,600
all possible possibilities.

201
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,160
Captain Cao.

202
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,560
I'll go this way

203
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,480
to take a look.

204
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
See you later.

205
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,800
Okay.

206
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,000
Tao Zi.

207
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,520
Follow Ning Zhen

208
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,640
to protect him.

209
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,920
Everyone.

210
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,320
Keep searching.

211
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,840
You...

212
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Follow me.

213
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,520
Why is he running faster than a dog?

214
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,480
I'm exhausted.

215
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,600
Are you following me?

216
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,560
Tao Zi.

217
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,400
Ning Zhen.

218
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,640
You ran too fast.

219
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,160
Captain Cao asked me to protect you.

220
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,840
Captain Cao.

221
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,320
I just found

222
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,400
in front of me.

223
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,640
Let's look for it together.

224
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,240
Okay.

225
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,320
(Keep up.)

226
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,400
We've been looking for it for so long.

227
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,440
Did we find the wrong direction?

228
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,160
Here.

229
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,760
There's nothing here.

230
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,200
They all went along the pine.

231
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,359
It should be right.

232
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,480
Let's keep looking.

233
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,319
Based on your judgment,

234
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,319
we can really find it.

235
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,119
I'm impressed.

236
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,319
Tao Zi.

237
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,440
What is it?

238
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,240
Hold this for me.

239
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,760
The inside of the shoes is clean.

240
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,480
I think it was left here not long ago.

241
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,040
Do you think it belongs to Li Guokun?

242
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,920
270, 44.

243
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,080
It should be his.

244
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,800
Captain Cao.

245
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,000
We found the shoe that the suspect left behind.

246
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,120
The exact location.

247
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,600
Okay, I'll send it to you right away.

248
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,800
This mountain is too big.

249
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,880
If he just wants to pass the checkpoint,

250
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,160
it's too far.

251
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,680
Ningdefu.

252
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,880
Li Fengzhen.

253
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,880
Captain Cao.

254
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,800
We found Li Guo Kun.

255
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,880
Cao.

256
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,280
The results are out.

257
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,640
Time of death.

258
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,720
before you arrived at the crime scene.

259
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,960
before you arrived at the crime scene.

260
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,240
to find Li Guokun before us.

261
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,480
This person must be

262
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,320
Li Guo Kun is familiar and trustable.

263
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,160
Yes.

264
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,880
He told him where he was going

265
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,400
he told him where he was going.

266
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,800
to get his help.

267
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,360
but he killed me.

268
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,800
Did you find anything else?

269
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,880
This is the drug Li Guokun carried with him.

270
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,000
The lab report of Lebra.

271
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,840
The medicine is fine.

272
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,880
It's just expired.

273
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,360
It's not working.

274
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,680
This medicine

275
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,800
can't be stopped at any time.

276
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,120
Otherwise, the condition will relapse.

277
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,360
or hallucinations.

278
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,960
I'll get back to work.

279
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,880
Captain Cao.

280
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,520
All information on Li Guokun's phone

281
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,360
has been deleted.

282
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
These are all the calls

283
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,120
from the mobile company.

284
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,440
The last number to contact him

285
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,040
is a temporary number without real name.

286
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,720
Other than the city,

287
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,160
where Li Guokun was killed.

288
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,720
Nanzhao.

289
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,440
But the phone is off now.

290
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,360
Li Guokun just left the hospital.

291
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,880
His contact is very single.

292
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,720
This number is very important.

293
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,680
It could be

294
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,880
who killed Li Guokun.

295
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,280
Find out the contact of this temporary number

296
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,440
and see if you can confirm

297
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,680
who this person is.

298
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,360
Right away.

299
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,640
Captain Cao.

300
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,200
Every time I couldn't find you,

301
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I would be here.

302
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,160
These are the files

303
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,440
that my dad didn't investigate back then.

304
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,560
Captain Cao.

305
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,600
I really want to join

306
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,760
the murder of Li Guo Kun.

307
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,280
I know.

308
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,320
But

309
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
we have discipline.

310
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,280
We need to leave.

311
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,040
No way.

312
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,600
If not,

313
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,400
it's good news.

314
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,000
At least it means your mother is still alive.

315
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,440
You have a hope too.

316
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Thank you, Dr Li.

317
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,560
It's okay.

318
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,240
You're welcome.

319
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,480
After that, the police will send a nameless female body.

320
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,760
Please call me again.

321
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,400
Okay.

322
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,320
How did you know I was in the hospital?

323
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,480
Your colleague told me.

324
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,040
What's wrong?

325
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,840
Are you sick?

326
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,640
or something else?

327
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,960
Someone went missing before.

328
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
So when a nameless female body came,

329
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,000
I'll check it out.

330
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,320
Have we met somewhere before?

331
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,760
The day Li Guokun was released.

332
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:47,960
No.

333
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,560
Earlier.

334
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,120
15 years ago,

335
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,800
on the day my master sacrificed,

336
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,080
he should have

337
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,040
go home early to celebrate his daughter's birthday.

338
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,000
But because

339
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,360
worried about a little boy

340
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,760
and rushed to the crime scene.

341
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,520
and died during the mission.

342
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,360
And that little boy has grown up

343
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,240
and became a police officer.

344
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,200
You went to see your mother, right?

345
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,000
So...

346
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,880
That day, by the river of the park,

347
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,960
by the park that day,

348
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,480
you were so nervous

349
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,120
and pay attention to

350
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,080
the mysterious symbol 15 years ago.

351
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,960
appeared again.

352
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,160
I want to restart the old case.

353
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,640
I can request

354
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,840
to transfer you to the police station.

355
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,440
Captain Cao.

356
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,760
But I have one condition.

357
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,040
You can’t tell Lu Fan

358
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,280
about the case.

359
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,440
Why?

360
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,680
What does she have to do with this case?

361
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,960
Because

362
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,560
she's my master's daughter.

363
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,880
Dad.

364
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,200
My dad has the same watch.

365
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,960
The person who gave you the watch...

366
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,600
If she knows

367
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,960
you are that little boy,

368
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,640
Guess what she will do.

369
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,560
I should have known

370
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,960
Li Guo Kun is dead now.

371
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,560
I hope she can forget the past

372
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,040
and start a new life.

373
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,840
Now it depends on what you think.

374
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,880
Hello, Tao Zi.

375
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,520
Captain Cao.

376
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,440
I compared Li Guo Kun and the last one.

377
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,400
between Li Guokun and Li Guokun.

378
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,000
I found a communication record

379
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,120
with Li Guokun.

380
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
This person is very likely to know

381
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,960
who contacted Li Guokun last.

382
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,760
Is it his real name?

383
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,000
He's a psychologist.

384
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,640
And

385
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,080
when I was investigating his information,

386
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,320
he was a witness

387
