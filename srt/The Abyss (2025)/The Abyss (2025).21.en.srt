1
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,800
[Do you have Kang Yeon now?] Yes.

2
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,400
[I want to see Jiang Yan.]

3
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,960
Who is it? It's me.

4
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,840
It's me.

5
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,640
Ning Zhen.

6
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,240
Why are you here?

7
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,800
Captain Cao.

8
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,680
I'm here for you.

9
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,240
There's something

10
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,480
I want to ask you alone.

11
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,560
Come in.

12
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,480
Have a seat.

13
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,360
I'll get you a cup of tea.

14
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,040
No need.

15
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,720
I'll leave after asking.

16
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,560
What is it?

17
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,560
The ferry took you to Wu Fei's burial site.

18
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,960
Why is the abyss here too?

19
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,040
When the flute applied for medical treatment,

20
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,880
why did the abyss know where his ward was?

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,640
When we went to Jiang's Group to find evidence,

22
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
why would the abyss know

23
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,920
We need technical support.

24
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,840
How would I know that?

25
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,880
I was the one

26
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,320
I...

27
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Captain Cao.

28
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,720
Marco Lu.

29
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,000
Only you.

30
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,720
Wu Ke Ran.

31
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,600
Are you connected to the abyss?

32
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,960
How is that possible?

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,360
Do you know who the abyss is?

34
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,000
Do you know where Jiang Yan is?

35
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,440
Give me back my phone.

36
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,360
Wu Fei.

37
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,600
Please get out.

38
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,680
Who gave you this bracelet?

39
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,640
Is it Joien?

40
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,920
Who is Joien?

41
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,040
I don't understand what you're talking about.

42
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,680
My psychiatrist gave it to me.

43
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,560
Coming. Wait.

44
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,280
I also want to know where Jiang Yan is.

45
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,680
But I really don't know.

46
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,960
I hope more than anyone

47
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,440
Jiang Yan can be punished by the law

48
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,960
and clear my father's name.

49
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,360
Officer Ning.

50
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,040
Do you think I have something to do with the abyss?

51
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,960
Compared to me,

52
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
you now

53
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,960
you're more like someone who's blinded by hatred.

54
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,600
Wu Ke Ran.

55
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,680
When you think of Aunt Liu and Xiao Xiao,

56
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,560
when you think of Aunt Liu and Xiao Xiao?

57
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
I want to see Jiang Yan.

58
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,040
As what?

59
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,160
Are you the victim's family

60
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,280
or the police?

61
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,440
The victim's family.

62
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,760
[I won't use this number again.]

63
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,680
[Who are you?]

64
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,560
Hello.

65
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,520
[The number you have dialled is not available.]

66
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,680
[Hello.]

67
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,640
[The person you have reached is unavailable.]

68
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,520
[Do you have Kang-yeon?]

69
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,880
Answer it.

70
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,360
Hello?

71
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,440
Don't hang up.

72
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,320
I know Jiang Yan is with you.

73
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Me too.

74
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,240
she is the real murderer

75
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
who killed my father.

76
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,720
I don't care who you are.

77
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,240
I beg you.

78
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,760
let me see her, okay?

79
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
I don't mean anything else.

80
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
I just want to know the truth.

81
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,800
Okay?

82
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,120
Okay?

83
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,200
Okay.

84
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,520
Who are you?

85
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,680
You're the one who contacted me.

86
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,000
You're an abyss.

87
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,840
Why do you have my dad's phone number?

88
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,880
Who are you?

89
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,000
Why did you go to the cafe that day?

90
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,440
I just went to work.

91
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,600
I didn't do anything else.

92
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,440
What time did you go?

93
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,000
Around 11 p.m.

94
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,440
Captain Cao.

95
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,520
You asked me to check Joey’s information abroad.

96
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,160
I found it.

97
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,040
His legs were cured after he went abroad.

98
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,160
There was no medical record in China,

99
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,280
so we haven’t found it.

100
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,680
Then Joien is very likely

101
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,320
the abyss we are looking for.

102
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,800
We must find him immediately.

103
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,440
Okay.

104
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,120
Captain Cao.

105
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,320
He missed.

106
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,160
Heavenly Eye.

107
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,000
Track Joien’s movement.

108
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,600
He must have Kang Yan.

109
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,160
Copy that.

110
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,440
Tao.

111
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,360
Yes.

112
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,120
No need to check.

113
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,920
Follow me.

114
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,800
Everyone, go!

115
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,200
HaiB 45689.

116
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,280
Do you like this gift?

117
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,160
Jiang Yan.

118
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,080
Did you kill my mother?

119
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,680
Where did you hide her body?

120
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,360
Joien.

121
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,440
What do you want?

122
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,240
Let me introduce myself again.

123
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,800
My name is Joien.

124
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,240
is the abyss you mentioned.

125
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,320
Welcome to my world.

126
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,040
You've been luring me into the game.

127
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,680
Why?

128
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,640
Because you and I are the same kind of people.

129
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,760
We share the same experience.

130
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,200
and the same enemy.

131
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,400
Including Wu Ke Ran?

132
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,400
All this time,

133
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,760
understand

134
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,360
for the past 15 years.

135
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,120
Instead of waiting desperately,

136
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,040
it's better for us victims

137
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
stand together

138
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,560
and bring justice

139
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,840
for our dead family.

140
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,160
I can't live much longer.

141
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,600
But you should be able to feel it.

142
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,160
how important

143
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,160
how important this day is to me.

144
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
It's good now.

145
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,040
This day has finally come.

146
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,600
I want you to witness this moment

147
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,720
with me.

148
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,920
We are different.

149
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,560
I have my own bottom line.

150
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,040
No one can overtake the law.

151
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,440
What about her?

152
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,800
You knew

153
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,440
she killed your parents.

154
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,080
But there's nothing you can do.

155
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,560
How will you punish her?

156
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,120
Think about your dead parents.

157
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,880
and the pain

158
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,920
all these years.

159
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,480
Jiang Yan.

160
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,960
Tell me.

161
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,960
Tell me

162
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,640
did you do?

163
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,520
I guess you're not going to tell me

164
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,080
to tell me.

165
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,680
Really?

166
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,560
You caught me

167
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,560
and tortured me.

168
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,640
for this?

169
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,920
I'm telling you.

170
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,640
I'm the real one.

171
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,320
Let's make a bet.

172
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,720
to see the police arrive first?

173
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,680
or mine?

174
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,040
Bet on your sister.

175
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,200
where your sister is.

176
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,480
Joien.

177
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,200
I’ll kill you now!

178
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,040
Why didn't I

179
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,800
clean back then?

180
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,640
I left you two behind.

181
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,440
Yes.

182
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,120
Among those people you mentioned,

183
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
including my mother, right?

184
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,320
Ning-jin.

185
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,960
It's time to accept your real gift.

186
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,640
Release Jiang Yan.

187
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,720
Mo Bei!

188
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,400
Come here.

189
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,720
Ning Zhen.

190
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,280
I don't want to kill you.

191
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,120
Go down and have a look.

192
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,640
Captain Cao.

193
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,160
That car belongs to Jiang's Group.

194
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,680
They are also looking for Jiang Yan and the abyss.

195
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,200
Jiang's Group?

196
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,200
I think being a bad guy

197
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,160
suits you better than being a cop.

198
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
I'm not like you.

199
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,960
Your bloody hands...

200
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,720
I'll cut him off right now.

201
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,440
You kill him?

202
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,920
Kill him.

203
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,440
What's the difference between us?

204
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,400
Jiang Yan.

205
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,280
You're such a vicious person.

206
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,640
When you killed my sister,

207
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,280
when you killed my sister?

208
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,560
You killed innocent people.

209
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,840
I am...

210
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,200
for them.

211
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,080
They are all murders.

212
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,440
Stop pretending to be noble.

213
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,440
I have no family now.

214
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,360
You pushed me into the abyss.

215
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,160
Now,

216
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
I'll wait for you under the abyss.

217
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,320
Joien.

218
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,880
Joien.

219
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,760
Mom.

220
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm home.

221
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,080
Mom.

222
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,200
Mom!

223
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,680
Mom!

224
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,600
Wake up!

225
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,080
Mom, wake up!

226
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,840
Mom.

227
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,640
Let's talk inside.

228
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,000
Take your dirty hands away.

229
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
I'm done.

230
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,680
Let me tell you.

231
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,400
I never brought a woman home.

232
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,360
That's my friend.

233
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,960
Mom.

234
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,400
How do you feel?

235
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,920
You always kick me.

236
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
I always kick you.

237
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,440
Really?

238
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,240
Let me hear.

239
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
Your mother's death

240
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,960
has nothing to do with me.

241
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,560
She has depression.

242
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,960
The third person.

243
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,440
Get out of my house!

244
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,840
What third party?

245
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,240
Your house?

246
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,360
This is my house.

247
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,560
The three of us.

248
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,960
Only you are unnecessary.

249
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,120
Someone stole my stuff.

250
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,160
The people I sent to investigate

251
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,680
are all gone.

252
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,880
Even my stupid brother

253
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,560
wants to set me up.

254
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,280
I don't like anything

255
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,600
get out of my control.

256
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,600
Since young,

257
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,440
what I hate

258
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,600
shouldn't exist.

259
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,320
As long as you help me,

260
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,840
you can set any conditions.

261
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,240
Why are you still up so late?

262
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,240
Rest early.

263
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,040
Dad.

264
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,280
Do I look good?

265
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,520
I shouldn't have bothered you.

266
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,080
You... You killed her.

267
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
Let's end this.

268
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,880
You killed her.

269
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,800
I regret

270
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,640
I regret not killing you all.

271
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,080
Shoot!

272
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,440
Shoot me!

273
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,680
I have your sister's body.

274
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,720
Joien.

275
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,760
The police are here.

276
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,680
The police are here.

277
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,120
Joien.

278
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,040
Trust me.

279
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,960
I have a way to make her tell the truth.

280
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,520
Hands up.

281
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,240
Don't move.

282
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,000
Raise it.

283
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,640
Get down.

284
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,680
Hands up.

285
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,480
Raise your hands.

286
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,640
Higher.

287
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,520
Welcome to the abyss.

288
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,360
Ning Zhen.

289
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,880
Captain Cao.

290
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,320
Let me do it.

291
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,000
Kedye.

292
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
Why are you here?

293
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,760
Yeongjin.

294
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,760
What happened?

295
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,520
Captain Cao.

296
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,160
Ning Zhen.

297
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,640
Ning Zhen.

298
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,520
Cha...

299
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,240
Tao Zi.

300
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,240
Kris.

301
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,120
What are you holding?

302
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,240
Nothing.

303
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,960
The data.

304
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,880
The test results are out.

305
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,120
Come here.

306
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,720
The result is out.

307
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,920
The gun in Mo Bei

308
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,640
was the same one that shot the porpoise.

309
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,760
The handmade gun

310
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,080
was the weapon that killed Mo Bei.

311
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,320
Joien killed Mo Bei.

312
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,240
Normally,

313
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,560
But Jiang Yan has confirmed

314
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,520
Ning Zhen and Wu Ke Ran are Joien's accomplices.

315
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,360
How is that possible?

316
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
What evidence does she have?

317
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,960
So I checked the handmade gun.

318
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,160
There was another person’s fingerprint

319
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,640
other than Qiao En.

320
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,840
Yeongjin.

321
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,440
A fingerprint doesn't mean anything.

322
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,960
It should be when Yeongjin was fighting.

323
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,480
when Ning Zhen was fighting.

324
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,960
Do you remember the burned computer and USB

325
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,520
when you were kidnapped by Mo Bei?

326
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,640
Although technicians can't

327
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,840
to restore the contents,

328
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,400
But we found

329
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,600
in the USB.

330
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,760
Joien found it

331
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,440
in the USB.

332
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,280
and kidnapped him.

333
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,360
And this USB

334
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,240
has always been in Yeongjin’s hands.

335
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,840
I don't want to think about it.

336
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,080
but if Yeongjin's parents' case

337
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,560
is really related to Jiang Yan,

338
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,880
he has a motive

339
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,040
with Joeun.

340
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,120
We also checked Joien’s personal number.

341
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,640
and temporary number.

342
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,680
I found that he has been communicating with Ning Zhen recently.

343
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,600
in private recently.

344
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,640
Ning Zhen may have a problem.

345
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,200
If you need my help,

346
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
come to me anytime.

347
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,840
Fan,

348
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,160
I have to hand over the report to Captain Cao.

349
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,000
Fan.

350
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,360
Captain Cao.

351
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Ning Zhen is suspected of Qiao En's accomplice.

352
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,520
I think Kris went to find Ning Zhen.

353
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,000
I see.

354
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,520
Take someone to the hospital now.

355
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,840
Copy that.

356
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,240
Why are you there?

357
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
The reason why you were there.

358
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,840
is the same.

359
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,440
That means my guess was right.

360
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,760
Since we have the same goal,

361
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,280
Jiang Yan is still at large.

362
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,240
What do you think?

363
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,840
Cao Jin and the others will find out soon.

364
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,880
We'll depend on our abilities.

365
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,720
to protect ourselves.

366
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,240
But I have to

367
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,520
your bracelet.

368
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,200
Why?

369
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,080
Under the black stone on the bracelet,

370
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,360
under the black rock on the bracelet.

371
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,199
The police will soon find you through the end.

372
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,159
and find out your relationship with the abyss.

373
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,280
I'll wait for the timing you're talking about.

374
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,920
Ning Zhen.

375
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,120
Ning Zhen.

376
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,920
I have something to tell you.

377
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,440
Marco Lu, I can't tell you something now.

378
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,760
But trust me. Give me some time.

379
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,160
You can go now.

380
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,160
No.

381
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,240
Unless you come back with me.

382
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,960
I have something to do.

383
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,720
I want to reveal the truth too.

384
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,000
I also want to find evidence of Jiang Yan's crime

385
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,240
and bring her to justice.

386
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,200
I want to know

387
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,920
Is Ning Zhen

388
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,400
still the same Yeongjin?

389
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,120
If you are innocent,

390
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,440
I’ll find evidence to clear your name.

391
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,120
If you really join the abyss,

392
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,840
I will send you to prison myself.

393
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,360
Marco Lu.

394
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,400
Uncuff me.

395
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,680
I won't.

396
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,440
until you come to the police station with me.

397
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,200
Captain Cao.

398
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,640
Now we can be sure

399
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,440
Mo Bei is the murderer of the porpoise.

400
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,240
Can we start the investigation

401
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,600
for this reason?

402
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,680
Where is the evidence?

403
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,520
Jiang Yan can totally

404
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,000
to Mo Bei.

405
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,480
How did the interrogation go?

406
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,320
Joien admitted that he killed

407
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,640
He killed Mo Bei.

408
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,880
The details of the crime are also very accurate.

409
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,600
We will verify his testimony later.

410
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,120
Did you tell him

411
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,440
Did you tell him?

412
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,760
No.

413
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,600
He didn't mention anything

414
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,960
in the abandoned slaughterhouse.

415
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,120
However,

416
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,360
after Ning Zhen escaped,

417
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,640
I have explained

418
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,680
of all the crimes.

419
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,000
What else do you want to ask?

420
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,640
The process of kidnapping Jiang Yan.

421
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,040
I've told you

422
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,000
what happened that day.

423
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,640
What do you want to know?

424
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,080
The relationship between Ning Zhen and you.

425
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,720
and what happened that day.

426
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,640
You guys

427
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,520
You can investigate it yourselves.

428
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,280
What are these?

429
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,800
What trash?

430
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,560
Can a trash be my driver now?

431
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,600
Ms. Jiang.

432
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,560
I’ll go find it now.

433
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Don’t be angry.

434
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,320
Ms. Jiang.

435
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,120
Such a big temper

436
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,640
It's not good for the recovery of the wound.

437
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
Captain Cao is here.

438
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,840
I haven't had time to thank you.

439
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,400
Have a seat.

440
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:24,960
You're welcome.

441
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,320
This is what the police should do.

442
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,920
Ms. Jiang,

443
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,560
Did you see or hear

444
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeongjin and Joien?

445
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,800
I've said it many times.

446
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,840
Ning Zhen, Wu Ke Ran.

447
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,640
He's with the abyss.

448
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,760
If it weren't for Mo Bei,

449
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,360
I wouldn't know where I am now.

450
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,840
How did you get

451
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,240
[Mo Bei's gun?]

452
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,840
Captain Cao.

453
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,040
Mo Bei is just my driver.

454
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,520
I don't care about his private life.

455
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,440
Excuse me.

456
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,640
Ms. Jiang needs an injection.

457
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,000
Thank you. Thank you.

458
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,000
Captain Cao.

459
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,000
You're here.

460
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,280
I bought you some fruits.

461
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,880
How is it?

462
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,800
Is the test report out?

463
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,800
What did the doctor say?

464
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
The doctor said he was fine.

465
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,120
He can be discharged after a few days of rest.

466
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,200
That's good.

467
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,840
Why did you show up

468
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,840
where you kidnapped Jiang Yan?

469
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,320
Before that day,

470
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,480
Ning-jin came to me.

471
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,240
and asked me many strange questions.

472
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,800
about what happened before.

473
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,280
about what happened before.

474
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,080
You asked me why the ferry kidnapped me.

475
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,560
the abyss was there too.

476
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,440
and asked me why I

477
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,040
push Aunt Liu to a dead end.

478
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,920
I think he was very excited.

479
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,320
I felt very anxious.

480
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,680
So I followed him

481
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
to the place where Kang Yan was imprisoned.

482
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,120
Joien caught me.

483
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,760
Have some water.

484
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,240
It's hot.

485
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,360
Do you know

486
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,040
why Yeongjin went there?

487
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,840
They don’t look familiar.

488
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,400
Okay.

489
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,480
Have a good rest.

490
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,960
I'll pick you up

491
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,120
I'll pick you up.

492
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,440
Well...

493
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:19,880
Captain Cao.

494
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,600
You eat first.

495
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,080
I'll get changed.
