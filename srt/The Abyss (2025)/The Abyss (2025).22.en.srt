1
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,080
You're awake.

2
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,920
I have the key.

3
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,720
I took care of the phone.

4
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,640
Are you crazy?

5
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Let go of me! Let go of me!

6
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,919
Yeongjin.

7
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,360
What are you doing?

8
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm going to the burial site in Mobei.

9
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,520
But I need a car.

10
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,960
My car is near the hospital.

11
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,840
But if you use it,

12
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,240
you'll be discovered.

13
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,840
I know what to do.

14
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,880
I can do the rest myself.

15
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,079
Marco Lu.

16
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:40,920
Let me go.

17
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Wait for me here.

18
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,720
Don't go anywhere.

19
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,240
Marco Lu.

20
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,560
Hand Ning Zhen over.

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,360
and ask the police for her.

22
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,440
Are you from Jiang Yan?

23
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,080
Hello?

24
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,800
Ning Zhen.

25
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:25,920
Marco Lu.

26
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,800
Where are you?

27
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,400
On the day Mobei's body was moved,

28
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,280
on the day when Mobei moved the body.

29
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,440
There's no CCTV from here.

30
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
I'm going to

31
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,240
where he was buried.

32
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,200
Get ready.

33
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
Okay.

34
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,560
Six.

35
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,560
Seven.

36
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,880
I'm here.

37
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,840
Marco Lu.

38
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,160
According to the time of the journey,

39
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,200
the journey takes

40
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,240
an hour and ten minutes.

41
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,880
And I remember Mo Bei

42
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,440
when Mo Bei was separated from the team,

43
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,800
Mo Bei and other cars were here.

44
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,360
After two hours and 15 minutes,

45
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,280
we meet here again.

46
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,480
During this time,

47
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,760
he might have moved the body.

48
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,760
Two hours and 15 minutes.

49
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,560
So many corpses.

50
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,040
The time we spent on the road

51
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,080
We only have an hour left for Mo Bei.

52
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,159
Dig out the body

53
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,480
before moving the body.

54
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,159
In such a short time,

55
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,440
in such a short time.

56
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,760
So,

57
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,200
when Mo Bei returned,

58
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
his body was in that car.

59
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,520
After Mo Bei changed the license plate and changed the car,

60
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,200
the CCTV shows that

61
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,960
his men drove the car back to the park.

62
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,480
When we went to check,

63
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,760
the car was sent to clean.

64
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,080
Then those corpses should still be hidden in the park.

65
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,320
The park is so big.

66
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,400
where can the body be hidden?

67
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,440
The century-old Tombstone.

68
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,840
Security! Security!

69
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,080
The lost car is back.

70
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,159
It's at the gate.

71
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,520
Who are you?

72
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,440
Stand there.

73
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,600
Security! Security!

74
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,960
Help!

75
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm asking you.

76
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,120
Hurry up.

77
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,040
Tao Zi.

78
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,520
Have you found Marco Lu?

79
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,960
Kris’s car has been parked near the hospital.

80
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,800
It hasn’t been turned on yet.

81
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,920
We're checking the CCTV.

82
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,120
Okay.

83
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,400
Jiang's Group.

84
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,280
Let's go now.

85
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,200
Yes.

86
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,360
How did you know it was here?

87
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,080
I went through the route

88
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
I went through it again.

89
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,799
According to the estimated time,

90
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Where is Yeongjin?

91
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,400
I don't know.

92
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,480
I just want to solve the case as soon as possible.

93
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,360
Captain Cao.

94
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,720
When the victim's teeth were found,

95
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,800
we've collected DNA of the missing's family.

96
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
including Ning.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,560
Now we need to compare Youning

98
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,200
compared with the corpse we just found.

99
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,800
Marco Lu.

100
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,480
The result is out.

101
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,160
tell Ning Zhen immediately.

102
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,640
How is it?

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,840
We got the result.

104
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,360
Where are you?

105
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,120
Marco Lu.

106
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,400
Ning Zhen.

107
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,080
I'm in front of the lab.

108
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,960
I just got the DNA test results.

109
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,600
Is there my mother's?

110
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,320
Come in.

111
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,880
Captain Cao.

112
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,280
The bodies found in the Jiang's Group

113
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,800
and the DNA of the missing families.

114
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,880
The results are out.

115
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,280
This

116
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,680
is Ning Zhen.

117
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,640
His mother

118
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,600
was also one of the victims.

119
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,720
Captain Cao.

120
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,120
All the signs indicate that

121
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,520
Ning Jin is Joien’s accomplice,

122
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,400
But I don’t think he can.

123
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,960
We're the police.

124
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,920
No matter who he is,

125
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,560
as long as he breaks the law,

126
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,760
he has to find out the truth.

127
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,960
We've found

128
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,080
the body of the missing person,

129
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,760
can we investigate Jiang Yan

130
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,840
and convict her?

131
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,720
Now we can only prove

132
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,240
that these people's deaths are related to Mo Bei.

133
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,720
But he's dead.

134
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,440
We need crucial evidence.

135
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,720
to prove

136
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,000
These victims are related to drug research.

137
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,440
That way,

138
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,360
to convict Jiang Yan.

139
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,600
Got it.

140
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,440
Mom.

141
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,720
I'm Ning Zhen.

142
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,440
Say something.

143
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,840
I...I...

144
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,920
I'm a police officer now.

145
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,960
I can protect you.

146
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,680
I've thought about many possibilities.

147
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,520
I think

148
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,760
I think you might be

149
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,040
somewhere else.

150
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
I never blame you.

151
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,960
Mom.

152
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,040
I miss you.

153
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,240
Thank you.

154
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,920
Marco Lu.

155
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,160
I have some left behind.

156
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,520
I'll take a photo for you now.

157
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,680
What's written on this page, Mom?

158
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,880
The third window.

159
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,040
Before she died,

160
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,640
Take this page with you.

161
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,320
It means the content is very important.

162
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,800
I understand.

163
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,880
Mom, hurry up.

164
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,080
Zhen Zhen, slow down.

165
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,040
Be careful.

166
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,840
Be careful.

167
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,000
Okay.

168
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,960
Mom.

169
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,280
The flowers smell so good.

170
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Can I put it in the storage room?

171
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,040
No problem.

172
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,360
Okay.

173
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,920
I'll put it away now.

174
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,000
Be careful.

175
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:26,800
Mom.

176
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,280
This is a window.

177
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,280
Zhen Zhen.

178
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,640
Look, there's a crack on the wall.

179
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
I'm here.

180
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,400
I'll draw a window for you.

181
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,800
It's the real third window.

182
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,920
If I lock Zhen Zhen in the black room again,

183
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,000
Zhen Zhen doesn't have to be afraid.

184
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,560
Because there is a window here.

185
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,440
right?

186
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,800
Yes.

187
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,000
Thank you, mom.

188
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,040
Mr. Du.

189
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,520
Master Du.

190
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,280
Why are there so many people over there?

191
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,240
What are you doing?

192
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,040
The first phase of the new drug test is recruiting volunteers.

193
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,800
2,000 yuan for each episode.

194
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,000
Two thousand.

195
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,000
Can healthy people participate?

196
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,040
Of course.

197
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,960
What do you want?

198
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,440
Nothing.

199
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,240
I'm just asking.

200
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,360
Thank you.

201
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,320
Zhen Zhen.

202
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
I'm off work.

203
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,240
Mom.

204
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,120
You're back.

205
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,200
Have you finished your homework?

206
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,200
Soon.

207
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,080
Look what I bought for you.

208
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,120
Roast chicken.

209
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,360
Your favorite.

210
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,680
I want it now.

211
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,800
Do your homework first.

212
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,440
Mom will cook two dishes and we'll eat later.

213
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,960
Okay?

214
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,480
Okay.

215
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,080
Where is he?

216
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,800
Why didn't you say yes?

217
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,040
I'm hungry.

218
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,880
Go cook.

219
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll go now.

220
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,160
Hurry up.

221
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,600
Where did you get the roast chicken?

222
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
I got my salary.

223
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,240
Where is it?

224
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,640
Don't touch my bag.

225
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,040
Where is it?

226
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,200
Don't look through my bag.

227
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,840
Isn't this...

228
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,520
No.

229
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
What is this?

230
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,520
You didn't tell me you got paid.

231
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,200
This is me.

232
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,520
How dare you?

233
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,280
Get lost.

234
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,520
This is my living expenses.

235
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,680
Save some for me.

236
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,800
Don't force me to hit you.

237
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,680
Are you a man?

238
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,480
Did you get the money back?

239
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,040
You even took my money.

240
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,160
Thank you.

241
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,600
Ma'am.

242
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,240
Please open the door.

243
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,560
I'm locked inside.

244
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,760
What happened?

245
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,080
I don't have time to explain.

246
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,360
Ma'am.

247
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,400
Please open the door for me.

248
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,400
I didn't bring the key.

249
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,960
Don't you have the key over there?

250
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,320
Please open it for me.

251
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
Let me show you.

252
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,160
The medicine Ms. Jiang developed is problematic.

253
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,320
I have to call the police.

254
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,000
Okay.

255
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,960
I'll get the key.

256
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,880
Wait for me here.

257
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,720
Okay.

258
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,720
Sister.

259
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,080
Let's go.

260
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,600
Go!

261
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,360
Hurry!

262
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,640
Sister.

263
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,640
I brought you some food.

264
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,000
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

265
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,240
Don't go out.

266
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,800
Sister.

267
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,760
Thank you.

268
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,080
If I didn't want to fake data with them,

269
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,400
this wouldn't have happened.

270
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,840
Don't think too much.

271
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,400
Just stay here for a few days

272
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
in case they come for revenge.

273
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,320
I've told my relatives

274
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,960
about this house.

275
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,600
this house is always empty.

276
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,680
No one usually lives here.

277
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,440
Thank you.

278
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Have a seat.

279
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,520
Thank you.

280
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,720
By the way,

281
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,200
you haven't taken your medicine, have you?

282
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,960
No.

283
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,840
I'll listen to you.

284
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,200
I feel much better now.

285
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,040
When we ran away,

286
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,720
I lost the USB.

287
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,400
The data in my hand

288
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,760
can’t prove their crime.

289
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,920
Sister,

290
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,240
We...

291
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,160
She's fine.

292
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,880
as long as he's safe.

293
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Don't think too much about other things.

294
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,120
Sorry for the trouble.

295
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,000
Just tell me

296
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,800
where Jin Jie is.

297
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,720
Ms. Jiang.

298
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,640
I really don’t know who you are talking about.

299
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,400
We got the CCTV footage.

300
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,720
You let her go.

301
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,640
Jin Jie stole my stuff.

302
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,600
If I call the police,

303
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,840
you'll be an accomplice.

304
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,280
Now I'm willing to settle it with you.

305
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,360
Just tell me

306
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,040
where she is.

307
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,120
A girl asked me for help that day.

308
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,680
and I opened the door.

309
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,160
But I really didn’t know she was Jin Jie.

310
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
I don't know where she is.

311
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Ning Zhen.

312
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,040
Ms. Jiang.

313
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,920
I really don’t know where Jin Jie is.

314
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,720
If I knew,

315
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,000
I would have told you.

316
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,440
You really don't know.

317
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,880
I really don't know.

318
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,680
Bye.

319
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,360
Your money.

320
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,440
You two.

321
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,600
What are you doing?

322
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,400
Who are you?

323
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,280
I'm the man upstairs.

324
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,040
What is it?

325
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,080
I'm looking for a female employee in my company.

326
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,840
I think I know your wife.

327
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,360
But unfortunately,

328
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,240
your wife doesn't know where she is.

329
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,040
You can ask me.

330
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,720
My wife is not in her right mind recently.

331
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,160
She's in a trance.

332
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,360
Nonsense.

333
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,880
Our family

334
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,840
is short of money.

335
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,640
I need to make some money to treat her.

336
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,560
I have money for treatment,

337
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,840
but I don't have time to wait.

338
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,480
That woman stole my stuff.

339
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,760
A woman?

340
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
I remember.

341
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,080
A relative of mine told me

342
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,320
my wife has been with a girl recently.

343
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,880
She lives in the old house of my relative.

344
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,760
Do you know the address?

345
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,160
Who is it?

346
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,520
Sister.

347
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,480
Hello.

348
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,680
I’m Jin Jie’s friend.

349
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,280
She asked me to bring you something.

350
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,520
Jin Jie.

351
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,320
Yes.

352
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,240
I don’t know Jin Jie.

353
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,480
You got the wrong person.

354
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,640
Ms. Li.

355
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,640
I know you know Jin Jie.

356
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,760
You dare not open the door in the middle of the night.

357
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,640
I understand.

358
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,040
She asked me to bring you something.

359
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,760
There's a computer hard disk here.

360
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,840
It contains the criminal information of Jiang's Group.

361
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,680
I'll give their evidence to the police.

362
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,920
But please.

363
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,040
If anything happens to me,

364
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,240
and didn't give this evidence to the police,

365
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,200
you must give this back to the police.

366
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,720
It’s very important

367
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,320
to Jin Jie and me.

368
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,040
I put it at the door.

369
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,360
Coming.

370
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Hurry up.

371
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,520
What are you doing?

372
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,560
I told you to open the door.

373
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,920
Lower your voice.

374
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,280
I'll forgive you.

375
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,440
I have money.

376
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,200
Where did you get the money?

377
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,920
Someone gave you money but you didn't want it.

378
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,840
I kept it for you.

379
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,480
How dare you take the money?

380
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,680
It's cheating.

381
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,840
A life for money.

382
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,320
Let go!

383
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,160
I'll return it.

384
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,600
Let go.

385
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,400
I really have to return it.

386
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,400
Let go.

387
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,760
How dare you!

388
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,040
How dare you talk to me like that?

389
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,320
How dare you!

390
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,640
You don't want money from someone.

391
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,680
Are you crazy?

392
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,680
Are you crazy?

393
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,400
Get lost!

394
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,080
Are you crazy?

395
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,000
Dad!

396
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,680
Stop fighting!

397
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,920
You're a bad guy.

398
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Come here.

399
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,040
Don't hit him.

400
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,680
Don't touch him.

401
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,000
Don't lock him up.

402
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,760
Go in.

403
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,040
Dad!

404
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,160
You bad dad!

405
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
Let me out!

406
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,680
Don't hit my mom!

407
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,560
Come here!

408
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,240
Let me out!

409
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,160
Dad!

410
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,920
You jerk!

411
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,440
Let me out!

412
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,880
Hurry!

413
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,920
Let me out!

414
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Stop hitting my mom!

415
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,200
Dad!

416
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,120
Don't hit my mom.

417
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,640
Who is it?

418
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,040
It's late.

419
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,880
Who is it?

420
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,640
Zhen Zhen.

421
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,640
No matter what happens today,

422
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,480
don't come out of here.

423
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,320
Understand?

424
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,440
Ning Zhen.

425
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,200
Ning Zhen.

426
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,600
This is the evidence to convict Jiang Yan.

427
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,120
Now we have the evidence.

428
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,840
Go back to the station with me.

429
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,280
Let's make things clear.

430
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,040
Ning Zhen.

431
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,400
I believe you are innocent.

432
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,560
You can't keep running.

433
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,160
Whether it's the goose or the abyss,

434
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,840
leave it to me and Captain Cao.

435
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,680
Please trust us one more time.

436
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,720
Okay.

437
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,440
I'll go back with you.

438
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,000
Ning Zhen.

439
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,440
Open it.

440
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,840
Ning Zhen.

441
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,640
Open it.

442
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,440
Ning Zhen.

443
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,400
Ning Zhen.

444
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,760
Lu Fan.

445
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,480
Captain Cao.

446
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,080
Be careful.

447
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,240
Are you okay?

448
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,640
Who locked you in there?

449
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,560
Where is Yeongjin?

450
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,440
He ran away.

451
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,160
Tao Zi.

452
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,200
Go after him.

453
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,880
Okay.

454
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,680
Let's go.

455
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,600
Captain Cao.

456
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,400
Ning Zhen found this.

457
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,080
that can testify against Jiang Yan.

458
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,160
You still don't trust him?

459
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,760
The law only trusts evidence.

460
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,040
I'll take this card back

461
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,520
and send it to the technical team.

462
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,960
Captain Cao.

463
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:35,800
Bet.

464
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,679
What brings you here?

465
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,520
I'm just passing by.

466
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,320
and visit my old friend.

467
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,719
You treat me as a friend?

468
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,920
Although I suspected you before,

469
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,320
but every time I come to you,

470
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,120
you always give me some correct guidance.

471
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,520
Why aren't you a good teacher and friend?

472
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,280
Thank you.

473
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,120
If you need anything,

474
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,400
if anything happens.

475
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,360
No need.

476
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,840
I'm here to say goodbye.

477
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,880
We might never meet again.

478
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,200
You really...

479
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,640
into the abyss.

480
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,560
I remember when we first met,

481
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,760
you introduced a sentence to me.

482
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,800
People who fight against demons

483
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,280
should be careful of becoming a devil.

484
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,160
When you gaze at the abyss from afar,

485
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,200
the abyss is staring at you.

486
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,040
I like it.

487
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,360
Maybe

488
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,360
become that devil now.

489
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,640
This is a philosopher Nietzsche

490
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,240
by the famous philosopher Nietzsche.

491
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,120
Actually, you and I

492
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,600
desperately want to ashore.

493
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
But

494
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,360
I have no choice.

495
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,280
One by one.

496
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,200
We meet by chance in the crowd.

497
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,480
Since it's a farewell,

498
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,120
I'll find that book

499
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,240
as a souvenir.

500
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,640
Wait for me.

501
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,120
Captain Cao.

502
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,760
When checking Joien’s testimony,

503
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,200
what he said almost matches.

504
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,720
But I found the only strange thing.

505
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,680
What is it?

506
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,960
On the day Li Guokun was killed,

507
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,480
Joien was in the hospital for chemotherapy.

508
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,200
He was in the hospital that day.

509
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,200
and stayed in the hospital for a night.

510
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
I didn't have enough time

511
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,400
to the nearby mountain area.

512
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,480
The murderer who killed Li Guokun

513
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,960
must be Joien's accomplice.

514
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,640
In Joien's list,

515
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
besides Yeongjin,

516
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,960
besides Ning Zhen?

517
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,600
No suspicious person.

518
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,280
We're looking for other clues in his house.

519
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,440
What about the SD card

520
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,680
in Ning Zhen's old house?

521
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,240
I've asked relevant experts to analyze it.

522
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,280
There's no result yet.

523
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,120
Let me ask you again.

524
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,880
Who is your accomplice?

525
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,760
My accomplice.

526
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,960
is all the victims of this case.

527
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,680
Joien.

528
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,120
What are you doing?

529
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,800
I want you to know

530
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,280
