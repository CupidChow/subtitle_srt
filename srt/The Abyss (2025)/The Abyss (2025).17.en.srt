1
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,520
I've checked Mo Bei.

2
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,800
I used to be a Special Forces soldier abroad.

3
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,080
Jiang Yan hired him

4
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,720
through money and connections.

5
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
Special Forces soldier

6
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,800
That's the scapegoat

7
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,680
for Jiang Yan.

8
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
We're very sure

9
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,240
there must be something wrong with Jiang Yan.

10
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,520
This is the only breakthrough.

11
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,360
We can continue to investigate.

12
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,760
the case of Jiang's Group

13
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,840
Go to Jiang's Group to get some information.

14
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
But those newcomers

15
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
who haven't been here for long

16
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
I don't think they'll find out anything.

17
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,680
We have to find an old employee.

18
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,480
The older, the better.

19
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,200
Miss,

20
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,840
has been working here for a long time.

21
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,720
She even introduced me to be a security guard.

22
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,920
Here.

23
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,840
Hello. Hello.

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,480
He,

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,640
These two officers want to talk to you.

26
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,280
Detective.

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,040
Looking for me?

28
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,760
Aunt, don't be nervous.

29
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,920
You guys talk.

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,079
I'm leaving.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,680
Are you picking vegetables?

32
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,400
Let us help you.

33
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,080
Aunt,

34
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,040
We are here to ask you

35
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,400
about Jiang’s.

36
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,680
Jiang?

37
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Ask away.

38
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
How long have you been working in Jiang's Group?

39
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,160
Almost 20 years.

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,640
I just retired last year.

41
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,079
Do you remember

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,040
they are close?

43
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,360
They are very close.

44
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,480
Especially Mr. Jiang.

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,600
Every important day,

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,040
Mr. Jiang's birthday

47
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,920
for Mr. Jiang's birthday.

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,200
to celebrate for Ms. Jiang.

49
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,520
Ms. Jiang

50
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,320
also protects his brother.

51
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,840
Are they always

52
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,240
always so close?

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,440
Of course.

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
When the old chairman was here,

55
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,760
who was the successor?

56
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,000
the relationship between them was a little tense.

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,960
Mr. Jiang

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,320
was afraid of his sister.

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,200
And then?

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,280
something happened to the old chairman.

61
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,840
Ms. Jiang started managing the company

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,240
and her brother.

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,840
with my brother.

64
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,080
In other words,

65
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,600
their relationship

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,920
changed 15 years ago.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,800
Almost.

68
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,280
Ms. Jiang's mother is so angry.

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,920
But God is watching.

70
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,800
When Ms. Jiang was three,

71
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,600
his mother fell down and died.

72
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,240
Think about it.

73
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,600
The siblings

74
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,760
get along well.

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,280
It's not easy.

76
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,560
The relationship between Jiang Yan and Jiang Mi

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,640
was 15 years ago.

78
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,720
But in this year,

79
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,440
the naked body case in Kubei

80
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,560
My parents' case.

81
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,880
Your father's case

82
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,920
happened in this year.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
This is definitely not a coincidence.

84
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,240
Based on their relationship,

85
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,920
Jiang Yan would do anything

86
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,280
to save Jiang Yu.

87
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
This means the case of the naked body in Kubei is not simple.

88
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,240
There must be something we don't know.

89
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,080
I'll sort out all the cases

90
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,880
in Hongwan that year.

91
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,360
and see what clues we can find.

92
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,240
Okay.

93
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,560
Here.

94
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,600
Take your ID card.

95
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,440
As for the rest,

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,640
I'll hold it for you.

97
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,480
Thank you.

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,200
Captain Cao.

99
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,680
I'm really sorry.

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,840
As you know,

101
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,960
I don't have many friends.

102
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,680
I have to trouble you.

103
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,200
Don't mention it.

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,760
The wound is not healed yet.

105
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,000
Besides, we have luggage.

106
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,159
Captain Cao.

107
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,600
I heard something happened at the hospital last night.

108
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,720
I saw the news this morning.

109
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,120
A prisoner named Kang

110
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,280
died in the hospital.

111
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Is it a porridge?

112
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,720
Yes.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,600
You don't have to hide it from me.

114
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
To me,

115
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,800
he was already punished.

116
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,560
Whether he was sentenced to death

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,280
or killed by the abyss,

118
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,400
is the punishment he deserves.

119
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,200
You acknowledge

120
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,560
the Abyss.

121
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,960
I must have said something wrong.

122
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,440
It's okay.

123
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,159
Let's go.

124
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,960
Okay.

125
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,600
Have a good rest these days.

126
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,240
Remember,

127
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,760
Don't touch water.

128
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,040
I'm going back to the team.

129
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,840
It's late.

130
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,360
at this hour?

131
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,320
I wanted to treat you to a meal.

132
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,680
Maybe another day.

133
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,520
Tomorrow,

134
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,520
I think

135
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,840
you've been helping me for so long.

136
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
You saved me.

137
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,280
and helped me find the murderer.

138
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
If you don't come,

139
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,360
if you don't come.

140
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,400
Okay.

141
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,680
I'll try to be early tomorrow.

142
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,880
Remember to lock the door.

143
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,840
Bye.

144
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeongjin.

145
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,640
Did you find anything?

146
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,360
I took the time of the crime

147
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,720
of the naked body case

148
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,280
I searched for all cases

149
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,920
in a month.

150
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,480
The missing persons ratio

151
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,160
was much higher than other times.

152
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,840
Your mother

153
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,400
disappeared at that time.

154
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Is the case closed?

155
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,080
There are five cases that haven't been closed yet.

156
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,440
They haven't been found.

157
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,920
The missing person case is the only clue now.

158
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,960
We have to look into it.

159
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,840
Let's visit the missing person's family first.

160
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,240
Okay.

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
Do you remember the date she went missing?

162
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,800
June 2, 2009.

163
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,680
The only similarity

164
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,160
have in common

165
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,040
is that they all have heart disease.

166
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,040
Indeed.

167
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,280
Let's go to the next one.

168
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,000
Next.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,800
Lee Bong-jin.

170
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sure...

171
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,720
What's wrong?

172
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,280
She's my mother.

173
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,760
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
Let's go to the next place.

175
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,000
The missing person.

176
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,760
Qiao Rui.

177
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Heart.

178
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,800
The visitor is her brother, Joien.

179
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,440
When they were young,

180
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,280
lost their parents in an accident.

181
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,680
Only the two of them survived.

182
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,320
because of this accident.

183
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,600
Joien’s legs were disabled.

184
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,320
But because of his high IQ,

185
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,960
he was adopted by a couple in New Zealand.

186
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,440
and his sister was adopted in China.

187
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,680
and they separated.

188
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,080
Ten years later,

189
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,000
Joien returned to China.

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,360
but found his sister missing.

191
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,920
He's currently running

192
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,360
an online security consultation company.

193
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,600
Network safety consultation?

194
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Yes.

195
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,640
In fact, he's the only one

196
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,880
to make a living with some small companies.

197
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,280
Got it.

198
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,520
Let's go.

199
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,640
Who is it?

200
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,240
Police.

201
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,960
I'm here to investigate Qiao Rui's missing case.

202
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,400
Come in.

203
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,000
You've visited many places, right?

204
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,640
How did you know?

205
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,360
Observe.

206
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,520
You two look tired.

207
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,200
Mr. Joien lives alone.

208
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,560
Yes.

209
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,120
I studied electronic information abroad.

210
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,080
After I came back,

211
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,720
I'll do

212
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,680
Internet information security maintenance.

213
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,400
Then you must know

214
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,720
You must know a lot about hackers.

215
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,520
Hacker.

216
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,080
Hackers are spears.

217
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,080
We are shields.

218
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,120
My job is safety maintenance.

219
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,160
not attack.

220
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,080
Can I have a look?

221
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,040
Sure.

222
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,480
Mr. Joien.

223
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,400
Did anything unusual happen

224
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,520
when your sister Qiao Rui went missing?

225
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,400
After I came back,

226
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,440
my sister has been missing for a while.

227
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
I don't know

228
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,720
I'm not sure.

229
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,680
What about her adoptive parents?

230
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,040
They've been looking for them for a while.

231
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,480
but they gave up

232
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,880
they gave up.

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,680
Can we talk about your sister?

234
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,440
My sister?

235
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,000
My sister.

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,920
is a lively girl.

237
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,320
But she's been in poor health.

238
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,120
Is it a heart attack?

239
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,920
Yes.

240
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,200
congenital heart disease.

241
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,240
And before she went missing,

242
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,760
before she went missing.

243
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,800
Did she receive any treatment?

244
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,600
Her adoptive parents

245
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,720
is not very good.

246
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,120
Then there was a special drug.

247
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,320
It's still in the clinical trial stage.

248
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,280
I heard it's very effective.

249
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,120
And it's free.

250
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,280
So they let my sister

251
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,840
to participate in this experiment.

252
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,120
Jiang's Group.

253
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,720
It's Jiang's Group.

254
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,080
I heard

255
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,200
the first half of the year my sister participated in the clinical trial

256
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,240
in the first half of the year.

257
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,800
But in the second half of the year,

258
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,240
for some unknown reason,

259
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,880
her body became very bad.

260
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,280
After that,

261
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,400
she went missing one day.

262
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,600
Do you still have those pills?

263
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
It's been so many years.

264
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,160
The medicine is gone.

265
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,840
Sir.

266
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,640
Tell me.

267
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,600
my sister is still alive?

268
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,680
Don't worry.

269
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,760
As long as there is still hope,

270
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,400
we will do our best.

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,800
I'll wait and see

272
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,320
I'll wait and see.

273
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,840
When you find me,

274
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,400
I'll give you a gift.

275
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,640
What's going to happen

276
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,400
Let's wait and see.

277
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,480
If one appears, he will kill one.

278
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,680
So I believe

279
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,320
the real identity of the abyss

280
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,800
is hidden in this case.

281
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,160
Thank you for your cooperation today.

282
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,280
If you remember anything,

283
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,520
feel free to contact us.

284
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,800
If you need any help,

285
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,800
if you need any help.

286
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,040
Thank you.

287
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,360
[Most of the missing people]

288
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,160
have

289
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,800
heart disease in different degrees.

290
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,840
has also changed

291
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,240
at the same time.

292
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,360
And these pills

293
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,880
came from Jiang's Group.

294
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
Let's go to the relevant department to check

295
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,080
of Jiang’s Research and Development.

296
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,960
Marco Lu.

297
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,240
Are you sure Joien’s legs

298
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,560
really disabled?

299
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,320
Yes.

300
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,440
That accident was very serious.

301
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,280
His parents died on the spot.

302
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,160
He was still a child.

303
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,840
How is that possible?

304
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,600
I also found out that

305
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,360
Joien had terminal lung cancer.

306
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,120
It hasn’t been long.

307
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,280
Maybe it's because he suffered too much misfortune.

308
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,440
he often went to see a psychiatrist.

309
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,800
A psychiatrist?

310
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,080
We know each other.

311
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,520
Luo Yin.

312
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,240
Luo Yin.

313
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,120
What’s wrong?

314
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,440
I have something to do.

315
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,520
You go first.

316
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,840
Call me anytime.

317
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,640
Officer Ning.

318
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,520
Why are you here?

319
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,280
Don't call me Officer Ning.

320
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,440
I'm suspended.

321
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,080
So we are

322
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,240
the same disease.

323
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,600
Are we closing?

324
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,880
Pack it a little

325
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,440
and transferred it out.

326
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,040
How is it going?

327
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,080
The flute is dead.

328
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,200
How?

329
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,560
I found a suspect.

330
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,079
It fits the characteristics you told me before.

331
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,480
Someone related to the case.

332
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,000
Congratulations.

333
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,800
It's good that you didn't give up.

334
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,520
It means you heard what I said.

335
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,119
But this person has something to do with you.

336
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,720
He is your patient.

337
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,920
His name is Joien.

338
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,120
Joien.

339
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,320
Can you tell me

340
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,120
the questions he asks you every time?

341
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,640
It's not convenient.

342
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,160
We keep

343
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,920
is a secret.

344
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,720
Even if I'm not a doctor now,

345
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,280
I have a duty to keep it a secret.

346
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,400
Unless the patient agrees,

347
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,200
Or...

348
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,560
Do you have a warrant? Yes, sir.

349
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,880
Understood.

350
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,520
Yeongjin.

351
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,040
Joien’s problem

352
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,760
is his missing sister.

353
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,200
I'll give you some advice.

354
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,000
Since you've found

355
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,520
the cause of the case,

356
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,800
keep investigating.

357
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
As long as we can't find a new suspect,

358
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
there is no target in the abyss.

359
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,360
But those who wait for the truth

360
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,000
are suffering every day.

361
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Tell me.

362
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,240
Which one is more urgent?

363
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,720
In other words,

364
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,960
Once we find a new suspect,

365
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,280
the abyss will appear.

366
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,280
You mean

367
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,560
the abyss is using the police to solve the case?

368
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,960
He doesn't know who the mastermind is.

369
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,200
Marco Lu.

370
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,040
the information about Luo Yin

371
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,200
and the provincial records

372
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,960
to me.

373
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,960
I'll find you later.

374
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,120
Okay.

375
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,640
Okay.

376
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,720
I'll send you the address later.

377
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,360
What do you think?

378
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,320
This is the report and application

379
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,200
15 years ago.

380
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,080
Did you bring Luo Yin's information?

381
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,440
Why do you want this?

382
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,240
Luo Yin has a daughter?

383
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,160
16 years old.

384
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,360
I've been studying in America.

385
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,600
Marco Lu.

386
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,240
Look at this.

387
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,320
In the past few years,

388
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,440
almost every year

389
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,880
June 13.

390
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,720
On the 14th and 15th day,

391
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,680
I went to my hometown to pay my respects to my dead wife.

392
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,160
But this date

393
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,280
is not his wife's death anniversary.

394
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,480
Then why did he go there at this time?

395
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,200
June 14.

396
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,520
The naked body case in Kubei.

397
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,360
Why did he go to

398
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
to pay tribute to his dead wife?

399
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,280
His wife

400
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,640
died before the naked body case in Kubei.

401
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,880
There's nothing between them.

402
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,880
Zhong Yuqing.

403
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,760
Heart disease.

404
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,960
Luo Yin's wife.

405
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,400
Did she take

406
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,800
Jiang's special drug?

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,720
She's not on the list.

408
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,960
She died naturally again.

409
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,240
How can we prove that she's related to Jiang's Group?

410
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,400
The list of candidates.

411
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,520
Dr. Na.

412
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,680
Dr. Na.

413
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,120
Did you get discharged? Yes.

414
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,200
When did you get discharged?

415
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,000
I heard you reported yourself

416
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,160
because of Kang Mi case.

417
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,400
But I didn't expect this to happen.

418
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
It's okay.

419
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
It's my duty.

420
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,760
All these years,

421
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,280
Without your guidance,

422
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,840
I really don't know what would happen to me.

423
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,840
But now the clinic is gone.

424
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,040
I have no one to rely on.

425
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,080
dyed.

426
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,600
life

427
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,080
won't be affected

428
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,120
one thing

429
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,400
stop alone.

430
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,520
It will continue forever.

431
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,080
Look.

432
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,560
Just like today's sun.

433
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,920
Although the clouds are covering us,

434
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,720
but the clouds will disappear.

435
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,640
The sun will come out

436
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,640
and shines on us.

437
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,120
It makes us feel warm.

438
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,960
Like this.

439
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,440
Take me as my last patient today.

440
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,480
Even if I'm not a doctor,

441
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,760
come to me whenever you need help.

442
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,920
As your friend,

443
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,200
as your friend.

444
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
OK?

445
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,680
No information about Luo Yin's wife.

446
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,240
What did you find?

447
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,200
Jiang's Group did develop

448
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,080
a new drug to cure heart disease.

449
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,200
The clinical trial has reached the third stage.

450
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,320
But

451
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,680
in the first three episodes,

452
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,240
in the first three episodes.

453
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,080
and was listed.

454
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,680
You invested so much.

455
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,360
You'll make a profit soon.

456
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,760
Then I suddenly quit.

457
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,920
My mom took this medicine,

458
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,400
but she has no heart disease.

459
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,640
In the clinical stage,

460
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,920
we'll find some healthy candidates to participate.

461
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,800
Maybe

462
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,960
to make up for the family expenses.

463
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,560
Look at this.

464
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,480
These experiments were signed by Jin Jie.

465
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,840
Jin Jie.

466
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
Everything is normal.

467
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,800
but it stopped being listed.

468
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,800
Is there something wrong with the drugs?

469
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,040
If the experiment result

470
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,960
was fabricated,

471
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,600
we must find the real drug test.

472
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,480
and test report.

473
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,400
There must be

474
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,120
in the report.

475
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,880
If we can confirm the drug is wrong,

476
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,200
and one of the victims

477
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,440
there are patients with severe side effects.

478
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,960
If the list matches the missing person,

479
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,200
we can convict him.

480
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,000
I suspect

481
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,760
Wu Fei's last task

482
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,120
was to find the evidence.

483
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,840
According to Jiang Yan,

484
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,080
the abnormal behaviors of Jiang Yu and his brother

485
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,360
and the way they get along,

486
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,240
the evidence

487
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,800
is probably in the hands of the porridge.

488
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,160
and threatened Jiang Yan.

489
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,120
Like this.

490
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,160
all the clues are connected.

491
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,880
If that's the case,

492
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,760
then on the day the porridge was killed,

493
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,720
Jiang Yan must have got the evidence back.

494
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,680
That day at the nursing home,

495
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,560
The thing that Kang-yeon's men wanted to destroy

496
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,000
is what we are looking for.

497
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,160
Can you show me the computer?

498
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,800
I'm sorry to offend you.

499
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,560
Do you have a laptop?

500
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,720
Yes.

501
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,840
All the documents and files

502
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,760
If you insert the USB,

503
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,920
Even if you don't copy it on the computer,

504
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,040
it can be restored.

505
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,000
From the way Kang-yeon was driving that day,

506
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,480
she left the nursing home

507
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,760
she went straight to the company.

508
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,720
If the computer is in the company,

509
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,880
it'll be hard for us to get it.

510
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,480
This is our last chance.

511
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,360
We have to try no matter how slim it is.

512
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,240
But we don't have such technical support now.

513
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,120
Besides,

514
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,480
It's illegal to invade someone's computer without permission.

515
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,640
is illegal.

516
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,760
Unless I ask Captain Cao.

517
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,160
Captain Cao won't help.

518
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,400
Captain Cao.

519
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,320
Everyone in the cafe that day

520
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,120
in the cafe that day.

521
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,640
Especially those who used computers.

522
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,320
There are three people working on computer programming

523
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,800
Internet security and so on.

524
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,080
We checked their computers.

525
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,400
There are no suspicious operating records.

526
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
This is their information.

527
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,520
Where are they sitting respectively?

528
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,960
One of them is sitting there.

529
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,080
The last one.

530
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,160
sit where you are now.

531
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,480
Give me his information.

532
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,160
Okay.

533
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,200
Joien.

534
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,000
But...

535
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,680
Captain Cao.

536
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,360
This man has lost his legs

537
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,680
due to an accident.

538
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,000
Why does he have so many years of information

539
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,240
is blank?

540
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,680
His parents died.

541
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,600
After he became an orphan,

542
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,000
he was adopted by a foreign couple.

543
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,360
So there are only records in China.

544
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,920
If you want to check foreign information,

545
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,040
to check foreign information.

546
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,320
I need some time.

547
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,440
You can see

548
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,160
in this location.

549
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,280
Got it, Captain Cao.

550
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,360
Who is it?

551
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,920
Stop!

552
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,080
It's dyed.

553
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,240
It's dyed.

554
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,360
It's dyed.

555
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,080
It's dyed.

556
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,640
Don't touch me.

557
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,320
I'm Cao Jin.

558
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
I'm Cao Jin.

559
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,240
Just stay here for a few days.

560
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,760
When the suspect is caught,

561
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,720
you can move back.

562
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,360
Thank you.

563
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,240
You can use the things at home.

564
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,160
you can use them.

565
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,600
Tell me if you need anything.

566
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,480
I'll buy you more.

567
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,600
Thank you.

568
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,320
Captain Cao.

569
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
You can stay in that room.

570
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,400
That room is bigger.

571
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,160
Here.

572
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,840
Go in and clean up.

573
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,840
Why are you here?

574
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,160
It's weird.

575
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,560
Why can't I come?

576
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,600
Tell me.

577
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,320
What is it?

578
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,720
Brother.

579
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,840
We suspect there's more to the naked body case in Kubei.

580
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,600
It's very likely that

581
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,400
is very likely

582
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
they have something on Jiang Yan.

583
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,880
Actually, Jiang Yan

584
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,960
is the one behind all this.

585
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,560
When we followed her to the nursing home,

586
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,640
I saw her taking a laptop.

587
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,800
The evidence is probably in this computer.

588
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,680
Now,

589
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,640
is technical support.

590
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,080
The case of the naked body in Kubei has been closed.

591
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,240
You don't need to investigate anymore.

592
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,440
The death of Jin Jie and Wu Fei

593
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,640
are not that simple.

594
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,440
Now we have new clues.

595
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,120
Why don't you investigate it?

596
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,040
Marco Lu,

597
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,200
If this thing

598
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,800
has something to do with Jiang Yan,

599
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,680
it could be very dangerous.

600
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,880
I forbid you to get involved.

601
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,360
Cao Jin.

602
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,920
I won’t give up.

603
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,320
Marco Lu.

604
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,120
The murderer who killed my dad

605
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,960
is Jiang Yan.

606
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,520
Is it?

607
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,280
right?

608
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,120
I didn't know you were here.

609
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,040
I...

610
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,720
Marco Lu.

611
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,800
I’m leaving.

612
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,440
You knew it all along.

613
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,120
Right?

614
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,480
It's dyed.

615
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,000
We're still doubting it.

616
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,160
If this is related to Jiang Yan,

617
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,200
I will investigate it.

618
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,640
The person who came to my room today

619
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,960
must be Jiang Yan's men.

620
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,920
They knew I was discharged.

621
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,400
They came to take revenge on me.

622
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,880
Why did Jiang Yan take revenge on you?

623
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,880
When I was in the hospital,

624
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,360
Jiang Yan came to me.

625
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,480
Yes.

626
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,360
It's her.

627
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,360
Captain Cao.

628
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,680
Jiang Yan is a devil.

629
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,240
She can do anything.

630
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,160
You must catch her.

631
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,840
Okay?

632
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,880
It must be her.

633
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,720
(The real culprit is Kang Yeon)

634
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,240
[The real culprit is Kang Yeon.] [They need to invade each other's computer and restore the test data.]

635
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,960
[This is all you can do.]

636
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,120
[What do you mean?]

637
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,679
(I just talked to Captain Cao and got rejected.)

638
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:49,960
