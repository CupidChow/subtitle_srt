1
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
Why are you scolding me?

2
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,320
Why did you step on my handkerchief?

3
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,600
You stepped on the handkerchief my mom left me?

4
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,640
I didn't mean to kill her.

5
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,040
She stepped on my handkerchief.

6
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,400
stepped on my mom's handkerchief.

7
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,880
She stepped on my mom's handkerchief.

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,720
I have to deal with her.

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,240
Honey.

10
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,400
I'll kill you now.

11
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,520
Liar.

12
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
Why are you here?

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,079
Didn't you already...

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,200
I'll kill you if you keep talking.

15
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,440
If I don't die today,

16
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,280
I'll make your life miserable.

17
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,079
Freeze!

18
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,960
Police!

19
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,680
Let him go!

20
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,320
Help me!

21
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,440
Help me!

22
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,200
Hurry!

23
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,760
Let him go.

24
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,840
Sir.

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,680
Are you okay?

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,640
Help me!

27
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,360
Help me.

28
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,480
Can you do it?

29
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,600
How's your injury?

30
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,480
Officer,

31
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,600
Thank you for saving me.

32
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
The person who stabbed you

33
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,960
who stabbed you?

34
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,079
How about this?

35
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,920
I'll find a way to stop the bleeding for you.

36
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:32,960
Luo Yin.

37
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,840
Officer,

38
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,680
Listen.

39
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,480
I heard

40
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,520
that man

41
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,120
beat his wife at home again.

42
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,280
He fights every three days.

43
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,240
This kid

44
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,280
is also unlucky.

45
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,600
Is it because that woman couldn't stand domestic violence

46
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,960
and killed the man?

47
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,240
and ran away.

48
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,480
Don't talk nonsense.

49
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,400
Captain Lu.

50
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,400
My child.

51
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,080
How old are you?

52
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,240
My name is Lu Zheng.

53
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,240
I’m the captain.

54
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,320
Don't be afraid.

55
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,920
How about this?

56
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,000
What about you?

57
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
If you remember anything,

58
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,240
or if you need any help,

59
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,920
feel free to contact me.

60
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,640
This is my number.

61
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,160
You can find me at the police station.

62
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,920
My mom won't kill anyone.

63
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,040
Kid.

64
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,680
Trust me.

65
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,200
I will do my best.

66
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,960
No matter what the truth will be,

67
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,920
I hope you can be well.

68
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,480
You have a long way to go.

69
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,680
Xiao Li.

70
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,880
Captain Lu.

71
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,680
Check if

72
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
if he has a guardian.

73
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,440
If not,

74
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,159
take good care of him

75
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,680
take good care of him.

76
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,480
Master.

77
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,640
The investigation report of Ningdefu is out.

78
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,720
Meeting.

79
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,160
According to the interviews,

80
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,280
the victim, Ning Defu,

81
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,320
has no fixed job.

82
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,080
His wife, Lee Bong Jin, raised him.

83
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,160
and always abused him.

84
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
His social relationship

85
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,080
is simple.

86
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,040
He doesn't have any enemies.

87
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,400
His son, Yeongjin,

88
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,840
was locked in a storage room during the incident.

89
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,840
So I didn’t see the whole process.

90
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,560
There was no trace of anyone else at the scene.

91
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,360
There were obvious signs of fighting at the scene.

92
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,320
But there was no other fingerprints

93
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,760
there was no other fingerprint.

94
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,680
According to the neighbor description,

95
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,320
on the day of the incident,

96
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,240
the victim and his wife

97
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,640
had a fierce fight.

98
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,640
After that,

99
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,960
his wife went missing.

100
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,320
Officer Lu.

101
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,520
The autopsy report is out.

102
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,240
The victim, Ning Defu,

103
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Male, 36 years old.

104
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,559
died of mechanical asphyxiation.

105
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,720
The time of death is

106
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,520
Around 1 a.m. on the night of the incident,

107
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,840
The weapon was a wire connected to lights outside the courtyard.

108
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,800
The victim's fingerprints

109
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,080
on the wire.

110
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,320
There are many scratches on the victim's body.

111
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,280
According to the DNA,

112
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,840
was caused by his wife, Lee Bong Jin.

113
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,160
02683.

114
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,600
The blood on the victim

115
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,160
from the wife of the deceased.

116
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,480
All the clues

117
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,120
is pointing to his wife, Lee Bong-jin.

118
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,000
Lee Bong Jin disappeared after the incident.

119
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,520
Is there a possibility

120
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,040
that after Li Fengzhen killed Ning Defu,

121
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,080
after killing Ning Defu.

122
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
It's too early

123
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,920
is too early.

124
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,680
The traces on the victim

125
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,040
may be left by a domestic violence wife.

126
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,160
There's another detail.

127
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,800
Wife.

128
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
She's thin.

129
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,040
How did she make her husband

130
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,880
hanging her husband

131
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,120
hanging on the tree?

132
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,080
At the crime scene,

133
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,280
There might be a third person.

134
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,680
As soon as possible,

135
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,160
is to find the dead's wife.

136
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,240
Cao Jin.

137
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,640
Let’s go and visit again.

138
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,560
to see if we can find new clues.

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,080
Yes, Master.

140
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,120
You're back?

141
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,000
I haven't been home for days.

142
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,640
I thought you died outside.

143
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,280
I'm blind.

144
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,440
I'm looking for something like you.

145
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,640
Crazy.

146
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,200
You even went to jail.

147
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,360
and poor.

148
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,840
What are you doing?

149
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,880
The fish is full.

150
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,160
I'm still hungry.

151
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,040
Go cook.

152
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,520
I made money.

153
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,920
A lot.

154
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,400
Where is the money?

155
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,080
I hid it.

156
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,880
Kun.

157
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,360
Are we sick again?

158
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,720
Are you delusional this time?

159
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Why didn't you say you're the richest man?

160
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,760
You loser.

161
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,760
Take this stupid handkerchief again.

162
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,640
Your crazy mother's stupid handkerchief again.

163
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,840
Crazy Mom's stupid handkerchief.

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,080
Your mom is crazy.

165
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,160
I inherited it from you.

166
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,920
I didn't even dare to give birth.

167
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,560
Why are your parents so stubborn

168
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
to get you out.

169
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,920
You should go out and buy an insurance

170
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,520
and get a car to kill you.

171
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
You should contribute to this family.

172
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,920
Go cook.

173
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,640
Captain Lu, come here.

174
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,720
We found something.

175
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
The victim's home is located in the suburbs of the warehouse.

176
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,080
In another yard,

177
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,600
we found a suspicious man.

178
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,360
It's here.

179
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,360
He's very cunning.

180
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,680
He covered his face with a hat.

181
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,960
and turned his back to the camera.

182
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,520
And we just found this person.

183
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,800
also appeared near the victim's house this morning.

184
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,960
After the incident,

185
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,840
after the incident.

186
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,320
I'm not looking for anything.

187
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,920
I just want to destroy the evidence.

188
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,720
Print this for me.

189
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,320
Okay.

190
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,960
Hello?

191
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,800
It's me.

192
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,760
Don't forget

193
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,000
I have to go home early today.

194
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,120
How could I forget?

195
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,240
Today is Fan Fan's birthday

196
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,880
I practiced a song for a long time

197
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
I'll play it for you at home.

198
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,760
Our little princess is so good.

199
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,360
The piano is not wasted.

200
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,560
I have to listen to it.

201
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,480
But I have something urgent to do.

202
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,320
I need to go out.

203
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,560
I'm done.

204
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,040
I'll go home right away, okay?

205
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,040
You have to keep your promise this time.

206
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,400
Yes.

207
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,160
Little princess.

208
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,040
Master.

209
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,320
Take a look.

210
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Can you see clearly?

211
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,040
How about this?

212
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,440
Let's go to the North Warehouse again.

213
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,920
Master.

214
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,800
Tonight,

215
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,200
my mom arranged a blind date for me.

216
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
She insisted that I go.

217
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,520
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

218
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
I approve this leave.

219
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,640
I'll go by myself.

220
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,400
Thank you, master.

221
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,280
By the way,

222
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,000
Well,

223
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,360
Where is your wife?

224
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,320
is temporarily

225
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,960
a bed surgery today

226
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,000
I promised her I would pick up Fan Fan today

227
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,160
Please pick her up for me

228
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
I'll complete the mission.

229
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,360
Hello?

230
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,520
Who is it?

231
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,280
Uncle Lu.

232
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,000
Ning Zhen.

233
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm on my way to your house.

234
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,600
Do you have something to tell me?

235
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,080
Just now,

236
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,560
I saw a strange person.

237
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,920
He was wearing a hat.

238
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,160
And he showed up in front of my house this morning.

239
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,000
Where are you now?

240
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,080
Okay.

241
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,160
Wait for me.

242
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,880
I'll be right there.

243
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,800
Okay.

244
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,400
Liu, inform the team

245
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,960
Something is going on in Kubei District.

246
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,320
Send backup.

247
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,760
Happy birthday to you

248
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,680
Is today

249
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,360
our little princess?

250
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,240
It's you again

251
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,680
Dad told me.

252
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,160
Today

253
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,080
go home early to celebrate Fan Fan's birthday

254
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,760
But he promised me

255
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,360
Why did he break his promise again?

256
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,800
Is the cake nice?

257
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,720
Your dad also said

258
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,440
as long as I send Fan Fan home first

259
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,400
Dad will be home

260
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,840
to cut the cake with Fan Fan

261
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,760
OK?

262
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,600
Okay.

263
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,240
Here, take it.

264
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,080
Get in.

265
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,920
Go home.

266
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,480
Sit tight.

267
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Let's go home.

268
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,840
Uncle Lu.

269
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,320
Over there.

270
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,680
Kid.

271
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,600
My phone died.

272
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,880
Uncle go in

273
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,440
If you don't come out in ten minutes,

274
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,560
call the police for me.

275
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,079
and tell the police

276
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,160
the location here.

277
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,920
Okay?

278
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,760
But I don't know

279
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,920
Look.

280
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,160
This watch

281
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,319
happened to break it today.

282
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,960
But

283
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,440
you can read it.

284
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,480
There's a second hand.

285
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,280
It's engraved.

286
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,280
What about you?

287
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,040
Count.

288
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,720

289
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,800
Seven.

290
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,360
Nine.

291
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,880
Ten.

292
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,200
Don't move.

293
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,440
Police!

294
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,880
Excuse me, madam.

295
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,440
Wait.

296
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,000
Sister-in-law.

297
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,640
Wait.

298
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,400
Lu.

299
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,320
Sister-in-law.

300
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,560
Dad.

301
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,880
Master.

302
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,680
no matter what the truth will be,

303
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,800
I hope you can live a good life.

304
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,000
You didn't tell me about your salary.

305
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,800
That's for real.

306
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,160
Let me out!

307
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,400
You have a long way

308
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,120
a long way to go.

309
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,320
Don't always look down at the shadow under your feet.

310
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,240
No matter what happens today,

311
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,320
don't come out of here.

312
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,160
Understand?

313
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,480
Raise your head.

314
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,360
Look at the sun.

00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,280

316
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,040
Are you okay?

317
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,400
I'm fine.

318
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,680
One against four.

319
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,560
to fight the bad guys.

320
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,400
Do you really think you're a tough girl?

321
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,160
What if they all have weapons?

322
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,400
It's just a minor injury.

323
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,080
Alright.

324
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,800
Don't go to the scene for the next two days.

325
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,560
Have a good rest.

326
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,480
Captain Cao.

327
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,800
It's just a minor injury.

328
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,720
It's the 15th.

329
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,760
I'll go with you.

330
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,320
Let's go.

331
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,120
What are you waiting for?

332
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,560
I don't know

333
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,200
I don't know

334
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,440
or never.

335
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,280
It's been so many years.

336
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,760
I just want to know

337
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,480
what happened that day.

338
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,800
Who is that mysterious person?

339
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,960
What does that symbol mean?

340
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,040
At the crime scene that day,

341
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,200
Except for that symbol,

342
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,120
there are no valuable traces and clues left.

343
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,760
It's almost done.

344
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,160
Are you sure you're not getting off?

345
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,960
Who is this person?

346
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,240
For so many years,

347
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,520
no one has visited him.

348
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,640
Why did someone pick him up?

349
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,320
Let's go.

350
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,640
I made some bait last night.

351
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,080
How about we try it today?

352
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,640
I heard

353
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,000
a lot yesterday.

354
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,880
I was fishing in the north yesterday.

355
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
I caught over ten catties.

356
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,640
It's not big.

357
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,520
I got it.

358
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,280
