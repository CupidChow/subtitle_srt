1
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,600
Stop!

2
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,560
Stop!

3
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,400
Don't move.

4
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,280
Abyss.

5
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,520
Captain Cao, I'm going upstairs.

6
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,800
Take them away.

7
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,600
Captain Cao is coming back.

8
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,640
We have to go now.

9
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,400
Don't tell Captain Cao that you saw us.

10
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,840
The suspect has been arrested.

11
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,560
Don't worry.

12
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,320
We're leaving.

13
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:31,960
Okay.

14
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,880
Thank you.

15
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,280
Abyss.

16
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,400
What’s wrong with you two?

17
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,079
Fan.

18
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,920
If Captain Cao knows

19
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,560
Ning Zhen came to investigate the abyss case with you,

20
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,040
He will leave soon.

21
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,360
We're just investigating

22
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,160
the naked body case in Kubei.

23
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,120
Have you caught the abyss?

24
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,240
I got it.

25
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,400
Just grab it.

26
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,800
You caught him.

27
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,760
Don't spill it.

28
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,440
I...

29
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,600
Catch.

30
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,720
Stand by the wall.

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
I caught him.

32
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,040
What happened?

33
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,240
Captain Cao.

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,440
I caught him.

35
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,480
Then...

36
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,360
and pursue the abyss.

37
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,079
And you let him stay here alone

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,480
and wait for you?

39
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,320
Take him away.

40
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,520
Yes.

41
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,560
Let's stay here for a while.

42
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,520
We'll leave after Captain Cao leaves.

43
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,520
Why is there another person?

44
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,920
Hello?

45
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,920
Officer Ning.

46
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,400
Someone is following you.

47
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,240
Don't look back.

48
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,280
Go eat at the restaurant ahead.

49
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,760
Leave the rest to us.

50
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,920
Okay.

51
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,960
I see.

52
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,360
Let's go.

53
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,120
Stop fighting!

54
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,159
I'll tell you.

55
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll tell you.

56
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,920
You've been

57
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,200
you've been following Wu Ke Ran, right?

58
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,840
Who gave you the key?

59
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,120
I didn't follow her before.

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,640
I just got the girl's information

61
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,680
from the seller today.

62
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,680
Hunger.

63
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,720
I couldn't help it.

64
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,440
I wanted to find a chance to do it.

65
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,080
That's why he came to the girl's workplace and waited.

66
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,720
People who sell my information

67
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,600
are all connected online.

68
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,720
I've never seen her in person.

69
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,760
It's the same as Li Jing's.

70
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,560
Is it really him?

71
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,680
Before the abyss,

72
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,840
and Zhang Jianmin's death

73
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,760
led us to the naked body case in Kubei.

74
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,040
Then why did he

75
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,400
make things worse this time?

76
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,840
I have the same thought.

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,480
He used to die with one stab.

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,120
The fatal wound was at the heart.

79
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,040
But when I saw the forensic report,

80
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,680
but he stabbed several times.

81
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,760
The method of the crime is not mature.

82
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,240
Forget about it.

83
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,640
Let's ask Captain Cao about the interrogation tomorrow.

84
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,360
Uncle Xiao.

85
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,000
The naked body case in Kubei 15 years ago.

86
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,320
Wu Fei's last request.

87
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,280
Why didn't I find it?

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,159
Did someone take it?

89
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,760
There is a document

90
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,880
was borrowed

91
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,520
was borrowed before you.

92
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,800
Who is it?

93
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,640
Captain Cao.

94
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,320
I printed it.

95
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you.

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,480
You're welcome.

97
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,280
Yeongjin.

98
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,480
Come with me.

99
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,920
Captain Cao.

100
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,040
How is it going here?

101
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,480
The suspect is Li Jing's brother.

102
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,320
He's an IT agent.

103
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,040
When I was fixing my sister's computer,

104
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,840
I found that my sister was attacked.

105
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,200
Because the website in the abyss

106
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,680
He wants to use this

107
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,640
to take revenge on everyone.

108
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,880
Last night,

109
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,440
he followed the buyer

110
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,320
because he thought of his sister.

111
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,520
No.

112
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,680
others to be hurt like her sister.

113
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,400
Now he has confessed

114
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,280
the process of killing Zhao Weiguo and Qian Xian.

115
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,120
However,

116
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,640
Li Guokun

117
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,600
It has nothing to do with Zhang Jianmin's death.

118
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,960
He's not an abyss.

119
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,600
No.

120
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,280
You two came to me because...

121
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,720
The naked body case in Kubei.

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,280
Do you have

123
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,039
with you?

124
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,680
Did you join the investigation

125
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,160
with my dad?

126
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,360
This is the last case

127
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,120
participated in the investigation.

128
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,040
So you know this case best.

129
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
After Master died,

130
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,400
after Master died.

131
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,320
but we didn't get any new clues.

132
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,280
A living person

133
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,240
15 years.

134
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840
You didn't even use your ID card,

135
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,560
or travel records.

136
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,200
It's like the world vanished.

137
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,000
without any trace of life.

138
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,960
In our opinion,

139
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,160
is probably dead.

140
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,080
Just like my mother.

141
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,720
We just suspect that

142
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,360
there is no evidence

143
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,680
that Wu Fei is dead.

144
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,680
If Wu Fei is dead,

145
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
it must be related to this letter.

146
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,720
The content is very simple.

147
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,360
An employee representative

148
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,200
asked Wu Fei to find the company.

149
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,280
the lost client list.

150
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,160
But the pay is 200,000.

151
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,880
RMB200,000 15 years ago

152
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,280
is not a small amount.

153
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,960
A large medical company

154
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,160
was stolen by his employees.

155
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,360
a confidential document

156
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,520
and was blackmailed.

157
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,800
That's why he asked Wu Fei

158
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,440
After investigation,

159
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,400
this employee is the victim, Jin Jie.

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,600
But she resigned before the incident

161
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,520
She didn't live in the house she rented.

162
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,400
but a temporary residence outside.

163
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,720
This temporary residence

164
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,440
There was a fire after the incident.

165
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,160
There was no evidence left.

166
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,280
According to this,

167
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,440
Wu Fei killed Jin Jie

168
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,920
is the 200,000 yuan.

169
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,120
But because they didn't negotiate,

170
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,280
because they didn't negotiate.

171
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,240
Wu Fei is really short of money

172
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,600
because of his lover.

173
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,960
And after the incident,

174
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,360
his account received

175
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,760
of 100,000 yuan.

176
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,720
Wu Fei got the confidential document

177
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,880
for the employer.

178
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,480
Probably.

179
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,640
I think

180
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,080
other people related to this case

181
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,920
about this case.

182
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,400
Especially

183
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,440
Wu Fei's Jiang's Group.

184
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,200
Be careful.

185
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,880
Report in time.

186
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,280
Okay.

187
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,600
After so many years,

188
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,920
after so many years?

189
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,040
Since it's under the company's name,

190
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,360
he'll definitely leave a record.

191
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,720
How much do you know about Jiang's Group?

192
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,720
It's a famous company.

193
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,880
I only know one thing.

194
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,640
The former president fell down the stairs

195
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,920
fell down the stairs in an accident

196
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,960
and became a vegetative.

197
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,760
Then his daughter, Jiang Yan, took over the company.

198
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,160
It's developing well.

199
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,440
He even built his own industrial park.

200
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,200
But Jiang Yan just came back.

201
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,400
and didn't take over the company.

202
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,800
How would she know that?

203
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,320
You know her too.

204
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,520
She often represents Jiang's Group to do charity.

205
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,920
I saw her on the media.

206
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,080
Let's meet her.

207
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,320
Morning.

208
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,280
Ms. Jiang.

209
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,200
Do you take the elevator?

210
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,280
It's okay. You guys go ahead.

211
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,240
Who is that?

212
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,080
He doesn't take the elevator or or the stairs.

213
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,840
That’s Mr. Jiang from our group.

214
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
of our group.

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,480
likes sports,

216
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
and doesn't like taking elevators.

217
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,720
He's our idol.

218
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,480
Please have a seat.

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,840
Please wait a moment

220
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,640
Thank you.

221
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,440
When can Ms. Jiang come back?

222
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,280
We've been waiting for almost two hours.

223
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,120
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,960
Let me ask him again.

225
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,120
Thank you.

226
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,160
Let's wait a little longer.

227
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,400
We came here without an appointment.

228
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,680
Okay.

229
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll take it as afternoon tea.

230
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,080
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,720
Officers.

232
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,680
Sorry.

233
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

234
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,000
Hello.

235
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm Ms. Jiang's brother.

236
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,960
My name is Jiang Fei.

237
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,200
Please have a seat.

238
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,920
Thank you.

239
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,000
My sister

240
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,080
is meeting a very important client.

241
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,520
He won't be back soon.

242
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,920
What about you two?

243
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,920
If you have any questions,

244
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,000
just ask me.

245
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,040
I'll tell you everything I know.

246
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,560
Do you know

247
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,840
your company's client list was stolen 15 years ago?

248
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,240
I know something.

249
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,040
When I first joined the company,

250
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,280
as my sister's assistant.

251
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,520
It seems that an employee

252
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,560
stole the company's internal documents.

253
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,240
and tried to blackmail the company.

254
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,240
I didn't want them to keep their promise.

255
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,560
we'll add more later.

256
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,680
So we found a consulting company.

257
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,720
The owner

258
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,960
He used to be a cop.

259
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,800
It cost a lot.

260
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,160
to find out

261
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,040
This person

262
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,640
who just resigned from the company.

263
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,040
Take a look at this.

264
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,000
This is a drug researcher of your company.

265
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,240
Her name is Jin Jie.

266
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,400
Is that her?

267
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,400
I really don't remember

268
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,760
what happened 15 years ago.

269
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,120
But I'm sure of one thing.

270
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,240
this person must be a woman.

271
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,960
Why didn't you call the police

272
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
Why didn't you call the police directly?

273
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,080
instead of the police?

274
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,680
Officers,

275
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,600
our company

276
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,080
in the industry.

277
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,800
First,

278
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,360
I'm afraid it'll affect the public.

279
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,080
Second,

280
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,680
I'm also afraid of competitors

281
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,760
to take revenge.

282
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,920
Do you remember

283
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,240
who was

284
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,200
Who is from your company?

285
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,640
I went to Wu Fei on behalf of the company.

286
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,000
is just an ordinary employee.

287
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,600
A dozen years ago.

288
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,640
I've already resigned.

289
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,560
Otherwise, it wouldn't be me

290
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,840
to receive you.

291
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,200
What happened next?

292
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,960
Later,

293
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,240
we got the document back.

294
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,480
Let's settle the rest.

295
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,840
it'll be over.

296
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,680
You mean

297
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,240
the person you were looking for retrieved the file

298
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,240
and returned it to you.

299
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,320
Yes.

300
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,360
Did you hand it in yourself?

301
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,400
Email?

302
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,160
We paid the rest according to the contract.

303
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
Do you know

304
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,000
Jin Jie was killed.

305
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,560
And Wu Fei from your consulting company

306
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,200
has been listed as a suspect.

307
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
I didn't know.

308
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,960
About a week after the payment was paid.

309
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,400
The police came to ask.

310
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,720
I just heard that

311
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,200
Wu Fei

312
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,480
in such extreme way.

313
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,280
Did he hire a murderer?

314
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,760
Officer,

315
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,560
We're all fair and square.

316
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,800
And we have a legal contract.

317
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,960
It has been confirmed back then.

318
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,599
Do you still remember

319
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,359
Do you remember?

320
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,599
I'm sorry.

321
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,359
Here.

322
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,560
The police asked about it.

323
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,040
But it's been a week since the incident.

324
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,560
I threw away all the packages.

325
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,840
No one noticed the address.

326
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,760
Okay.

327
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,720
Thank you.

328
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,640
I knew it.

329
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,200
We've been waiting for so long.

330
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,760
There's no useful clue.

331
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,240
It's been more than ten years.

332
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,120
About the origin and karma of this matter,

333
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,520
The flute that just joined the company

334
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,840
can speak so perfectly.

335
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,440
And Jiang Yan hasn't shown up.

336
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,400
What's wrong?

337
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,840
Jiang Yan.

338
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,160
Isn't she with the client?

339
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,320
She deliberately doesn't want to see us.

340
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,280
Let’s go.

341
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,360
Go visit the victim’s family.

342
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,000
Jin Jie’s parents have passed away many years ago.

343
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,040
Only her uncle’s family

344
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,760
her uncle's family.

345
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,280
Who?

346
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,600
Who are you?

347
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,280
Officer.

348
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,200
Hello.

349
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,840
Are you Jin Jie’s uncle?

350
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,720
Yes.

351
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
We came to you today

352
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,880
to learn about Jin Jie’s case.

353
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,200
Xiao Jie's case?

354
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,960
We have new news.

355
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Please come in.

356
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,720
Uncle.

357
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
We're here today

358
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,280
to know

359
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,120
who Jin Jie had a grudge with

360
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,680
or offended anyone?

361
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,840
Impossible

362
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,640
Xiaojie

363
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,840
very kind.

364
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,680
and has a good temper.

365
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,760
When you work,

366
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,960
and behave.

367
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,440
I never hold grudges against anyone.

368
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,960
Got it.

369
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,200
Did anything unusual happen

370
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,720
before the accident?

371
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,920
This...

372
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,360
I only remember

373
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,960
Xiaojie

374
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,120
found a good job in the city.

375
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,760
What are you doing?

376
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,440
A drug researcher.

377
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,840
But before the accident,

378
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,120
before the accident.

379
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,360
It's such a good job.

380
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,520
such a good job?

381
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,720
Then why didn't she

382
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,800
after that?

383
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,920
Well...

384
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,680
I'm not sure.

385
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,200
Is there really something?

386
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,720
She also told her parents

387
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,840
Unfortunately,

388
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,640
they

389
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,680
are long gone.

390
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,320
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,040
Wu Fei.

392
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,960
needs money to treat his wife.

393
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,080
So Wu Fei took a high commission

394
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,040
to kill Jin Jie.

395
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,200
But after Wu Fei went missing,

396
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,040
his wife

397
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
died of a serious illness

398
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,520
due to lack of money.

399
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,760
After Wu Fei went missing,

400
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,840
after Wu Fei went missing.

401
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,400
But this money

402
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,160
is evidence to prove Wu Fei's motive.

403
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,840
In this case,

404
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,240
Wu Fei's motive for murder doesn't make sense.

405
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,680
This money is more like

406
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,080
to prove

407
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,560
why Wu Fei killed him.

408
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,480
Maybe it's to prove that Wu Fei

409
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,800
was still alive after Jin Jie’s death.

410
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,080
But the CCTV did see it.

411
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,440
After Wu Fei killed Jin Jie,

412
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,600
after he killed Jin Jie.

413
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,200
and destroy the evidence.

414
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,400
Back then,

415
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,520
the police investigation

416
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,800
was Jang Geon-min,

417
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,600
because of Jang Geon-min's report,

418
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,880
the police

419
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,000
found Wu Fei's body

420
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,480
Wu Fei dumped the body.

421
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,720
But Jang Gun-min

422
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,760
is the weakest part of all evidence chains.

423
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,120
If Jang Geon-min had lied,

424
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,800
who ordered him to do it?

425
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,160
If someone deliberately

426
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,280
was deliberately disguised,

427
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,440
That means there must be some doubts

428
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,480
there must be something we haven't found.

429
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,320
I'll get all the surveillance videos

430
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,280
related to this case.

431
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,320
Did you find anything?

432
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,680
I checked all the roads of Wu Fei's car.

433
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,440
including the scene where Jin Jie’s body was found.

434
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,440
there was a CCTV footage that

435
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,520
Wu Fei's car came here.

436
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,280
and stayed here for a while.

437
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,400
Then there's no clue.

438
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,560
Calm down.

439
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,960
Let's keep looking.

440
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,040
I'll go buy some food.

441
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,400
Captain Cao.

442
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,440
Thank you.

443
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,560
For what?

444
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,760
Thank you.

445
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,480
for not giving up on my dad's case.

446
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,360
That's what I do.

447
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,520
Besides,

448
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,680
this case has been delayed for so many years.

449
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,040
I feel

450
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,800
feel guilty.

451
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,960
I know it's not your fault.

452
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,240
And

453
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,240
it's quite difficult.

454
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,560
So,

455
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,760
I want to treat you to a meal today.

456
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,800
Dinner

457
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,280
It's lunch time.

458
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,280
I won't delay your work.

459
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,160
This time,

460
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,920
this time.

461
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,480
Okay.

462
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,760
Then

463
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,760
around here.

464
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,960
Okay.

465
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,720
Ms. Jiang is here. Welcome.

466
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,360
The barbecue is delicious today.

467
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,560
We can go again another day.

468
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,080
Are you happy?

469
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,760
Where did the bug come from?

470
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,160
What are you doing?

471
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,960
Are you crazy?

472
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,640
Hello.

473
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,920
Are you okay?

474
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,160
Hello.

475
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,080
I'm a cop.

476
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,000
I won't hurt you.

477
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,680
What happened?

478
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,960
He's crazy.

479
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,560
He hit on me at the bar first.

480
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,760
and asked me to go home with him.

481
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,040
I don't know what's wrong with my brain.

482
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,400
He left it here.

483
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,400
Are you a cop?

484
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,280
I'm reporting in real name.

485
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,320
This bastard is drunk driving.

486
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,960
Go get him.

487
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,040
You didn't know each other before?

488
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,720
If I knew him,

489
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,320
do I have to be here?

490
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,080
Alright, I'll call a taxi for you.

491
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,480
Leave me alone.

492
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,120
I can call myself.

493
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,320
He drove drunk.

494
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,520
Get him.

495
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,880
Captain Cao.

496
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,760
Hello?

497
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,640
Chunyang Road.

498
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,560
Someone was drunk driving.

499
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,960
The license plate number is...

500
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,280
HaiB 78500.

501
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,080
OK.

502
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,840
Marco Lu.

503
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,080
Marco Lu.

504
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,400
What's wrong?

505
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,000
Look at Wu Fei's route.

506
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,240
I know.

507
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,080
I've seen it many times.

508
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,520
Look at this road without CCTV.

509
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,200
Pay attention.

510
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,720
This is Wu Fei's car.

511
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,800
This is the suspect car.

512
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,200
The car is driving normally.

513
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,280
each car

514
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,440
on the same road

515
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,000
at the same speed.

516
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,960
Let's start with the last camera.

517
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,480
to the next camera.

518
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,800
Let's test the driving time of each car.

519
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,920
which one takes longer?

520
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,280
it means this car

521
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,040
on this road.

522
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,400
Wu Fei's car.

523
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,920
From entering the blind area

524
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,640
from entering the blind area

525
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,800
Compared to other time,

526
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,720
at the same time,

527
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,000
he was 56 seconds late.

528
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,480
Then,

529
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,080
he went to Jin Jie’s burial site.

530
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,720
In the end,

531
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
to a repair factory.

532
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
And the CCTV shows

533
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,280
there was a suspect car

534
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,960
there was a suspect car.

535
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,080
followed closely.

536
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,120
And this car

537
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,880
in the blind area

538
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,800
35 minutes.

539
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,800
What's the relationship between these two cars?

540
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,760
They stay in the same blind spot at the same time.

541
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,360
What a coincidence.

542
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
Let's assume Wu Fei was already killed.

543
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,600
Then the person who drove Wu Fei's car

544
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,240
is the murderer.

545
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,920
He was wearing Wu Fei's clothes and pretended to be Wu Fei

546
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,560
and drove the car

547
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,640
on the road without CCTV.

548
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,800
Then he stopped with another car

549
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,560
with another car,

550
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,360
drove the car to Jin Jie’s burial site.

551
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,720
and took care of Jin Jie’s body

552
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,320
and drove the car to the repair factory.

553
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,360
And the other suspect car

554
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,560
used the half an hour

555
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
to dump Wu Fei's body

556
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,440
Wu Fei's body

557
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,000
and buried it.

558
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,560
You mean

559
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,120
if Wu Fei had been killed,

560
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,080
he might be buried nearby.

561
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,600
Yes.

562
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,080
What about Wu Fei's car?

563
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,160
Where did it go?

564
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,880
The CCTV footage

565
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,600
according to Wu Fei's driving route.

566
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,600
As for this car,

567
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,120
It's been 15 years.

568
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,360
There's no way to find out.

569
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,440
I'll inform Captain Cao.

570
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,840
It's 3 a.m. now.

571
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,200
Is this the place?

572
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,360
It was here.

573
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,120
The blind spot of the surveillance back then.

574
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,000
All the way here is surveillance.

575
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,080
The road has expanded

576
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,520
A big change.

577
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,880
The suspect car

578
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,880
only 35 minutes

579
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,920
only 35 minutes.

580
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,720
If you want to bury the body,

581
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,760
it won't be too far.

582
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
It should be around here.

583
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,360
Hello, Tao Zi.

584
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,760
I'll send you a location.

585
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,440
Bring someone to block this area.

586
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,800
and search the area.

587
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,040
Xiaoyu.

588
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,600
We got the search warrant.

589
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,960
No.

590
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,920
Kris,

591
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,200
I found this car

592
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,680
I found that this car

593
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,160
a large medical group.

594
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,800
But there is a record that

595
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,600
this car

596
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,520
was reported for theft back then.

597
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,960
What group?

598
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,040
Jiang's Group.

599
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,640
And the user of this car

600
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,560
has always been the deputy general manager of the group.

601
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,720
It's the flute again.

602
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,600
I’ll report to Kris.

603
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,800
He looks a little nervous.

604
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,880
When I saw him last night,

605
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,680
when I saw him last night.

606
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,800
You met him last night?

607
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,120
On the road.

608
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,040
Drunk driving.

609
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,320
He flirted with a woman in the car.

610
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,280
and kicked her out halfway.

611
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,200
So strange.

612
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,920
Leave him alone.

613
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,520
Marco Lu.

614
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,680
Come in with me later.

615
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,480
Okay.

616
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,360
Name.

617
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,600
Kang Woo.

618
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,320
Age.

619
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,560
I want some water.

620
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,440
35 years old.

621
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,960
I drank too much last night.

622
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,720
I'm thirsty.

623
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,600
Didn't you get caught for drunk driving?

624
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,760
Drunk driving?

625
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,400
The driver who drove my car last night was my driver.

626
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,320
It has nothing to do with me.

627
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,720
That's why you called me here.

628
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,040
Come.

629
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,440
Take a look.

630
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,199
Do you remember this car?

631
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,120
No.

632
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,560
Take a closer look.

633
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,440
Don't you know your own car?

634
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,440
The suspect of the naked body case in Kubei.

635
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,840
Wu Fei.

636
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,199
On the way to dump the body,

637
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,639
this car has been following him.

638
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,719
You're the owner.

639
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,520
It's a porridge.

640
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,199
You mean the car that was stolen 15 years ago?

641
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,800
I remember.

642
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,520
This isn't the only car I have.

643
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,520
And this car that was stolen 15 years ago

644
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,800
was reported 15 years ago.

645
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,520
Where were you

646
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,800
where were you?

647
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,600
What are you doing?

648
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,880
Can you remember

649
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,960
where you were 15 years ago

650
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,840
What did you do?

651
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,800
It's a flute.

652
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,440
With your attitude,

653
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
we have more reason to suspect

654
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,160
you are related to the naked body case in Kubei.

655
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,640
Please cooperate.

656
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,760
How can I cooperate?

657
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,480
I've said everything I should.

658
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,600
Please let me out.

659
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,920
I feel very uncomfortable here.

660
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,800
As long as you accept our interrogation,

661
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,280
it means you have nothing to do with this.

662
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,960
we will let you go.

663
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,960
Captain Cao.

664
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,160
Captain Cao.

665
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,160
Get back to work.

666
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,160
Hello.

667
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,360
Thank you, officers.

668
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,200
I'm the legal consultant of Jiang's Pharmacy Group.

669
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:49,920
Zhang Dong.

670
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,920
I'm here to pick up my client, Mr Jiang.

671
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,920
What's the rush?

672
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,480
We haven't finished yet.

673
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,640
This

674
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
the report of the missing car.

675
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,920
The time and location are very detailed.

676
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,000
It proves that

677
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,560
has nothing to do with my client.

678
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,840
If you can't bring out any new evidence,

679
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,160
you have no right to detain my client.

680
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,160
Also,

681
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,960
this can prove that my client

682
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,760
has severe claustrophobia.

683
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,160
In the interrogation room,

684
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,920
Such a small and closed space

685
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,560
can't accept normal questions.

686
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,040
If you insist on asking,

687
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,560
and cause

688
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,520
to my client

689
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,360
or physically.

690
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,640
we have the right to hold you accountable.

691
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,160
Of course.

692
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,760
if you need

693
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,920
in the future,

694
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,880
We are obligated to provide clues.

695
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,160
The police can contact me directly.

696
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,120
I can represent

697
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,280
my client.

698
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,760
Captain Cao.

699
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,600

700
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,120
