1
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,000
You're here already?

2
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,880
Are you waiting for me?

3
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,800
I thought you were coming.

4
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,800
so I prepared a small gift for you.

5
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
Wait.

6
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,440
You told me

7
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,560
you would give me a gift.

8
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,040
Is this it?

9
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,440
Yeongjin.

10
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,720
Are you confused

11
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,600
between me and your other friends?

12
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,760
I didn't say

13
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,240
I didn't say I wanted to give you a gift.

14
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,760
Really?

15
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,680
If I want to give you a real gift,

16
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,800
it must be

17
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,840
something you really like.

18
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,520
What is this?

19
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,560
This is a program I just wrote.

20
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,400
It can help you get what you want.

21
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,400
How did you know I needed this?

22
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,480
How would I know what you need?

23
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,520
Maybe the gift I gave you

24
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,680
is of use to you.

25
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,760
Joien.

26
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,120
What do you have to do with the abyss?

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
Abyss?

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,480
What abyss?

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,120
You came all the way here

30
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,280
to ask me this?

31
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,760
Forget it.

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,560
But I won't use

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,840
your things.

34
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,440
Yeongjin.

35
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,640
Why bother?

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,600
It's just a gift.

37
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,160
Look at me now.

38
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Even if I have bad intentions,

39
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,520
what else can I do?

40
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,480
Let's go.

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,600
Let me give you a ride.

42
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,360
Where did you go?

43
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,920
Nothing.

44
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,680
Here's some water.

45
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,600
Thank you.

46
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,200
Found it.

47
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,880
of Jiang's Group.

48
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,120
Let me see.

49
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,240
[Wish you luck.]

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,800
What's wrong?

51
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,280
Nothing.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,640
We have no technical support

53
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,040
we can only get the computer out

54
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,240
and find a way to break it.

55
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,560
The penthouse.

56
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,680
Jiang Yan's office.

57
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,080
These are

58
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,360
the safe passageway of the building

59
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,520
There are security guards 24 hours a day.

60
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,480
You need to register or pass to enter.

61
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,200
Every floor and office need it.

62
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,280
corresponding staff cards.

63
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,520
And the CCTV in the whole building

64
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,680
in this building.

65
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,560
employee card.

66
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,760
I need an employee card.

67
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,600
Leave it to me.

68
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,000
Officer,

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,400
All the surveillance files in our community

70
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,280
are all here.

71
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,360
Okay.

72
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,200
Thank you.

73
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,920
You're welcome.

74
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
What is this?

75
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,360
A proper way.

76
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you.

77
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,840
It’s right to follow Kris.

78
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,080
Please take two copies of your medical check-up and ID.

79
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,360
Be careful.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,800
Okay.

81
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,520
What can I do for you?

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,159
I'm here to work.

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,800
Okay.

84
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,520
Let's go in.

85
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,040
My uniform and staff are stuck in the closet.

86
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,920
Get changed and you can start working.

87
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,640
Okay.

88
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,120
Zhen Zhen.

89
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,680
I'm going to work.

90
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,760
Do your homework at home.

91
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,600
Be good.

92
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,920
Okay.

93
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,520
Okay.

94
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,240
Mom.

95
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,720
Aren't you coming in?

96
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,400
Which floor are you going?

97
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,000
The top floor.

98
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,720
Are you new here?

99
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,520
Hello.

100
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,400
Cleaning.

101
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
Attention, all departments.

102
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,840
Someone has entered the chairman's office.

103
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
Seal the whole building now.

104
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,520
Hello?

105
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,680
You're exposed.

106
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,520
Retreat now!

107
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,960
Ning Zhen.

108
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,280
It's too late.

109
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,200
I've changed my profession.

110
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,120
Vet Floor.

111
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,480
Hello?

112
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeongjin. Yeongjin.

113
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,120
I think this suits you better.

114
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,640
Where is she?

115
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,840
Mr. Mo.

116
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,840
He's in the elevator.

117
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,440
Find out whose employee card he used.

118
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,000
Cancel all authority right now.

119
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,960
Ning Zhen.

120
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,480
How did you come up with this idea?

121
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,080
Cut the crap.

122
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,320
How can we activate the employee card of Jiang's Group?

123
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,280
That's easy.

124
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,200
I'll send you a file

125
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,000
Then turn on the NFC function of your phone

126
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,040
Then open my file.

127
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,720
and put your phone and your access card

128
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,680
together.

129
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,080
You can't enter the park now.

130
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,360
Police.

131
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,480
I was here a few days ago.

132
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,240
Have you forgotten?

133
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,120
Move.

134
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,320
Detective.

135
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,080
Good timing.

136
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,160
We have a thief here.

137
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,160
Get in.

138
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,480
Lock the door.

139
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,680
All vehicles are not allowed to go out.

140
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,240
Did you get it?

141
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,960
Yes.

142
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,720
Are you okay?

143
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,480
I'll take you to the hospital.

144
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,320
No, I'm fine.

145
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,960
Mo Bei will catch up soon.

146
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,120
Let's hurry up and copy the data.

147
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,520
Everything is here.

148
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,440
What is this?

149
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,200
When the data is sent,

150
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,120
bring the USB and inform Captain Cao.

151
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,640
I'll hold the computer.

152
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,200
to stall Mo Bei.

153
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,120
No.

154
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll stall him.

155
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,080
You go to Captain Cao.

156
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,440
Okay.

157
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,920
Take the USB.

158
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,720
Don't act tough.

159
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,760
This is the evidence.

160
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,840
Ning Zhen.

161
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,680
Ning Zhen.

162
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,240
Ning Zhen!

163
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,440
Ning Zhen.

164
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,800
Captain Cao.

165
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,160
Fan called and said

166
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
she got the evidence.

167
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,320
But Ning Zhen is injured.

168
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,560
We've called an ambulance.

169
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,880
And Mo Bei is chasing her.

170
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,840
At Wuling Road.

171
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,760
Lu Fan.

172
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,640
Marco Lu.

173
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,720
Where is Ning Zhen?

174
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,720
A living person just disappeared.

175
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,000
Then you brought a computer

176
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,200
with a computer

177
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,720
in front of me.

178
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,080
You've already got it, right?

179
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,400
Where is he?

180
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,400
The evidence

181
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,600
has been taken away by Ning Zhen.

182
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,200
He should be in the police's hands now.

183
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,760
Give up.

184
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,080
It's your best choice

185
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,200
is your best choice.

186
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,600
I have a better choice.

187
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
What are you doing?

188
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,840
Hello, Ning Zhen.

189
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,680
This is Mo Bei.

190
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,040
Where is Marco Lu?

191
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,240
Marco Lu.

192
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,200
She is here.

193
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,840
I'll give you ten minutes.

194
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,160
Within ten minutes,

195
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,640
take all the evidence and copy documents

196
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,400
