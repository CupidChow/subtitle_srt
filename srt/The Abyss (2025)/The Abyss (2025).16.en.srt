1
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,759
Hey! Hey! Hey!

2
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,320
Are you crazy?

3
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,240
Time waits for no one.

4
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,920
Fluffy.

5
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,000
All these years,

6
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,160
have you ever thought about

7
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,720
give it back to me?

8
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,040
Sister.

9
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,920
It's the right day today.

10
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,480
When you arrive at 12,

11
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,280
the email will be sent to the police automatically.

12
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,240
As usual.

13
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,920
Only when I'm alive

14
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,000
you'll be fine.

15
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,120
Take it away.

16
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,480
Mo Bei.

17
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,040
You dog.

18
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,280
All these years,

19
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
I've been enduring the hatred

20
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,240
and let you be by my side.

21
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,800
Everything about you

22
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,480
is under my control.

23
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,840
email.

24
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,400
My phone.

25
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,079
Here.

26
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,120
I searched everywhere.

27
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,920
There's nothing.

28
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,280
I've had enough.

29
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
Let's end this today.

30
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,160
As long as you give me my things,

31
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,079
I'll send you abroad.

32
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,400
and give you a new identity.

33
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,560
Isn't that great?

34
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,280
You can be free.

35
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,600
You don't have to carry the password

36
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,480
You don't have to work so hard.

37
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,880
You're my brother.

38
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,880
Sister.

39
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,320
Sister

40
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,280
Sister

41
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
You're willing to tell me?

42
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,120
Sister.

43
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,880
I have something on you.

44
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,640
You have evidence of my murder.

45
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,520
We've been balancing each other for so many years.

46
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,240
and safe.

47
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,520
Isn't that great?

48
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,920
I enjoyed it too.

49
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,080
As normal siblings,

50
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,600
I can feel

51
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,320
your tolerance for all my mistakes.

52
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,480
and my tolerance for you

53
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,240
is always

54
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,920
Because I'm afraid of what's in your hand.

55
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,280
I guess it really made you feel like a family.

56
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,560
Honey.

57
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,680
I want to do my nails. Okay.

58
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,240
Okay.

59
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,400
I'll go with you.

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,040
Really?

61
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,480
Honey, you're so nice to me.

62
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,960
What is it?

63
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,240
What if you step on it?

64
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,760
Dad.

65
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,200
Is this pretty?

66
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,440
Yes.

67
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,040
But don't throw it around

68
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,600
I stepped on the stairs.

69
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,720
It's dangerous.

70
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,760
Okay, Dad.

71
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,720
Play by yourself.

72
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,800
It's too late.

73
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,680
Auntie.

74
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,240
Don't forget to make nutritious food for Yi-chi later.

75
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,080
Okay.

76
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,000
I got it.

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Yanyan.

78
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,880
What's wrong?

79
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
I can't move.

80
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,320
This...

81
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,280
It hurts so much.

82
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,200
Go get me the medicine.

83
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,320
Hurry up.

84
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,920
Okay.

85
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,040
You're playing with me, aren't you?

86
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,920
Let me play.

87
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,240
Let me play.

88
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,920
You...

89
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,400
Come with me.

90
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,280
Come with me.

91
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,160
It's time to go to the black room.

92
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,400
I'll take you to the black room now.

93
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,440
Come with me.

94
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,120
Sister!

95
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,920
Let go of me!

96
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:44,480
Let go of me!

97
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,840
Stay right there.

98
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,720
Just stay there.

99
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,440
Fluzy.

100
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Did you lock him up again?

101
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,080
Let him out.

102
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,280
Why did you hit me?

103
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,159
I didn't.

104
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,720
I want to tell my dad.

105
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,520
Don't hit me.

106
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,920
Can you?

107
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,920
I didn't.

108
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Go away!

109
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,480
Fluffy.

110
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,880
Is it fun

111
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,960
Is it fun?

112
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Are you afraid of it?

113
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,880
right?

114
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,720
Are you afraid of it?

115
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,520
Bye, little rabbit.

116
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,320
Why did you agree to go to MBA?

117
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,480
Are you competing with me?

118
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,160
No.

119
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,080
I didn't promise Dad.

120
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,840
I just want to think about it.

121
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,880
Think about it.

122
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,760
Think about it?

123
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,240
You still need to think about it.

124
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,200
I won't go.

125
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,760
Sister.

126
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,960
I was wrong.

127
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,320
Fluffy.

128
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,520
Do you want to go clubbing?

129
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,960
Club is fun.

130
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,040
I'll give you money.

131
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay?

132
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:31,920
Sister.

133
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,440
Thank you.

134
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,600
Sister

135
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,440
Thank you.

136
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,040
Do you think I don't know

137
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,640
why you killed those girls?

138
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,000
Do you think

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,680
I walk through the stairs at home every day

140
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,760
I don't know what I'm stepping on.

141
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,160
You think I don't know?

142
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,120
those girls wore my clothes

143
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,080
before they died.

144
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,200
You've been trying to kill me for a long time.

145
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,400
Let me ask you again.

146
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,920
Where is my thing?

147
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,960
How about we die together today?

148
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,760
Sister.

149
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,360
My mom died early.

150
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,520
Dad hardly comes home because he has been working.

151
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,240
You're the first half of my life.

152
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,280
Only you.

153
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,360
I want family love

154
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,520
I remember your birthday

155
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,760
and all the important festivals about you.

156
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,120
I thought you would acknowledge me.

157
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,040
until that happened.

158
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,000
The evidence

159
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,360
is enough to accuse you.

160
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,400
Even so,

161
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,680
I thought

162
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,520
as long as you care about me,

163
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,400
even if

164
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,160
even if it's fake,

165
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,560
I'm willing to believe

166
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,520
Fluffy.

167
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,240
Why didn't you

168
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,600
to me?

169
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,240
You don't know

170
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,280
you are the only family

171
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,000
in this world.

172
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,840
It doesn't matter anymore.

173
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,760
Let's be good.

174
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,720
I promise you.

175
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,280
As long as we go out,

176
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,520
I'll always be with you.

177
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,320
Okay?

178
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Sister.

179
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,880
Stop pretending.

180
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,840
You have no feelings.

181
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,920
You've tortured me for so many years.

182
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,520
Dad has been paralyzed for more than ten years.

183
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,840
How many times have you seen him?

184
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,560
We all lived our lives wrong.

185
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,080
In the next life,

186
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,840
Let's start over in the next life.

187
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,200
Don't you want evidence?

188
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
The evidence is right beside you.

189
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,040
But you can never find it.

190
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,040
I'm so afraid of you.

191
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,680
hate you.

192
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,560
and know you.

193
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
So you want to die with me.

194
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,200
Do you know how your mom died?

195
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,880
Just like dad.

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,040
I pushed him.

197
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,720
Is it fun?

198
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,680
I don't want the evidence.

199
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,120
He told me.

200
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,000
I won't let you go again.

201
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,120
Maybe you'll never be a cop.

202
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,600
Where is the porridge?

203
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,400
He ran away.

204
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,320
The porpoise has solid evidence

205
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,360
and was arrested.

206
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,080
Why must you kill him?

207
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,560
Don't let go of every prey.

208
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,520
This is the law of hunting.

209
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,360
I don't know what you've been through

210
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,440
what happened to you.

211
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,920
But since you care so much about this case,

212
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,840
it means it has something to do with this case.

213
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,960
Who are you?

214
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,640
You care about who I am.

215
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,880
Have you ever thought

216
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,560
you are related to this case?

217
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,920
I...

218
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,960
Maybe one day, you will become me.

219
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,360
How could I become you?

220
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,000
Ning Zhen.

221
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,640
Have you ever thought

222
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,480
that the past and the present

223
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,800
is not a coincidence.

224
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,480
You've come this far.

225
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,720
As long as you keep investigating,

226
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,640
you'll see me soon.

227
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,720
When you find me,

228
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,040
I'll give you a gift.

229
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,640
What's going to happen

230
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,760
Let's wait and see.

231
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,400
[Abyss]

232
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,760
Abyss.

233
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,600
Abyss.

234
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,000
Abyss?

235
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,240
Ning Zhen.

236
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,960
Ning Zhen.

237
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,120
What about the abyss?

238
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,920
Yeongjin.

239
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,880
Are you okay?

240
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,720
How did you promise me?

241
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,680
Why did you and Marco Lu

242
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,720
come here?

243
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,760
Captain Cao.

244
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,760
I fought the abyss.

245
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,640
Now you need me.

246
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,200
Ning Zhen.

247
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,880
Captain Cao.

248
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
The CCTV is fixed.

249
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,200
Any other suspects

250
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,400
and other suspects?

251
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,680
We checked everything.

252
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,120
We didn't find anyone suspicious.

253
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,840
There's no CCTV.

254
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,200
Not the rooftop.

255
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,760
The basement.

256
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,600
Everyone!

257
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Follow me to the basement.

258
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,120
The murderer must have escaped from here.

259
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,320
Abyss?

260
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,200
It's not an abyss.

261
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
The flute disappeared while being kidnapped by the abyss.

262
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,320
The abyss followed me to the rooftop.

263
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,440
until the abyss escaped.

264
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,600
Then how did the flute get here

265
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,520
from the ward?

266
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,760
There must be an accomplice in the abyss.

267
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,000
Tao Zi.

268
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,560
Yes.

269
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,480
Keep searching.

270
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,960
Let's go to the surveillance room.

271
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,880
Got it.

272
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,360
Ms. Jiang.

273
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,400
Where are we going now?

274
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,640
Nursing Home.

275
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,000
The car in front.

276
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,840
Parking check.

277
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,200
We don't have time.

278
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,480
Stop the car in front.

279
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,560
Stop here.

280
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,120
Captain Cao.

281
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,440
This person looks like an abyss.

282
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,480
But this person

283
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,080
went into the blind spot.

284
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,720
Is there any other angle?

285
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,920
Let me see.

286
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,000
Pause this.

287
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,440
Turn back a little.

288
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,520
Jiang Yan's car came to the hospital tonight.

289
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,160
Captain Cao.

290
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,400
Say something.

291
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,240
We found a suspicious car.

292
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,200
We're tracking him down.

293
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,480
The license plate number is HaiBF5203.

294
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,920
Jiang Yan's car.

295
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,880
Captain Cao.

296
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,920
We found again at the nearby intersection.

297
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,160
in a cafe

298
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,400
entered a cafe.

299
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,640
Captain Cao.

300
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,080
[IP address]

301
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,880
the IP address that attacked the surveillance system

302
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,320
It was also in this cafe.

303
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,760
Tao Zi. Tao Zi.

304
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,480
Wait for me downstairs.

305
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,600
Go after the abyss.

306
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,240
When Jiang Hai died,

307
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,640
the abyss was on the rooftop with me.

308
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,240
If it's not an abyss,

309
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,560
Could it be Jiang Yan?

310
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,640
Get rid of them.

311
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,200
I'll take care of the evidence.

312
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,720
Okay.

313
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,280
Hello.

314
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,440
Municipal Police Station.

315
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,680
Officer,

316
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,440
How can I help you?

317
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,000
Could you check the CCTV footage?

318
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,480
I don't know what happened to the CCTV today.

319
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,680
It's been broken since night.

320
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,880
I couldn't fix it.

321
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,840
It's broken.

322
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,440
Is the CCTV in your shop

323
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,680
was still good during the day?

324
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,800
Yes.

325
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,160
Is there a back door?

326
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,000
No.

327
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,680
Hou.

328
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,320
Yes.

329
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,360
Guard the door.

330
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,600
No one is allowed to go out.

331
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,560
Yes, Captain Cao.

332
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,440
Tao Zi.

333
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,560
please register

334
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,080
in the store.

335
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Especially computer.

336
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,360
Focus on the investigation.

337
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:56,840
Yes.

338
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,280
Lee!

339
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,960
Over there.

340
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,600
Hello.

341
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,440
We're out of visiting time.

342
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,240
Are you new here?

343
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll call Director Liu with you.

344
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,000
Look, Marco Lu.

345
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,040
These are the points

346
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,960
when Mo Bei escaped.

347
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,360
His escape route is very messy,

348
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,400
his target

349
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,600
has never changed.

350
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,280
A nursing home.

351
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,520
Kang Yeon's father lives here.

352
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,680
They tried their best to enter the hospital.

353
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,080
and went to the nursing home

354
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,920
she went to the nursing home where her father was.

355
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,960
There must be something wrong with this place.

356
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,520
Whether it was Jiang Yan

357
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,400
or Mo Bei,

358
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,640
[or Mo Bei.]

359
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,880
Let's go.

360
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,560
Dad.

361
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,680
I'm here to see you.

362
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,640
As you know,

363
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,800
I've been busy lately.

364
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
I just finished my work and came here.

365
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,480
You know what day it is today, right?

366
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,760
For 15 years,

367
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,800
I'll visit you regularly.

368
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,080
I know.

369
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,200
But unfortunately,

370
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,760
this time,

371
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,800
this time.

372
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,240
From now on,

373
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,440
I'm afraid I'm the only one who can visit you.

374
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,360
He left something with you.

375
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,200
so I came to pick it up.

376
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,400
Dad.

377
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,880
So you know

378
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,280
why I called you today, right?

379
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,320
Dad, I'm sorry.

380
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,600
I forgot you can't move.

381
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,360
Is it good?

382
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,440
Dad.

383
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,400
Where is it?

384
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,680
I don't need to ask you.

385
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,760
You told me everything.

386
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,520
Otherwise,

387
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,200
why would I come here?

388
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,320
No wonder I checked all her emails.

389
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,120
No.

390
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,720
Dad.

391
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,320
So he's using your email.

392
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,520
What's the password?

393
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,320
You're the first half of my life.

394
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Only you.

395
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,200
I want family love.

396
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,560
I remember your birthday.

397
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,720
and all the important festivals about you.

398
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,240
You're my good brother.

399
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,040
He used my birthday password.

400
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,880
What a coincidence.

401
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,160
It's so late.

402
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,560
at this hour?

403
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,600
Officer Ning also has relatives living here.

404
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,240
Ms. Jiang looks busy today.

405
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,040
Go to the hospital to see your brother.

406
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,640
Who are you visiting at this hour?

407
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,360
You know I'm busy.

408
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,760
Move.

409
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,560
Can I see your computer?

410
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,440
I'm sorry to offend you.

411
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,600
Let me ask you something.

412
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,800
What's in this USB?

413
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,600
It's the company's office document, of course.

414
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,680
You don't want to talk?

415
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,200
Come back to the police station with us.

416
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,840
As bodyguards,

417
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,320
as bodyguards

418
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,360
is my duty.

419
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,680
On the contrary,

420
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,000
You need evidence to do anything.

421
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,520
Now,

422
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,840
Where is your evidence?

423
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,880
Officers,

424
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,440
Tonight, you randomly

425
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,040
for no reason tonight.

426
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,760
I must file a complaint against you.

427
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,960
Get up. Let's go.

428
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,240
The chip has been burned.

429
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,640
It can't be recovered.

430
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,520
This Jiang Yan...

431
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,440
Tell me.

432
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,880
What did you do at the hospital last night?

433
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,880
Answer the question.

434
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,600
Here's the thing.

435
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,240
Captain Cao.

436
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,320
I’m Ms. Jiang’s bodyguard.

437
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,120
Ms. Jiang

438
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,520
worried that something unexpected will happen

439
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,920
during the hospital.

440
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,640
So he asked me to stay around the hospital.

441
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,120
Then why did you run?

442
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,560
I saw a suspicious person running out.

443
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,720
so I followed him.

444
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,120
I just lost him.

445
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,920
I saw someone suspicious.

446
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,120
Then tell me

447
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,800
What's his license plate number?

448
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,880
The license plate is blocked.

449
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,640
I didn't see it.

450
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,440
I didn't know you were on me.

451
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,040
on me.

452
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,640
Why are you asking here?

453
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,480
Besides,

454
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,680
Captain Cao.

455
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,200
You spent so much effort

456
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,160
Did something happen in the hospital last night?

457
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,160
Is Ms. Jiang safe and sound?

458
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,880
Captain Cao.

459
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,640
Mo Bei.

460
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,960
Do you really not know?

461
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,680
The cleaner's son has grown up.

462
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,200
Do you want to deal with it?

463
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,920
Ms. Jiang.

464
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,720
He's just a cop.

465
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,600
Is Wu Ke Ran going to be discharged?

466
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,000
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

467
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,240
Your brother, Kang Mi, was murdered at the hospital last night.

468
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,120
Please come and cooperate with the investigation.

469
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,960
Captain Cao.

470
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,160
The test report is out.

471
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,360
Tell me.

472
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,320
The wound on the waist of the flute is a knife wound.

473
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,640
There are traces of second injury.

474
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,960
He was tortured before he died.

475
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,160
His fatal wound was a gunshot on his chest.

476
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,400
However,

477
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,760
there is no blood

478
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,640
on Mo Bei.

479
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,760
No weapon was found in his car.

480
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,680
and no dashcam was installed.

481
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,720
There was no CCTV footage

482
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,840
we can’t prove

483
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,480
We can't prove

484
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,160
if Mo Bei was admitted to the hospital that night.

485
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,160
What about the nurse?

486
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,920
She has disappeared.

487
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,360
Someone must be behind her.

488
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,520
If it was an abyss,

489
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,160
he could have killed the porpoise on the spot.

490
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,200
There's no need to lure him to the basement.

491
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,560
So last night in the hospital,

492
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,080
there must be another group.

493
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,920
Their goal is to save the porpoise.

494
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,320
Then what happened in the basement?

495
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,880
Captain Cao.

496
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,880
Come and take a look.

497
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,840
Jiang Yan is here.

498
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,440
Move.

499
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,720
Tell Director Zhao to come out.

500
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,120
Please wait a moment.

501
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,000
Captain Cao will be here soon.

502
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,760
Move.

503
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,480
Hold on.

504
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,120
He'll be here soon.

505
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,840
Move.

506
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,440
Ms. Kang, wait a moment. What is it?

507
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,840
Captain Cao.

508
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,120
Ms. Jiang.

509
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,200
You want to see me?

510
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Captain Cao.

511
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,360
Why did my brother die?

512
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,320
He's just a doctor.

513
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,160
What are you police doing?

514
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,800
The case is still under investigation.

515
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,040
You police are incompetent.

516
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,719
With so many people watching,

517
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,679
My brother was killed

518
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,280
and died so miserably.

519
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,520
Is it your fault

520
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,360
or

521
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,199
you are the accomplices?

522
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,800
Last night, near the hospital,

523
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,520
near the hospital last night.

524
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,920
I have a few questions for you.

525
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,280
What do you mean?

526
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,280
Please cooperate with our investigation.

527
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,520
I'm worried about my brother.

528
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,920
I asked my bodyguard to guard the hospital.

529
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,800
What's wrong with that?

530
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,120
If you don't catch the murderer,

531
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,080
instead of catching the murderer?

532
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,440
Are you crazy?

533
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,240
Captain Cao.

534
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,480
Now my brother is dead.

535
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
My brother is dead.

536
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,800
Do you understand?

537
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,000
The police should be responsible for his death.

538
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,440
Marco Lu.

539
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,280
Prepare the room.

540
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,160
Cao Jin.

541
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,120
Director Zhao.

542
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,120
Ms. Jiang.

543
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,360
Please calm down.

544
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,000
We will

545
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,880
we will give you

546
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,320
a satisfying answer.

547
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
Follow me.

548
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,160
Director Zhao.

549
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,280
Director Zhao.

550
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Director Zhao, take care.

551
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,600
Captain Cao.

552
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,320
How is it?

553
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,120
Release Mo Bei.

554
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,520
What?

555
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
Captain Cao, why?

556
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,520
There is no evidence.

557
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,480
Let him go.

558
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,680
Come with me.

559
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,720
Where did you go with Yeongjin last night?

560
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,800
We received a complaint

561
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,640
that you two broke into the nursing home for no reason

562
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,720
and stole the patient's family's personal belongings.

563
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,560
and damaged public facilities.

564
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,960
The nursing home patient was shocked.

565
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,840
Is that so?

566
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,760
Detective is investigating

567
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,000
Jiang's Group really complained about you and Ning.

568
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,080
You and Ning Zhen are suspended.

569
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,800
and be punished after finding out the truth.

570
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,240
Marco Lu,

571
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,160
we are not only facing the abyss,

572
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,600
but also

573
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,440
in the future.

574
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,360
I'm not afraid.

575
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,400
About Li Guo Kun, he...

576
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,280
Write a self-criticism.

577
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,960
and hand it over to me with the police ID.

578
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,240
Ning Zhen.

579
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,600
Ning Zhen.

580
