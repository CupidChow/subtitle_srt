1
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,320
Mr. Du.

2
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,360
I’ve got the thing.

3
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,160
I'll send it to you

4
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,240
as scheduled.

5
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,240
Great.

6
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,240
Thank you very much.

7
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,120
You didn't read it, did you?

8
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,600
We had a deal.

9
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,520
Don't worry.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,760
See you later.

11
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,840
Okay.

12
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,080
But on one condition.

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,000
Go ahead.

14
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,079
Don't look at anything inside.

15
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,800
Who is committing a crime?

16
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Who is blackmailing?

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,520
He said he believed me

18
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,920
to understand the situation.

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,800
But you always call me a bad guy.

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm not lying.

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,240
You can search.

22
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,160
or call the police.

23
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,400
If your client asks you to call the police...

24
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,680
Dad.

25
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,720
When will Mom recover?

26
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,760
200,000.

27
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,920
I'll give you 100,000 deposit first.

28
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,120
The rest 100,000

29
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
will be settled

30
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,000
after it’s done.

31
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,760
Don't distinguish right from wrong.

32
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,040
People like you

33
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,320
can do anything

34
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,720
you can do anything for money.

35
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,760
Wu Fei,

36
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,560
Why are you...

37
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:55,920
Lu Zheng.

38
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,040
Where are you?

39
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,600
I'm on a mission.

40
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,360
When will it end?

41
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,320
I have something for you.

42
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,760
I...

43
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,280
I'm not sure.

44
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,200
Maybe later.

45
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,720
Okay.

46
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,360
I'll wait for you near your house.

47
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,760
See you.

48
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,000
Hello?

49
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,560
Hello.

50
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,120
Who is it?

51
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,120
Speak.

52
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,520
Detective Wu.

53
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,040
I should call you Mr Wu now.

54
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,720
Do you think we lost you

55
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,280
if we lost you?

56
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,240
Let me guess.

57
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,560
Where are you going now?

58
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,120
Take a guess.

59
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,200
Li Guokun.

60
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,080
Did you do that in my company?

61
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,240
What do you want?

62
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,560
I want to quit.

63
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,160
Say something.

64
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,680
Mr Wu.

65
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,120
Calm down.

66
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,800
We

67
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,400
found your car.

68
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,720
As an excellent detective,

69
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,440
how can you not try to delete

70
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,360
in the car?

71
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,280
You're not a cop anymore.

72
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,960
You even pretended to be a cop.

73
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,240
and took 500,000 from us.

74
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,600
What 500,000?

75
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,200
You mean the USB?

76
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,280
Let go of me!

77
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,000
Let go of me!

78
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,840
Li Guo Kun.

79
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,880
I'm warning you.

80
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,039
Don't do anything stupid.

81
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,960
Release him.

82
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,920
That's not right.

83
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,680
That's not right.

84
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,000
Mr Wu.

85
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,520
You took something

86
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,080
without giving it to your employer.

87
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,680
What do you want?

88
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,280
You want to blackmail me like Jin Jie?

89
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,960
How about this?

90
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,520
Let's work together.

91
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,120
Do you want to die?

92
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,440
I won't talk to you.

93
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,120
I’ll give you 20 minutes.

94
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,720
Come to Jin Jie.

95
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,520
Or we’ll die together.

96
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,360
Wait for me there.

97
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,080
Yes.

98
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,920
Detective.

99
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,680
I'll wait for you.

100
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,720
Who is it?

101
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,080
Sister.

102
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,960
Hello.

103
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,320
I’m Jin Jie’s friend.

104
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
She asked me to bring you something.

105
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,280
Ran Ran.

106
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,040
Hello.

107
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,520
When are you coming back?

108
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,360
Ran Ran.

109
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,920
I have something to do.

110
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,320
so I can't go back for dinner.

111
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,920
You eat with your mom first.

112
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,080
Remind your mom to take the medicine after dinner.

113
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay.

114
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,680
Don't worry.

115
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,200
Ran Ran.

116
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,240
Detective Wu.

117
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,680
Li Guo Kun.

118
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,160
How dare you kill me!

119
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,000
So what?

120
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,120
Didn't you rob the evidence for money?

121
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,720
Let me tell you.

122
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,920
If I don't arrest you,

123
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,640
if I don't catch you.

124
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,240
Save your energy.

125
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,160
The last thing

126
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,960
in your life

127
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,360
is to become

128
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,080
who killed Jin Jie for me.

129
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,480
Someone is there.

130
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,560
It's okay.

131
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,440
I'm just a homeless man.

132
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,560
Since you saw it,

133
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,240
I took care of it together.

134
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,440
When I woke up again,

135
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,840
I found myself buried alive.

136
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,480
I crawled out of the burial pit desperately.

137
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,280
and took a deep breath.

138
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,520
When I woke up,

139
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
I found someone's hand

140
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,680
in the mud.

141
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,840
I thought it was Jin Jie.

142
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,920
I tried my best

143
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,840
to dig out his face,

144
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,840
I realized he was a strange man.

145
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,520
After that, I was exhausted.

146
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,200
I fainted again.

147
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,320
I was in a coma for a long time.

148
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,400
I finally woke up.

149
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,760
When I got back to the consulting company,

150
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,520
I found a police car at the entrance.

151
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,520
I can't tell if it's because I went missing

152
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,880
or as Li Guokun said,

153
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,800
he has become a murder suspect.

154
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,160
To prove my innocence,

155
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,920
I'll go to your house right away.

156
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,800
to get back

157
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,640
the evidence left back then.

158
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,160
I found your family

159
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,840
was also killed.

160
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,280
While you were away,

161
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,680
when you weren't home.

162
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,040
But I searched every corner,

163
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,520
but I couldn't find anything.

164
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,720
[I desperately thought]

165
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,360
the evidence

166
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,360
may have been destroyed

167
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,360
when your parents were killed.

168
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,600
After Jin Jie’s body was found,

169
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,520
I was soon confirmed

170
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,400
a murder suspect with solid evidence.

171
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,240
[My wife is waiting for my surgery fee.]

172
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,560
suddenly had a heart attack.

173
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,640
and was hospitalized.

174
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,920
And I can only take a look from afar.

175
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,440
I couldn't do anything.

176
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,480
I didn't get enough money for the surgery,

177
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,960
his wife passed away in pain and grief.

178
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,920
My young daughter became an orphan.

179
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,520
I couldn't do anything.

180
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,920
And this is all because of

181
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,640
behind Li Guo Kun.

182
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,240
So I found Li Guo Kun's house.

183
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,640
[It was...]

184
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,360
Just a little

185
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,440
I'll come little by little.

186
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,960
I'll kill you now.

187
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,079
Liar! Liar!

188
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Why are you here?

189
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,880
Didn't you already...

190
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,320
I'll kill you if you keep talking.

191
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,720
Answer me.

192
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
You answer.

193
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,600
Who is your accomplice?

194
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,520
Who is behind this?

195
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,680
What evidence did you steal?

196
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,600
Do you think you're still a cop?

197
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,040
Why should I tell you?

198
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,560
If I don't die today,

199
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,400
I'll make your life miserable.

200
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,360
Move your hands.

201
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,840
Do you want to live a miserable life like this?

202
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,880
If I were a cop, I wouldn't dare to hurt you.

203
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,040
Let me tell you.

204
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,640
I died once.

205
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,000
I can do anything.

206
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,440
If you don't tell me,

207
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,520
I'll kill you.

208
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,240
Who is it?

209
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,280
Who?

210
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,640
That person.

211
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,000
Don't move.

212
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,720
Police!

213
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,400
Let him go!

214
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,960
Help me!

215
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,080
Help me!

216
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,360
Let him go!

217
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,720
Lu Zheng!

218
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,760
Lu Zheng.

219
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,720
Say something.

220
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,280
This is the only clue

221
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,320
the only clue

222
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,360
left a symbol of the first abyss.

223
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,720
to mark all related cases

224
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,840
all related cases.

225
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
In my life,

226
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,920
I will use my own way

227
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,440
in my own way.

228
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,280
and the mastermind behind it.

229
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,000
and the mastermind behind it.

230
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,920
I couldn't clear my name.

231
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,720
I was desperate.

232
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,440
I went back to

233
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,720
where I was buried alive.

234
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,040
I plan to live

235
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,880
as Luo Yin.

236
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,400
If my wife hadn't taken their medicine,

237
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,960
she wouldn't have died

238
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,000
because of complications.

239
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,960
I won't accept this request

240
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,880
because I was in a hurry.

241
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,080
I ended up like this.

242
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,280
has something to do with Jiang's Group.

243
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,840
But you didn't expect that

244
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,400
the boss of Jiang's Group

245
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,880
suddenly had an accident.

246
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,520
The person who replaced him was the 28-year-old Jiang Yan.

247
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,960
The whole company changed blood.

248
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,960
The employee who came to you instead of the company

249
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,000
has gone missing.

250
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,040
There's no way to find out the truth.

251
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,480
Your only hope

252
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,640
is Li Guo Kun.

253
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,440
This is God's will.

254
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,000
Li Guo Kun was admitted again.

255
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,960
as a psychologist.

256
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,600
gave me a second chance.

257
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,080
to get help

258
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,920
and changed my appearance.

259
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,480
I went abroad to study psychology

260
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,240
and studied his living habits.

261
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,520
After I came back to China,

262
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,320
I went back to Luo Yin.

263
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,480
and met Li Guokun again.

264
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,960
All these years,

265
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,440
he has been silent about Li Guokun.

266
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,120
[psychological hint.]

267
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,520
He already believed me.

268
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,040
But apart from his wife

269
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,120
and Lu Zheng,

270
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,600
he said nothing.

271
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,720
He kept his mouth shut.

272
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,040
To break through his psychological defence,

273
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,720
I told him

274
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,240
I told his ex-wife

275
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,480
to his ex-wife.

276
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,600
And

277
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,680
I prescribed him

278
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,880
I prescribed him an expired Lebazo.

279
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,240
I think he will contact his accomplice

280
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,440
he will contact his accomplice.

281
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,960
But he chose to kill his ex-wife.

282
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,640
When he was desperate,

283
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,880
he contacted me

284
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,920
to contact me.

285
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,280
But he didn’t tell me

286
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,000
before he died.

287
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
Because all the evidence related to the case

288
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,760
and information are in the police's hands.

289
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,520
You used the last call

290
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,600
last phone call

291
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,960
found you.

292
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
After we got the recording

293
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,600
Jang Geon Min's perjury,

294
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,360
before us,

295
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,680
to kill Jang Geon-min.

296
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,600
But you didn't expect him to be alive.

297
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,120
So your accomplice Joien appeared

298
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,440
and killed Jang Geon-min.

299
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,040
and cleared your suspicion.

300
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,280
Because of Zhang Jianmin's death,

301
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,000
led us to the naked body case in Kubei.

302
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,600
The dusty case has restarted.

303
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,080
Yes.

304
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,040
You're right.

305
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,760
What about your daughter, Wu Ke Ran?

306
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,720
For revenge and truth,

307
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,480
I can sacrifice my daughter.

308
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:16,880
Really?

309
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,160
It's not like that.

310
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,360
If everything goes

311
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
my feelings,

312
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,600
I won't drag her in.

313
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,440
When I came back and started my plan,

314
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,080
he came to me alone.

315
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,760
That was Joien.

316
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,040
As the victim's family,

317
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,240
before the accident,

318
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,320
before the accident.

319
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,880
So I found an ally.

320
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
What can I do for you?

321
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,600
Tell me.

322
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,760
Anything.

323
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,080
My sister went missing six years ago.

324
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,000
Can you be more specific?

325
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,360
Doctor Na.

326
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,760
Don't you remember me?

327
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
He saw through my identity.

328
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,720
We became allies.

329
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,560
Since then, I have a new pair of hands.

330
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,400
But my hands are out of control.

331
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,760
He's bolder

332
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,680
and more aggressive.

333
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,920
After helping me

334
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,280
the murder of Li Guokun and Zhang Jianmin,

335
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,920
in order to convict

336
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,520
to progress the progress of the case,

337
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,200
So we must let the police find Wu Fei's body.

338
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,000
But Luo Yin was buried there.

339
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,120
The only way

340
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,800
is to make Jiang Fei

341
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,520
to identify Wu Fei's body there.

342
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,600
We had a fight.

343
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,640
This is our only way out.

344
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,760
We've come this far.

345
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,400
we can't lose here.

346
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,160
We should solve our own problem.

347
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,520
We can solve our own problems.

348
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,600
Do you have any good ideas?

349
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,000
Don't get my daughter involved.

350
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,440
If you don't have a good idea,

351
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,640
I'll solve it

352
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,480
in my own way.

353
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,880
I don't have much time left for myself.

354
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,360
If I close my eyes now,

355
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,000
I can think of myself

356
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,440
waiting for death in pain.

357
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,880
I can't imagine it.

358
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,600
I can't accept this ending either.

359
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,640
I will take revenge before I die.

360
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,920
Joien went against my will.

361
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,360
Contact Kedye with my phone's virtual number.

362
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,600
and instigated the dye to approach Jianghu.

363
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,800
and found Wu Fei's remains.

364
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,560
I rushed over after I got the news.

365
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,000
So even if you didn't arrive in time that day,

366
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,760
I would have killed the porpoise

367
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,120
and save Ke Ran.

368
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,640
That's why

369
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,880
You were the one who talked to me.

370
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,840
It's me.

371
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,400
What about the rooftop of the hospital?

372
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,760
Joien was in the hospital

373
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,880
he was in the hospital.

374
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,480
If he shows up again,

375
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,760
I'll be seen through.

376
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,600
So it was me that time.

377
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
But how did Joien know

378
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,000
our conversation?

379
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,520
He was near the hospital.

380
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,680
near the hospital.

381
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,800
He can hear us.

382
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,440
Where's the porpoise?

383
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,680
He ran away.

384
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,040
Joien used

385
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,280
she used dyeing again.

386
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,640
In the fight,

387
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,600
he agreed to my request.

388
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
I won't see Ke Ran again.

389
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,040
He gave me

390
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,440
to me.

391
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,440
Then why did Wu Ke Ran

392
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,480
still involved?

393
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,360
After Kang Yan was kidnapped by Joien,

394
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
the dye repeatedly requested to see Jiang Yan.

395
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,520
But I rejected her.

396
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,600
I don't want her to fall deeper and deeper.

397
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,640
But she begged

398
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,800
she wanted to see Jiang Yan.

399
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,920
She wants the truth from her.

400
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,000
She wants the truth.

401
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,640
It's dyed.

402
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,320
It's dyed.

403
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,480
So I gave her a place.

404
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,880
I want to put an end

405
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,160
with Kei.

406
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,400
Why do you have my dad's phone number?

407
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,440
Who are you?

408
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,080
Why are you here?

409
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,440
That's right.

410
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,280
It's me.

411
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,200
I approached you on purpose.

412
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,520
and used you to work for us.

413
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,920
You're no longer useful.

414
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,400
Go back to your life

415
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,440
go back to your life.

416
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,080
No.

417
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,000
Everything I did

418
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,440
is what I want to do.

419
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,600
Dr. Na.

420
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,280
I found my father's remains

421
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,960
on my own.

422
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,720
The porridge is dead.

423
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,760
Jiang Yan was caught too.

424
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,800
I did everything I wanted.

425
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,520
Dr. Na.

426
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,480
Like I said,

427
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,720
I found peace in my heart.

428
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,360
Dr. Na.

429
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,760
But that's not enough.

430
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,760
I told you.

431
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'll make everyone who killed my dad

432
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,760
will pay with their lives.

433
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,200
I jumped into the abyss myself.

434
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,640
Jiang Yan is right in front of me.

435
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,800
I want her to die.

436
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,040
So...

437
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,800
Dr. Na.

438
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,000
When are we going to kill her?

439
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,720
No matter what you do now,

440
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,040
your father will never come back.

441
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,840
Wu Fei is dead.

442
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,560
Then let him wait for me.

443
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,240
When I do what I should do,

444
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,000
Okay?

445
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,040
Let go of this.

446
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,200
Open it

447
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,720
Open it

448
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,360
Open it.

449
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,600
Why?

450
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,520
Open it.

451
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,680
She's right in front of me.

452
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,000
I want her to die. I told you.

453
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,760
I'll let her die.

454
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,920
Do you want to be like me?

455
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
like me?

456
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,920
You can't go back.

457
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,480
Let's go.

458
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,760
But she's right in front of me.

459
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,120
Open it.

460
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,920
Let go of me!

461
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,960
Come down.

462
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,320
I'm going to kill her.

463
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,040
Listen carefully.

464
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The station is right ahead.

465
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,320
Don't ever come back.

466
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,320
That number...

467
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,280
I won't use it again.

468
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,120
Who are you to tell me what to do?

469
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,240
Let's go.

470
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,000
That's why I knew Kang-yeon would run away.

471
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,440
She would go abroad.

472
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,200
So I did it abroad.

473
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,960
But I saw

474
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,640
I saw the dyed positioning.

475
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,120
We're on our way to the airport.

476
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
to find Jiang Yan.

477
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,360
So I came here.

478
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,520
I have to stop her.

479
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,480
I'm glad

480
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,560
I met you.

481
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,000
You love your daughter so much.

482
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,280
Why didn't you tell her?

483
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Out of gratitude and guilt,

484
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,719
I raised Luo Yin's daughter.

485
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,040
But for the past 15 years,

486
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,239
For the past 15 years,

487
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,679
I've been missing my daughter all the time.

488
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,719
But Ran is like this today.

489
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,360
It's all my fault.

490
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,920
I didn't know how to face her.

491
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,800
So I opened a private psychological clinic

492
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,080
to approach her

493
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,679
and listen to her pain for many years.

494
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,199
and guide her and comfort her.

495
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,480
I know that's not enough.

496
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,520
But what can I do?

497
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,120
The source of all evil

498
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
was the 28-year-old Jiang Yan.

499
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,120
Can you return my friends

500
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
and the victims?

501
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,800
Can you return the love

502
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,800
my daughter lost for 15 years?

503
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,160
Can you return my wife's life?

504
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,120
Can you

505
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,920
and my life?

506
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,440
Wu Fei, calm down.

507
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:44,920
Wu Fei.

508
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,880
Luo Yin.

509
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,320
No, Wu Fei.

510
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,680
Put the gun down.

511
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,360
One more thing.

512
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,960
It's not easy

513
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,320
is not easy.

514
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,760
How did you get plastic surgery and go abroad?

515
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,200
And the symbol of the abyss.

516
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,000
Was it really your idea?

517
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,280
And who is he

518
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,720
Who is he?

519
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:31,960
Morse code. You did well. It's time to end it.

520
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,720
Wu Fei 15 years ago

521
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,680
was already dead.

522
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,720
Now I am

523
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,520
a puppet that is occupied by hatred.

524
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
It's time to end.

525
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,600
It's dyed.

526
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,080
Mom said

527
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,000
remember the beauty in life.

528
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,160
even if it's just a little bit of beauty.

529
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,560
The sun hides in the clouds

530
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,120
When the clouds disappear,

531
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,920
The sun comes out

532
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,960
It shines on us

533
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,960
It makes us feel warm.

534
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,320
Ran Ran.

535
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,640
Listen to me.

536
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,920
Close your eyes

537
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,080
Close your eyes.

538
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,240
Please.

539
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,800
Close your eyes.

540
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,880
I beg you.

541
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,160
Wu Fei, what are you doing?

542
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,640
Wu Fei.

543
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,520
Wu Fei.

544
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,240
Ran Ran.

545
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,360
I love you.

546
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,520
My dad is really not a murderer.

547
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,960
The abyss doesn't need someone like you.

548
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,120
I won't do it again.

549
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,200
I won't.

550
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,480
In this world,

551
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,560
love

552
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,200
or hatred,

553
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:02,800
or a person?

554
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,600
or things.

555
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,400
Once you lose it,

556
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,640
I will never come back.

557
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,400
Forever.

558
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,960
This is reality.

559
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,160
Dad.

560
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,400
Go!

561
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,160
Old man.

562
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,720
Do you like the song?

563
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,840
I didn't lose it.

564
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,480
I miss you.

565
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,800
Master

566
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Fan Fan has grown up

567
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,240
She is a good cop

568
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,840
like you.

569
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,280
What about you?

570
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,280
Have you made your decision?

571
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,440
Police.

572
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,320
Be a good cop.

573
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,720
Go.

574
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,360
We still have a long way to go.

575
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,280
