1
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,840
Why are you so mysterious?

2
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,200
Where are you taking me?

3
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,240
I caught one before.

4
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,640
a post-production video.

5
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,080
We can ask him

6
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,360
to edit a fake news

7
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,640
It will be aired at the destination of Mobei.

8
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,280
to lure him to the burial site

9
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,120
to move the body.

10
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,160
Marco Lu.

11
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,320
Is that black car from Mo Bei?

12
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,880
Why is he following us?

13
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,600
It's probably because of Jiang Yan's disappearance.

14
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,120
He thinks it has something to do with us.

15
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,000
This is crazy.

16
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,400
If he keeps following us,

17
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
our plan can't be implemented.

18
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Who is it?

19
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,800
Who is it? So annoying.

20
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,640
Who are you?

21
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,040
Officer Lu.

22
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,560
Why are you here?

23
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,440
I haven't...

24
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,400
All right.

25
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,120
I need your help.

26
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
Help?

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,240
Come in.

29
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,960
You go in first.

30
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
I need to make a call.

31
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,400
Hurry up.

32
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,560
Hey!

33
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,000
You just want money.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,960
Let me out!

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,720
How much do you want?

36
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,440
I'll give it to you.

37
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,440
She's quite stubborn.

38
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,240
What?

39
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,720
You found the bodies of the missing people?

40
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,240
I'll try to reveal it to the police.

41
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,520
The investigation will start tomorrow.

42
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,640
I can't talk here.

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,440
Let me know if there's anything else.

44
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,200
I didn't expect the video to be edited so slowly.

45
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,480
It's getting dark.

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,280
It's okay.

47
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,480
Anyway, no matter what,

48
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,920
will take action when it gets dark.

49
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,240
What should we do now?

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,040
I looked into it.

51
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,600
The ads in this elevator

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,880
was complained by the owner committee two years ago.

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,760
The income from advertising machines

54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,320
will be repaid to the owner

55
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,600
to the owner.

56
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,800
We also set an advertisement time.

57
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,279
For the rest of the time.

58
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,160
current affairs or public welfare advertisements.

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,240
Now we need to replace fake news.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,800
How?

61
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,760
Done.

62
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,560
Let's go.

63
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,080
Let's go.

64
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,760
[According to the warm-hearted citizen,]

65
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,560
Mo Bei will be back soon.

66
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,440
Many years ago,

67
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,159
where the body was hidden

68
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,360
is in this city.

69
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,159
Currently,

70
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,680
the police are doing their best to search.

71
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,440
Why isn't he responding?

72
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,800
What a waste of time.

73
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,360
Mo Bei is out.

74
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,960
Let's go.

75
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,840
Mo Bei.

76
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,200
I've been looking for you for days.

77
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,320
What is it?

78
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,240
Do you know Wu Ke Ran?

79
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,120
I know this person.

80
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,480
I want to ask you about her.

81
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,640
Please cooperate with our investigation.

82
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,560
This way, please.

83
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,640
Follow him.

84
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,120
Is it familiar?

85
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,680
What are you doing in this neighborhood

86
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,280
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

87
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,360
Why do you think this is me?

88
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,880
Really?

89
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
If it weren't for you,

90
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,520
It was around 8 p.m. on the 30th.

91
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,880
Where have you been?

92
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
Is there anyone who can prove it to you?

93
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,840
Prove?

94
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,880
What kind of proof do you want?

95
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,640
Why should I?

96
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,880
Besides, why should I go there?

97
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,720
to take revenge on Wu Ke Ran?

98
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,360
In this case,

99
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,640
the disappearance of my boss

100
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,440
Shouldn't you ask Wu Ke Ran

101
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,680
and ask Marco Lu and Ning Zhen.

102
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,960
You have no alibi.

103
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,480
and CCTV.

104
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,800
and motive.

105
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,240
Why did you go to Wu Ke Ran?

106
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,800
How much do you know about Youning?

107
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,080
On the day my boss went missing,

108
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
only Ning Zhen and Lu Fan knew her whereabouts.

109
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,080
Don't change the subject.

110
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
We've been looking for Jiang Yan.

111
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,160
I'm asking you about Wu Ke Ran.

112
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,280
Instead of wasting time on me,

113
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
than wasting time on me.

114
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,600
and find out where my boss is.

115
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,760
You want to waste time?

116
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,480
We'll keep you company.

117
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,320
If Mo Bei can't come out tonight,

118
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,560
it'll all be in vain.

119
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,920
Just wait.

120
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,920
What is it?

121
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,520
A man just turned himself in.

122
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,200
He said he stole from Wu Ke Ran's house.

123
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,800
Don't open it.

124
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,520
He's very vigilant.

125
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,280
Let's keep a distance.

126
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,320
This is your only chance.

127
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
I don't want to lose it.

128
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,000
You can't lose

129
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,720
I won't lose it.

130
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,800
Don't worry.

131
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,360
Let's go.

132
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,440
This is Mo Bei.

133
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,040
Something's wrong with him.

134
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,120
Did he find us?

135
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
He has no other choice.

136
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,880
Unless he doesn't care.

137
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,760
Go to bed.

138
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,400
Right here.

139
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,640
Let's go.

140
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,200
Just wait.

141
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,520
What's the point of us being here now?

142
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,440
Don't you think it's suspicious?

143
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,080
The lights are out.

144
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,200
Stay here.

145
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I'll take a look inside.

146
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,480
Okay.

147
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,600
Mo Bei.

148
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,080
Mo Bei ran away from the underground parking garage.

149
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,680
Get in.

150
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,360
Let's go after them.

151
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,200
It's too late.

152
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,000
If we miss this chance,

153
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,040
he will be more vigilant.

154
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,800
We'll investigate later.

155
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,640
It'll be harder.

156
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,560
The most important thing now

157
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,840
is to call Tao Zi

158
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,560
and ask him to check the CCTV.

159
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,920
Find out where Mo Bei's car is.

160
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,280
He's not picking up.

161
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,680
Call Captain Cao.

162
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,520
Mr. Mo.

163
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,400
How is it?

164
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,360
Is everything settled?

165
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,640
Yes, Mr. Mo.

166
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,680
Thank you.

167
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,560
Okay, Mr. Mo. See you.

168
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,080
Captain Cao.

169
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,760
You are

170
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,040
on me today?

171
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,840
Mr. Mo.

172
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,560
You must be tired.

173
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,280
I just came out from the police station.

174
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,320
I was busy delivering the goods.

175
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,440
This is also a temporary notice.

176
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,640
A batch of goods will be sent to another company.

177
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,000
Where did they go at the fork?

178
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,840
What did you do?

179
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,720
Take a shortcut.

180
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,120
I went to a branch.

181
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,720
Can I open this car?

182
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,840
It's all unloaded.

183
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,280
Open it.

184
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,240
Captain Cao.

185
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,440
If there's nothing else,

186
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,840
I want to go back and rest.

187
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,160
Tao Zi.

188
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,240
How is it?

189
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,680
Captain Cao is interrogating Mo Bei.

190
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,120
The truck in Mo Bei

191
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,920
has also tested the technical team.

192
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,560
Before the car test results come out,

193
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,800
we can only arrest him

194
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,600
of transporting illegal goods.

195
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,920
If there's nothing wrong with the car,

196
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,400
we have to release him.

197
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,520
And we've confirmed the branch

198
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,200
has been verified.

199
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,640
Mo Bei did deliver goods at that time.

200
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,600
No record.

201
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,360
But more than ten employees can prove it.

202
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,720
Can we trust our own witness?

203
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,960
The car test report is out.

204
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,760
Where's Captain Cao?

205
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,960
Give it to me.

206
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,240
Thank you.

207
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,960
There's no trace of the body or the soil.

208
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,440
How could it be?

209
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,880
Tao Zi.

210
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,160
Show me the travel route of Mo Bei.

211
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,920
After Mo Bei ditched you,

212
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,520
he went back to the park of Jiang's Group.

213
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,000
driving and delivering goods with the cars.

214
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,360
It's obvious that they're moving the bodies.

215
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,360
When they arrived at the intersection B2,

216
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,680
Mobei left the team with a truck.

217
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,160
and left the surveillance area.

218
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,040
Captain Cao also thought it was strange.

219
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,560
so he wanted to follow him.

220
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,760
Okay.

221
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,680
Take a look.

222
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,200
I have to give the report to Captain Cao.

223
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,920
Mo Bei and other cars are here.

224
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,480
After two hours and 15 minutes,

225
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,400
we meet here again.

226
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,600
During this time,

227
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,160
he might have gone to transfer the body.

228
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,720
We can follow the direction

229
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,680
the direction, time and speed

230
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,120
Draw a rough range.

231
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,960
It's hard.

232
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,800
There are mountains nearby.

233
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,680
The road is complicated.

234
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,360
Even if we dig out the bodies,

235
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,640
and move the body,

236
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,040
This area

237
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,280
about 10 km radius.

238
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,560
It's too big.

239
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,560
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

240
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,120
Marco Lu.

241
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,760
Look here.

242
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,920
Before Captain Cao intercepted them,

243
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,320
they have been

244
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,080
under this bridge.

245
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,040
What can they do if they stop here?

246
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,960
I'm not sure.

247
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,160
Let's go to the park of Jiang's Group.

248
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,280
There might be other clues.

249
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,200
Hello.

250
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,000
What do you do

251
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,040
Hello.

252
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,800
Hello. Hello.

253
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,920
What brings you here?

254
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,280
Did you deliver the goods last night?

255
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,440
Yes.

256
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,560
I suddenly received a notice from the company last night

257
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,760
to send a batch of drugs to the branch office.

258
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,600
We had no choice.

259
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,880
So we loaded the car and sent it there.

260
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,480
Do you usually do this?

261
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,520
Usually, new drug promotion

262
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,360
and activities.

263
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,880
We can't avoid urgent delivery.

264
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,560
Fortunately, the overtime fee is quite high.

265
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,640
Everyone is willing to pay.

266
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,840
Does Mo Bei usually deliver goods with you?

267
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,560
Although he is the driver of our boss,

268
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,520
he has a high position in our company.

269
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,760
Everyone calls him Mr. Mo.

270
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,120
He doesn't care about such trivial matters.

271
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,360
I think the goods this time are more important.

272
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,560
and urgent.

273
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,360
So he sent it with us.

274
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,880
What did he do when he left the team?

275
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,040
The goods in his car belong to another branch.

276
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,680
How many cars are there?

277
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,160
How many were there yesterday?

278
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,280
Seven.

279
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,320
They all went out yesterday.

280
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,360
Seven.

281
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,960
Yes.

282
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,360
But there are only five cars here.

283
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,240
One of them will be sent to the police station for security check.

284
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,880
What about the other one?

285
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,640
That one?

286
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,960
That car is a bit dirty.

287
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
I sent it to clean.

288
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,160
When?

289
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,960
Where did you send it?

290
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,960
This morning,

291
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,440
It's not far away.

292
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,240
Hello.

293
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,120
This car has been washed.

294
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,200
Yes, I just washed it.

295
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,160
The license plate has been changed.

296
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,440
Look at this screw.

297
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,760
It's not a special anti-theft screw issued by the supervision.

298
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,000
Mo Bei changed the license plate before departure.

299
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,960
When we met up with the team,

300
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,240
he changed the license plate.

301
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,480
This is

302
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,960
is this car.

303
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,840
In the clues we know,

304
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,000
This is

305
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,280
is where Mo Bei separated from the cars.

306
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,480
The CCTV shows that

307
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,560
after Mo Bei left the team,

308
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,040
after Mo Bei left the team.

309
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,320
We can only

310
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,320
based on these.

311
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,880
to hide the body.

312
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,440
But we can't predict

313
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,040
a corpse was found in Mobei

314
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,360
and then move them elsewhere.

315
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,520
and bury them.

316
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
We don't know

317
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,920
we don't know.

318
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,720
But we can

319
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,320
in this area

320
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,160
where we can hide corpses.

321
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,560
Let's narrow the area

322
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,920
and narrow the area

323
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,360
within 10 km radius.

324
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,920
In this area,

325
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,560
Let's exclude the residential area first.

326
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,640
where there are many people in agricultural use.

327
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,880
Then the rest of the bodies

328
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,280
to hide corpses.

329
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,040
And...

330
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,080
an abandoned factory.

331
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,720
Abandoned factory?

332
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,360
Is this the place where Mo Bei kidnapped us

333
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,200
was here?

334
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,280
Yes.

335
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,200
What was this place before?

336
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,360
The old address of Jiang's Pharmaceutical Factory

337
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,360
has been abandoned for five or six years.

338
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Normally,

339
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,760
has a fixed place.

340
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,960
This should be the place where the body was dumped.

341
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,880
Even if the body has been moved,

342
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,280
we will find other clues

343
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,400
we will find other clues.

344
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Let's split up.

345
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,920
It's a trace of a flip.

346
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,680
Are you okay?

347
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,240
I'm fine.

348
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,800
Are you afraid that your mother will be buried here too?

349
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,960
For 15 years,

350
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,840
I've been hoping that my mother was still alive.

351
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,760
I've been imagining

352
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,360
somewhere.

353
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,160
But on that day,

354
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,360
Jiang Yan told me

355
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,560
my mother passed away.

356
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,800
I realized

357
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,400
I've already accepted this result.

358
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,800
I know you must be upset now.

359
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,160
But if your mom knows you've been looking for her,

360
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,240
she'll be very pleased.

361
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,160
No matter what the result is,

362
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,360
remember,

363
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,160
you are not alone.

364
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,200
As a friend,

365
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,440
I will face it with you.

366
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,120
Yeongjin.

367
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,920
Since we met,

368
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,680
since we met?

369
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,200
Tell me.

370
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,760
How did you find it?

371
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,920
That day.

372
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,080
when Mo Bei tied me up here.

373
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,840
Really?

374
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,960
Enough.

375
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,920
Stop making up stories.

376
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,240
Captain Cao.

377
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,120
We found something.

378
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,760
No body was found,

379
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,480
but in the mud,

380
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,240
in the mud.

381
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
The culprit can move the body,

382
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,080
but it's hard to remove his hair and teeth.

383
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,920
Take it back.

384
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,960
and compare the DNA

385
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,840
related to the case.

386
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,600
I'll be right there.

387
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,680

388
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,920
Take mine too.

389
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,400
Let's compare.

390
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,280
Comrade.

391
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,360
Is the result out?

392
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,840
How is it?

393
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,760
Please wait a moment.

394
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,600
Calm down.

395
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,760
Who is Zhang Juan?

396
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,600
It's me.

397
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,840
Ma'am.

398
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,280
According to our test,

399
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,480
the DNA of the sample and your DNA

400
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,360
The connection is 99.9%.

401
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,120
Comrade,

402
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,000
What do you mean?

403
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,360
In other words,

404
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
the owner of the tooth sample

405
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,120
is your daughter.

406
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,480
My daughter.

407
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,480
Everyone.

408
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,160
The next test will take some time.

409
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,040
Go back first.

410
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,720
Okay.

411
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,480
I'll let you know if there's any news.

412
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,280
Yeongjin.

413
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,760
Although the comparison result is not your mother,

414
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,680
but we can at least confirm

415
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,280
the bodies of the missing persons

416
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,440
was buried there.

417
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,720
But we still don't have

418
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,000
where the body went.

419
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,720
There's no body.

420
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,560
Even if we only have teeth and hair,

421
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,600
we still can't

422
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,760
as a murder case.

423
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,000
We're back to where we were.

424
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,560
Marco Lu.

425
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,560
You knew she was the murderer,

426
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,320
but watch her get away with it.

427
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,480
There is no other way.

428
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,280
We can keep investigating.

429
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,200
we will find new clues.

430
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,640
There's no time.

431
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,160

432
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,520

433
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,760
who were waiting for the DNA results today.

434
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,400
Joien isn't here today.

435
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,440
No.

436
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,760

437
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,160

441
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,920
Give me more time.

442
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,520
