1
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,479
What are you looking for?

2
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,840
The one who sent us the dashcam.

3
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,320
This man.

4
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,600
Since he can park his car near the porridge house,

5
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,960
he could be his neighbor.

6
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,280
or someone else who can enter the neighborhood.

7
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,640
It won't be hard to find him.

8
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,320
Do you think this person is an abyss?

9
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,000
How do you manage your property?

10
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,960
A strange car came in.

11
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,000
and cut the owner's car.

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
If I hadn't been driving the black box,

13
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,000
I wouldn't be able to explain.

14
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,680
Yes.

15
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,240
You're right.

16
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,920
We will

17
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,840
in the future.

18
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,480
Seriously.

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,160
Officer Ning.

20
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
Hello.

21
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,960
May I ask you something?

22
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,840
Take a look at this video.

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,520
Was it taken by your dashcam?

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,880
This.

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,840
was taken by my car.

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,640
Did you send it to the police?

27
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,760
No.

28
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,480
I didn't send it.

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
Have you

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,600
to anyone recently?

31
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,320
I see.

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,680
A few days ago,

33
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,120
a few days ago.

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,960
This car

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,920
has been parked here.

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
I'm worried

37
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,079
I'm worried.

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,480
I kept on the recorder.

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,840
When I came back,

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,520
this car

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,560
was scratched.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,960
So I quickly

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,920
and checked the black box.

44
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,079
In the middle,

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,480
I've never seen anyone else.

46
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
How did you find out?

47
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,000
I just...

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,320
This card.

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,200
Put this card

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,320
on the computer.

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,960
I've been looking at it for hours.

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,120
Is the computer connected?

53
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,840
Yes.

54
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,320
Thank you.

55
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:10,920
Thank you.

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,520
What should we do?

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,760
Go to the property management with me.

58
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,560
It should be him who sent us the video.

59
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,880
Kang Woo.

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,400
The dashcam recorded it.

61
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,040
The day after the girl went missing,

62
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,840
you moved the building materials to your house.

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
What is it for?

64
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,640
It has nothing to do with you.

65
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,240
Confess and you'll be lenient.

66
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,280
If you refuse, you will be punished.

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
We're giving you a chance.

68
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,200
Just say it.

69
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,440
This is the police station.

70
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,680
Without evidence,

71
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,560
if we have no evidence?

72
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Take a good look.

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
We found three female corpses

74
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
in your storage room.

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,840
The earliest one

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,520
went missing 14 years ago.

77
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,520
14 years ago.

78
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,280
The girl from the club two days ago.

79
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,279
What else do you want to say?

80
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,800
You found it.

81
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,399
As long as you do it,

82
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,880
we will find it.

83
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,720
Cao Jin.

84
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,000
Your wish has come true.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,240
Do you remember this girl?

86
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,000
Look carefully.

87
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,159
Jin Jie.

88
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,560
Her cause of death

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,159
just like the other three victims,

90
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,600
mechanical asphyxiation.

91
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,080
Tell me.

92
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,159
How did you kill the four of them?

93
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,680
I want to find my sister.

94
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,960
You have no chance.

95
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,760
Cao Jin.

96
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,240
Don’t be happy too soon.

97
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,040
Ms. Jiang,

98
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,400
The police have sufficient evidence.

99
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,920
According to the current situation,

100
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,720
you can be convicted with just one trial.

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,600
You need to be prepared.

102
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,920
There's no chance of a lighter trial.

103
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
Are you a pig?

104
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,800
The company spent so much money to support you.

105
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,280
You don't even know

106
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,040
what my master wants.

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,040
I want a lighter sentence?

108
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,960
What do I want?

109
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,040
What I want is to be acquitted.

110
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
But Ms. Jiang,

111
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,320
the social response is huge now.

112
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,640
Due to the pressure of public opinion,

113
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,000
the trial will begin soon.

114
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,240
If we do the hidden box operation now,

115
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,520
one is that time is too tight.

116
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,520
Two, there are certain risks.

117
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,200
risk?

118
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,600
Ask my sister.

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,760
The risk of the secret box operation

120
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,360
and the risk of my sentence,

121
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,600
which is more serious?

122
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,680
Ms. Jiang is trying her best

123
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,400
to help you.

124
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,320
Please wait for the rest.

125
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,760
Again?

126
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,080
You...

127
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,520
Tell me.

128
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
Time

129
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,560
is running out.

130
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,760
I'll go back and tell Ms. Jiang.

131
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,920
There must be a way.

132
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,680
There must be a way.

133
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,040
There must be a way.

134
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,840
Xi.

135
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,520
Two bottles of coke.

136
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,200
Today is a good day.

137
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,080
Why are you drinking cola?

138
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,320
Let's drink.

139
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,120
I've reported it.

140
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,240
Captain Cao is so straightforward.

141
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,640
Xi.

142
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,760
Ice beer

143
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,760
Cheers! Cheers!

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,159
Finally, we have solid evidence for the porpoise case.

145
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,440
Here.

146
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,760
Give our captain some nutrition.

147
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,000
Look, you’ve lost weight.

148
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,640
Really?

149
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,240
There's a saying.

150
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,880
It's good for your health.

151
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,200
I specially ordered it for you.

152
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,320
Pig brain.

153
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,400
It's good for your brain.

154
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
Ning Zhen did a lot this time.

155
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,640
Of course

156
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,920
should be given to Ning-jin.

157
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,560
You're welcome.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,440
Thank you.

159
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,680
This is what I need the most now.

160
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,640
and get some sleep.

161
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,320
How long

162
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,120
we haven't

163
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,040
since I had a quiet meal.

164
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,240
Cheers.

165
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,440
Come on.

166
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,880
Cheers.

167
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,640
Thank you

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,679
Fan Fan

169
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,679
Your kebabs are delicious

170
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,280
Make us some skewers.

171
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,120
Okay.

172
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,039
By the way, let me show you.

173
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,280
Remember to roast two oysters.

174
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,360
Marco Lu doesn't know yet, right?

175
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
I haven't told her yet.

176
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,680
You were transferred here

177
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,600
the naked body case in Kubei?

178
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,800
Now the case is closed.

179
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,320
I've set the time

180
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,280
on the day of the trial.

181
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,440
let this case

182
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,520
with you.

183
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Did you decide on the trial?

184
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,400
We've filed a lawsuit.

185
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,240
It should be soon.

186
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,760
The case is solved.

187
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,960
is a good thing.

188
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,120
One more thing.

189
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,960
The higher-ups attach great importance to this case.

190
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
It's specially for

191
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,080
[a psychiatrist]

192
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,840
hired a psychologist.

193
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,240
Do you know who it is?

194
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:31,920
Luo Yin.

195
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,040
Luo Yin.

196
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,960
I don't know if it was a coincidence

197
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,960
or he took this case on purpose.

198
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,600
But during this period,

199
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,840
my eyelids have been twitching.

200
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,880
The following things

201
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,400
are related to the abyss.

202
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,640
That's why you can't stay.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,960
I don't want

204
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,880
to get too close to the abyss.

205
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,400
Leave the rest

206
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,400
to me.

207
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,000
I understand.

208
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,560
Why isn't it ready yet?

209
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,040
It's done.

210
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,680
Dad.

211
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,440
I'm here to see you.

212
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,320
Dad.

213
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,360
How are you feeling these days?

214
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,200
Did the nurses

215
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
take good care of you?

216
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,880
There's one thing

217
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,720
I don't know how to tell you.

218
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,920
I can't believe you became a serial killer.

219
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,600
We have solid evidence.

220
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,800
and was arrested by the police.

221
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,400
After your accident,

222
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,960
I just wanted to take good care of him.

223
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,840
and protect him.

224
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,440
and not let him be hurt by others.

225
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,360
But I never thought

226
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
he would hurt others.

227
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,200
But Dad, don't worry.

228
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,840
I will save

229
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,120
from prison.

230
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,160
Dad.

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,360
Rest here.

232
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,160
I’ll find a way to save her.

233
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,520
Hello, Dr. Luo.

234
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,280
We...

235
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,240
Ms. Jiang wants to see you.

236
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,720
Are you looking for me, Ms. Jiang?

237
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,080
Dr. Luo.

238
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,320
Nice to meet you.

239
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,240
Actually, there's nothing else.

240
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,360
I just want to treat you to a meal

241
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,440
and discuss my brother's condition.

242
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,960
As you know,

243
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,760
he has a serious mental illness.

244
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,680
As his family,

245
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,840
as family members.

246
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,440
I want to ask you

247
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,840
when you are free.

248
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,000
Here's the thing.

249
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,640
There is a rule.

250
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,240
we are not allowed

251
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,400
contact the family of the suspect.

252
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,440
I see.

253
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,920
What if

254
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,680
I have a psychological problem

255
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,240
I'd like to consult you.

256
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,600
Every consultation fee

257
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
is 100,000 yuan.

258
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,760
You decide

259
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,080
You decide.

260
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,200
The consultation fee is standard.

261
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,840
High consultation fee is easy to be

262
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,080
Bribery?

263
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,560
Or was I too reckless?

264
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,640
I mean

265
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,360
you can do it in your way.

266
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,400
You know that

267
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,080
a single woman like me

268
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,880
to manage such a big family enterprise.

269
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,560
My pressure

270
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,160
My mental burden

271
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,160
more than others.

272
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,320
I also want to talk to someone else.

273
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,840
Ms. Jiang,

274
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,360
Don't be modest.

275
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,080
A woman like you

276
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,120
can make Jiang's Group

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
into a super business empire.

278
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,320
It's not easy.

279
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,880
You need strong psychological support.

280
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,760
Your strength

281
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,400
might be better than me, a psychologist.

282
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,960
So you want to see me?

283
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,480
It's not necessary.

284
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,280
Okay.

285
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Sorry for bothering you today.

286
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,520
Let's have dinner next time.

287
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,640
Okay.

288
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,200
Bye.

289
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,760
Dr. Na.

290
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,720
I think you know

291
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,280
I think you know what we want.

292
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,280
Here's the thing.

293
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,640
to identify a suspect

294
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,320
is mentally ill.

295
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,800
And when he killed someone,

296
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,000
when he killed someone.

297
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,360
The whole assessment

298
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,440
is a complicated process.

299
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,040
I'm not the only forensor.

300
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
Not the last round.

301
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,320
It's useless to force me alone.

302
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,440
But you went through so much trouble

303
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
to stop me today.

304
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,520
I'll tell you again.

305
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,560
My identification result

306
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,440
It's not a porpoise.

307
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,680
schizophrenia.

308
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,520
And when he killed someone,

309
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,960
during the murder.

310
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,920
Okay.

311
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,320
Doctor Na.

312
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,000
Here's your document.

313
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,480
It's not a conclusive evidence,

314
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,920
it is one of them.

315
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,360
one of them.

316
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,160
If you insist on the result,

317
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,520
I can't let you leave.

318
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,320
If you don't let me leave,

319
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,000
I can stay.

320
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,400
I'm not in a hurry.

321
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,200
But the passengers at the back

322
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,440
might be too late.

323
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,880
Hello.

324
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,400
Mr. Mo.

325
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:46,840
What a coincidence.

326
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,280
Director.

327
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,920
What a coincidence.

328
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:53,920
Doctor Luo.

329
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,160
I took up your time today.

330
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,360
We'll meet again soon.

331
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,200
Let's go.

332
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,720
Luo Yin.

333
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
I finally know

334
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,840
why you are so kind.

335
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,040
to send me to the airport?

336
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,160
No.

337
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,160
No, Chief.

338
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,200
You wronged me.

339
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
I was on my way.

340
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,400
I'll go to my wife's hometown to celebrate.

341
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,240
You're right.

342
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,600
You go back alone at this time every year.

343
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,360
right?

344
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,560
Yes.

345
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,200
It's none of your business.

346
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,800
Just go away.

347
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,280
People like Jiang Yan

348
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
as far away as possible.

349
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,000
Don't worry.

350
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,040
We'll make it in time.

351
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,880
You can't even handle such a small task.

352
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,640
He's just a doctor.

353
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,200
I can't handle it.

354
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,600
Luo Yin has left the city by plane.

355
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,880
No matter where he goes,

356
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,840
no matter what you do,

357
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,800
let him sign it for me.

358
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,520
Okay.

359
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,400
Help me ask the judge

360
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,000
the judge in charge of this case.

361
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,560
Ms. Jiang.

362
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,560
Lawyers are prohibited to meet the judge privately.

363
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,480
And...

364
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,240
about a sensitive sentence,

365
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,240
You've been with me for so long.

366
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,240
Why do you need me

367
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,080
Do you need me to teach you?

368
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,280
Got it.

369
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,920
Old classmate.

370
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,120
Why did you call me?

371
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,400
Class reunion.

372
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,320
Okay.

373
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,480
Who are they?

374
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,400
No problem.

375
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,760
Give me the location.

376
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:46,840
Okay.

377
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,520
Third Brother.

378
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,120
I owe you a big favor this time.

379
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,640
After this is over,

380
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,160
My old friend.

381
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,320
Mr. Yoo.

382
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,040
Long time no see.

383
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,680
It's a VIP.

384
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,040
Long time no see.

385
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,320
Have a seat

386
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,720
This is...

387
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,520
Zhang Dong.

388
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,880
This is my classmate in college.

389
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,720
What a coincidence.

390
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,640
We met downstairs.

391
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,760
I said we were classmates.

392
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,440
Let's sit together.

393
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,120
Mr. Yoo.

394
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,800
I'm really sorry.

395
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,520
I'm just here to join in the fun.

396
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,120
Zhang Dong.

397
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,200
The case that I'm about to investigate

398
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
The defendant's lawyer

399
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,960
is also called Zhang Dong.

400
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,560
What a coincidence.

401
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,480
What a coincidence.

402
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:30,920
Here.

403
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,480
Sit down.

404
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,360
You

405
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,920
are still so sensitive.

406
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,520
Well...

407
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,360
You guys talk first.

408
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,440
I'll go rush the dishes.

409
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,600
Mr. Yoo.

410
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,720
I'm really sorry.

411
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,240
to invite you here in this way.

412
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,200
to invite you here in this way.

413
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,840
I apologize to you.

414
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,400
There are some things

415
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,760
Sorry.

416
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,160
I think...

417
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,360
I have something to do.

418
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,240
Bye.

419
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:57,880
Mr. Yoo.

420
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,680
Mr. Yoo.

421
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,520
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

422
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,040
Ms. Jiang.

423
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,160
Mr. Liu.

424
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,480
Would you like to come over?

425
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,280
Many dishes are specially ordered for you.

426
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,880
I haven't had time to taste them.

427
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,320
I think there's nothing

428
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,560
between us.

429
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,720
I forgot to introduce myself.

430
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,160
I'm Jiang Yan.

431
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,480
My brother's case

432
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,800
The trial is coming up.

433
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,760
He has a serious mental illness.

434
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Please

435
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,440
please forgive him.

436
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,720
and be sentenced with leniency.

437
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,720
If the defendant Kang Woo

438
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,200
has a mental illness,

439
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,400
Then today,

440
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,400
you don't have to come to me in private.

441
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,000
It's impossible for you

442
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,360
That's impossible.

443
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,880
In court,

444
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,560
is about evidence.

445
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,600
Evidence?

446
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,680
We do.

447
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,960
It's just that

448
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,160
I need some time.

449
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,160
Did you get the same perjury?

450
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,760
Of course not.

451
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,120
As long as you delay it,

452
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,680
and hold one more trial for us,

453
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,120
When our evidence

454
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,320
the evidence,

455
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,720
Do you like it?

456
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,240
You got the wrong person.

457
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,640
Ting...

458
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,520
I'll open it as usual.

459
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
according to the law.

460
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,280
Why are you here?

461
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,040
The case of the porpoise will be held tomorrow.

462
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
You have insomnia.

463
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,440
Why?

464
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,800
I just want to take a walk with you.

465
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,680
You did a good job.

466
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,920
You might even be able to stay in the police force.

467
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,960
You don't have to stay.

468
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,440
I'll do my basic work.

469
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,600
and you solve the case.

470
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,280
What do you mean?

471
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,360
We only solved the naked body case in Kubei.

472
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,440
Our goal is to find the truth.

473
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,000
Your mother's case

474
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,760
and the abyss.

475
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,800
You don't even want to investigate?

476
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,840
Don't think too much.

477
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,600
I'll ask Captain Cao tomorrow.

478
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:36,960
Stop asking.

479
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,720
Captain Cao knows what to do.

480
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,280
Listen to me.

481
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
Leave me alone.

482
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:11,720
058.

483
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,240
Look north.

484
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,800
I will now announce the court discipline.

485
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,720
Everyone,

486
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,160
should obey your orders.

487
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,080
and follow the court order.

488
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,040
No clapping.

489
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
No call. Answer the phone.

490
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,680
Without permission,

491
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,320
No recording, recording, and taking photos.

492
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,840
For those who violate court discipline,

493
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,720
the legal police have the right to stop it.

494
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,280
You can take him out of the court if necessary.

495
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,320
The above rules.

496
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,880
The listeners must follow it carefully.

497
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,720
All rise.

498
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,200
Your Honor, please enter the court.

499
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,480
Your Honor.

500
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,840
The court is ready.

501
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,800
OK.

502
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,480
Sit down.

503
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,360
Please bring the defendant Kang Woo

504
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,440
to the court.

505
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,280
The Intermediate People's Court of Hongwan, Haidong Province.

506
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,360
The trial begins now.

507
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,640
Summon the identifator Zhou Changran to court.

508
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,200
The analysis report in my hand shows that

509
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,800
the victim was choked

510
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,440
caused mechanical asphyxiation.

511
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,680
Dr. Zhou,

512
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,880
from a forensic perspective,

513
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,920
how likely it is.

514
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,120
Can we rule out the possibility of suffocation?

515
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,240
First,

516
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,320
we are

517
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,360
the three victims

518
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,800
in the defendant's house,

519
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,520
The third victim.

520
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,600
There was a finger compression on both sides of the neck.

521
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,400
A slight blood vessel ruptured under the skin.

522
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,320
The bruises caused

523
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,520
Face congestion.

524
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,800
The eye is bleeding.

525
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,200
A thyroid cartilage and tongue fracture.

526
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,320
Other than that,

527
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,880
other obvious scars.

528
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,840
The other two victims

529
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,840
died too long

530
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,120
he's already skeletoned.

531
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,920
We can't identify the cause of death

532
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,920
to determine the cause of death.

533
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,600
Through the test on the bone,

534
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,600
we inferred that the victim was

535
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,360
of 20 to 30 years old.

536
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,160
We also conducted

537
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,680
the victim's tongue.

538
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,840
and analyzed the cause of the death of two victims.

539
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,320
The same cause of death as the third victim.

540
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,320
were strangled to death.

541
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,880
Prosecutor, please question the witness.

542
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,400
The attorney mentioned

543
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,760
a body asphyxiation.

544
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,040
According to

545
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,280
the three victims,

546
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,880
can we rule out

547
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,120
the three victims

548
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,120
died in an accident

549
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,400
during an abnormal behavior.

550
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,880
can be excluded.

551
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,880
the defendant's testimony.

552
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
15 years ago,

553
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,360
the death of Jin Jie and Wu Fei

554
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,600
were done by Zhang Jianmin and Li Guokun.

555
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,200
According to the autopsy results

556
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,280
of Sanbei naked corpse case,

557
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,680
Is the cause of Jin Jie’s death

558
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,480
is similar to

559
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,880
in Jiang Yi's house?

560
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,320
According to the autopsy results,

561
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,320
it's the same.

562
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,320
and compared with the fingerprints,

563
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,800
the defendant's fingerprints

564
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,720
of the defendant.

565
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,760
I didn't kill Wu Fei.

566
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,400
You confessed

567
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,240
Li Guo Kun and Zhang Jianmin

568
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,440
killed Jin Jie and Wu Fei

569
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,520
and killed Jin Jie and Wu Fei.

570
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,080
But the fact is

571
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,440
you killed Jin Jie.

572
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,280
Those two are just your accomplices.

573
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,240
You are the mastermind.

574
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,480
How many times have I told you?

575
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,600
I didn't kill Wu Fei.

576
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,560
I did nothing.

577
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,040
Silence!

578
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,880
Can't you understand?

579
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,240
Silence!

580
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,840
Yes, Your Honor.

581
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,920
That's all.

582
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,080
Okay.

583
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,920
Please leave the seat.

584
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,760
Next,

585
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,920
10 minutes.

586
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,960
The trial went well.

587
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,520
This time,

588
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,600
this time.

589
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,720
Shall we have hotpot

590
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,480
to celebrate?

591
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,240
Do you want to eat pig brains?

592
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:03,960
Do you want more?

593
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,880
I'm fine.

594
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,720
Isn't the person beside her always Mo Bei?

595
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,480
Look at her face.

596
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,680
She doesn't look like she'll lose.

597
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,400
Hello, honey.

598
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,960
What took you so long?

599
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Xiao Yu is missing.

600
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,960
What did you say?

601
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,080
Xiao Yu is missing.

602
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,400
Don't worry.

603
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,320
Take your time.

604
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,000
I went to the kindergarten to pick him up.

605
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,880
and he disappeared.

606
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,760
The teacher and other parents didn't see him.

607
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,920
Did you call the police?

608
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
I did.

609
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,280
The police are looking for him.

610
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,200
Wait for me.

611
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,720
I'll be right there.

612
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,400
Hello?

613
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,800
Who are you?

614
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,320
What do you want?

615
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,760
What's going on?

616
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,760
There are still many doubts in this case.

617
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,360
and

618
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,840
there is still new evidence that hasn’t been submitted in time.

619
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,680
So...

620
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,960
After hearing,

621
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,120
Request the retrial.

622
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,680
Brilliant.

623
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,760
Mr. Yoo.

624
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,040
What happened?

625
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,080
Who are you?

626
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,240
I'm from the City Police Station.

627
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,080
How can I help you?

628
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:42,920
I'm sorry.

629
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,640
I have something to do.

630
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,520
Xiao Yu.

631
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,680
Xiao Yu.

632
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,200
Let me see.

633
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,160
Are you okay?

634
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,520
Here.

635
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,480
Those two uncles are really nice.

636
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,760
They brought me to the amusement park

637
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,080
and bought me delicious food.

638
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,640
and played with me.

639
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,600
Okay.

640
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,640
Come home with me, okay?

641
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,360
Sure, Dad.

642
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:36,760
Let's go.

643
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,120
Mr. Yoo.

644
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,720
Did someone threaten you?

645
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Do you need help?

646
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,800
I'm sorry.

647
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,880
I want to take my child home first.

648
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,040
Mr. Liu.

649
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,600
Marco Lu.

650
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,280
It must be Jiang Yan.

651
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,560
She's stalling.

652
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,280
The porpoise has solid evidence.

653
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
What else can she do?

654
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:02,920
Luo Yin.

655
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,880
She is looking for him.

656
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,840
Ning Zhen.

657
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,199
Don't forget what you promised me.

658
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,199
What do you mean?

659
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,719
From now on,

660
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,239
you have nothing to do with this case.

661
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,760
Do you have to do this?

662
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,840
His borrowing period is over.

663
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,440
When did you become

664
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,639
so cold-hearted?

665
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,199
Ning Zhen.

666
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,719
Ning Zhen.

667
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,360
Ning Zhen!

668
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,520
Ning Zhen.

669
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,040
Tao Zi.

670
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,800
Has Ning Zhen been back?

671
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,560
No.

672
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,440
What’s wrong, Fan?

673
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,280
Luo Yin.

674
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,720
Cao Jin.

675
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,720
Get out of my way!

676
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,720
What are you doing?

677
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,400
We will keep an eye on Luo Yin.

678
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,560
The flute is caught.

679
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,960
Ning's mission has been completed.

680
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,320
Everything he does now

681
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,560
is his personal behavior.

682
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,240
You can't follow him anymore.

683
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,120
He has always been following me.

684
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,640
As long as I'm here,

685
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,920
he's not individual.

686
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,120
Also,

687
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,880
we have been strictly following the rules of the police force.

688
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,960
Now,

689
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,200
we just leave him like this.

690
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,760
In order to buy time,

691
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,640
to buy time.

692
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,600
I don't know what she will do next

693
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,000
Fan Fan

694
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
I beg you

695
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,760
Stay in the police station.

696
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,680
Don't go anywhere.

697
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,800
In your place,

698
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,720
The naked body case in Kubei is over.

699
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,280
Got it?

700
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,320
Captain Cao.

701
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,160
My dad's death

702
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,080
hurt us a lot.

703
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,400
I know.

704
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,560
all these years,

705
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,960
you’ve been protecting me for my dad.

706
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,120
But besides being Lu Zheng’s daughter,

707
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,040
I'm also a police officer.

708
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,960
You...

709
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:40,960
I...

710
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,640
Yeongjin.

711
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,760
For the three of us,

712
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,480
the truth

713
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,360
is the only key to unlock the knot.

714
