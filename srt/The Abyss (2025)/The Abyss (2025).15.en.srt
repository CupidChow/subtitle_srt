1
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
We must do it well this time.

2
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,720
to make sure

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,039
to prevent Zhang Jianmin from happening again.

4
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,360
Tao Zi.

5
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,920
Every entrance of the hospital

6
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,200
must be guarded.

7
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,360
Our technical staff

8
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,280
should be guarded by our technicians.

9
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,200
Roger.

10
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,720
Also,

11
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,680
don't let Wu Ke Ran know

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
that Wu Ke is also in this hospital.

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,600
Got it.

14
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,320
Kris.

15
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,880
What's going on?

16
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,280
Kang Woo is so cruel.

17
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,000
In the detention center,

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,800
the artery that bit his wrist.

19
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,800
He lost too much blood.

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,120
He's in there for emergency treatment.

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,240
Why did he commit suicide?

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,320
Why are you here?

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,320
Go back.

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,720
I'm in charge of the naked body case in Kubei.

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,640
The porpoise is here.

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
I should be here too.

27
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,120
Tao Zi.

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,200
Take her back.

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,200
Are you afraid of the abyss?

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,320
The flute has been sentenced to death.

31
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,480
He won't come.

32
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,120
All these years in the abyss,

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,000
to find

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,120
the naked corpse case in Kubei.

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,040
If he believes in the law,

36
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,160
Loosen the place. No entry.

37
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,320
he wouldn't have become a serial killer.

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
If he wanted revenge,

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,400
this place

40
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
is his last chance.

41
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,200
Rescue place. No entry.

42
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,640
Respect. No entry.

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,040
Enemy is forbidden.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
I won't let Jang Geon-min

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,280
happen again.

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,360
Mom.

47
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,079
Wu Ke Ran waited for 15 years.

48
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,400
and finally found her father.

49
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,480
Where are you?

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,240
What happened 15 years ago?

51
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,000
[I'll keep watching] [The flute bit his wrist in the detention center.]

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,360
[Kang-woo bit his wrist in prison.] He's now in the First People's Hospital in Hongwan. I'll keep watch.

53
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,400
(I'll keep an eye on him) [The flute bit his wrist in the detention center.]

54
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,159
[(Kang-woo won't let Jang Geon-min get hurt again.)] He's now in the First People's Hospital in Hongwan. I'll keep an eye on him.

55
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,240
(I won't let Jang Geon-min's incident happen again.)

56
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,960
I'm going to the CCTV room.

57
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,560
Tell me as soon as you wake up.

58
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,680
Captain Cao.

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
Fan.

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,040
Why are you here?

61
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,720
I brought you some food.

62
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,520
It's not that Captain Cao doesn't want you to...

63
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,720
I bumped into him.

64
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,320
Where is Xianbing?

65
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,560
Xianbing.

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,720
Kris.

67
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,680
Hurry.

68
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,480
Let's eat something.

69
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,159
OK.

70
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,960
Thank you, Kris.

71
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,760
You can sleep well.

72
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,880
Yes.

73
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,440
Hurry.

74
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,080
The doctor said

75
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,600
he might be in a coma due to excessive bleeding.

76
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,000
But he's fine now.

77
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,560
He may wake up anytime.

78
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,320
Okay.

79
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,120
Eat up.

80
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,320
Kris.

81
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,120
We’ve been here for three days.

82
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,680
We found nothing.

83
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,520
Our people haven't slept well either.

84
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,000
Maybe

85
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
we think too much?

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,640
Thank you for your hard work.

87
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,480
But don't let your guard down.

88
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,320
The killer pretended to be a doctor

89
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,280
who pretended to be a doctor.

90
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,760
We must focus on the defense this time.

91
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
Don’t worry, Kris.

92
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,560
We have all the medical staff's information.

93
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,400
Captain Cao also asked me

94
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,600
Let's eat.

95
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,200
We’ll be scolded again.

96
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,520
Fan.

97
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,600
Captain Cao.

98
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,120
It's okay.

99
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,760
I’ll leave it to you.

100
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
OK, Kris.

101
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,640
(Ward 823)

102
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,800
I'm in a hurry.

104
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,080
Doctor.

105
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,080
Which floor is the ultrasound room B?

106
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,120
Fifth floor.

107
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,920
Thank you.

108
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,880
The ultrasound room is on the second floor.

109
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,160
What?

110
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,960
Excuse me.

111
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,320
Captain Cao.

112
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,720
We found a suspicious male doctor on the 8th floor.

113
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,680
I'm tracking him down.

114
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,520
I'm in the monitoring room.

115
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,320
There's nothing wrong with the CCTV on the eighth floor.

116
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
I didn't see you either.

117
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,360
Marco Lu.

118
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,520
Why are you still in the hospital?

119
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,560
Captain Cao.

120
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,520
Someone tampered with the CCTV footage.

121
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,880
Marco Lu.

122
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,800
Where are you?

123
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,080
Marco Lu.

124
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,400
Attention, all units.

125
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,320
There's a suspicious person in the Inpatient Department on the eighth floor.

126
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,080
Zhang.

127
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,120
Protect the porpoise.

128
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,160
Return the surveillance.

129
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,200
Tao Zi.

130
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,400
What is it?

131
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,600
Nurse, change the dressing.

132
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,920
Please take off your mask.

133
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,160
No problem.

134
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,440
All right.

135
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,240
Come with me.

136
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,760
Sorry.

137
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,080
It's okay.

138
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,960
Let me help you.

139
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,240
Marco Lu.

140
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,760
Are you okay?

141
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,560
Captain Cao.

142
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,880
Captain Cao.

143
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,240
Anything unusual?

144
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,320
No.

145
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,680
Where is Marco Lu?

146
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,160
I don't know, Captain Cao.

147
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,840
Keep an eye on him.

148
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,800
[Hello.]

149
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,800
[The person you have reached is unavailable.]

150
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,640
[The message will be sent in a text message.]

151
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,320
There's still no signal.

152
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,400
This is the last floor.

153
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,760
This person must be here.

154
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,200
(Waiting for the effect)

155
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,880
Stop!

156
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,920
Who are you?

157
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,960
Police!

158
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,120
Police!

159
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,600
Please take off your mask.

160
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,320
It's a mistake.

161
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,040
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,000
There was a suspicious person

163
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,960
have been to this floor?

164
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,080
No.

165
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,160
I'm the only one on duty here.

166
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,120
Few people come here.

167
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,240
Have a look.

168
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,680
Did anyone come in?

169
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
My night duty room is right there.

170
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,800
I'll know if someone comes in.

171
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,480
Thank you.

172
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,920
It's over.

173
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,000
Let's go.

174
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,440
Doctor.

175
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Why are you here?

176
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,720
I don't know.

177
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,280
As soon as I entered,

178
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,319
I was knocked out

179
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,160
knocked out.

180
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,160
Did you see his face?

181
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,160
No.

182
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,040
I didn't see it clearly.

183
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,599
No, I didn't.

184
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,600
Abyss.

185
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,840
Captain Cao.

186
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
The abyss just escaped from the second floor underground of the hospital.

187
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,160
Okay.

188
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,320
Come up.

189
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,720
What should we do?

190
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,000
If the abyss's target is a flute,

191
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,560
he would go to the ward to find him.

192
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Leave the arrest to Captain Cao.

193
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,680
Let's go to the ward.

194
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

195
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,280
That way.

196
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,160
Up.

197
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,240
monitoring room.

198
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,360
How is it going?

199
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
I'm recovering.

200
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,080
It will take some time.

201
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,480
Hurry up.

202
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,360
They didn't leave.

203
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,080
Tao Zi.

204
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,560
Search every layer.

205
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,160
Don't let anyone go.

206
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,360
Roger.

207
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,560
Let's go.

208
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,080
Checks.

209
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,480
An emergency patient needs to go to the OR.

210
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,400
All patients.

211
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,520
Without permission,

212
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,160
without permission.

213
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,680
Yes, Doctor.

214
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,360
Excuse me.

215
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,160
Excuse me.

216
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,440
Excuse me.

217
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,520
The abyss took it.

218
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,800
It's not an abyss.

219
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,760
Isn't it more convenient

220
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Isn't it more convenient?

221
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,840
Why did you take him away?

222
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
Where did he go?

223
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,280
I think it's the flute that ran away.

224
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,640
He ran away after the exit was blocked.

225
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
He must still be in the hospital.

226
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
If he encounters an abyss,

227
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,360
he will die for sure.

228
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,320
Captain Cao.

229
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,680
Jiang Xun is missing.

230
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,480
He should still be in the hospital.

231
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,600
Attention, all units.

232
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,400
[Jiang Xun escaped from the ward.]

233
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,800
Guard every exit.

234
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,240
Don’t let him escape.

235
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,240
Ms. Jiang.

236
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,360
Has she come out yet?

237
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,240
The location is still in the hospital.

238
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
Go inside.

239
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,320
Okay.

240
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,160
Wait.

241
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,080
Tell me when you find him.

242
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,280
I'll pick him up myself.

243
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,160
Okay.

244
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,400
You're not a doctor.

245
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,080
Why is everyone trying to kill me?

246
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,520
Why are you here?

247
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,720
Did you find anyone suspicious?

248
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,280
No.

249
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,720
Did something happen?

250
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,320
Lock the door.

251
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,200
Don't go out.

252
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,920
Stop!

253
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,080
I know.

254
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,320
You're the one

255
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,520
with my father's number.

256
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,080
right?

257
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,600
Kill him.

258
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,480
You promised me.

259
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,200
You promised to kill him.

260
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,080
Kill him now.

261
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,800
I don't want him

262
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,840
in front of me again.

263
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,000
You killed him.

264
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,160
I'll take care of him.

265
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,040
This has nothing to do with you.

266
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
No.

267
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,280
You can use me.

268
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,480
You can take me as a hostage.

269
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,840
You can escape from the hospital.

270
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,080
I'm still useful.

271
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,480
I beg you.

272
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,400
I said

273
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,240
I'm going to kill the porpoise.

274
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,320
But your business

275
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,360
is over here.

276
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,040
The abyss doesn't need someone like you.

277
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,520
It won't happen again.

278
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,120
I won't.

279
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,040
Just shout if you want.

280
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,760
Your business

281
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,280
to the police,

282
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,680
you'll still be sentenced to death.

283
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,600
Ning Zhen.

284
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,520
Hurry!

285
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,360
They're up there.

286
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,280
Go up!

287
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,840
Help!

288
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,880
Help!

289
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,840
Are you okay?

290
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,760
Go after him!

291
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,880
Everyone, search ahead.

292
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,680
Captain Cao.

293
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,880
The abyss is going up.

294
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,400
Hurry!

295
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,240
They're upstairs.

296
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,800
Go after them!

297
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,480
Abyss!

298
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,880
Abyss?

299
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,680
Where's the flute?

300
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,840
You can't escape the abyss.

301
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,160
Where is the porridge?

302
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,600
Ning Zhen.

303
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,320
Ning Zhen, be careful!

304
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,920
Ning Zhen.

305
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,720
Tao Zi.

306
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,760
Find a tool to open the door.

307
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,320
Okay.

308
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,520
Sister.

309
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,240
Sister

310
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,280
Sister.

311
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,600
I knew you'd come.

312
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,640
You won't leave me.

313
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,320
Sister.

314
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,520
I'm worried about you.

315
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,160
Of course.

316
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,160
Time is running out.

317
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,160
You have something important to do.

318
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Okay, let's go.

319
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,560

00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,080
Are you crazy?

321
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,200
Time waits for no one.

322
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,560
Fluffy.

323
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,760

324
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,480
