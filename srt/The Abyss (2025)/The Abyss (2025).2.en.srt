1
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,400
We came fishing this morning

2
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,479
I thought we caught a big fish

3
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,600
but it's a box.

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,280
When we opened it,

5
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,840
Liu.

6
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,240
Where is the police team?

7
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,720
We're almost there.

8
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,960
Stay in order.

9
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,800
Protect the scene.

10
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,920
Got it.

11
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,920
Captain Cao.

12
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,640
Cao Jin from the city police force.

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,720
The chief of the Third Street Police Station, Zhang Lei.

14
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,640
What happened?

15
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,000
The clock came at seven this morning.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,960
I received a call.

17
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,400
A luggage with a female body

18
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,880
was rushed to the shore.

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,000
The fishing enthusiasts

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,040
who came to the river in the morning.

21
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,120
[The scene remains the same.]

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,840
It's not destroyed.

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,680
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,520
Tao Zi.

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,680
Get to work.

26
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,320
Okay.

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,160
Cao.

28
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,120
I'm here.

29
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,920
Let's get the evidence first.

30
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,320
Here, the evidence bag.

31
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,480
Cao.

32
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,080
According to the preliminary investigation,

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,600
the victim was put in a suitcase

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,640
after he died.

35
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,200
[Time of death]

36
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,800
Time of death.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,440
Over eight hours.

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,520
with one stab.

39
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,560
Give me the exact time of death.

40
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,800
Okay.

41
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,600
Captain Cao.

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,880
This is the wallet we found on the victim.

43
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,920
and her ID.

44
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,360
Check the water flow.

45
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,880
Find the possible place to dump the body.

46
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,480
Okay.

47
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,120
Feng Xiaojuan.

48
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,040
Director Zhang.

49
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,320
Captain Cao.

50
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,640
Director Zhang.

51
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,960
I need your help.

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,080
We're short-handed.

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,880
Can I borrow someone from you?

54
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,120
023085.

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,680
No problem.

56
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,320
Do your best.

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,560
023085.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,880
Liu, Zhao.

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,520
No need.

60
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,160
That one.

61
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,240
You look smart.

62
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,400
How long have you been a cop?

63
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,360
Three years.

64
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,360
I like detectives,

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,920
but I didn't get to be a detective.

66
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,760
Good.

67
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,880
help me analyze

68
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
There is a criminal

69
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,159
for 15 years.

70
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,800
He was just released.

71
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,440
When I was in prison,

72
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,560
in prison.

73
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,880
What do you think will happen

74
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,120
after he gets out of prison?

75
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,640
I don't know this criminal.

76
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,800
I'm not sure.

77
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,040
This case was quite famous.

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,480
You must have heard of it.

79
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,840
His name is Li Guo Kun.

80
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,800
I was a kid 15 years ago.

81
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,160
I've heard of it.

82
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,080
I don't remember either.

83
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,760
Do you know who the victim is today?

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,480
Li Guo Kun's ex-wife.

85
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,120
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,120
What?

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,159
I remember now.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,280
Or we knew each other from the beginning?

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,480
Not really.

90
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,440
I said two words before.

91
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,040
Li Guo Kun was released.

92
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,800
his ex-wife died.

93
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,640
What a coincidence.

94
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,200
Captain Cao.

95
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,520
The house has been cleaned up.

96
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,880
Nothing valuable was found.

97
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,320
The trash can has been cleaned.

98
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,040
So I used UV lamps.

99
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:29,880
I found it here.

100
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,440
Xianbing.

101
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,520
Captain Cao.

102
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,360
Take some men

103
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,920
to search the trash can in the community.

104
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,680
Okay, Captain Cao.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,640
You go too.

106
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,560
Captain Cao.

107
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,440
Blood reaction is found here.

108
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,240
This could be

109
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,360
is the first crime scene.

110
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,240
The victim was moved to the park river

111
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,360
he was transferred to the park river to dump the body.

112
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,640
Then why did the murderer

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,880
move the body to the park river?

114
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,200
Captain Cao.

115
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,320
Fingerprints were found on the key.

116
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,800
Bring back the fingerprints and blood sample.

117
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,880
and compare them with the victim.

118
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,240
Fan.

119
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,000
Why are you here?

120
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,280
Kris.

121
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,960
Shouldn’t you

122
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,360
for beating up the suspect

123
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
was locked in the bureau by Cao?

124
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,240
They fought back with more people.

125
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,920
I just hit them hard.

126
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,000
Not at all.

127
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,000
I brought you some breakfast.

128
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,000
Thank you, Kris.

129
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,240
We haven't eaten anything

130
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,120
since last night.

131
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,880
I'm starving.

132
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,880
How did it go?

133
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,320
Any clues?

134
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,800
Why don't you go back first?

135
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,440
Leave the dirty work to us.

136
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,920
You found the evidence so soon?

137
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,120
You look familiar.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,680
Police.

139
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm in charge of this area.

140
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,520
Tao Zi.

141
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,120
Lu Fan.

142
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,960
Captain Cao.

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,880
What are you doing here?

144
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,240
Li Guo Kun was released only for a week.

145
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,280
His ex-wife who escaped from him 15 years ago

146
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,920
died.

147
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,480
He is very suspicious.

148
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,200
Go back now.

149
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,280
On the day Li Guokun was released,

150
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,760
we met him.

151
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,000
Aren't you afraid that he's an accomplice

152
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
to destroy the evidence?

153
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,400
I know you want to take part in this case.

154
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,720
But this case

155
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,800
has something to do with Li Guokun.

156
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,840
But I've been waiting for 15 years.

157
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,560
I know.

158
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,480
Go back.

159
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,480
When will the autopsy report come out?

160
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,200
I did, Captain Cao.

161
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,160
Dr Zhou said

162
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,360
the report will come out tomorrow morning.

163
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,280
Can you confirm the exact time of death?

164
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,480
Yes.

165
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,640
It was last night.

166
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,720
between nine to nine.

167
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,040
Check the neighborhood where the victim lives.

168
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,240
At this time,

169
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,880
Is anyone here? Yes.

170
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,360
Okay.

171
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,000
Check it now.

172
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's go to Li Guokun's house.

173
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,080
How?

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,760
You can pick him up at the mental hospital,

175
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,640
but you don't know where he lives.

176
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,920
I went to see him

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,960
to ask him something.

178
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,960
What is it?

179
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,960
I'm looking for someone.

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,800
He appeared in Lee Gook-gon's house before.

181
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,000
(Investigate the policemen who were transferred today)

182
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,760
Captain Cao.

183
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,320
Li Guokun's hometown is demolished.

184
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,000
I've sent you the new address.

185
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,960
Detective.

186
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,520
What?

187
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,480
Why are you here?

188
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,840
I came here

189
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,640
with this detective.

190
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,480
Okay, come in.

191
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,480
Have you seen Feng Xiaojuan after you came out?

192
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,480
No.

193
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,760
Where were you

194
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,440
Where are you?

195
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,920
From nine to nine thirty.

196
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,920
I'm downstairs.

197
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,520
24-hour restaurant

198
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,720
in the restaurant.

199
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,600
And

200
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,280
I don't know how long I'll stay.

201
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,600
I'll go to the fruit shop after eating.

202
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,800
I also bought fruits.

203
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,600
I have a receipt.

204
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,280
There seems to be some on the receipt.

205
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,120
Let me see.

206
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,280
Look.

207
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,320
It's on the receipt.

208
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,680
Where did you go after that?

209
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,280
After that,

210
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,480
I came back to sleep.

211
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,280
Do you have a witness?

212
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,160
No.

213
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,200
I just came out.

214
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,600
I don't even know my friends and neighbors.

215
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,880
I...

216
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,000
can't prove me.

217
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,160
Okay.

218
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,800
Got it.

219
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,360
Thank you.

220
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,080
Let me see you off.

221
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,040
Feng Xiaojuan is dead.

222
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,080
The last time Li Guo Kun showed up

223
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,960
The time in the surveillance

224
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,520
was 8:35 p.m.

225
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,960
It matches the time on the shopping receipt.

226
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,600
If he left the fruit supermarket,

227
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
and went straight to the victim's house to commit the crime,

228
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,880
There is no direct subway between the two places.

229
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,920
The fastest way

230
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,600
It takes one and a half hours to drive.

231
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,600
It doesn't match the time of death.

232
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,920
Indeed.

233
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,040
This can be his alibi.

234
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,440
But it's strange.

235
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,200
What 25?

236
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,160
025196.

237
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,240
Li Guokun just told us

238
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,360
he didn't pay attention to the time.

239
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,920
But in the CCTV,

240
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,240
He looked back at the clock.

241
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,720
Look.

242
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,200
8:29.

243
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,440
8:30.

244
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,520
8:33.

245
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,560
he looked back at the clock.

246
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,960
The last time.

247
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,320
At 8:34,

248
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,120
He was looking at his phone.

249
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,360
It's really strange.

250
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,400
He keeps checking the time.

251
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
he must have a deep impression of time.

252
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,880
But he said

253
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,720
I didn't notice.

254
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,120
He must have other arrangements.

255
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,320
But the remaining time

256
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,400
to kill someone.

257
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,480
Thank you for today.

258
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,600
It's okay.

259
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,200
It's my duty.

260
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,520
It's okay.

261
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,640
You can leave now.

262
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,640
What?

263
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,240
You want to be a detective with me?

264
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,520
I'm leaving. 025196.

265
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,000
What's your name?

266
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,600
Ning Zhen.

267
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,000
Why are you here?

268
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,920
Tell me.

269
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,440
Are you here to destroy the evidence?

270
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,160
I'm here to investigate a case.

271
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,520
You're a police officer.

272
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,200
What case?

273
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,640
Acting without permission is violation of the rules.

274
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,320
What about you?

275
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
Isn't it a violation of the law to act without permission?

276
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Do you want to solve the case?

277
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,640
What do you mean?

278
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
The case I'm investigating

279
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,120
is also related to Li Guokun.

280
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,800
What case?

281
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,480
None of your business.

282
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,160
I can help you.

283
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,480
But we have to investigate the case together.

284
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,400
Answer me.

285
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,960
Answer me first.

286
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Why are you so obsessed with Li Guo Kun?

287
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,640
I don't need a suspicious person

288
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,000
to help me investigate the case.

289
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,720
I'll let you go this time.

290
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,560
Get out of my sight now.

291
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,640
Okay.

292
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,240
Hello.

293
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,560
Hello.

294
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Are you Li Guokun?

295
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,960
You are...

296
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,880
We met 15 years ago.

297
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,680
I have something to ask you.

298
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,000
You are

299
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,360
to see my child?

300
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,520
We don't know each other.

301
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,080
I thought

302
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,800
I won't let you see me.

303
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,440
That's all for now.

304
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,360
I want to ask you something about 15 years ago.

305
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,560
I don't know anything.

306
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,720
And so many years have passed.

307
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,920
I can't remember.

308
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,400
That's all.

309
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,160
Mom.

310
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,840
Where are you?

311
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,280
How have you been?

312
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,000
I miss you.

313
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,640
What's written on this page, Mom?

314
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,000
Captain Cao.

315
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,160
The materials are ready.

316
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,320
Let's go.

317
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,600
Coming.

318
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,360
Cao.

319
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,360
The victim is Feng Xiaojuan.

320
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,160
Female.

321
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,960
42 years old.

322
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,720
A local.

323
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,720
No fixed job.

324
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,360
On the 22nd of this month,

325
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,240
7:05 a.m.

326
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,920
was discovered

327
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,760
who went to the suburb park.

328
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,480
According to zombies,

329
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,920
the time of death

330
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,560
between 21

331
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,240
between 21 to 21:30,

332
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,720
the body was shrinked.

333
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,920
I think it was recently

334
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,440
after he died.

335
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,920
The cause of death was excessive bleeding.

336
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
The victim was stabbed in the heart

337
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,240
causing a heart rupture.

338
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,880
The victim had no mud in his mouth and nose.

339
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,920
and weeds.

340
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,000
were dumped in the river after death.

341
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,480
We found a wallet

342
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,000
with cash and ID.

343
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,920
No shoes.

344
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,080
There was a large amount of blood reaction on the floor of the living room.

345
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,800
According to a slight blood test,

346
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,000
the blood belongs to the victim.

347
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,520
In the trash can downstairs of the victim,

348
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,560
in the trash can

349
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,600
on the weapon.

350
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,840
Only traces of blood

351
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,360
on the knife and the knife.

352
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,720
It was tested to be the victim.

353
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,920
So...

354
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,960
the first crime scene

355
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,400
should be the victim's house.

356
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,800
Only the victim's fingerprints were on the key.

357
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,440
It's very likely that the victim opened the door for the murderer.

358
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,880
So the murderer knew each other.

359
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,800
The person on the last call log

360
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,320
could be the murderer.

361
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,560
But this number

362
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,360
is a virtual number.

363
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,760
Did you check the CCTV in the neighborhood?

364
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,280
I checked the CCTV footage from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.

365
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,160
No suspicious person went to the victim's house.

366
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,360
Including the key suspect, Li Guo Kun.

367
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,840
I went to see Li Guokun yesterday.

368
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,280
and checked the CCTV footage.

369
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,320
But during that time, Li Guokun had

370
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,320
of the fruit store

371
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,280
and CCTV records.

372
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,800
He's not allowed to

373
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,880
to kill and dump the body at the scene.

374
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,040
I checked Li Guokun's

375
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,520
of Li Guokun

376
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,080
No location was moved.

377
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
No bus, subway, taxi,

378
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,680
or online bus records.

379
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,360
Li Guo Kun

380
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
wrote letters to Feng Xiaojuan to repent.

381
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,640
Feng Xiaojuan only replied

382
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,600
a few years ago.

383
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,920
and never replied.

384
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,480
Did you find the body dumping site?

385
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,920
According to the calculation,

386
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,280
we can only calculate the range.

387
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,080
We haven’t found the exact place.

388
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Find out the victim's social connections.

389
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,440
and list suspicious people.

390
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,440
Search one by one.

391
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,640
Expand the search area.

392
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,400
Find the dumping site as soon as possible.

393
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,880
Tao Zi.

394
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,760
Come here.

395
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,480
How's the investigation

396
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
I asked you to investigate?

397
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,760
We've found out the basic information.

398
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,920
His name is Yeongjin.

399
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,640
an orphan.

400
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
grew up in a welfare home.

401
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,920
I graduated from the Public Security Academy.

402
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,360
He worked at the police station for two years.

403
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,280
We haven't found anything suspicious yet.

404
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,640
Is he related to Li Guo Kun?

405
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,480
Li Guo Kun?

406
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,240
As far as I know,

407
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,320
No.

408
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,320
This is too basic.

409
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,160
Keep investigating.

410
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,000
Captain Cao.

411
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,000
Did the police offend you?

412
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,160
I'll investigate it right away.

413
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,960
I'll do it now.

414
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,840
I'll do it right away.

415
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,440
How is it?

416
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,120
Captain Cao.

417
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,800
The estimated range is too big.

418
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,720
At this rate,

419
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,880
we have to find out

420
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,240
the victim's social relationship

421
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,920
of the deceased?

422
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,840
We've checked everything.

423
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,360
There's no time to commit the crime.

424
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,480
Find the place as soon as possible.

425
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,040
Okay.

426
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,800
Try your best.

427
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,960
Officer,

428
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,040
Please be the judge.

429
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,960
His house always piles the stuff in the corridor

430
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
and blocked my door.

431
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,240
When I opened the door today,

432
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,600
a big rat sneaked out

433
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,320
ran into my house from his shabby cabinet.

434
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,880
Do you think this makes sense?

435
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,920
A public land.

436
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,880
Anyone can use it.

437
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,600
Is it yours?

438
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,040
No, sir.

439
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,960
the public land

440
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,920
more civilization.

441
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,560
Right?

442
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,200
Who is not civilized?

443
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,280
Watch your mouth.

444
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,560
Arrest him.

445
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,280
and teach him morally.

446
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,800
Ma'am.

447
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,080
You can't just arrest anyone.

448
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,840
Who?

449
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,400
I'll leave my stuff here.

450
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,520
What can you do?

451
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,760
I'll catch you.

452
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,520
Well...

453
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,160
Uncle, auntie.

454
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,280
Calm down.

455
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,200
Let's go to the police station.

456
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,280
Sit down and have some tea.

457
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,880
We understand each other.

458
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,600
It's unnecessary.

459
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,880
Who wants to go?

460
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,000
It's just a small film cop.

461
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,080
It's none of your business.

462
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,360
Comrade.

463
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,840
You don't care?

464
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,720
No.

465
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,400
Ma'am.

466
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:23,920
Well...

467
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,320
I'll come back tomorrow to mediate.

468
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,800
Look at his temper.

469
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,080
I can't get it now.

470
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,760
Hello

471
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,520
