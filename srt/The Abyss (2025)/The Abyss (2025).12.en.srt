1
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,840
[A serial killer?]

2
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:48,880
Then...

3
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,200
Did you catch him?

4
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,240
No.

5
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,160
There's no evidence.

6
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,960
the only witness

7
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,000
And he refuses to tell the truth.

8
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,000
Grandma.

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,760
What's wrong?

10
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,360
I'm fine.

11
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,280
My hand slipped.

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,360
I'll go wash up.

13
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,440
Xiao Xiao.

14
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,480
Can you fold this yourself?

15
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,400
Okay.

16
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,440
If the only witness refuses to tell the truth,

17
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,320
more girls

18
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,160
will be killed.

19
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,440
They might not have escaped

20
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,600
like me.

21
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,200
Wait.

22
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you the girl

23
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,920
who was injured by Ms. Jiang?

24
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,640
I'm a part-timer.

25
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,400
Ms. Jiang is one of my services.

26
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,520
Did you really see something?

27
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,240
If I hadn't escaped,

28
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,520
I couldn't imagine what would have happened.

29
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,320
That day...

30
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,840
is Thursday.

31
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,280
I'll go clean Ms. Jiang's house.

32
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,360
Hello, Aunt Liu.

33
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,400
Ms. Jiang.

34
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,760
Today is Thursday.

35
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,000
I just cleaned the house.

36
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,880
Do you need me to cook for you?

37
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,640
No.

38
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,600
Go home early.

39
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Put the money on the bill.

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,360
We'll pay at the end of the month.

41
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,120
Okay.

42
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,240
I'll get going.

43
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,440
Where's my wallet?

44
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,560
My brain.

45
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,520
Seriously.

46
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,400
Ms. Jiang.

47
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,920
Ms. Jiang.

48
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,000
So I ran away.

49
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,960
Why didn't you call the police?

50
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,280
I'm scared.

51
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,560
When I mustered up the courage to call the police,

52
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,080
but at the entrance of the police station,

53
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,200
in front of the police station.

54
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Officer,

55
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,760
I have something to tell you.

56
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,760
Nothing.

57
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,520
I'm just passing by.

58
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,159
I beg you.

59
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,120
I won't say anything.

60
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,960
I saw nothing.

61
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,720
Don't kill me.

62
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,360
Xiao Xiao is waiting for me.

63
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,000
Please.

64
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,120
Xiao Xiao.

65
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,040
Aunt Liu, don't be nervous.

66
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm not here to trouble you.

67
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,200
I'm here to see Xiao Xiao today.

68
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,400
Aunt Liu.

69
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,040
You know

70
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
Fly likes to play.

71
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,920
Were you scared that night?

72
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,880
No.

73
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,720
No.

74
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,000
My brother

75
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,799
has a little fetish in love.

76
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,000
I like to

77
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,480
with his girlfriend.

78
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,039
I know you bumped into it that night.

79
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
You must be scared.

80
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,840
But that girl

81
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,640
went missing after leaving our house.

82
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,000
She was sad to know it.

83
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,040
Aunt Liu.

84
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,760
If someone asks you

85
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,560
what happened that night,

86
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,520
what happened that night, okay?

87
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,640
This...

88
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,040
Mr. Jiang.

89
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
Is the bone marrow transplant ready?

90
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,080
It's hard to make an appointment.

91
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,360
This is what Jiang's Group does.

92
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,120
We have a lot of medical resources.

93
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,960
I'll arrange

94
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,920
for the bone marrow matching.

95
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
The later treatment of Xiao Xiao

96
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,800
will cost a lot of money.

97
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,440
I can take care of everything.

98
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,840
Soon,

99
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,760
our lovely Xiao Xiao

100
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,320
can be healthy.

101
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,800
Aunt Liu, you don't have to work so hard.

102
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,960
That's it.

103
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,400
I took the money.

104
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,360
I feel guilty too.

105
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,200
But I really need money to treat Xiao Xiao.

106
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,400
I have no other way.

107
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,120
If this goes on,

108
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,200
Xiao Xiao will die.

109
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,560
I know.

110
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,400
I also hope Xiao Xiao

111
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
can recover soon.

112
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,080
Miss,

113
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,960
I know I'm sorry.

114
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,720
No.

115
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,280
Aunt Liu.

116
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,560
But you want Xiao Xiao and me to die.

117
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,120
I'm telling you this today

118
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,960
because I hope you can understand my difficulties.

119
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,480
How did it go?

120
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,160
How much?

121
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,560
It's not as much as the surgery fee.

122
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
That's...

123
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,080
about 30,000 yuan.

124
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,840
We'll go there later.

125
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,640
to consult the children's rescue fund.

126
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,200
That's all we can do.

127
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,800
They're all here.

128
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,800
It's mine.

129
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,480
Captain Cao.

130
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,040
It'll cost at least two or three thousand yuan.

131
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Are you not getting married?

132
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
You don't even have a girlfriend.

133
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,000
Where are you going to get married?

134
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,560
Didn't my mom say she wanted to introduce you to someone?

135
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,360
A porridge.

136
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,840
Come with us.

137
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,960
Coming.

138
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,280
Ms. Jiang.

139
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,960
We all know

140
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,520
you love charity.

141
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,160
Over the past ten years,

142
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,240
on behalf of Jiang's Group,

143
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,880
on behalf of Jiang's Group.

144
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,040
Do you have any new thoughts

145
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,320
about this charity dinner?

146
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,480
Every year at the charity dinner,

147
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,720
we are supported by

148
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,680
and the support of Heart Company.

149
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,480
Here,

150
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,360
on behalf of Jiang's Group,

151
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,640
on behalf of Jiang's Group.

152
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,000
Our common goal

153
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,880
is to keep the troubled people away from difficulties.

154
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,480
and feel our love.

155
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,640
I also hope to take this opportunity

156
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,800
more people

157
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,560
in charity business.

158
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,400
Ms. Jiang,

159
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,720
How many donations

160
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,880
for this charity dinner?

161
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,040
Recently, your brother, Kang Woo,

162
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,280
was involved in a murder case.

163
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,800
As a famous philanthropist,

164
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,560
what do you think?

165
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,080
Ms. Jiang.

166
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,520
Do you believe your brother will kill someone?

167
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,440
Rumor has it that

168
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,480
for your brother.

169
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,000
Is it because of his brother's crime?

170
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,000
Please give us an explanation.

171
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,560
Ms. Jiang.

172
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,880
Can you explain it to us?

173
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,200
Ms. Jiang.

174
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,120
What do you think about this murder case?

175
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,360
I hope you can answer

176
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,320
our questions.

177
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,080
Can you answer our questions?

178
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,720
Ms. Jiang. Ms. Jiang.

179
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,280
How did the reporters know?

180
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,000
Attorney Jang.

181
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,320
What?

182
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,360
What's wrong?

183
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,840
Wu Ke Ran lied to us.

184
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,880
I'm an hour worker.

185
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,600
Ms. Jiang is one of my services.

186
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,200
So did you really see something?

187
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,280
If I hadn't escaped,

188
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,840
I couldn't imagine what would have happened.

189
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,680
That day...

190
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,720
It was Thursday.

191
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,520
I'll go clean Ms. Jiang's house.

192
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,640
Don't be nervous.

193
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,960
Are you the one talking in the recording?

194
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,360
Yes.

195
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,440
It's me.

196
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,560
Is it true?

197
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
How did Wu Ke Ran know

198
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,880
that Aunt Liu is a witness?

199
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,080
If that's the case,

200
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Aunt Liu and Xiao Xiao...

201
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,960
Ning Zhen.

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,560
[Kang Jae.]

203
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,880
Do you think you can get bailed out?

204
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,960
The warehouse in the detention center.

205
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,560
Psychologists are waiting for you.

206
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,040
You think we can do nothing

207
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,520
we can do nothing about you?

208
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,360
We have a witness.

209
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,280
saw you

210
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,480
on the night of the 30th.

211
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,560
You don't have to say anything.

212
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Let's talk about hobbies.

213
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,240
Women in professional clothes.

214
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,240
This is good.

215
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,440
My heart flutters when I see it.

216
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,680
I can't control myself.

217
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,160
Or is it because

218
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,120
in the past?

219
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,560
Other than a club girl,

220
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
how many people did you kill?

221
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,280
Jin Jie.

222
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,840
Did you kill him too?

223
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,560
See?

224
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,800
This is how police work.

225
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,200
Because of an old lady's words,

226
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,319
I'm a...

227
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,520
a murderer.

228
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,640
How about this?

229
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,839
Find the missing girl

230
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,400
and ask her.

231
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,200
Get me out of here.

232
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,400
Ms. Jiang.

233
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,440
The current situation

234
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,960
is not good for you.

235
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,760
I don't care.

236
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,280
I don't want to stay here.

237
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,520
You can't let my sister...

238
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,040
You can't let my sister

239
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,120
to get me out of here.

240
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,640
Then you have to tell me the truth.

241
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,120
Did you kill her?

242
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,560
Tell my sister to hurry up.

243
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,480
We don't have much time.

244
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,400
Got it.

245
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,440
I'll try my best.

246
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,280
Aunt Liu.

247
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,680
Didn't we agree that

248
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,480
You took the money.

249
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,360
Why did you say it out again?

250
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,560
It's not what I want to say.

251
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,360
Sorry.

252
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,000
Ms. Jiang,

253
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,200
I will find a way to pay you back.

254
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,600
Tomorrow,

255
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,440
I'll take back the surgery fee.

256
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,440
No!

257
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,360
Ms. Jiang.

258
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,680
Please.

259
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,320
I won't testify in court.

260
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,720
I'll tell the police again.

261
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,880
I'm getting old.

262
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,600
What I said before was nonsense.

263
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,720
That money is Xiao Xiao's life.

264
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,360
Please.

265
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,640
If you change your statement like this,

266
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,920
the police will think

267
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,880
you are the witness I bribed.

268
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,000
What's the use?

269
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,280
Please.

270
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,960
Please save Xiao Xiao.

271
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,440
Aunt Liu.

272
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,960
Why don't you think of a way

273
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,440
to clear my brother's name?

274
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,920
and help Xiao Xiao.

275
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,760
Wait for me.

276
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,920
Officer Ning.

277
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,680
Why are you here?

278
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,120
Wu Ke Ran.

279
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,360
How did you know Aunt Liu was a witness?

280
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,280
Her granddaughter and I are sick friends.

281
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,440
I found out by chance.

282
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,680
Since you know the serious illness,

283
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,880
and Aunt Liu's difficulties,

284
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,080
Why did you force her to testify?

285
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,720
Forced?

286
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,320
providing evidence to the police

287
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,920
is her duty.

288
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,080
I did nothing wrong.

289
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,320
Officer Ning.

290
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,840
As a police officer,

291
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,640
why did you turn a blind eye

292
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,560
the witness?

293
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,160
We didn't turn a blind eye.

294
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,680
We're just thinking of a better way

295
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,960
to save Xiao Xiao

296
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,080
and get the testimony.

297
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,280
That way.

298
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,400
Where is it?

299
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,920
How long do I have to think?

300
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,440
How long?

301
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,920
You can wait.

302
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,680
the other victims' families

303
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,320
who have been suffering

304
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,160
How long will it take?

305
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,600
Just like me.

306
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,480
for 15 years?

307
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,760
I found the evidence for you.

308
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,640
but you're questioning me.

309
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,280
I have nothing to say to you.

310
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,920
Leave.

311
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,280
Yeongjin.

312
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,840
Are you suitable to be a police officer?

313
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,640
Aunt Liu.

314
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,480
Aunt Liu.

315
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,040
Marco Lu.

316
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,960
The hush fee was exposed.

317
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,880
Jiang Yan will definitely ask Aunt Liu for money.

318
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,840
She won't listen to anything now.

319
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,440
We need to hurry.

320
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,120
The foundation.

321
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,960
Let's go to the foundation.

322
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,840
Xiao Xiao.

323
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,880
Why are you standing here?

324
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,040
Grandma.

325
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,240
You're here.

326
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,200
How do you feel today?

327
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,720
Pretty good.

328
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,360
Grandma.

329
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,040
Don't worry.

330
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,840
Today...

331
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,920
Why didn't you bring food?

332
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,320
I forgot.

333
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,560
I'll buy it for you later, okay?

334
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,360
Grandma.

335
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,600
Why are your eyes red?

336
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
Are you crying?

337
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,760
No.

338
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,960
Grandma was blinded by accident.

339
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,880
It's okay.

340
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,480
Grandma.

341
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,520
Let's go home.

342
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,960
I feel like I've recovered.

343
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,800
Not at all.

344
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,560
I want to share a bed with you.

345
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,920
and let you hold me.

346
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,680
and tell me a story.

347
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:22,920
Xiao Xiao.

348
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,240
I can tell you stories here.

349
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,920
Once upon a time,

350
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,120
when a hunter went hunting,

351
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,640
he swore to God

352
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,320
Morning, Fan Fan

353
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,120
Morning

354
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,560
Captain Cao.

355
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,000
Lu Fan.

356
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,560
Xiao Xiao's data assessment has been approved.

357
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,720
Really?

358
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,200
Look.

359
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,440
Let's go.

360
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,240
Go find Aunt Liu.

361
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,400
Bye, Captain Cao.

362
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,320
Hello, City Police.

363
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,080
Captain Cao.

364
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,520
Aunt Liu hanged herself at home.

365
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,080
Excuse me.

366
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,280
How come?

367
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,880
Kris.

368
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:07,920
You are here.

369
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,160
Initial survey,

370
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,720
the victim should have committed suicide.

371
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,840
This...

372
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,400
was found on the victim's desk.

373
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,720
It says

374
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,560
on the day the girl went missing,

375
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,760
she actually saw

376
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,360
after the girl went on a date with Jiang Xun,

377
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,400
she called a taxi and left.

378
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,920
But he wanted to extort some money.

379
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,760
to treat his granddaughter.

380
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,320
That's why he said

381
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,880
I saw the porpoise kill someone.

382
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,720
I didn't expect

383
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,080
I was approached by Wu Ke Ran

384
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,600
and recorded his words

385
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,400
to the police.

386
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,120
Kang Yeon took back

387
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,680
the ransom I gave her back then.

388
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,360
She thought life was hopeless.

389
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,160
So

390
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,480
I ended my life.

391
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,440
What are you doing here?

392
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,120
What are you doing?

393
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,280
I know you have a hobby of recording secretly.

394
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,880
I hope you don't mind.

395
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,800
You came to me

396
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,320
that means the porpoise has been arrested.

397
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,040
You're here to punish me.

398
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,960
I promised you

399
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,680
not to pursue my dad.

400
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,920
But I can't guarantee

401
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,160
I won't do anything else.

402
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,040
If you really think so,

403
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,280
it means you're quite naive.

404
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,680
I'm here to comfort you today.

405
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,080
Comfort me?

406
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,880
The recording you gave to the police

407
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,000
Fei was arrested.

408
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,000
But Aunt Liu

409
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,560
she used her life

410
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,520
with her life.

411
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,440
Life.

412
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,080
Life.

413
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,720
What did you do?

414
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,720
I...

415
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,080
You killed her.

416
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,680
Nonsense!

417
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,840
I didn't mean to hurt her.

418
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,480
What did you do?

419
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,280
Ms. Jiang.

420
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,600
The procedures are done.

421
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,600
Procedure?

422
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,360
Go back to the company.

423
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,280
Don't go.

424
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,040
What procedure?

425
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,240
What procedure?

426
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,320
Xiao Xiao.

427
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,080
Xiao Xiao.

428
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,200
Xiao Xiao!

429
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,160
Nurse.

430
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,280
The patient in this hospital bed

431
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,200
has been transferred to another hospital.

432
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,920
Where did he go?

433
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,800
I'm not sure.

434
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,560
A children welfare agency picked her up.

435
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,600
Grandma.

436
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,720
This is Miss Wu.

437
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,600
My patient.

438
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,560
She has been with me these days.

439
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,520
If

440
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,120
can live a happy life

441
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,600
let me and my grandma

442
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,360
a happy life.

443
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,040
Why can't Aunt Liu wait a little longer?

444
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,200
Just wait one more night.

445
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,160
waiting

446
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
is the most painful.

447
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,280
Everything is going back to the beginning.

448
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,480
The flute will be released soon.

449
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,920
Let's go to the Mi's house.

450
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,720
Hurry.

451
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,120
Captain Cao.

452
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,440
I'm going to Kang Woo's house.

453
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,440
Get me a warrant.

454
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:58,880
Okay.

455
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,920
Be careful.

456
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
If you need backup,

457
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,960
call me anytime.

458
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,120
Hurry.

459
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,280
Manager.

460
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,960
Can I borrow a tool from your property management?

461
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:16,880
Okay.

462
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,200
What's going on?

463
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,600
A strange number

464
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,600
sent me

465
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,840
recorded by a black box.

466
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,000
in front of Kang Woo's house.

467
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,960
In the video,

468
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,680
the night the girl went missing,

469
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,400
[Jiang Yi brought a lot of architectural materials]

470
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,200
to the house.

471
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,679
So the girl's body

472
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,600
must be at home.

473
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,600
This is new.

474
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,400
The door of his storage room

475
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,280
is always closed.

476
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,760
So this wall is moist.

477
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,640
Dr. Na.

478
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,280
I guess

479
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,200
I win.

480
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,760
Marco Lu.

481
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,760
We can finally convict Jiang Hai.

482
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,480
Hello?

483
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,240
It's a porridge.

484
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,400

485
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,560
There are still many mysteries that haven't been solved.

486
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,920
I don't know where the destination is.

487
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,800
But one day,

488
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,240
we will reveal the truth.

489
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,160
Close that door

490
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,000
