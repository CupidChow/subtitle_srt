1
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,320
I want you to know

2
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,840
the whole truth.

3
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,400
Joien's accomplice is still outside.

4
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,360
is waiting for the time to kill Jiang Yan.

5
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,880
Captain Cao.

6
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,080
The analysis result of the SD card is out.

7
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,640
The content inside is

8
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,160
the drug test report

9
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,200
and all the testers.

10
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,360
The test records of this drug

11
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,320
is very scary.

12
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,520
Several subjects

13
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,640
died of heart failure after using them for a year.

14
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,160
But these records

15
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,600
were erased by Jiang Yan and the others.

16
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,840
Not only that,

17
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,400
This drug

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,079
has three percent death rate.

19
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,200
In other words,

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,320
if one million people use it,

21
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,600
30,000 people will die.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,720
And there will be

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
of the victim.

24
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,800
The list of missing persons

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,640
the missing person list.

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Let's go now.

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,480
to catch Jiang Yan.

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,240
Don't worry, Ms. Jiang.

29
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,720
This is your last chance.

30
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,920
Hongwan International Airport.

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,520
Sir.

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,360
Officer Ning.

33
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,680
Let me borrow your car.

34
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,120
This...

35
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,800
Captain Cao.

36
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,440
Jiang Yan might have found out that he was exposed.

37
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,640
and bought a ticket to America today.

38
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,320
I'm on my way to Hongwan International Airport.

39
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,960
Inform relevant departments at the airport

40
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,840
to handle the border control.

41
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,240
Okay.

42
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,560
Captain Cao.

43
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,920
Me too.

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,640
Get in.

45
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,480
Hello, Mr Jiang.

46
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
We're from the city police force.

47
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,560
We have a few questions about your daughter, Kang Yeon.

48
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,000
about your daughter, Jiang Yan.

49
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,080
Considering your condition,

50
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,520
for my next problem,

51
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,560
you can choose to blink 025077.

52
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,600
You can choose to blink

53
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,520
in the blink of an eye.

54
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,560
Hello?

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,680
Hello.

56
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,480
Mr. Cao, right?

57
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,360
This is Hongwan City People's Hospital.

58
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,520
What's wrong?

59
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,680
Here's the thing.

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,159
About two hours ago,

61
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,159
your friend, Ms. Wu Ke Ran, was in my hospital.

62
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,400
She disappeared while she was hospitalized.

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,600
After checking the CCTV,

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,320
and found that she left the hospital without permission.

65
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,640
Thank you.

67
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,280
Let Xiaoyu check Wu Ke Ran's whereabouts.

68
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,920
Wu Ke Ran is missing.

69
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,880
Okay.

70
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,680
Check it now.

71
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,640
Ning Zhen.

72
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,200
Where are you?

73
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,120
Do I have to

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,600
all by yourself?

75
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,280
Captain Cao.

76
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,480
The airport police found Jiang Yan's car

77
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,680
in the parking lot.

78
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,400
The system shows she's already on duty.

79
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,640
She should have arrived.

80
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,200
All the exits are ready.

81
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,120
She can't escape.

82
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,680
Let the police at the airport

83
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,760
to conduct a thorough check.

84
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,280
Okay.

85
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,520
Also,

86
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,000
we found Wu Ke Ran's whereabouts.

87
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,760
Where is she?

88
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,800
According to Wu Ke Ran's online car record,

89
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,360
she is at the same destination as us.

90
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,040
And she has arrived at Hongwan International Airport.

91
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,520
Xiaoyu.

92
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,760
I saw your message.

93
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,120
What?

94
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,920
What's wrong?

95
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,840
What did Xiaoyu say?

96
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,280
Captain Cao.

97
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,400
The technical team.

98
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,120
While checking Joien’s personal computer,

99
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
he used hacking

100
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,280
to simulate Wu Fei's number.

101
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,280
I've been keeping in touch with Wu Ke Ran.

102
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,120
Oh no.

103
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,040
Wu Ke Ran went to Jiang Yan

104
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,880
to kill Jiang Yan before he got on the plane.

105
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,600
You've waited for this day.

106
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,840
Do it.

107
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,800
You should have expected

108
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,200
that this day would come.

109
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,960
Be careful.

110
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,840
You finally showed up.

111
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,200
Leave her here.

112
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,840
Leave.

113
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,320
Step back.

114
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,040
How could it be you?

115
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,880
Are you familiar with this car chasing scene?

116
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,080
Double effect.

117
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,840
Do you like it?

118
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,440
I wouldn't have known you

119
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,840
I wouldn't have known you.

120
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,280
Why did you kill me?

121
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,600
This is what you hate.

122
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,080
You killed so many people.

123
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,040
You don't even know who they are.

124
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,080
Ning Zhen.

125
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,360
What happened last night?

126
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,600
Last night, Lu Fan and I

127
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
followed the clues to Jiang Yan's father.

128
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,120
in the nursing home.

129
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,840
Then I found that Kang-yeon went to a nursing home

130
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,760
after leaving the hospital.

131
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,040
And she was in a hurry

132
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,280
to destroy an electronic document.

133
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
But unfortunately,

134
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,320
we didn't get any evidence.

135
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,440
I believe you.

136
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,320
That day,

137
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,120
we were both on the rooftop.

138
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,680
And we never use guns for the abyss killing.

139
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,880
There was no smoke on the porridge.

140
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,520
and any weapon.

141
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,400
Then there's only one possibility.

142
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,440
Jiang Yan did it.

143
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,320
and took the weapon when he left.

144
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,120
We seem to be trapped

145
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
in a bottomless pit.

146
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,040
You've done well.

147
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,800
Leave the rest

148
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,160
Leave it to us.

149
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,840
I might be able to continue.

150
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,400
Because I'm obsessed with the Abyss Case.

151
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,920
Do you remember what I asked you before?

152
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,320
if one day I stand on that line,

153
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,280
and have to make some choices,

154
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,440
will you believe me?

155
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,080
That day on the rooftop,

156
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,960
the abyss told me

157
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,040
I'm related to the case.

158
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,680
Everything is not a coincidence.

159
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,680
As long as I keep investigating along the clues,

160
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,280
I'll find him soon.

161
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,280
By then,

162
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,960
he'll give me a gift.

163
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,560
Now it seems

164
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,840
it's not necessarily a bad thing

165
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,680
is not necessarily a bad thing.

166
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,360
If you want to get close to the abyss,

167
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,840
I'll apply to my superiors.

168
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,640
But...

169
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,840
be careful.

170
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,280
Report every action in time.

171
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,120
Besides,

172
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
don’t let others

173
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,640
especially Marco Lu.

174
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
Alright.

175
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,200
Go back.

176
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,920
Marco Lu.

177
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,200
He must be waiting for you at your door.

178
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,080
Director Zhao, I have a plan.

179
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,680
You asked me to investigate

180
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,160
about Joien abroad.

181
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,080
His legs were cured after he went abroad.

182
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,160
There was no medical record in China,

183
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,320
so we haven’t found it.

184
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,480
Then Joien

185
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,360
might be the abyss we are looking for.

186
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,120
It failed.

187
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,880
Heavenly Eye!

188
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,760
Track Joien’s movement.

189
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,360
He must have Kang Yan.

190
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,960
Got it.

191
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,720
Tao Zi.

192
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,040
Yes.

193
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,800
No need to check.

194
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,640
Follow me.

195
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,839
Everyone!

196
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,400
Let's go.

197
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,200
I know.

198
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,760
Take someone to the hospital now.

199
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,480
Roger.

200
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,480
Is there an abyss behind Joien?

201
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,520
never appeared.

202
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,280
According to your analysis,

203
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,080
the person who manipulated the CCTV in the cafe

204
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,280
was Joien.

205
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,640
As for the one on the rooftop,

206
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
hasn't shown up.

207
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,800
But the relationship between Wu Ke Ran and the abyss

208
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,640
is much closer than we thought.

209
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,800
The key is Jiang Yan.

210
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,280
The threat of death this time

211
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,400
he didn't tell us where the missing bodies were buried.

212
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,520
nor

213
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,000
any clues related to the case.

214
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,760
we may face another fierce battle.

215
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,640
Ning Zhen.

216
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,600
Be careful.

217
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,400
Marco Lu is here for you.

218
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,520
I'll be right there.

219
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,440
Okay.

220
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,800
Captain Cao.

221
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,440
Jiang Yan bought it in advance.

222
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,240
The ticket to Hongwan International Airport is fake.

223
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,680
Let our own men drive here first.

224
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,000
to divert her attention.

225
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,360
What she really wants to go

226
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,040
is Hongwan North Airport.

227
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,040
What about Wu Ke Ran?

228
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I lured her there.

229
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,200
We can find her

230
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,880
we should be able to find

231
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,560
that she's connected to the abyss.

232
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,200
Okay.

233
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,680
I'll be right there.

234
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,160
Tao Zi.

235
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,360
Split up to the international airport.

236
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,480
The rest of you, follow me to the northern suburb airport.

237
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:47,920
OK.

238
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,680
Luo Yin,

239
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,520
You are not a judge.

240
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,560
The law will give the victims justice.

241
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,640
No.

242
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,720
Luo Yin,

243
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,880
What is your motive?

244
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,680
You knew you would expose yourself,

245
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,040
you still want to kill Jiang Yan.

246
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,920
What do you have to do with these cases?

247
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,920
As far as I know,

248
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,840
your wife died of a heart attack 15 years ago.

249
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,480
Is it related to the drug test?

250
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,080
It's a long story.

251
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,280
Do you want to hear it?

252
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,320
A dozen years ago,

253
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,560
my job

254
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
is psychological counseling for inmates.

255
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,680
I saw all the weakness of humanity

256
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
[and regret.]

257
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,200
despair

258
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,320
Fake

259
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,240
without guilt.

260
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,160
I heard too much

261
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,080
Yes.

262
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,360
Through my eyes,

263
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,400
through my eyes.

264
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,640
My life was gloomy.

265
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,720
until my wife showed up.

266
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,640
she saved me.

267
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
She told me

268
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,440
remember that

269
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,680
even if there is a little bit of beauty,

270
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
she also told me

271
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,480
the sun sometimes hides in the clouds

272
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,960
The clouds are scattered.

273
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,000
The sun comes out

274
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,960
shines on us

275
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,120
makes us feel warm.

276
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
With her persistence,

277
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,880
[she had a heart attack.]

278
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,680
gave birth to a beautiful daughter for me.

279
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,120
I think my beautiful life is about to start.

280
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,960
But my dream woke up.

281
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,640
When my daughter was ten years old,

282
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,120
his wife's condition suddenly worsened.

283
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,000
We found a new medicine from the patient.

284
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,920
is in the clinical trial stage.

285
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,720
and the effect is obvious.

286
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,960
So we also signed up for the exam.

287
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,520
In the first half year,

288
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,080
under the effect of medicine,

289
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,400
his wife's condition has greatly improved.

290
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,160
But six months later,

291
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,960
the side effects of the drug began to appear.

292
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,680
But they firmly claimed that the drug was fine.

293
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,960
The side effects are normal.

294
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,960
A few months later,

295
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,880
The side effects are getting worse.

296
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,240
There's no point in stopping the medication.

297
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,720
One year after the trial,

298
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,680
my wife died of acute heart failure.

299
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,400
I went to Jiang's Group for an explanation.

300
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,720
But my wife

301
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,640
who had the first problem.

302
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,840
There are no other cases.

303
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,600
can prove that there is something wrong with the medicine.

304
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,520
and the medicine was stopped before he died.

305
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,360
Plus the exemption agreement,

306
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,920
I have no choice.

307
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,760
Let go of me!

308
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,320
Let go of me!

309
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,160
Tell me the truth!

310
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,920
Tell me the truth.

311
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,480
Who is it?

312
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,960
Who?

313
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,160
Why did you come out from Jiang's Group?

314
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,360
Who are you?

315
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,120
I'm the family of the victim who looked for you before.

316
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,320
You ran out of Jiang's Group in a hurry.

317
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,160
Is it because of your medicine?

318
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,880
Why are you here?

319
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,240
I'm no longer an employee of the Jiang family.

320
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,760
Stop pestering me.

321
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,360
I want to know the truth.

322
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,160
I beg you.

323
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,920
If you...

324
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,440
you have the evidence,

325
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,480
Tell me.

326
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,680
My wife...

327
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
My wife can't die without a reason.

328
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,440
I don't have the evidence

329
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,600
is not with me.

330
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,200
I can't even protect myself now.

331
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,920
Please go back.

332
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,320
I beg you.

333
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,760
Please tell me.

334
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,960
I beg you.

335
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,320
I'm sorry.

336
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,640
I really didn't know.

337
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,720
Please calm down.

338
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,320
Please stop.

339
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,240
I'll call the police if you keep doing this.

340
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,480
But I didn't give up.

341
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,400
A few days later,

342
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,480
I came to Jin Jie’s place

343
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,680
I found Jin Jie was carried into the trunk.

344
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,720
I also know the person who carried her.

345
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,760
Li Kun.

346
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,240
Zhang Jianmin.

347
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,320
Later I knew Jin Jie was killed.

348
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,440
I knew it wasn’t that simple.

349
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,160
This must have something to do with my wife's death.

350
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,960
Li Guo Kun was admitted for murder.

351
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,160
I think God has given me a chance.

352
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,320
in front of me again.

353
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,840
I must seize this opportunity.

354
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,560
Through Li Guokun,

355
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,440
through Li Guokun.

356
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,240
I want him to feel

357
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,800
ten times more pain.

358
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,120
You're good at telling Luo Yin's story.

359
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,880
But I want to hear your own story.

360
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,520
Wu Fei.

361
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,600
What are you talking about?

362
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,920
I couldn't figure out

363
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,160
why the abyss always knew

364
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,960
our plan in advance?

365
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,120
Why is Wu Ke Ran in your clinic?

366
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,280
in your clinic?

367
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,200
Why are you always at the nude case in Kubei?

368
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,680
to pay tribute to your dead wife.

369
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,320
Until I found that

370
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,760
Wu Ke Ran.

371
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,200
Give me back my phone.

372
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,000
Wu Fei.

373
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,320
Please leave.

374
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,320
But it's strange.

375
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,040
She could have helped you a lot,

376
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,160
but she stopped.

377
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,120
It's you.

378
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,360
found that she started to lose herself.

379
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,560
You were worried that she would make a big mistake.

380
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,600
You stopped her.

381
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,280
Then I found out

382
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
when Wu Ke Ran was discharged,

383
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,720
and was threatened by Jiang Yan,

384
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,760
you gave her this.

385
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,560
Sleep monitoring bracelet.

386
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,320
I care about patients.

387
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Is there a problem?

388
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,960
This bracelet

389
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,000
is the same as the USB Joien gave me.

390
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,160
there is a black stone.

391
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,440
There's a tracker

392
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,360
under a black stone.

393
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,120
You're not simply using Wu Ke Ran.

394
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,160
That's why I can lure you out.

395
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,720
This is just your assumption.

396
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,880
You reminded me

397
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,040
the real identity of the abyss

398
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,360
must be among the victims related to the case.

399
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,320
Joien's helper was the same.

400
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,680
In order to find his father,

401
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,560
Wu Fei's body,

402
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,160
Take the risk.

403
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
to get close to the flute.

404
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,880
According to the testimony of the porridge,

405
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,840
Wu Ke Ran's autopsy

406
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,200
The forensic DNA is confirmed.

407
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,920
No one will suspect that it wasn't Wu Fei who died.

408
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,360
I doubted my own judgment before.

409
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,320
But to verify my thoughts,

410
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,920
I went to Wu Ke Ran's ward

411
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,560
and then went to your clinic to say goodbye.

412
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,600
to get the DNA sample

413
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,400
from you.

414
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,760
This is the comparison result

415
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,720
of you and Wu Ke Ran.

416
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,800
It shows that you two are related to each other. 9%.

417
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,320
Do you want to see it?

418
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,680
Are you kidding me?

419
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,760
How do you explain that?

420
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,120
The police identified Wu Fei's DNA.

421
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,760
Is the police wrong?

422
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,160
Of course the police didn't make a mistake.

423
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,320
When the DNA sample was tested,

424
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,040
Wu Fei's body

425
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,760
was kept in the forensic lab.

426
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,360
You can't do anything to it.

427
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,240
But when the coroner

428
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,800
when Wu Ke Ran tested the sample,

429
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,160
when Wu Ke Ran tested the sample.

430
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,440
I guess at that time,

431
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,400
Joien changed Wu Ke Ran's test sample

432
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,680
to Luo Yin's daughter.

433
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,880
Sorry.

434
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,840
It’s OK.

435
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,240
The real Luo Yin

436
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,760
ten years ago,

437
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
when Li Guo Kun transferred Jin Jie's body,

438
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,920
he was killed.

439
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,280
You went to comfort your deceased wife

440
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,360
to comfort your dead wife

441
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,200
because it was the anniversary of his death.

442
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,160
We haven't found his body.

443
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,720
That's why you comforted his dead wife

444
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,000
on his death anniversary.

445
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,680
Ning Zhen.

446
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,240
You're better at telling stories than me.

447
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,600
Is it true?

448
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,800
You'll see.

449
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,360
Wu Ke Ran.

450
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,320
It's dyed.

451
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,480
dyed.

452
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,720
Wu Fei.

453
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,320
Are you really going to kill her in front of Wu Ke Ran?

454
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,080
Look at her.

455
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
If any of you come over,

456
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,960
I'll kill Jiang Yan.

457
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,320
We've found the evidence.

458
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,880
The law will punish her accordingly.

459
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,920
Put the gun down, Wu Fei.

460
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,640
Ning Zhen.

461
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,920
What you said just now

462
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,920
is not completely correct.

463
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,480
Catch the thief!

464
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,640
Catch the thief!

465
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,520
Catch the thief!

466
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,920
Catch the thief!

467
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,360
Catch the thief!

468
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,120
Catch the thief!

469
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,680
Catch the thief!

470
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,400
Catch the thief! Catch the thief!

471
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,360
Mr. Oh!

472
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,800
Please don't kill me.

473
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,280
You're not a cop anymore.

474
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,880
You...

475
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,880
Okay.

476
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,360
Catch the thief! Catch the thief!

477
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,440
Sister.

478
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,280
See if there's anything missing.

479
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,160
Thank you.

480
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,320
No.

481
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,080
No.

482
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,400
Thank you

483
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,240
Hello

484
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,520
Hello.

485
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,080
I'm Wu Fei, the person in charge here.

486
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,720
You are?

487
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,240
Du Jun from Jiang's Group.

488
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,520
Mr. Du.

489
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,120
Have a seat.

490
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,800
Thank you.

491
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,320
I

492
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,800
I have something to ask you on behalf of the company.

493
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,640
Go ahead.

494
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,000
The company has a very important

495
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,920
of our company

496
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,360
was stolen by an employee named Jin Jie.

497
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,840
and blackmailed.

498
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,040
Our company is worried that

499
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,640
even if we give her the money,

500
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,000
she won't keep her promise.

501
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,840
So she asked me to ask you

502
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,400
to find this employee

503
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,840
and get the file back.

504
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,080
I know your company

505
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,960
My wife took the medicine from your company.

506
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
A big company like you

507
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,320
to hire such a small company.

508
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,680
Why didn't you call the police?

509
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,640
The reputation of this company is a big deal.

510
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,920
Besides, it's a small matter

511
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
is nothing.

512
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,520
We know you were a detective.

513
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,400
You were an excellent police officer.

514
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,360
You're capable of that.

515
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,520
It's all in the past.

516
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,000
So I entrust you

517
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,920
to entrust you.

518
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,680
I won't call the police.

519
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,520
It’s all done by the police.

520
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,400
Mr. Du,

521
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,080
find another one.

522
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,320
I can't do it.

523
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,880
200,000.

524
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,000
I'll give you 100,000 deposit first.

525
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,160
The rest 100,000

526
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,000
will be settled

527
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,080
after it’s done.

528
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,400
I have a condition.

529
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,000
Go ahead.

530
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,320
Don’t look at anything inside.

531
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,080
Mr. Du.

532
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,800
Our company is different.

533
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,800
but we value our clients

534
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,920
the same.

535
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
Jin Jie.

536
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,880
Mr. Du.

537
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,320
Is it convenient to talk?

538
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,679
Go ahead.

539
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,760
Jin Jie hasn’t been home for two days.

540
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,480
It should be after he stole

541
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,760
he stole something from the company

542
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,800
she never went home.

543
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
Can you adjust

544
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,000
when she left the company?

545
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,280
There should be some clues inside.

546
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,360
The CCTV inside the office is confidential.

547
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,560
I can ask the leader for permission.

548
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
I'll wait for your news.

549
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,120
Sister.

550
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
I forgot something.

551
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
Who are you?

552
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Jin Jie, right?

553
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,000
Hello.

554
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,880
Hello, I'm Wu Fei. I'm Wu Fei. I'm Wu Fei. I'm Wu Fei.

555
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,280
Don't be afraid.

556
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,960
I'm here to help you solve Jiang's Group.

557
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,840
I don't know you.

558
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,560
I don't need it.

559
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,560
Look at you now.

560
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,880
you can't even go home.

561
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,600
I know you about this.

562
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I saw you today.

563
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,520
you don't look like a bad girl.

564
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,880
Besides,

565
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,000
if the neighbours hear this,

566
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,720
it'll be bad for both you and Lee Bong-jin.

567
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,320
Let's talk inside.

568
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,400
There's nothing to talk about.

569
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,160
You've been to my house.

570
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,520
I've been to many places.

571
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,040
You left in a hurry

572
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,480
I didn't have time to get changed.

573
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,560
What do you want?

574
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,440
What do you think?

575
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,760
My client suspects that you stole

576
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,800
of Jiang's Group.

577
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,160
Let me discuss with you.

578
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,520
They hope you don't commit crimes

579
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,640
and stop blackmailing them.

580
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,680
Who is committing a crime?

581
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
Who's blackmailing?

582
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,400
He said he trusts me.

583
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,800
to understand the situation.

584
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,440
But you always call me a bad guy.

585
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,240
You took money from the Jiang family.

586
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,520
you are in cahoots.

587
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,120
Please leave.

588
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,360
Did I say you're a bad guy?

589
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,280
Don't come near me.

590
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,520
Miss.

591
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,880
You're now a thief and a blackmailer.

592
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,080
What?

593
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,600
Do you want to kill more people?

594
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,560
Don't be afraid.

595
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,360
Come on.

596
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,720
Sit down.

597
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,720
I did take the money,

598
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,320
but I'm not on their side.

599
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,480
I'm a middleman.

600
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
I have a girl too.

601
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,920
who is not much younger than you.

602
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,400
As parents,

603
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,000
want their children to be safe.

604
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,120
Is it the same for your family?

605
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,680
Don't distinguish right from wrong.

606
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,920
People like you

607
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,200
no matter right or wrong,

608
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,640
for money,

609
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,560
for money.

610
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,720
I'm the one who helps you.

611
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,520
Do you have any other choice?

612
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,560
I don't have it.

613
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,680
You can search it.

614
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,920
I lost it when I ran away.

615
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,760
Even if I have it,

616
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,400
I won't give it to people like you.

617
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,920
Leave now.

618
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,120
or I'll call the police.

619
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,120
I'll call the police for you.

620
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,360
It's a trade secret.

621
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,400
The situation is very serious.

622
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,120
more than three years.

623
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,760
Over ten years.

624
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,560
The extortion is very serious.

625
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,880
is more than three years.

626
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
Over ten years.

627
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,680
Think about it.

628
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,800
How long can you stay in there?

629
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,480
Here.

630
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,200
Done.

631
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,640
Just press it.

632
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
Where is it?

633
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,360
I'm not lying.

634
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,120
You can search.

635
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,040
or call the police.

636
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,320
If your client asks you to call the police...

637
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,320
What?

638
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,320
You don't dare?

639
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,040
I dare.

640
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,880
110?

641
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,440
Honey.

642
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,360
Stop it.

643
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,120
Officer,

644
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,880
I'm sorry.

645
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,000
I had a fight with my wife.

646
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,760
Stop it.

647
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,680
Sorry.

648
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,520
Listen, Jin Jie.

649
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,520
The thing is with someone else.

650
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,400
You're fine.

651
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,680
If you lie,

652
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,840
I'll see you again.

653
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,720
not today.

654
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,880
Jin Jie once said

655
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,240
the evidence was lost

656
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,800
the evidence was lost.

657
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,000
Does it mean here?

658
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,000
If Jin Jie has lost the evidence,

659
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,680
then who is the one

660
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,520
who is it?

661
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,120
An old friend.

662
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,880
Mr. Du.

663
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,080
How is it going?

664
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,040
It’s almost time.

665
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,600
We are going to make a deal with Jin Jie.

666
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,840
Don’t worry.

667
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,640
Everything is fine.

668
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,400
Just go as you promised.

669
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,480
I'll give you a satisfying explanation.

670
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,360
Hello, Detective Oh.

671
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,520
Do you know why I'm here?

672
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,400
No.

673
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,680
I haven't hurt anyone since I came out.

674
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,520
Did I say you hurt someone?

675
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,920
What are you doing?

676
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,120
Are you going on a date?

677
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,440
No.

678
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,520
Go find a friend.

679
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,320
Smoking?

680
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,480
What's your friend's name?

681
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,760
It's called...

682
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,680
Is it called the blackmailer?

683
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,520
Where is it?

684
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,920
Detective Oh, I...

685
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

686
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,200
Stop acting.

687
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,200
Let me remind you.

688
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,520
The girl you bumped into

689
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,760
The girl you knocked down

690
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,760
knows your house.

691
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,800
Where can he go?

692
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,800
Do you want this

693
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,680
or pick it up?

694
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,000
That's it

695
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,080
Take off your shoes.

696
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,040
