1
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:47,842
=Live or Love?=

2
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:48,608
=Live or Love=

3
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:52,128
=Episode 5=

4
00:00:57,832 --> 00:00:58,671
Miss Fang.

5
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:01,551
After I finish the task,

6
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:06,272
you stay here.

7
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:10,311
Stay here forever.

8
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:11,951
(Your game mission has failed.)

9
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:13,792
(Failed to exit.)

10
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,152
(Your game mission has failed.)

11
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:18,231
(Failed to exit.)

12
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:04,352
You are now my ally.

13
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:06,671
No one can bully you.

14
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:09,751
(Miss Fang should dress more nicely.)

15
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:12,631
(After all, clothes make the man.)

16
00:02:13,672 --> 00:02:14,432
Sorry.

17
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:16,552
I'd like to speak to her directly.

18
00:02:17,232 --> 00:02:18,031
Don't be afraid.

19
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:20,351
At least,

20
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:21,832
you have me by your side.

21
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:24,232
If destined, we will meet again.

22
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:44,071
(Asking for help won't work.)

23
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:46,031
(To leave the game,)

24
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,591
(I must complete the task.)

25
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:49,191
(That means)

26
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:50,511
(one of us two)

27
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:52,071
(must stay here.)

28
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:54,071
(But...)

29
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:58,311
(I am deceiving him now.)

30
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:59,712
(Is this fair?)

31
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:05,911
Miss Fang.

32
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:07,832
How much longer do you need?

33
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:09,511
Let's talk about the contract.

34
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:11,272
The contract?

35
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:32,392
We cooperate to complete the game task

36
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:33,591
for a win-win situation.

37
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:35,751
Since we can't contact the outside,

38
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:36,791
let's follow the rules.

39
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:38,392
You help me become the CEO,

40
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:39,832
and I'll double Ju'an's profits.

41
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:41,591
This way, we can both pass the game.

42
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:43,872
(My mission is to defeat you.)

43
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:45,712
(I won't help you.)

44
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:50,152
The marriage is just for the game.

45
00:03:50,152 --> 00:03:51,351
After returning to reality,

46
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:54,031
we can't interfere
with each other's work and life.

47
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:56,392
After all, once we're out,

48
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:57,712
we'll compete for agency rights.

49
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,071
Address ugly words openly.

50
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:01,071
After going out, we are strangers.

51
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:03,112
I won't give up any benefit.

52
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:05,832
Miss Fang, please don't
play the emotional card.

53
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:08,032
Don't worry.

54
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,311
About businesses,

55
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:10,751
I never play the emotional card.

56
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:11,791
That's good.

57
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:14,911
I saw how emotional you were
at the wedding yesterday.

58
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:16,592
I was afraid you'd overthink it.

59
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:18,672
Overthink?

60
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:20,391
There were so many people yesterday.

61
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:21,751
You married me with a stern face.

62
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:22,951
Don't I have any pride?

63
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:25,352
So, I could only say something

64
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:26,391
just to cheer you up.

65
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:27,391
Miss Fang,

66
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:29,032
please don't take it personally.

67
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:31,831
We're just temporary partners.

68
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:32,592
Not friends.

69
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,711
I was just thinking,

70
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:41,711
you comforted me so sincerely yesterday.

71
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:43,191
It seems rather unkind

72
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:44,352
to compete with you later.

73
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:46,112
Luckily, you reminded me in time.

74
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:48,151
We are always competitors.

75
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:50,151
No need to hold back.

76
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:51,136
Okay.

77
00:04:51,472 --> 00:04:52,831
If you are my opponent,

78
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:54,032
I will not hold back.

79
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:55,232
Alright.

80
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:56,472
It's a deal.

81
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:57,751
It's a deal.

82
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,191
I have two more conditions to add.

83
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:02,391
First.

84
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:03,631
I must be involved in

85
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:05,032
all of your company's business.

86
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:07,456
Second. I sleep on the bed
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

87
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:09,912
You, on Tuesday, Thursday,
and Saturday. Strictly follow it.

88
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:10,472
Now,

89
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:11,472
hurry up and wash up,

90
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:12,672
then drive me to the company.

91
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:15,511
No problem.

92
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:18,032
Hello, Luo.

93
00:05:18,032 --> 00:05:19,592
Schedule a time with Luo Yan.

94
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:21,232
Right.

95
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:22,191
For private matter.

96
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:24,191
No.

97
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:26,032
I know I'm already married.

98
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:33,032
Fang Lili.

99
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:36,391
(Men's restroom)
You've blocked me this far.

100
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:37,831
Don't you have any sense of shame?

101
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:40,032
No.

102
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:41,511
I'm not blocking you.

103
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,151
I...

104
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:48,831
Fang Lili.

105
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:50,872
Let me make it clear.

106
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,951
You've already married
the rubbish An Yushen.

107
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:54,592
Whether it's out of anger

108
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:55,711
or self-abandonment,

109
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:57,472
frankly, you two losers

110
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:58,592
are well-matched.

111
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:00,391
Please have some self-awareness.

112
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,352
Go back and live with that rubbish.

113
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:03,951
Don't try to hit on me again.

114
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:05,472
Seeing your face

115
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:06,951
only makes me feel disgusted.

116
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:11,912
Let me also make it clearer.

117
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:12,792
First.

118
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:15,271
I really like my face.

119
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:16,711
What exactly makes you disgusted?

120
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:18,151
Please elaborate.

121
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:19,151
Second.

122
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:20,511
An Yushen is not a rubbish.

123
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:22,912
He just needs some time
to become the CEO of Ju'an.

124
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:24,391
Don't look down on him.

125
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:25,792
You can't even compare to him.

126
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:26,912
Third.

127
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:29,151
I have no personal feelings for you.

128
00:06:29,232 --> 00:06:30,271
Only for mutual interests.

129
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:32,631
What? Exchange of interests?

130
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:34,472
I will stay close to An Yushen,

131
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,191
helping you become the CEO.

132
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:38,912
Fang Lili.

133
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:41,631
Even if you degrade yourself like this,

134
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:43,232
I won't fall for you.

135
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,592
I will make you believe what I say.

136
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:07,592
What's up?

137
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:11,592
Is my face that revolting?

138
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:13,312
What?

139
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:41,112
Let's start.

140
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,151
Our Longxing Supermarket

141
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:48,511
has some operational issues these days

142
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:49,751
needs to be solved.

143
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:50,711
Yushen,

144
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:51,872
and Luo Yan.

145
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:53,912
Which one of you

146
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,912
wants to take charge of it?

147
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:03,032
Young An has just recently

148
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,032
shown his skills in futures investment.

149
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:06,032
I believe

150
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:07,792
that for him,

151
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:09,071
this matter

152
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,552
is just a piece of cake.

153
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:12,992
Longxing Supermarket
loses money for years

154
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,912
with complicated stuff.

155
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:15,872
It's a bit inappropriate.

156
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:18,232
Ms. Sun.

157
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,311
We should give young people a chance.

158
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,631
You beat a retreat at the beginning.

159
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:23,631
Are you doubting

160
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:25,751
Young An's ability?

161
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:26,792
Shi Yu,

162
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,792
why not leave the good opportunity

163
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:30,751
for Mr. Luo?

164
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:33,352
I also want to see

165
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,431
his abilities.

166
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,192
(It sounds like)

167
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:39,391
(the project is small but challenging.)

168
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:41,671
(Isn't it the perfect obstacle?)

169
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:46,352
Everyone,

170
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:48,072
I don't understand business,

171
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:49,352
but I know,

172
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:52,391
one in the high place must stand
through ability to last long.

173
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:55,431
Yushen can lead by example.

174
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:02,911
That's right.

175
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,312
As a member of the company,

176
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:09,112
we should rise to the challenge.

177
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:11,232
I'd like to take over
Longxing Supermarket

178
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,712
and turn losses into profit

179
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:13,872
within a month.

180
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:15,872
Great.

181
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,192
Longxing Market

182
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:19,791
will be Yushen's project.

183
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:22,112
Additionally,

184
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,551
let me emphasize,

185
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:26,151
from now on,

186
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,712
no unrelated persons can

187
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:30,712
attend the internal meetings.

188
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:33,872
Fang Lili.

189
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,312
Please remember it.

190
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:41,151
Right.

191
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:42,151
What she is here for?

192
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:44,992
Not knowing her position.

193
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:47,072
She dragged down the Fang Group.

194
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:48,031
Such a jinx.

195
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,151
Don't bring bad luck to Ju'an.

196
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:53,151
In fact, I...

197
00:10:16,391 --> 00:10:17,872
Actually, Lili is my assistant.

198
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,112
All my future projects

199
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:21,671
will be co-managed with her.

200
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:23,271
Today, I brought her here

201
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:24,671
to formally introduce her to you.

202
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:26,192
Besides,

203
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:28,391
she is my wife.

204
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:31,751
When speaking,

205
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:33,671
please make clear your own position.

206
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:35,992
I don't want to hear any

207
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:37,151
disrespectful word about her.

208
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:47,031
((What's going on with him?)

209
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:48,671
(Why is he trying to act cool?)

210
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:50,431
(Please be colder towards me.)

211
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,992
(You make me really despicable.)

212
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:53,712
(Ju'an Group)

213
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:55,872
You've realized there are pitfalls
in the project,

214
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,271
but you still let me do it.

215
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:02,631
I was thinking...

216
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:03,592
You were thinking,

217
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:05,911
since we want to quickly
establish ourselves in Ju'an,

218
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:07,271
why not tackle a tough problem?

219
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:09,192
Only this way can we prove our strength.

220
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:12,791
Exactly.

221
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:14,791
Great minds think alike.

222
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:20,472
Did you catch a cold
from kicking the covers off last night?

223
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:23,551
Take it.

224
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:24,608
(Cold tablets)

225
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:26,016
(Hey.)

226
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:27,511
(Why do you care about me?)

227
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:29,391
(Does it have to be this way?)

228
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,016
(Seasonal cold tablets)

229
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:35,712
You sleep in the bed today.

230
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:36,791
I'll sleep on the couch.

231
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:39,751
(Enough!)

232
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:42,031
(Don't say anything more.)

233
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:46,912
(Ju'an Group)

234
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:21,431
That night,

235
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:22,391
you dropped something.

236
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:26,872
Thanks.

237
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:30,992
I return your things back.

238
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:32,192
Isn't there any reward?

239
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:34,352
Drink together tonight?

240
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:38,511
Boss Yin.

241
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,791
Your car is blocking others.

242
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:45,192
Feng Zhixing!

243
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:49,911
Such temper.

244
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:51,232
So cute.

245
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:38,072
Excuse me,
where is your person in charge?

246
00:13:39,992 --> 00:13:40,952
Another goal scored!

247
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:41,791
Scored!

248
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,391
Scored again!

249
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:44,271
Excuse me.

250
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:45,192
The ball is in!

251
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:48,472
I told you one would go in today, right?

252
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:49,431
Yes!

253
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:53,312
Excuse me,
where is your person in charge?

254
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:55,671
Who are you?

255
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:57,472
An Yushen from the Ju'an Group.

256
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:00,499
(Longxing Supermarket)

257
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:02,551
Sorry.

258
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,192
Please wait.

259
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:13,811
(Bringing Joy to the City)

260
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:16,271
Hey.

261
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,472
Long time no see.

262
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:18,671
I can hardly recognize you.

263
00:14:21,031 --> 00:14:22,952
Wow, I didn't expect

264
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:24,872
that you two got married.

265
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:25,992
Congratulations!

266
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:26,952
Congratulations.

267
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:29,832
Let's plan another diving day sometime.

268
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,072
Remember the last time?

269
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:33,072
You threw up all the way on the boat

270
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:34,431
and didn't get in the water.

271
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,431
Cousin,

272
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:37,352
let's chat some other day.

273
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:39,072
Today I'm here

274
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:40,671
is mainly to reorganize Longxing.

275
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:42,232
Just downstairs,

276
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:43,352
firstly,

277
00:14:43,352 --> 00:14:44,352
there's no customer.

278
00:14:44,712 --> 00:14:45,312
Secondly,

279
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:47,072
there's no stuff working.

280
00:14:47,312 --> 00:14:48,472
Encountered any difficulties?

281
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:51,551
Each supermarket
has its own business philosophy.

282
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:54,671
Indeed, service is not
Longxing's strong suit.

283
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,832
But we do achieve annual sales targets.

284
00:14:56,952 --> 00:14:57,592
Don't we?

285
00:14:57,911 --> 00:14:59,472
So, I'm really curious.

286
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:01,431
How did you meet the sales goal?

287
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:03,072
Show me the financial report,

288
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:03,791
purchase orders,

289
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,872
and all the accounts.

290
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:06,112
Let me take a look.

291
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:07,671
I'll cooperate with you.

292
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:09,472
No problem at all.

293
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:11,072
But,

294
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:12,992
I'm on leave today.

295
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:15,431
My accountant and assistant
are also on leave.

296
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:16,551
How about this?

297
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,911
Please wait

298
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:19,472
until we return.

299
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:25,112
(Really tricky indeed.)

300
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:26,551
(It's not a waste effort.)

301
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:30,232
You're getting smarter.

302
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,151
This mess of Longxing

303
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,551
is now passed on to Yushen.

304
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:37,952
Mr. An,

305
00:15:38,992 --> 00:15:40,112
it's company business.

306
00:15:40,112 --> 00:15:41,072
I didn't mean that.

307
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:42,312
Is that so?

308
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:44,352
However,

309
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:47,551
if he can resurrect Longxing,

310
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:52,352
I'll really reconsider this man.

311
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:14,671
(From Lin Lu)
(Mr. Zheng, from Shanyuan Group,)

312
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:16,112
(do you want to meet and talk?)

313
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:24,072
Mr. Zheng has arrived.

314
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:25,271
Come with me.

315
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:39,631
Mr. Zheng.

316
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:42,352
I've trying to meet you for long.

317
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,592
I didn't expect you

318
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:44,472
available today.

319
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:47,352
Sit down.

320
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:54,872
During the previous talks,

321
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:56,431
I always felt

322
00:16:57,431 --> 00:16:59,511
that you didn't seem very interested.

323
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:01,271
But this time,

324
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,431
you're so proactive.

325
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:04,231
I heard

326
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:06,191
that the eldest son of the Ju'an family,

327
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:07,631
An Yushen,

328
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:09,592
has been performing well recently.

329
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:12,512
Mr. Luo,

330
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:14,391
feeling some pressure, huh?

331
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:19,512
I cooperate with you
because of your capabilities.

332
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,872
Nothing else.

333
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:25,032
Mr. Zheng,

334
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:26,431
please have some tea.

335
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:30,112
Miss Lin.

336
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:32,671
Aren't you from the CEO's office?

337
00:17:32,872 --> 00:17:34,231
Why are you so eager

338
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,231
to assist Mr. Luo with the project?

339
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:38,671
Could it be that you two...

340
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:39,552
Lin is helping me

341
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:40,911
under Mr. An's order.

342
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:42,631
Totally for business.

343
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:44,352
Well.

344
00:17:46,552 --> 00:17:47,112
I see.

345
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:49,671
About the cooperation,

346
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:51,352
there's no need to rush.

347
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:52,991
Let's schedule

348
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:53,991
a meal the day

349
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:55,352
after tomorrow.

350
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:57,272
That day,

351
00:17:57,711 --> 00:17:59,671
don't you mind bringing Miss Lin

352
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:00,872
along together?

353
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:03,191
I don't mind.

354
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:06,872
Okay.

355
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,792
It's a deal then.

356
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,911
Young An. The meal's here.

357
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:23,911
Young An?

358
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:24,991
Young An.

359
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:32,072
Time to eat.

360
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:35,191
Hasn't he returned?

361
00:18:36,471 --> 00:18:37,631
He has gone on annual leave.

362
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:38,312
Won't return.

363
00:18:42,032 --> 00:18:43,872
Zhang Chao is really showing his power.

364
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:46,711
A dragon can't quell the local snake.

365
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:49,391
He is determined to wear me down.

366
00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:52,552
So what do we do now?

367
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:53,792
Is it a bad choice

368
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:54,792
taking over Longxing?

369
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:03,112
Let's leave now.

370
00:19:03,552 --> 00:19:04,256
Okay.

371
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:13,352
Why are you so quiet?

372
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,832
In a small matter like this,

373
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:16,711
shouldn't you have numerous ideas

374
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:17,711
to deal with Zhang Chao?

375
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:22,671
(Living with such low customer traffic.)

376
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:24,832
(He must be making Ju'an's money.)

377
00:19:25,752 --> 00:19:27,151
I don't have the authority

378
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:28,391
to see Longxing's data.

379
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:29,711
Any idea?

380
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:30,512
Speak directly.

381
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:34,872
The customer traffic is so low,

382
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:36,191
but it still operates normally.

383
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:37,888
There's only one possibility.

384
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,951
Zhang Chao is making money off Ju'an.

385
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:41,431
He buys low

386
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,752
and quotes high to the group.

387
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:45,471
He makes a profit by doing nothing.

388
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:48,391
He is a relative of the An family.

389
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:49,231
Hard to handle.

390
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:51,191
An Xiangyang sent me here

391
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:52,951
to obtain evidence.

392
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:55,352
Logically, it makes sense.

393
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:57,191
How do you plan to get the evidence?

394
00:19:58,512 --> 00:20:00,792
Zhang Chao must have the real accounts.

395
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,471
But how to find them...

396
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:03,951
Let me think about it.

397
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:05,512
(Don't worry.)

398
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:07,191
(I will definitely remind Zhang Chao)

399
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:08,951
(to destroy the accounts today.)

400
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:10,592
Then take your time.

401
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:12,552
Anyway, I have nothing to do here.

402
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:14,231
I'll ask Yin Zhiluo about it.

403
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:16,992
Thanks.

404
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:18,191
No problem.

405
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:27,219
(Longxing Supermarket)

406
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:31,151
Hello, Zhang Chao.

407
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:31,911
I'm Fang Lili.

408
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,711
Hi.

409
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:42,231
Why are you here?

410
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:43,272
Miss Fang.

411
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:44,711
What can I do for you?

412
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:45,711
Get in.

413
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:56,752
Zhang Chao.

414
00:20:56,752 --> 00:20:57,631
To cut to the chase.

415
00:20:57,911 --> 00:20:59,151
I know we're not familiar.

416
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:00,631
But what I'm about to say,

417
00:21:00,631 --> 00:21:02,032
I hope you'll listen to seriously.

418
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:04,072
Not familiar?

419
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:05,312
Lili.

420
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:06,552
Haven't you forgotten

421
00:21:06,872 --> 00:21:08,231
about what happened between us?

422
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:11,552
What happened between us?

423
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:15,431
Fine.

424
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:18,784
Look.

425
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:27,352
Why doesn't Luo Yan like me?

426
00:21:28,911 --> 00:21:30,352
Luo Yan doesn't like you,

427
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,191
but I like you.

428
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:33,272
Good.

429
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,231
(Oh, no).

430
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:38,112
(How dramatic is this backstory?)

431
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,631
Oh my, Lili.

432
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:43,792
You didn't agree last time.

433
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:45,792
But it's okay.

434
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,671
Even if you got married,

435
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:52,112
we can still continue our relation.

436
00:21:53,832 --> 00:21:55,272
An Yushen, that loser.

437
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,431
Even if he finds out,
he wouldn't dare to do anything.

438
00:21:58,391 --> 00:21:59,272
Aren't I

439
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:01,872
better than him?

440
00:22:03,832 --> 00:22:04,471
Zhang Chao,

441
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:05,711
you bad guy.

442
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:07,512
Don't you know what self-awareness is?

443
00:22:07,512 --> 00:22:08,911
Let me summarize for you.

444
00:22:09,312 --> 00:22:10,631
From your looks to abilities,

445
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:11,471
your EQ to IQ,

446
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:12,391
and forehead to feet,

447
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:13,151
all can't compare

448
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:14,552
to a leg hair of An Yushen.

449
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:15,391
- You...
- Besides,

450
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:16,671
in the video,

451
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:17,552
it's clearly you are

452
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:19,352
taking advantage of me while I'm drunk.

453
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,872
How dare you to bring this up?

454
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:23,431
What's there to brag about?

455
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:24,832
This is your criminal record.

456
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:26,431
If I sue you for harassment,

457
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:27,872
how will you stay in Ju'an?

458
00:22:28,072 --> 00:22:28,911
Fang Lili.

459
00:22:29,512 --> 00:22:30,951
Don't forget who you really are

460
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,471
just because you're in the An Family.

461
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:34,312
(Item purchased)

462
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,431
(Obedience charm)

463
00:22:35,911 --> 00:22:37,592
Don't cooperate when I speak nicely.

464
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:39,592
Wild pig can't stomach fine grains.

465
00:22:41,391 --> 00:22:42,032
Tell me,

466
00:22:42,312 --> 00:22:44,231
where are the account books?

467
00:23:03,752 --> 00:23:05,231
Really cheated on the purchase price.

468
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,151
So much money.

469
00:23:10,711 --> 00:23:11,391
(Forget it.)

470
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:12,711
(It's just a game.)

471
00:23:12,711 --> 00:23:13,592
(It's not real.)

472
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:14,792
(Put it back.)

473
00:23:38,072 --> 00:23:38,752
You are here too.

474
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:45,671
Found the accounts?

475
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:47,991
I...

476
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:00,872
Well done.

477
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:03,911
I had planned to see him too.

478
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:05,792
But you were faster.

479
00:24:06,631 --> 00:24:07,711
As expected of Miss Fang.

480
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:10,240
Thank you.

481
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:11,592
You're welcome.

482
00:24:17,752 --> 00:24:19,312
I've sent materials to Mr. An.

483
00:24:19,832 --> 00:24:21,072
Thanks for helping me,

484
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:22,072
Miss Fang.

485
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,072
Cooperation.

486
00:24:24,352 --> 00:24:25,391
No need to thank me.

487
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:27,072
It's stuffy here.

488
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:28,352
I'll go up first.

489
00:24:42,352 --> 00:24:43,231
Take your time.

490
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:45,312
Anyway, I have nothing to do here.

491
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,872
I'll ask Yin Zhiluo about it.

492
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:48,800
Thanks.

493
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:50,032
No problem.

494
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:58,151
Feng,

495
00:24:58,832 --> 00:24:59,792
drive here.

496
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:02,711
Young An.

497
00:25:03,512 --> 00:25:04,552
At this time,

498
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:06,832
why is meeting Zhang Chao privately?

499
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:08,391
Don't rush.

500
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:09,471
Follow her.

501
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,032
Young An.

502
00:25:18,752 --> 00:25:20,752
Miss Fang is helping you find evidence.

503
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:22,471
She's really nice to you.

504
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:24,512
Where is Zhang Chao?

505
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,312
He's in the car.

506
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:28,752
Seems asleep.

507
00:25:29,752 --> 00:25:31,352
Take him to the hospital for a check-up.

508
00:25:31,352 --> 00:25:32,552
Avoid extra problems.

509
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:34,231
Got it.

510
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,360
Hello?

511
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:48,752
How's it going?

512
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:49,911
Young An.

513
00:25:50,352 --> 00:25:51,752
I've had him checked.

514
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:52,552
Nothing wrong.

515
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:54,032
However,

516
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,711
he seems to have forgotten
what happened today.

517
00:25:57,832 --> 00:25:59,631
Copy his dashcam recordings for me.

518
00:25:59,752 --> 00:26:01,352
I want to know exactly what they said.

519
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:02,832
Okay.

520
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:09,151
(Ju'an Group)

521
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,272
Everyone must have heard

522
00:26:10,711 --> 00:26:12,151
about the Longxing issue?

523
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:14,352
Zhang Chao

524
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:17,112
has been overreporting costs

525
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:18,471
and embezzling funds for years.

526
00:26:19,072 --> 00:26:21,151
Now he has been expelled from the group

527
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:23,352
and will never to be rehired.

528
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:29,072
Yushen.

529
00:26:29,752 --> 00:26:31,032
You've done well this time.

530
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:34,951
Since

531
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:36,552
the root has been eliminated,

532
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:37,352
now,

533
00:26:37,752 --> 00:26:38,911
Longxing's business

534
00:26:39,312 --> 00:26:40,711
will be left in Yushen's charge.

535
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:42,151
Work hard.

536
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:43,552
When I started out,

537
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:45,312
I also worked on supermarket business.

538
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,552
Gradually, I am here.

539
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:48,191
Thank you.

540
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:50,391
I won't let you down.

541
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:52,711
Mr. Sun, come here.

542
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:05,552
(Is this how you proof?)

543
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:10,991
(Let me explain.)

544
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,368
(Feng Zhixing)
(Young An. I've sent you the recording.)

545
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:32,671
Zhang Chao.

546
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:33,991
You bad guy.

547
00:27:33,991 --> 00:27:35,711
Don't you know what self-awareness is?

548
00:27:35,711 --> 00:27:37,032
Let me summarize for you.

549
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:38,832
From your looks to abilities,

550
00:27:38,832 --> 00:27:40,592
your EQ to IQ, and forehead to feet,

551
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,752
all can't compare

552
00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:42,752
to a leg hair of Yushen.

553
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,592
Besides,

554
00:27:43,752 --> 00:27:45,711
in the video, it's clear that you...

555
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:51,352
Well.

556
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:52,832
Meeting's over.

557
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:17,272
Honey,

558
00:28:17,272 --> 00:28:18,512
wait for me, let's go together.

559
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:22,072
Have me walk you down the stairs?

560
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,671
I don't mind the thing this morning.

561
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:46,911
Get in my car, no fuss.

562
00:28:47,151 --> 00:28:48,312
Just a meal.

563
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:50,792
Mrs. Yin.

564
00:28:52,512 --> 00:28:54,151
Let me ask for leave from Young An.

565
00:28:54,352 --> 00:28:55,032
Okay?

566
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:56,072
What leave?

567
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:57,272
I'll tell Fang Lili.

568
00:28:57,272 --> 00:28:57,911
Just wait.

569
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:02,231
Feng Zhixing!

570
00:29:04,872 --> 00:29:05,552
Fine.

571
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:07,552
I like such challenging game.

572
00:29:09,911 --> 00:29:11,112
See Feng Zhixing again?

573
00:29:13,272 --> 00:29:14,112
Not only him,

574
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,072
I also look for you.

575
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:16,991
It's spread all around

576
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:19,151
that you protect your husband so well.

577
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:22,032
Other men aren't worth a hair
on your husband's leg.

578
00:29:22,352 --> 00:29:23,911
How did you fall so low?

579
00:29:24,072 --> 00:29:25,112
Stop it.

580
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:26,391
Want to drink?

581
00:29:26,752 --> 00:29:27,352
I'll treat.

582
00:29:33,911 --> 00:29:35,832
An Yushen surprisingly made a comeback.

583
00:29:36,832 --> 00:29:38,272
Mr. Zheng's project

584
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:39,512
must be in my hands.

585
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:45,312
He has been contacting me

586
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:47,832
every night these days.

587
00:29:48,752 --> 00:29:49,376
Okay.

588
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:51,832
I see.

589
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:55,272
You go up first.

590
00:29:56,151 --> 00:29:56,736
Okay.

591
00:30:14,592 --> 00:30:15,112
Mr. Zheng,

592
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:16,911
this toast is for you.

593
00:30:19,272 --> 00:30:19,872
Mr. Luo.

594
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:21,272
Today,

595
00:30:21,272 --> 00:30:23,112
it's just a casual meal.

596
00:30:23,752 --> 00:30:25,072
No need to be so formal.

597
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:31,792
Mr. Zheng,

598
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:33,832
we should have a drink, right?

599
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:37,671
Of course, Miss Lin.

600
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:38,631
Cheers.

601
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:43,471
Miss Lin.

602
00:30:43,471 --> 00:30:45,032
You're really straightforward.

603
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,032
You, too. Mr. Zheng.

604
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:49,872
Let's not beat around the bush.

605
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:54,272
About the cooperation,
why don't we just settle it today?

606
00:30:56,151 --> 00:30:57,151
Mr. Zheng.

607
00:30:57,911 --> 00:30:59,352
Well, regarding the contract,

608
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:00,552
there's no rush.

609
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:03,951
There are many details

610
00:31:06,112 --> 00:31:08,832
need to be further discussed.

611
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:18,312
Mr. Zheng,

612
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:20,911
as long as you cooperate,

613
00:31:21,272 --> 00:31:22,671
the details are no big deal.

614
00:31:24,231 --> 00:31:25,552
All trifles.

615
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:26,151
Well then.

616
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:27,832
Let's now

617
00:31:28,032 --> 00:31:29,832
have a good discussion

618
00:31:29,832 --> 00:31:31,272
about these trifles.

619
00:31:31,832 --> 00:31:33,272
Let's start

620
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,032
with

621
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:37,072
the first item.

622
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:41,352
Look,

623
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:43,352
the first item...

624
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:45,072
Here,

625
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,032
it's a bit...

626
00:31:58,991 --> 00:31:59,832
Luo Yan!

627
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:01,231
What are you doing!

628
00:32:02,592 --> 00:32:03,312
Mr. Zheng,

629
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,431
I don't mind bringing her to dinner.

630
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,991
But I mind you doing other things.

631
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:12,272
You!

632
00:32:16,671 --> 00:32:17,231
Luo Yan!

633
00:32:18,231 --> 00:32:19,592
You'll regret this!

634
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:22,832
Regret?

635
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,391

Lin Lu,

00:33:17,752 --> 00:33:18,631
why glare at me?

650
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:20,431
Go tell on me to your parents.

I forgot you don't

have parents anymore.

655
00:33:27,512 --> 00:33:29,832
You're now just a dog
adopted by the An family.

Not asleep yet?

667
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:11,232
I have something to tell you.

668
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:12,431
Go ahead.

669
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:16,752
Although you praised my leg hair today,

670
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,672
I thought about it carefully
after I got home.

671
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:20,911
Miss Fang.

672
00:34:21,872 --> 00:34:22,872
Your task

673
00:34:22,872 --> 00:34:25,111
is not doubling Ju'an's profit, is it?

674
00:34:31,272 --> 00:34:32,391
You encouraged me

675
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:34,431
to take over this mess of Longxing,

676
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:36,872
but slacked off

677
00:34:36,872 --> 00:34:37,951
on handling the project.

678
00:34:38,152 --> 00:34:39,551
Although you obtained the evidence,

679
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:41,591
why use an item to make

680
00:34:41,591 --> 00:34:42,752
Zhang Chao lose his memory?

681
00:34:43,272 --> 00:34:44,712
Are you afraid I'll find something?

682
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:46,752
You went to see Zhang Chao

683
00:34:47,192 --> 00:34:48,431
really to help me?

684
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:56,192
What else could it be?

685
00:34:57,192 --> 00:34:58,352
To bring down Ju'an

686
00:34:58,352 --> 00:34:59,551
and take revenge.

687
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:04,632
According to the system setting,
Fang Lili was rejected by Luo Yan.

688
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:06,528
Deceived by the An family,
she lost her dowry.

689
00:35:06,528 --> 00:35:08,391
This indirectly led to her
father's death.

690
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:11,272
With such a miserable history,

691
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:14,951
how else could this story unfold,
if not for the revenge?

692
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:17,551
That's ridiculous.

693
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:19,031

I will not be lenient.

Did you listen to me?

698
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,232
I don't want revenge.

699
00:35:29,471 --> 00:35:30,232
Is that so?

700
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:32,192
