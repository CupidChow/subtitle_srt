=Episode 1=

3
00:00:58,714 --> 00:00:59,394
Five.

4
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:00,914
Four.

5
00:01:01,473 --> 00:01:02,034
Three.

6
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:03,113
Two.

7
00:01:03,793 --> 00:01:04,233
One.

8
00:01:10,114 --> 00:01:11,074
It seems like nothing...

9
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,194
(Where am I?)

10
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:50,953
(What's going on?)

11
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:54,793
(This is the game world?)

12
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:06,914
(Live or Love?)
Welcome to the game, Live or Love?

13
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,034
It feels so real.

14
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:12,074
I am your game butler.

15
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:13,154
You can call me

16
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:13,953
Aotian.

17
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,113
Aotian?

18
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:17,754
You will start the game
as the character Fang Lili.

19
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:18,833
Your mission is

20
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,673
to help Luo Yan defeat An Yushen

21
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,594
and become the CEO of Ju'an Group.

22
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:26,233
New players have 1,500 points

23
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:27,833
(Difficulty Levels, Save, Settings, Characters)
for purchasing items.

24
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:29,754
Wish you a pleasant game experience.

25
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:32,553
It starts now?

26
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:33,553
I'm showing you

27
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,833
the character introduction.

28
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:38,233
(Luo Yan.)

29
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:39,273
(Please marry me.)

30
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,113
(Fang Lili.)

31
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,993
(Don't you have your self-respect
as a woman?)

32
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:46,154
(Luo Yan.)

33
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:47,874
(I can give you all my money.)

34
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:48,474
(Get lost.)

35
00:02:49,993 --> 00:02:50,754
(Luo Yan.)

36
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:51,474
(Luo Yan.)

37
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:52,074
(I can't live)

38
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:53,793
(without you.)

39
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:54,233
(Today,)

40
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:55,594
(once again, Fang Lili failed)

41
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:56,793
(to propose to Luo Yan,)

42
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:59,314
(the illegitimate son of An Xiangyang,
the boss of Ju'an Group.)

43
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:02,194
(We will keep you updated on this news.)

44
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,233
So, I failed to propose

45
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:06,432
to an illegitimate son
from a wealthy family?

46
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:07,953
It's so melodramatic.

47
00:03:08,673 --> 00:03:09,833
To marry Luo Yan,

48
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,513
you transferred your family's property
to the An family,

49
00:03:12,513 --> 00:03:14,594
leading to the death of your dad
from a heart attack.

50
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:16,513
(I like Luo Yan.)

51
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:18,154
(You're so useless.)

52
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:18,953
(Otherwise,)

53
00:03:18,953 --> 00:03:20,393
(Luo Yan will beg to marry me.)

54
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:22,154
(Ungrateful.)

55
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:25,553
On the wedding day,

56
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:27,154
you found out that you were deceived.

57
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:28,393
The groom was not Luo Yan.

58
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:29,434
(An Xiangyang.)

59
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:32,634
(You deceived me.)

60
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,754
(You promised I could marry your son
after you got my family's assets.)

61
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:37,993
(I want to marry Luo Yan,
not An Yushen, a loser.)

62
00:03:37,993 --> 00:03:38,553
(Come on.)

63
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,634
(Did I refer to Luo Yan?)

64
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:43,194
(Return my family's assets to me.)

65
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:44,673
(Don't be silly.)

66
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:45,993
(If you're not satisfied,)

67
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:47,194
(you can leave right now.)

68
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,434
(I will not stop you.)

69
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:50,314
I caused my dad's death for a man?

70
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:51,874
Such a fool.

71
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:54,233
A scriptwriting team
that worked on international projects?

72
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:57,673
I don't know a lot about it.

73
00:03:57,914 --> 00:03:58,993
I'll get back to you.

74
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:00,754
Give me a normal character.

75
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:04,354
(Live or Love?)

76
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:05,993
I can't change your character.

77
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:07,074
I'll exit the game.

78
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:13,833
S-Sorry.

79
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:17,273
Currently, you cannot exit the game.

80
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:18,393
There is a problem?

81
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:21,074
How do I go home?

82
00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:24,153
Is anyone there?

83
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:26,074
System.

84
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:28,114
Aotian?

85
00:04:29,513 --> 00:04:30,634
Let me out.

86
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:33,033
Complete the game task,

87
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,353
and you'll exit the game.

88
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,314
I can exit if I die, right?

89
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:50,314
It's fine.

90
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:51,634
It's just a program.

91
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:52,754
It's all fake.

92
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:25,554
You jumped off a building
eight times last night.

93
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:26,554
Warning.

94
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:27,874
If you die in this game,

95
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:29,713
it will damage your brain.

96
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:31,513
After completing the task,

97
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:32,713
you can exit the game.

98
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:35,833
Okay.

99
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:37,314
Just a game.

100
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:38,833
Who will I help become CEO?

101
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:41,074
Luo Yan, the illegitimate child
of An Xiangyang.

102
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:42,194
Give me ten minutes.

103
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:43,434
I'll be quick.

104
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:49,851
(Ju'an Group)

105
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:51,634
Miss Fang.

106
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:52,393
May I help you?

107
00:05:53,473 --> 00:05:54,593
I'm looking for Mr. Luo.

108
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:55,754
Mr. Luo needs you

109
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:57,513
to be away from him.

110
00:05:58,314 --> 00:05:58,794
Remind you.

111
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:00,114
Luo Yan has appeared

112
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:01,874
behind you, ten meters from you.

113
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:09,953
Are you Luo Yan?

114
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,473
Luo, wash the car later.

115
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:12,234
It got dirty.

116
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:13,953
Luo Yan.

117
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:36,353
In this game,

118
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:37,713
is Luo Yan a domineering man?

119
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:39,353
Who does he think he is? Aotian?

120
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:40,234
I'm here.

121
00:06:40,353 --> 00:06:41,952
It's not about you. Be quiet.

122
00:06:52,393 --> 00:06:53,634
Hello. Help me heat it up.

123
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:55,153
Pay the bill first.

124
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:57,393
Do you use money here too?

125
00:06:58,674 --> 00:06:59,713
What's wrong with you?

126
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:01,473
Give it to me.

127
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:04,033
Come on.

128
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:05,713
You drank it?

129
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:07,234
Do you have any manners?

130
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:09,434
Eight yuan.

131
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,234
Pay the bill,

132
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:11,314
or I'll call the police.

133
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:13,593
There are even police?

134
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:15,754
Don't play dumb with me.

135
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:17,234
You don't even have eight yuan.

136
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:19,833
No.

137
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:21,434
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:22,833
I don't have any cash on me.

139
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:24,833
Call your husband here to pay.

140
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:25,994
Where's he?

141
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:27,953
I...

142
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:29,833
What are you doing?

143
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:31,713
Wearing a wedding dress without money.

144
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:32,593
Got dumped?

145
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:33,713
Take revenge on society?

146
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:35,114
No.

147
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:35,794
I...

148
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:37,473
Let me pay for her.

149
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:54,273
(Who is)

150
00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:55,554
(this man?)

151
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:00,314
(Is it necessary to pay by credit card?)

152
00:08:00,473 --> 00:08:02,194
(He is trying to look cool.)

153
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:03,074
An...

154
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:03,833
Mr. An.

155
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,554
Although it's

156
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,234
a small supermarket owned by Ju'an,

157
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:11,314
you still need to watch your manners.

158
00:08:19,314 --> 00:08:19,994
Miss Fang.

159
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:20,713
Sorry.

160
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:22,234
I apologize to you.

161
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:23,994
Game character introduction.

162
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:25,033
An Yushen,

163
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:26,674
the eldest son of An Xiangyang.

164
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,353
Fang Lili ran out
on her wedding with him.

165
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:29,833
I ran out on my wedding with you?

166
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:32,394
Miss Fang.

167
00:08:32,873 --> 00:08:35,233
There's no need to bring it up again.

168
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:48,753
So Fang Lili gave up her money

169
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:49,833
to marry Luo Yan.

170
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,953
As a result, the An family deceived her

171
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:53,713
and tricked her
into marrying another man.

172
00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:55,194
Correct.

173
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:57,993
Why did she run out on her wedding?

174
00:08:58,473 --> 00:08:59,593
Why must she marry Luo Yan

175
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:00,833
instead of An Yushen?

176
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:17,314
Why haven't you eaten it?
It doesn't suit your taste?

177
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:20,674
I have a question.

178
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,514
I ran out on our wedding.

179
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:24,953
Are you sure you want
to treat me to a meal?

180
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:28,674
After all,

181
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:30,554
my dad deceived you.

182
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:33,314
I've been wanting to apologize to you.

183
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:36,394
(This man)

184
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:37,713
(is good-looking.)

185
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:40,394
You are so polite.

186
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:42,674
I find you much better than Luo Yan.

187
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:44,074
Miss Fang.

188
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:45,873
Please don't joke with me.

189
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:47,953
He is more capable than I am.

190
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,194
Ju'an has such a promising future

191
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:51,434
thanks to Luo Yan.

192
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:53,554
I'm far behind him.

193
00:09:57,713 --> 00:09:58,674
What's going on?

194
00:09:58,753 --> 00:09:59,713
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:00,993
We are leaving.

196
00:10:01,953 --> 00:10:03,674
It's because of the crude oil futures?

197
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:04,914
Don't worry.

198
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:06,554
If the board pursues accountability,

199
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:08,074
I'll say it was my decision alone.

200
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,194
You don't need to resign.

201
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:11,034
Mr. An.

202
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:12,674
We're not resigning.

203
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,154
We're being transferred.

204
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:15,674
All of us.

205
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:18,593
You were set

206
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:19,914
on the crude oil futures

207
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:21,674
and rejected our advice.

208
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,554
The company appreciated

209
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:24,674
our work ethics.

210
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,993
So, the company

211
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,314
gave us a transfer.

212
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:28,233
What's more,

213
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,434
we got a ten percent raise.

214
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:33,593
I was set on it?

215
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:35,674
You advised me to buy crude oil futures

216
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:37,074
and promised to be responsible.

217
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:38,593
Is that so?

218
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:40,074
I don't remember.

219
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:42,314
Mr. An.

220
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:43,873
Good luck to you.

221
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:49,914
(Alright.)

222
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:52,833
(I know why I ran out on my wedding.
He's a loser.)

223
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:55,104
(Transfer Notice)

224
00:10:58,434 --> 00:10:59,194
Well,

225
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:01,953
I'm going home.

226
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,674
- I won't bother you.
- Miss Fang.

227
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:06,194
Weren't you driven out
by your uncle and aunt?

228
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:07,514
Where are you going to?

229
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:08,394
Remind you.

230
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,233
After your dad died,

231
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,233
your house was taken over
by your uncle and aunt.

232
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:13,314
You are currently homeless.

233
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:14,314
If you come again,

234
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:15,353
I'll break your legs.

235
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:16,794
You were expelled
from the An family.

236
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:18,473
I can't be that cold to you.

237
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,376
Here's two hundred.
Take it for a hotel stay.

238
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,873
This outfit will look better on me
with diamond earrings to match.

239
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:45,394
You have a good eye.

240
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:47,034
We have a set of matching earrings.

241
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:48,154
I'll go find them for you.

242
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:04,953
You look good in this outfit.

243
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:06,593
Thank you.

244
00:12:17,593 --> 00:12:17,914
Come on.

245
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,314
Slippers. Put them on.

246
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:22,993
(This NPC is useless,)

247
00:12:23,194 --> 00:12:24,713
(but he's very thoughtful.)

248
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:26,633
(Is he trying to win me over?)

249
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:56,314
This way, you won't get it wet.

250
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,034
(I just ran out on his wedding.)

251
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,794
(Has he planned to take revenge on me?)

252
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:06,554
An Yushen.

253
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,554
Why did you help me?

254
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:11,593
I...

255
00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:14,314
It's inconvenient for you

256
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:15,674
to wear a wedding dress.

257
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:17,194
Helping a girl is

258
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:18,194
the right thing to do.

259
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:25,314
Hello.

260
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:28,074
(He seems a good man.)

261
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:30,113
(Too bad he can't be the male lead.)

262
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:31,713
(Modern girls)

263
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,233
(don't like this kind of man.)

264
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:35,353
Miss, I'm really sorry.

265
00:13:35,434 --> 00:13:37,034
We're out of the earrings you wanted.

266
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:38,353
Forget it.

267
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:39,794
It's alright.

268
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:41,394
My wife looks good enough

269
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:42,113
in that outfit.

270
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:43,833
(Is he not my type?)

271
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:45,394
(I guess)

272
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:47,074
(he is.)

273
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:48,993
(He's quite likable.)

274
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:49,993
Thank you.

275
00:13:53,514 --> 00:13:53,993
Oh right.

276
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,753
Do you want me to lend you some money?

277
00:13:58,074 --> 00:13:59,794
(He's so considerate.)

278
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:12,353
No wonder he's a supporting role.

279
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:13,674
He paid for me,

280
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:14,394
helped me,

281
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:15,514
and paid for my hotel room.

282
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:17,833
Then, next...

283
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:23,233
Aotian.

284
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:23,833
Yes.

285
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:24,873
Is An Yushen

286
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:26,394
really Luo Yan's rival?

287
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,794
Sure.

288
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:30,794
What an easy task.

289
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:36,593
Miss Fang.

290
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:37,993
My company

291
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:40,434
has analyzed the market
through market research.

292
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:42,593
This is the game content team,

293
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,554
mainly responsible for the game scripts.

294
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:45,794
Some of them used to work

295
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:46,993
on international projects.

296
00:14:47,593 --> 00:14:48,554
Are you interested

297
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,074
in a basketball-themed project?

298
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:53,274
This can be discussed
after the cooperation.

299
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,233
However, another person
is also vying for it.

300
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,274
We hope you can experience it personally

301
00:14:58,274 --> 00:14:59,233
before the cooperation.

302
00:14:59,233 --> 00:14:59,953
Is that okay?

303
00:15:00,753 --> 00:15:02,113
May I ask who it is?

304
00:15:02,113 --> 00:15:03,593
An Hang from Juhui Group.

305
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:04,713
An Hang?

306
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:07,154
It's him again.

307
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:14,194
Young An.

308
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:22,074
I was just looking for you.

309
00:15:25,713 --> 00:15:27,194
There are too many mosquitoes.

310
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,194
I'm here to give you mosquito repellent.

311
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:36,633
You rest well.

312
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:37,593
I have to go.

313
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:39,074
Wait.

314
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:42,993
Thanks to you,

315
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:44,434
I have a place to live.

316
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,593
Let's have a drink.

317
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:52,554
Since I know

318
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:53,314
you were kicked out

319
00:15:53,314 --> 00:15:54,434
by your family,

320
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:56,074
I can't let you live

321
00:15:56,194 --> 00:15:57,194
on the streets, right?

322
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:58,713
Forget it.

323
00:15:58,914 --> 00:15:59,473
Well,

324
00:16:00,154 --> 00:16:01,993
they made a scene in your office today.

325
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:07,833
You're contending for the CEO position.

326
00:16:07,914 --> 00:16:09,274
More problems will come.

327
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:11,514
You lost money from crude

328
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:12,593
oil futures, right?

329
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:14,314
Do you have any plans?

330
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:16,914
I still want

331
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:19,194
to buy crude oil futures.

332
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,993
I've consulted the master about it.

333
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:23,648
I'll earn money if I keep buying it.

334
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:27,233
(Come on. You just lost money.)

335
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:29,353
(What are you thinking?)

336
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:32,713
Good idea.

337
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:34,314
You should buy more in.

338
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:35,394
Be bold.

339
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,794
To win, just push all the chips in.

340
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:38,394
Really?

341
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:39,554
So you think so too?

342
00:16:39,914 --> 00:16:41,314
Could you lend me some money?

343
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:45,593
I heard your uncle and aunt

344
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:46,873
swindled money out of you.

345
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:49,274
Well,

346
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:51,113
I can help you find a lawyer

347
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:52,434
to recover your money.

348
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:54,034
As long as you lend me money,

349
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:55,953
I can share the profits with you.

350
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:59,154
(NPCs can't be cunning.)

351
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:01,953
(Anyway,)

352
00:17:02,074 --> 00:17:03,753
(Luo Yan avoids seeing me.)

353
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,274
(Instead of helping him,)

354
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:06,913
(I better beat his rival in one move.)

355
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:08,994
(I can take the chance
to trap An Yushen)

356
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:09,954
(and finish the game.)

357
00:17:14,794 --> 00:17:15,633
Of course.

358
00:17:16,153 --> 00:17:17,433
But before lending you money,

359
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:18,833
can we sign a contract about it?

360
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:19,433
Of course.

361
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:20,234
I must do that.

362
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,113
There's no need to find a lawyer.

363
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:22,633
Trust me.

364
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:23,873
I can get my money back.

365
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:25,113
Then we sign the contract

366
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:26,353
and make money together.

367
00:17:26,514 --> 00:17:27,714
You agreed?

368
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:29,913
You're so nice.

369
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:31,554
Helping a boy

370
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:33,113
is the right thing to do.

371
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:45,274
(I'll set traps in the contract.)

372
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:46,673
(Once you sign, you're doomed.)

373
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,714
(I'll go home tomorrow.)

374
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:06,673
What are you doing here?

375
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:07,873
Come in.

376
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:08,633
Take a look.

377
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:10,193
Who let you in?

378
00:18:10,193 --> 00:18:11,034
What are you doing?

379
00:18:11,393 --> 00:18:12,714
It's a three-story house.

380
00:18:12,714 --> 00:18:13,994
There's a garden outside.

381
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:15,193
More than 800 square meters.

382
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:17,193
Look at its decoration.

383
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:19,040
Selling it for 100 million
is reasonable.

384
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,784
Can I have a look upstairs?

385
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:26,113
Don't break anything.

386
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:28,593
Fang Lili.

387
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:30,193
Fang Lili.

388
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:32,074
Fang Lili.

389
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:33,833
No need to be so loud.

390
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,193
I can hear you.

391
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:37,314
She is

392
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:38,433
selling our house.

393
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:39,514
Your house?

394
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,633
This is my house.

395
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:45,433
I am the rightful heir of it.

396
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,474
Who can prove this house is yours?

397
00:18:48,153 --> 00:18:49,314
Your dad?

398
00:18:50,113 --> 00:18:50,873
Or An Xiangyang,

399
00:18:50,954 --> 00:18:52,873
the one who swindled money from you?

400
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:55,474
If I were you,

401
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,074
I wouldn't come to this house

402
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:59,153
or claim I'm a member
of the Fang family.

403
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,074
You took advantage of your positions

404
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:06,633
to embezzle my family's assets.

405
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:08,633
Don't claim yourselves to be my family.

406
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:09,034
What?

407
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:10,433
What do you think you are?

408
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:12,153
Other than shopping,

409
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:13,314
what else can you do?

410
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:14,633
Don't make a scene here.

411
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,314
Today, I'll teach you a lesson

412
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:17,193
for your dad.

413
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:20,633
Let go.

414
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:22,393
Be nice.

415
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:23,633
I hate fighting.

416
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:25,074
Do something.

417
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:28,994
I'm hitting you.

418
00:19:39,153 --> 00:19:40,353
I've already had it appraised.

419
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:41,714
One hundred million is okay.

420
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:43,554
You...

421
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:44,873
Who exactly are you?

422
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:46,393
An Yushen

423
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,193
from Ju'an Group.

424
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:50,314
An Yushen?

425
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:51,474
So,

426
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:53,074
you're the eldest son of the An family.

427
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:57,633
When my dad was alive,

428
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:58,913
you made him a guarantor.

429
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:01,393
You undertook Ju'an Group's project.

430
00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:02,833
Yet you didn't finish it in time.

431
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,153
In the end, he paid the penalty for you.

432
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:07,393
And you hypocritically

433
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:08,714
signed an IOU for 50 million.

434
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:11,153
My dad, out of brotherly love,

435
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:12,554
never pursued the debt with you.

436
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:13,913
Fortunately,

437
00:20:14,153 --> 00:20:16,153
you did it all
in Ju'an's conference room.

438
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,833
The surveillance device

439
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,393
has recorded everything you did.

440
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,673
I've found that IOU.

441
00:20:21,913 --> 00:20:23,153
I also discovered you tampered

442
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:24,554
with my dad's will

443
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,474
and the statement
from the notary office.

444
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,393
To put it lightly,

445
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:31,633
it's an infringement
on my inheritance rights.

446
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:33,153
And to put it seriously,

447
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:34,554
it's fraud.

448
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:36,954
Guess how many years you'll serve?

449
00:20:37,913 --> 00:20:38,593
Lili.

450
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:40,153
I was wrong.

451
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:41,074
Please.

452
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,153
Please forgive us.

453
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:42,673
Well,

454
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:43,673
this house

455
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,633
is yours.

456
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:46,393
I'll pay back

457
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:47,754
the money I owe your dad.

458
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:49,794
Lili.

459
00:20:50,393 --> 00:20:51,833
We're family, after all.

460
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:53,673
Don't be so ruthless.

461
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:54,433
Indeed.

462
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:55,794
You explain to the police.

463
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,554
I'm in a good mood today.

464
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:09,474
You shut up.

465
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:11,794
Transfer 50 million to my account.

466
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:13,193
Right now.

467
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:14,433
Immediately.

468
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:15,074
Alright.

469
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:15,714
Right now.

470
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:16,353
Remember,

471
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,794
I temporarily lend this house

472
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:19,994
to you.

473
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:21,433
You guard my house.

474
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:24,234
Good.

475
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:33,074
Congrats, you got your money back.

476
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:35,136
Congrats, you got 50 million to invest.

477
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,393
As we agreed,

478
00:21:42,873 --> 00:21:43,554
sign it.

479
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,392
(Loan Agreement)

480
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:58,284
(Party B)

481
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:02,314
Taking the company's equity
as collateral?

482
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:03,193
What does it mean?

483
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:08,474
It's a contract template.

484
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:09,994
It's just a formality.

485
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,393
Nobody fusses over these details.

486
00:22:13,686 --> 00:22:17,411
(Party B)

487
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,474
Miss Fang.

488
00:22:22,514 --> 00:22:24,433
I don't know what to say.

489
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:25,673
But I'm truly grateful to you.

490
00:22:29,153 --> 00:22:30,153
I thought

491
00:22:30,873 --> 00:22:32,833
only Grandma would believe in me
unconditionally.

492
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:34,474
I know

493
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:36,633
I'm slow-witted.

494
00:22:37,474 --> 00:22:38,833
I'm often mocked by others.

495
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:40,393
Can't help it.

496
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:42,913
After all, I am a loser.

497
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:45,474
Very few people

498
00:22:46,873 --> 00:22:48,633
trust someone like me.

499
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:52,234
So,

500
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,153
I will definitely not

501
00:22:54,393 --> 00:22:55,633
forget your help.

502
00:22:56,913 --> 00:22:57,554
Thank you.

503
00:22:59,954 --> 00:23:00,633
I...

504
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,247
(Grandma)

505
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,913
Wait, my Grandma's calling.

506
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:09,873
Hello, Grandma.

507
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:15,554
Don't feel guilty.

508
00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:19,193
It's natural to trick people in games.

509
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:21,514
What's wrong
with finding ways to get home?

510
00:23:22,153 --> 00:23:23,274
He's just an NPC.

511
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:25,554
Be friends with an NPC?

512
00:23:25,913 --> 00:23:27,274
You must be crazy, Fang Li.

513
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:46,474
Grandma, can you hear now?

514
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:48,074
Sure.

515
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,074
Your investment failed?

516
00:23:51,794 --> 00:23:52,353
Yes.

517
00:23:53,074 --> 00:23:53,994
I lost money

518
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:54,873
on my investment.

519
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:56,554
I lost 50 million.

520
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:58,673
Fifty million?

521
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:00,673
I'm sorry, Grandma.

522
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:02,393
I've let you down again.

523
00:24:02,393 --> 00:24:04,514
This is no small sum.

524
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:06,074
I know.

525
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,274
I was careless.

526
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:09,274
You go back home.

527
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:10,274
Okay, I'll head back.

528
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:23,554
I'm sorry.

529
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:24,633
I'm going home.

530
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,153
What happened?

531
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:34,873
The company

532
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:36,314
knows the loss I made.

533
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:38,673
My dad asked me to explain.

534
00:24:43,913 --> 00:24:44,913
This might

535
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:47,074
be the last deal Grandma gave to me.

536
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:50,034
I was planning to announce

537
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:51,913
my departure from the management team

538
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:54,074
at tomorrow's company celebration.

539
00:24:55,554 --> 00:24:57,274
I just wanted to make her happy

540
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:58,554
before that.

541
00:25:00,113 --> 00:25:00,794
Perhaps,

542
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:02,633
I'll have to step down today.

543
00:25:04,153 --> 00:25:05,433
But still, I want to thank you.

544
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:09,113
You're right not to marry a loser

545
00:25:09,913 --> 00:25:10,833
like me.

546
00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:12,994
But I think

547
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:15,393
we're already friends, right?

548
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:26,994
(Wait.)

(I don't need to take action.)

551
00:25:31,554 --> 00:25:33,833
(His dad will kick him
out of the company tonight.)

552
00:25:34,153 --> 00:25:35,433
(Then I'll just win.)

553
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,833
Yes.

554
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:50,314
Fang Li, stay calm.

555
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,393
Don't be friends with an NPC.

556
00:25:52,913 --> 00:25:54,833
He helped you because he

557
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:55,833
likes to be a hero.

558
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,234
It fits his character, okay?

This is your investment statement
for this month.

561
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,593
Pick it up.

562
00:26:43,954 --> 00:26:44,673
Hurry.

is a black sheep?

has already exceeded the losses.

571
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:27,833
I'm familiar

572
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:28,913
with Mr. Chen.

573
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:30,754
I'll call to congratulate him.

574
00:27:31,353 --> 00:27:32,034
So rude.

575
00:27:33,714 --> 00:27:35,113
Are you doubting

576
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:36,633
I am

577
00:27:36,633 --> 00:27:37,794
deceiving you?

578
00:27:45,234 --> 00:27:46,034
Did you

579
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:47,794
make this deal?

580
00:27:53,514 --> 00:27:54,153
No.

581
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:56,714
According to company policy,

582
00:27:56,994 --> 00:27:58,074
hand over the key.

583
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:02,794
Are you happy now?

584
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:04,754
Don't step

585
00:28:05,234 --> 00:28:07,153
in my family affairs.

586
00:28:10,593 --> 00:28:11,593
I'm leaving.

587
00:28:12,673 --> 00:28:13,593
Take care.

588
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:14,994
Madam An.

589
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:28,913
Forget it.

590
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,474
Out of sight, out of mind.

591
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:37,393
Luo Yan.

592
00:28:43,714 --> 00:28:45,234
Have I not made myself clear?

593
00:28:46,913 --> 00:28:47,714
If you pester me,

594
00:28:47,714 --> 00:28:48,433
I'll hate you.

595
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:48,954
Stop.

596
00:28:51,994 --> 00:28:53,353
An Yushen left this in my place.

597
00:28:53,593 --> 00:28:55,074
I've just come to return this.

598
00:28:56,994 --> 00:28:58,593
He actually helped you.

599
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:01,833
My useless brother makes things easier.

600
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,034
What do you mean?

601
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:08,514
The An family has a ban.

602
00:29:09,234 --> 00:29:11,234
People like you
who disgrace the An family

603
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:12,794
should be avoided.

604
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:14,754
I will tell them

605
00:29:15,074 --> 00:29:16,234
he helped you.

606
00:29:16,514 --> 00:29:17,074
Anyway,

607
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:19,314
he is about to be driven out of home.

608
00:29:35,994 --> 00:29:37,474
Miss, I'm really sorry.

609
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:39,234
We're out of the earrings you wanted.

610
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:40,234
It's alright.

611
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:42,514
My wife looks good enough
in that outfit.

612
00:29:45,314 --> 00:29:45,954
However,

613
00:29:46,193 --> 00:29:47,113
please order it

614
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:48,153
for me.

615
00:29:48,274 --> 00:29:48,954
Okay.

616
00:29:56,234 --> 00:29:56,794
I will

617
00:29:57,074 --> 00:29:58,193
give it to him.

618
00:30:00,954 --> 00:30:02,234
Stop wasting time.

619
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,234
At tomorrow's company celebration,

620
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:08,593
you'll announce your withdrawal
from the management team

621
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:10,913
as a way to restore your pride.

622
00:30:18,496 --> 00:30:20,234
(Ju'an Group)

623
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:21,714
(I heard he helped you.)

624
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,234
(My useless brother)

625
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:24,474
(makes things easier.)

626
00:30:25,193 --> 00:30:26,794
You're right not to marry a loser

627
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:28,234
like me.

628
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:29,314
But I think

629
00:30:29,714 --> 00:30:31,074
we're already friends, right?

630
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:37,393
Aotian.

631
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:38,113
Yes.

632
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:39,913
I can buy items, right?

633
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:42,554
Wait.

634
00:30:54,274 --> 00:30:55,714
The player has purchased the item,

635
00:30:55,714 --> 00:30:56,833
Amnesia Gun.

636
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:58,673
Two hundred points deducted.

637
00:31:09,474 --> 00:31:10,113
Sorry.

638
00:31:11,113 --> 00:31:12,593
Although I'm here to help you,

639
00:31:13,554 --> 00:31:15,994
I despise arrogant men.

640
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:18,514
Let go.

641
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:21,714
Give up.

642
00:31:22,474 --> 00:31:23,673
Having you as a son

643
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:25,954
is my biggest failure.

644
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:27,954
You loser.

645
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:33,193
He is not a loser.

646
00:32:05,193 --> 00:32:05,673
Mr. An.

647
00:32:06,514 --> 00:32:08,954
You have been struggling
in the business world for many years.

648
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:10,954
Haven't you ever lost money?

649
00:32:11,193 --> 00:32:12,474
It's not your place

650
00:32:13,113 --> 00:32:14,833
to say something judgmental.

651
00:32:15,794 --> 00:32:16,994
So, I'm right.

652
00:32:17,954 --> 00:32:19,633
If losing money makes one a loser,

653
00:32:19,954 --> 00:32:21,153
everyone present here

654
00:32:21,514 --> 00:32:22,673
is a loser, right?

655
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:23,994
You...

656
00:32:23,994 --> 00:32:24,554
Mr. An.

657
00:32:25,514 --> 00:32:26,673
If I remember correctly,

658
00:32:27,193 --> 00:32:29,274
you swindled me
out of my marriage dowry.

659
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,673
Thanks to you, I'm homeless.

660
00:32:34,593 --> 00:32:35,353
It's fine.

661
00:32:36,074 --> 00:32:37,954
I'm pretty tolerant.

662
00:32:38,193 --> 00:32:40,274
I'll help your son.

663
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,234
I'll give An Yushen money

664
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:44,034
to invest.

665
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:48,153
Take it.

666
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,113
Spend it as you like.

667
00:32:57,353 --> 00:32:58,193
It's none

668
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:00,034
of your business.

669
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:01,714
You are wrong.

670
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:04,474
After all, I am his wife.
