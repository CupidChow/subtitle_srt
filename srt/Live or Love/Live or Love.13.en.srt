4
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,608
Yushen,

5
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:56,928
I was very angry that the Yin family

6
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,848
is asking for 400 million yuan.

7
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:03,888
But you think too highly of me

8
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:05,847
to ask me for a loan.

9
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:09,088
I have very few shares in Ju'an

10
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,448
and my own business
isn't doing well, either.

11
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:13,888
I don't even have

12
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:14,847
20 million yuan.

13
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:15,847
Mr. Shi,

14
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:18,287
I'm asking for your help

15
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,088
as I know your financial capabilities.

16
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:21,207
Rest assured.

17
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:22,168
I will definitely

18
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:23,808
return the money borrowed with interest

19
00:01:23,888 --> 00:01:24,847
on time.

20
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:27,728
I really don't have it.

21
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:30,327
You can't expect me to rob for you.

22
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:33,888
Alright,

23
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:36,448
since you put it this way,

24
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,448
let's not talk about borrowing money.

25
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:40,008
Let's talk about

26
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,127
that incident happened to me

27
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:44,327
at the real estate auction.

28
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:50,327
That day,

29
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:52,207
you nearly had an accident.

30
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:54,648
Fortunately, nothing happened.

31
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:56,528
Look at this.

32
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:57,728
Familiar to you?

33
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:09,488
This person

34
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:10,768
is your secretary, right?

35
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:13,088
This matter

36
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:14,048
can be minor or serious,

37
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:15,088
depending on

38
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:17,567
whether you want to settle it
privately or officially.

39
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:21,887
I will lend you

40
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:23,928
200 million yuan.

41
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:28,607
What?

42
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,968
He really did give you 400 million yuan.

43
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:32,447
I didn't expect it, either.

44
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:34,248
An Yushen

45
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:36,407
actually made the payment
just before the deadline.

46
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:37,847
In such a short time,

47
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:39,248
where did he get so much money?

48
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:40,687
Given his situation,

49
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:42,447
no bank would lend him a loan.

50
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:44,847
He can only borrow money
from individuals.

51
00:02:53,648 --> 00:02:54,287
Honey,

52
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:55,887
don't look so worried.

53
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,167
Although An Yushen has bought the land,

54
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:00,928
he has made the cost so high.

55
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,648
Even if he develops luxury residences,

56
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:03,968
he will not make much money.

57
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:05,727
This time, you're sure to win.

58
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:07,528
I hope so.

59
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:10,808
But I always feel uneasy.

60
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:17,488
Although we didn't end up

61
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,808
collaborating,

62
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:21,208
I managed to help you make money.

63
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:22,648
I know.

64
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:24,248
That's why I'm friends with you.

65
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:31,808
Madam An.

66
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:34,127
How is Xiangyin's condition?

67
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:36,007
They said

68
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:38,808
her health has improved,

69
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,488
and her state is relatively stable.

70
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:44,368
Wu Cong,

71
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,768
on behalf of the An family,
I thank you for

72
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:49,687
looking after Xiangyin
whenever you have time.

73
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:52,127
You're too kind, Madam An.

74
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,687
Over the years,

75
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,968
I've long considered Xiangyin

76
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:57,368
as my own family

77
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:59,287
and never found it tiresome.

78
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,808
Now that Xiangyin's condition
has improved,

79
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,607
make arrangements

80
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:07,048
to bring her home.

81
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:09,208
I miss her very much

82
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:11,248
and always dream of her.

83
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:13,048
Okay.

84
00:04:17,688 --> 00:04:18,407
Yushen.

85
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:19,128
Grandma.

86
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:22,208
Come here,

87
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:24,807
I have something to tell you.

88
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:28,008
Yushen,

89
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:31,208
tomorrow, the whole family
will have dinner together.

90
00:04:31,768 --> 00:04:33,807
Tell Lili to join us.

91
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:35,727
Grandma,

92
00:04:35,888 --> 00:04:37,247
she might not be willing to come.

93
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,367
Yushen,

94
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,008
I used to think

95
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:43,487
you young couples just
have little quarrels

96
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:45,047
and throw little tantrums,

97
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,287
which could pass quickly,

98
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:49,927
but it was naive of me to think so.

99
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:52,448
I didn't expect...

100
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:53,128
Grandma,

101
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:54,688
you shouldn't worry.

102
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:57,047
I didn't expect

103
00:04:57,287 --> 00:05:00,607
Fang Lili fights you tit for tat.

104
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:04,888
She has courage, boldness, and tactics.

105
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:06,688
A woman like this

106
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:09,247
deserves to move forward
side by side with you.

107
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:10,328
So,

108
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:12,927
no matter what means you use,

109
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:15,807
you must make her back.

110
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:35,047
Grandma asks you to
come home for dinner,

111
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:36,688
but you can refuse it.

112
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:40,407
I got it,

113
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:41,367
and I'll go.

114
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:44,607
Actually,

115
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:46,448
you don't have to force yourself.

116
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:50,367
It sounds like you don't me to go.

117
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:52,568
Given our current relationship,

118
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:54,528
I must take cautions.

119
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:56,367
Alright,

120
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:58,128
if you put it that way,

121
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:00,167
I'm definitely going.

122
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:02,167
No one's stopping you,

123
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,607
but you'd better not pull any tricks.

124
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,047
It's a reunion dinner.

125
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:07,568
Don't make it too embarrassing.

126
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:09,287
Of course.

127
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:26,487
In front of Grandma,

128
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:27,688
you'd better be mindful

129
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,807
of what to say

130
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,487
and what not to say.

131
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:33,247
Teach me

132
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:35,008
what not to say.

133
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,128
I shouldn't mention that
her precious grandson

134
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:41,367
has been taken for a fool

135
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:43,607
and overpaid for a piece of land

136
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:45,727
by a whole 400 million yuan.

137
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:49,768
Miss Fang,

138
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:52,727
my grandma asking you to come
is just a courtesy.

139
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:54,247
Actually, you don't have to

140
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,888
force yourself to come.

141
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:58,328
Considering the elderly's kindness

142
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:00,568
and my being so understanding,

143
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:02,008
I can reluctantly oblige myself.

144
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:04,487
Fang Li,

145
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:06,888
is there a particular purpose

146
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:08,247
behind your visit today?

147
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:09,807
How could I?

148
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,128
What bad intentions
could I possibly have?

149
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:15,648
Whenever you have bad intentions,

150
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:16,607
you've this expression.

151
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:21,568
Who are you two?

152
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:23,287
Why are you here at my home?

153
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,247
Xiangyin,

154
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,247
stop fooling around.

155
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,807
You are their aunt.

156
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:36,208
Aunt?

157
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:39,807
Yushen,

158
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:42,528
you were very young
when you last saw her.

159
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:45,167
I guess you don't remember it.

160
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:47,247
It's Lili's first time meeting her.

161
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:48,448
Call her auntie.

162
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:51,128
- Auntie.
- Auntie.

163
00:07:58,008 --> 00:07:58,847
Grandma,

164
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:00,648
she...

165
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:03,167
She had an accident when she was young,

166
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:05,328
and she can't recognize her relatives

167
00:08:05,888 --> 00:08:07,727
just like a child.

168
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:11,607
Where's Nuannuan?

169
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:14,888
What is Nuannuan?

170
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:18,688
Nuannuan is just Nuannuan.

171
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:21,727
Xiangyin, stop looking for it.

172
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:22,487
Let's eat.

173
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:23,607
Xiangyin,

174
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:24,247
here.

175
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,008
Xiangyin,

176
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:27,448
this.

177
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:29,528
Please.

178
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:31,487
Eat up.

179
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:34,727
The youngest child in the family
must be mentally incomplete.

180
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:36,127
The standard setting

181
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:37,808
and plot of the wealthy are so complete.

182
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:40,247
Could she be the hidden boss?

183
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:42,208
Whoever gets her wins, right?

184
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,007
Stop dreaming.

185
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:44,168
It's not your turn anyway.

186
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:46,007
Here.

187
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:48,487
Have carrots.

188
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:49,328
Good for your eyes.

189
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,127
Don't be so blindly confident
in the future.

190
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:55,328
Eat shrimp.

191
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:56,607
Oh,

192
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:57,887
remove the head, okay?

193
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:00,328
Its head is full of junk

194
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,367
like yours.

195
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:03,968
Let me peel it for you.

196
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:04,887
No,

197
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:05,847
I'll do it myself.

198
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:06,968
Don't be so polite.

199
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:07,767
Let me do it.

200
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:08,607
No need.

201
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:13,767
Men should not bully women.

202
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:15,007
Xiangyin,

203
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:16,088
don't be afraid,

204
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,568
Yushen did not bully her.

205
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:18,928
They are a married couple.

206
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:20,688
Married couple?

207
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:23,527
Uh...

208
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:24,527
Uh...

209
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:25,847
Kiss.

210
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:27,568
Only kiss can show that.

211
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:33,168
You are

212
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:33,727
lying.

213
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:35,527
They are not a married couple.

214
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:36,448
Yushen,

215
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:37,928
just coax her.

216
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:39,607
Kiss.

217
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:41,448
You must not lie to me.

218
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:42,408
She must

219
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,688
kiss you.

220
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,367
Kissed.

221
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:52,048
Kissed.

222
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:53,367
That's good.

223
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:56,328
Kiss, kiss.

224
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:56,968
Come on.

225
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:58,408
Kiss.

226
00:09:58,568 --> 00:10:00,048
Go to Iceland.

227
00:10:00,328 --> 00:10:01,887
My brother

228
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:05,688
will take me

229
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:07,487
to Iceland.

230
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:09,247
Holding Nuannuan,

231
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,487
Nuannuan...

232
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:15,048
Where is Nuannuan?

233
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:16,328
Nuannuan.

234
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:17,568
Where is Nuannuan?

235
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:18,607
Where is Nuannuan?

236
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:20,168
No,

237
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:22,527
I can't sleep without Nuannuan.

238
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:23,247
Nuannuan.

239
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:25,527
Nuannuan.

240
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:28,568
It fell behind the sofa.

241
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:29,808
I guessed you'd want this.

242
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:32,247
It's not called "this".

243
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:34,527
It's called Nuannuan.

244
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:35,847
I got it.

245
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:38,727
Nuannuan just told me it's very sleepy

246
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,487
and wanted to sleep.

247
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:42,607
Okay,

248
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:45,568
we'll sleep.

249
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,247
Auntie,

250
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:54,968
where are these postcards from?

251
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:57,767
They are from Iceland.

252
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,328
My brother said

253
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:01,968
he would take me to Iceland
when I grow up.

254
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:03,727
I need to go to sleep quickly

255
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,607
and then I'll grow up.

256
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:06,127
Okay,

257
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:08,088
go to sleep now.

258
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:24,527
Ms. Wu,

259
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:27,367
are Auntie and Mr. An
in a good relationship?

260
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:29,847
Why didn't he come back for
the family reunion dinner?

261
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:31,887
Miss Fang,

262
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:33,448
I don't know about matters

263
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,448
of this.

264
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:36,288
But I think

265
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:38,448
sometimes people who are close

266
00:11:38,727 --> 00:11:40,208
might have their reasons

267
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,928
to deliberately avoid each other,

268
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,168
just like you and the young master.

269
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:50,607
Madam An is waiting for you
in the living room.

270
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:15,408
I just learned to cook

271
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:17,727
Solomon's Seal and Glehnia
pork lung soup.

272
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:19,367
Have a taste.

273
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:21,968
Later.

274
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:52,168
I've been preparing since yesterday.

275
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,928
Can you watch your phone later?

276
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:00,328
If you think cooking is troublesome,

277
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:01,007
you can order

278
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:02,088
whatever you want to eat.

279
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:03,688
I don't want to eat takeout.

280
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:11,607
Luo Yan,

281
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:13,688
I know I don't have much ability

282
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,688
to help you with work-related matters.

283
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,408
But I just want to
take good care of you.

284
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:23,007
Seeing you eat the meals
I cook every day

285
00:13:23,127 --> 00:13:25,007
makes me feel valuable.

286
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:27,367
Lin Lu,

287
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:28,887
don't overthink it.

288
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:30,247
I've really been very busy lately.

289
00:13:33,288 --> 00:13:34,727
I won't hold you up any longer,

290
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,408
but I have a question...

291
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:43,767
Hello, Mr. Li,

292
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:45,767
I'm on my way.

293
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:47,328
See you later.

294
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:50,367
We can talk about it later.

295
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:51,727
I'll meet an important client.

296
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:17,247
(New Message: To Luo Yan)

297
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:18,247
(I want to know)

298
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:19,448
(if you still need me.)

299
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:41,048
Lili,

300
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:42,727
you didn't get scared, did you?

301
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:43,647
No.

302
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:45,647
Auntie did it to protect me.

303
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:46,527
I know that.

304
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:48,688
I think she likes you quite a lot.

305
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,688
Could you spend time
with her more often?

306
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,688
Uh...

307
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:56,328
Grandma,

308
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:57,247
it's time for her

309
00:14:57,247 --> 00:14:58,808
to go back home.

310
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:00,168
Go back home?

311
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,088
This is Lili's home.

312
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:04,487
The kiss Lili gave you just now

313
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:06,487
didn't make you feel her affection?

314
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:12,767
Grandma,

315
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:14,328
it's because you egged her on.

316
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:15,688
Yushen,

317
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:18,288
have you forgotten what I told you?

318
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:21,847
It's too late now

319
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:23,607
and it's not safe for you
to go back alone.

320
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:25,127
Just stay for the night.

321
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:26,168
Be compliant.

322
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:31,847
That doesn't seem proper.

323
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,328
What's wrong with that?

324
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:34,688
Stay here.

325
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:37,367
Alright, Grandma.

326
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:54,127
You wanted to stay on purpose,
didn't you?

327
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:57,208
I can't bear to disappoint your grandma.

328
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:58,408
As for you,

329
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:00,487
you only make me annoyed.

330
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,448
Since you despise me so much,

331
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:05,847
I won't let you sleep in the bed.

332
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:07,288
After all, I've slept in it.

333
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:08,607
I'll sleep

334
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:09,887
on the couch.

335
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,247
But, Mr. An,

336
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:18,487
you've used this blanket, haven't you?

337
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:24,887
Could you please get me a new one?

338
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:25,887
Thank you.

339
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:26,928
Fang Li,

340
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:28,168
this is my home.

341
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:30,568
You're bossing me around.

342
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:32,647
Aren't you overstepping
your role as a guest?

343
00:16:33,048 --> 00:16:34,288
You have a problem?

344
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,367
You can complain to your grandma.

345
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:38,847
I guess

346
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:41,247
Grandma wants you to chase after me.

347
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:44,367
Okay.

348
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:45,847
I'll get it

349
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:49,127
as fulfilling the host's duties.

350
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:51,328
You've got spine.

351
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:53,328
Please hurry up.

352
00:16:58,887 --> 00:16:59,688
I warn you

353
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:00,928
not to touch my things.

354
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:02,367
After coming back, I will check.

355
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,688
(XIA SHANG INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL
DEVELOPMENT PLAN)

356
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:37,968
He wants to build
an international school.

357
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:20,688
(What is he doing?)

358
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:35,928
If you want to sleep in the bed,
just say so.

359
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:37,007
Why pretend to be asleep

360
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:37,928
like a pig?

361
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:53,487
You're like a pig.

362
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:01,184
(Ju'an Group)

363
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:03,487
This is An Yushen's plan.

364
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,047
He bought Yin Zhiluo's land

365
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:06,567
to cooperate with the school.

366
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:08,168
If he really builds this

367
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:09,567
international school,

368
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:11,047
there will be better educational

369
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:12,727
resources around the residential zone,

370
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:14,727
and the price will also double.

371
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:18,727
No wonder he spends 400 million yuan

372
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:20,448
to secure this piece of land.

373
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:23,208
It turns out he planned his next move.

374
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:26,087
But if he hasn't signed the contract,

375
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:28,327
I believe the school authorities
would not refuse

376
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:29,888
a lower construction bid.

377
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:32,287
You mean

378
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,007
to intercept.

379
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,247
An Yushen's finances
are already strained.

380
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,888
So he won't offer a price too low.

381
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:45,608
As long as we secure the school
at a lower price,

382
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:48,007
we can thwart An Yushen's perfect plan.

383
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,928
But our lowest cost price

384
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:51,247
is 35 million yuan.

385
00:19:51,448 --> 00:19:52,448
The price

386
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:54,767
cannot go below this figure.

387
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:57,327
I got it.

388
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,087
In that case,

389
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:00,888
Principal Wei,

390
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:01,888
let's settle on this.

391
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:03,327
The land use rights are free.

392
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,287
The total construction cost
is 50 million yuan,

393
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:06,327
so sign the contract.

394
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:16,287
Principal Wei, don't rush your decision.

395
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,247
You'd compare prices
even when buying clothes.

396
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:20,448
Let alone constructing
such a large school.

397
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:21,767
What are you doing here?

398
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:23,767
We have an appointment with him,

399
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:26,567
because we are also interested
in building school.

400
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:35,208
Lili,

401
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:36,888
there are so many businesses.

402
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:38,247
You cannot always

403
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:39,448
focus on others.

404
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:40,408
Mr. An,

405
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,327
business is won

406
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:43,928
through competition.

407
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,608
If you have the ability,

408
00:20:45,848 --> 00:20:47,408
you can also take on my project.

409
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,287
We have land in the west of the city

410
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:50,567
where we also build a school.

411
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:52,888
Likewise, the land use rights are free.

412
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:55,408
Mr. An is quite insincere

413
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:57,168
with the 50 million yuan.

414
00:20:57,648 --> 00:21:00,007
Mr. Luo has always placed
great emphasis on education.

415
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,807
He will offer you

416
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:03,087
48 million yuan.

417
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:06,767
I thought Mr. Luo had been generous.

418
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:09,928
It turns out the dedication to education

419
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:10,928
is no more than this.

420
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:13,208
I'm willing to

421
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:15,087
go down to 45 million yuan

422
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,727
as a concession for arranging
nutrition for the students.

423
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:20,448
Quibbling over every ounce

424
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:22,168
is really your consistent style.

425
00:21:23,928 --> 00:21:24,727
Principal Wei,

426
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:26,247
for the children,

427
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:29,487
we'll offer 40 million yuan
to save you some budget

428
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:31,168
to add sports facilities.

429
00:21:31,527 --> 00:21:33,648
It seems that Mr. Luo
is determined to succeed.

430
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:36,527
I'm not for profit,

431
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:37,567
but for charity.

432
00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:40,727
I'll offer 35 million yuan.

433
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:46,327
30 million yuan.

434
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,247
Mr. Luo.

435
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:55,368
I concede.

436
00:21:56,408 --> 00:21:57,728
Wish you a pleasant cooperation.

437
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,247
Well.

438
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:08,408
Thanks to you this time,

439
00:22:08,408 --> 00:22:10,208
I was able to know
An Yushen's intentions.

440
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:11,928
He can't turn losses

441
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:12,727
into profits.

442
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:14,648
But the price we offered

443
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:15,888
is far below cost price,

444
00:22:15,888 --> 00:22:17,408
which means losing money.

445
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,648
I don't mind taking a loss,

446
00:22:21,128 --> 00:22:22,408
as long as it can

447
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:24,208
hurt my opponent.

448
00:22:51,476 --> 00:22:53,184
(Unknown Caller)

449
00:22:58,807 --> 00:22:59,888
Hello,

450
00:22:59,888 --> 00:23:00,968
who's speaking?

451
00:23:06,408 --> 00:23:07,487
It's you.

452
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:09,727
It's really you.

453
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:13,928
Mr. Luo.

454
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:19,247
Mr. Luo.

455
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:21,247
That's Secretary Lin's boyfriend.

456
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:25,727
After so many years,

457
00:23:26,408 --> 00:23:27,327
you've grown taller.

458
00:23:27,688 --> 00:23:28,327
Not bad.

459
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:29,527
Let's walk

460
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:30,128
and talk.

461
00:23:30,128 --> 00:23:30,720
Okay.

462
00:23:36,928 --> 00:23:38,368
Am I driving today?

463
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,087
Aside from the previous projects,

464
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:20,727
yesterday, I just

465
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,608
collaborated with
Xia Shang International School

466
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,727
to develop their new campus
in the west side of the city.

467
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,087
But as far as I know,

468
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:30,727
your cooperation with
Xia Shang International School

469
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:32,608
is a loss-making deal, right?

470
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:35,487
Don't worry, Ms. Sun.

471
00:24:36,648 --> 00:24:38,287
My next plan is to

472
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:39,888
develop residential areas

473
00:24:39,888 --> 00:24:41,727
and shopping malls around the school

474
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,487
to create a high-end living circle.

475
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:45,848
That will be a continuous profit chain.

476
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:50,968
Mr. An,

477
00:24:50,968 --> 00:24:52,527
how is the project progressing?

478
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,567
Share it with everyone please.

479
00:24:57,408 --> 00:24:58,688
Let's not talk

480
00:24:58,688 --> 00:25:00,087
about them today.

481
00:25:00,727 --> 00:25:02,007
You have to say something

482
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:03,888
to make the directors know

483
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:06,087
where they've spent

484
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:07,368
the funds.

485
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:09,968
Well, alright.

486
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:11,968
If you want to listen,

487
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,527
I'll just say a few words.

488
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:16,287
I simply have reached a cooperation

489
00:25:16,527 --> 00:25:18,047
with a well-known

490
00:25:18,047 --> 00:25:19,848
amusement park operator, DX,

491
00:25:19,848 --> 00:25:21,368
to establish

492
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,527
a large brand-new theme park.

493
00:25:25,928 --> 00:25:28,168
(Could it be that he never
intended to build a school?)

494
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:30,368
This will be our city's

495
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,648
first large-scale theme resort,

496
00:25:32,848 --> 00:25:34,848
which will drive
the surrounding four cities.

497
00:25:34,848 --> 00:25:36,168
Use Chinese mythological stories

498
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,648
and classic IP as the theme.

499
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:38,888
Upon completion,

500
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:41,536
it's expected to yield annual profits
of over 500 million yuan.

501
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:43,327
By the way,

502
00:25:43,848 --> 00:25:45,688
I also reached a cooperation

503
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:47,287
with Xia Shang International School.

504
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:50,408
The residents of my developed
residential buildings

505
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:51,727
will also enjoy

506
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:53,208
qualification admissions to it.

507
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:54,567
You and...

508
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:18,688
Mr. An,

509
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,767
do you mind if I take a few minutes,
do you?

510
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,408
Of course, Miss Fang,

511
00:26:22,408 --> 00:26:23,527
I don't mind.

512
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:26,208
You and Principal Wei
conspired this, right?

513
00:26:27,408 --> 00:26:28,327
I promised

514
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:30,408
to find him the lowest-priced organizer,

515
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:32,968
and he promised to provide me
with admission qualifications.

516
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:34,968
What a coincidence,

517
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,648
such a low-priced organizer

518
00:26:36,648 --> 00:26:37,648
turns out to be Mr. Luo.

519
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,247
Thanks to Mr. Luo.

520
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:42,287
You had the trap early,
waiting for me to fall into it.

521
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:45,087
I don't understand what you mean.

522
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:46,128
What kind of trap?

523
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:47,848
The file in your cabinet...

524
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,848
Could it be that you didn't

525
00:26:51,848 --> 00:26:53,287
listen to me and rummaged

526
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:54,888
through my things?

527
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:59,047
I'm sorry for having you
pass on wrong information.

528
00:26:59,408 --> 00:27:00,368
But Lili,

529
00:27:00,848 --> 00:27:02,567
didn't I remind you before?

530
00:27:02,928 --> 00:27:04,368
Why are you so disobedient?

531
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:13,247
You've got crow's feet.

532
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:15,087
Are you always staying up late?

533
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:17,567
An Hang.

534
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:18,688
But it doesn't matter.

535
00:27:18,688 --> 00:27:20,007
I'll ask Aotian

536
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:22,727
if there are any anti-wrinkle items.

537
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:23,567
Bye-bye.

538
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:36,567
Aotian.

539
00:27:37,168 --> 00:27:37,727
I'm here.

540
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:39,608
Are there beauty filters in the system?

541
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:41,208
There really aren't any.

542
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,208
Impossible.

543
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,327
You must be joking.

544
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:48,047
Please regain your senses.

545
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:49,368
Am I not sensible?

546
00:27:49,608 --> 00:27:50,487
I am very sensible.

547
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:51,848
If there is

548
00:27:51,848 --> 00:27:53,448
no beauty filter, I won't play anymore.

549
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:54,527
I might as well die here.

550
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:55,608
If you compensate me,

551
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:56,688
I'll make a gain.

552
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:57,368
How's that?

553
00:27:57,648 --> 00:27:58,888
You must be strong.

554
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:00,047
Don't tell me to be strong.

555
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:01,688
I just want to enable a beauty filter.
