=Episode 3=

3
00:00:54,464 --> 00:00:55,144
First of all,

4
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:57,144
I learnt another investor facing

5
00:00:57,545 --> 00:00:59,265
(Interactive Entertainment)
capital flow issues.

6
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:00,985
While our investment funds

7
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:02,344
can be transferred at any moment.

8
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:04,584
This...

9
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,385
Of course,

10
00:01:05,985 --> 00:01:08,784
fundraising is inherently
a matter of mutual choice.

11
00:01:09,105 --> 00:01:10,584
I can understand your hesitation.

12
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:12,985
After all, to be on the safe side,

13
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:15,905
I've looked into competitors that
launched games similar to yours.

14
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,185
If our collaboration doesn't succeed,

15
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:20,864
I will invest in them

16
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:23,105
and support them
with all my industry resources.

17
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:27,825
Just kidding.

18
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:30,064
Of course, I hope we are teammates,

19
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:31,064
not competitors.

20
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:31,704
Right?

21
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,265
(I didn't expect
a long trapping in the system.)

22
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:40,864
(Luckily, I'm about to get out.)

23
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,465
(I wonder how my competitor is doing)

24
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,665
(on the outside.)

25
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:52,185
An Yushen,

26
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,224
didn't you just agree with me

27
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:55,144
to back out?

28
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:58,385
Actually, that was my initial thought.

29
00:01:58,905 --> 00:01:59,825
But today,

30
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,504
seeing my grandma clap for me,

31
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:02,905
I suddenly thought

32
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:04,265
that I should try once more.

33
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,344
If I run away, I don't deserve

34
00:02:06,424 --> 00:02:07,625
to bring you happiness.

35
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:08,304
You deserve it!

36
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:09,624
Who says you don't deserve it?

37
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:11,424
I regard money as muck.

38
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,785
I want to leave here with you
and have our private time.

39
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:15,704
(This NPC)

40
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:17,704
(has been madly in love
with me since yesterday.)

41
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:19,265
(I didn't expect this.)

42
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:21,024
(Forget it.)

43
00:02:21,904 --> 00:02:23,024
(Give her what she wants)

44
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:24,345
(to shut her up.)

45
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:27,424
Staying with the An family

46
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:28,945
isn't inconvenient at all.

47
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:31,385
As long as Miss Fang has this intention,

48
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:33,144
we can always have our private time.

49
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:33,584
Stop!

50
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:40,345
There's no rush, actually.

51
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:45,584
Please don't be mad at me anymore.

52
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:47,024
Don't you wish me

53
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:48,505
to become Grandma's pride?

54
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,184
How could I not?

55
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:54,144
I'm just worried

56
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:55,904
that in the complicated Ju'an Group,

57
00:02:55,904 --> 00:02:57,985
as a kind-hearted boy,

58
00:02:58,304 --> 00:02:59,785
you might not be able to handle it.

59
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:01,584
Only by trying will you really know.

60
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:03,184
As for me,

61
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,225
I don't care the result,

62
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:05,825
as long as I have tried my best.

63
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:08,144
That's true.

64
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:10,065
It's getting late.

65
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:10,864
Let's head back.

66
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:12,225
Okay.

67
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:13,904
(He's definitely pretending.)

68
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:15,545
(I've been found out.)

69
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:17,385
(Let me wait and see.)

70
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:31,225
Aotian.

71
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:32,385
What's up?

72
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:33,385
Is there a way for NPC

73
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:34,624
to tell the truth?

74
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:36,744
No such items.

75
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:37,825
Also,

76
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:38,864
players in the game

77
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:41,065
have only one chance
to use an item each day.

78
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:42,704
Only once?

79
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:45,385
Dad.

80
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:47,304
Dad,

81
00:03:47,464 --> 00:03:48,105
aren't you

82
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:49,624
announcing An Yushen's departure?

83
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:50,864
Why didn't you...

84
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,464
Yushen just made the announcement

85
00:03:57,464 --> 00:03:58,624
to strive for it once.

86
00:03:59,184 --> 00:04:00,545
You made me do it in front of all.

87
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:01,505
How could I say it?

88
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:03,985
Want to disgrace our family publicly?

89
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:08,424
I understood, Dad.

90
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:14,024
Wait a bit.

91
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:15,665
If it's yours,

92
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:17,824
it will eventually be yours.

93
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:42,105
Morning.

94
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:42,985
Morning.

95
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:48,744
Yushen,

96
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:50,864
don't eat so many sweet food.

97
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:52,064
Try this quickly.

98
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:55,264
This is your favorite Xiaolongbao

99
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:57,264
made especially by a chef
from Yangcheng.

100
00:04:57,585 --> 00:04:58,424
Thank you, Grandma.

101
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:00,545
You attended a business banquet

102
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:01,944
for the first time yesterday,

103
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:03,424
and you performed so well.

104
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,624
You have worked hard.

105
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:08,504
Have

106
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:10,785
more pork sausages.

107
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:13,304
After all, you have to play dumb.

108
00:05:16,905 --> 00:05:17,624
Lili,

109
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:20,944
are you mocking me?

110
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:23,025
Are you still angry?

111
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:25,184
Fang Lili,

112
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:26,864
why are you angry?

113
00:05:26,944 --> 00:05:28,105
What did my grandson do?

114
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:28,824
Grandma,

115
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:30,944
It's not her fault.

116
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:31,905
It's my fault.

117
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:34,744
(You pretend to be innocent again.)

118
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,545
Today, all branches shall

119
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:39,864
submit their quarterly reports.

120
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:42,545
You have never completed it before.

121
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:44,064
I have never minded.

122
00:05:44,384 --> 00:05:45,624
But yesterday, since you said

123
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:47,785
that you want to compete
for the inheritance rights,

124
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:49,665
you should show your efforts.

125
00:05:50,064 --> 00:05:51,384
Today, I will having a meeting

126
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,064
with the boards in Crab Island resort.

127
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:54,824
Deliver the report before 6 PM.

128
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:56,025
Of course,

129
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,465
you can still choose not to submit it.

130
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:00,424
But from now on,

131
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:04,504
do not brag about
competing with Luo Yan.

132
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:06,384
Such matters

133
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:08,424
should be left to the managers.

134
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:10,064
Why make it difficult for Yushen?

135
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:11,145
Right.

136
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,824
And it's due today.

137
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:14,064
You don't have enough time.

138
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:14,905
Yushen,

139
00:06:15,184 --> 00:06:16,465
it's better to forget about it.

140
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:18,304
No problem.

141
00:06:19,384 --> 00:06:20,145
I can submit it.

142
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:28,064
Okay.

143
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:43,304
Wait for me.

144
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:43,944
I'll go too.

145
00:06:46,384 --> 00:06:47,624
Going to work with me

146
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:49,465
doesn't seem quite appropriate.

147
00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:51,384
I can't stop worrying about you.

148
00:06:51,824 --> 00:06:54,145
I can help you out in the company, too.

149
00:06:54,504 --> 00:06:55,665
But Miss Fang,

150
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:57,864
with your ability to make

151
00:06:57,864 --> 00:06:59,064
the Fang Group go bankrupt,

152
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:00,944
you probably
won't be able to help me much.

153
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:02,785
Yushen,

154
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:06,025
I will definitely
go to the company today.

155
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:07,624
Why?

156
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:08,985
Because I am your LP.

157
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:10,064
LP?

158
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:11,985
Miss Fang,

159
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,624
we haven't held a wedding yet.

160
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:15,985
What are you thinking about?

161
00:07:16,665 --> 00:07:19,504
I mean "limited partner".

162
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:20,624
Financier.

163
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:22,665
You took my investment of fifty million.

164
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:25,264
I have the right
to understand the company's operations.

165
00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:41,105
Feng,

166
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:42,424
wait a moment.

167
00:07:50,424 --> 00:07:51,184
Young An,

168
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:52,824
Grandma said there's rain and let me

169
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:53,824
give you an umbrella.

170
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:55,105
Thank you.

171
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:56,665
Feng,

172
00:07:56,665 --> 00:07:57,624
this one is for you.

173
00:07:58,785 --> 00:07:59,384
Thank you.

174
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:00,944
I'm off to work first.

175
00:08:00,944 --> 00:08:01,665
See you in a bit.

176
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:02,985
Okay.

177
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:10,424
Isn't Lin Lu going?

178
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:11,624
She doesn't get in.

179
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:14,424
She's the secretary of the CEO's office.

180
00:08:14,424 --> 00:08:15,944
It's not appropriate to ride with me.

181
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:16,624
To avoid doubt.

182
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,624
She's quite sensible.

183
00:08:19,864 --> 00:08:20,864
When she was young,

184
00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:22,465
her parents both died in a car accident.

185
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,624
Grandma has taken her in at our home.

186
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:27,864
Children who have suffered
tend to be sensible.

187
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:18,465
(Shut up.)

188
00:09:18,664 --> 00:09:19,544
(Understand?)

189
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:20,585
Lu,

190
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:22,544
I've led you
since you joined the company.

191
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:24,425
I treat you as my own younger sister.

192
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:26,384
I'm only telling you this.

193
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:28,945
Luo Yan is ingrateful guy.

194
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:30,425
He used me and then discarded me.

195
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,425
In the safe at my workstation,

196
00:09:32,624 --> 00:09:33,784
there is a file.

197
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:35,624
Luo Yan's dirt is in it.

198
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:38,425
I guarantee once An Xiangyang sees it,

199
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,624
he will
disown him as his illegitimate child.

200
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:41,585
Lu,

201
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:43,504
go and get it for me.

202
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:44,544
After

203
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,945
getting rid of Luo Yan,

204
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:47,705
at Madam An's place,

205
00:09:47,705 --> 00:09:49,305
you will certainly be credited for this.

206
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:51,784
Okay.

207
00:09:52,544 --> 00:09:53,784
What is the password?

208
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:55,185
6557.

209
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:02,504
Lin Lu.

210
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:05,425
Miss Fang.

211
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:07,384
Do you need me for something?

212
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:08,705
I have something to ask you.

213
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:10,945
Did you grow up with An Yushen

214
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,384
in the An family?

215
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:15,664
Yes.

216
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:17,305
What's the matter?

217
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:19,705
Well,

218
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:22,305
was An Yushen as ambitious as he is now?

219
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:28,105
Young An is easy to get along with.

220
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:29,264
But

221
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:31,425
he is not very interested in work.

222
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:32,945
Since the last time he

223
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:33,904
clicked the wrong mouse,

224
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:35,825
which led to the loss of 100 million,

225
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:37,504
Mr. An scolded him.

226
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:39,345
He has been afraid to come to work.

227
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,024
(As expected.)

228
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:43,705
(I knew there must be
something wrong with Yushen.)

229
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:45,825
Got it. Thank you.

230
00:10:53,563 --> 00:10:56,576
(Art Property Town Operation Project)

231
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:07,105
As for the Operation Project, there are

232
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:08,105
three points.

233
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:08,864
Firstly...

234
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:18,065
It seems everyone is busy.

235
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:20,264
How about
I directly show the report to Young An.

236
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:22,105
I have a meeting later.

237
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:22,945
I'll leave first.

238
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:23,744
Wait a moment.

239
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,985
Anyway, I can't understand reports.

240
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:27,105
Just give

241
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:28,264
verbal reports.

242
00:11:28,585 --> 00:11:29,705
You don't even know these.

243
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:30,864
So useless.

244
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:40,744
The Art Town Operation Project...

245
00:11:40,744 --> 00:11:41,945
Is it self-operated?

246
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:43,465
Yes.

247
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:45,465
What is
the ownership ratio of the company?

248
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:48,864
It's under negotiation.

249
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:50,744
What is
the income structure of the business?

250
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:55,345
I'll consider it later on.

251
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:56,945
Did you check out the original company?

252
00:11:57,465 --> 00:11:58,105
Not yet.

253
00:11:58,105 --> 00:11:59,825
As for acquisition
and consolidation dates,

254
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:00,744
how to arrange them?

255
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:02,105
Is it suspected of transiting?

256
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:03,585
Is upcoming IPO planned?

257
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:07,105
You don't even know these.

258
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:09,185
Truly useless.

259
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:14,225
Call HR later to process

260
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:15,345
the resignation.

261
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:16,624
Hurry up and leave.

262
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:17,744
Young An, I...

263
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:18,345
Additionally,

264
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:20,465
this report

265
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:22,065
has incomplete data.

266
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:24,225
After ten minutes,

267
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:26,264
no one noticed.

268
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:28,264
(You finally showed your true colors.)

269
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:30,705
(I want to see what you are capable of.)

270
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:34,065
What are these documents?

271
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:36,425
The reports Young An will need later.

272
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,465
(You are quite an expert.)

273
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:42,624
The group is downsizing.

274
00:12:43,585 --> 00:12:45,825
Given everyone's capabilities,

275
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:48,105
downsizing is inevitable.

276
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:51,744
Mr. Luo,

277
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:53,465
An Yushen did not use

278
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:54,744
the incorrect data I gave him,

279
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,225
nor did he adopt the managers'

280
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:57,465
fake business reports.

281
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,264
Now what should we do?

282
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,345
He has indeed made some progress.

283
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:05,744
But it's just him comparing to himself.

284
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:08,705
Let him do the quarterly report.

285
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:10,345
When it comes to reporting,

286
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:11,585
compared with me,

287
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,825
he will still be a useless one.

288
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:18,624
(Women's Restroom)

289
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,185
(An Yushen)

290
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,065
(can't go to Crab Island.)

291
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:26,664
(Otherwise, Luo Yan
will look like a useless one.)

292
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:29,544
Aotian.

293
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:30,544
Yes?

294
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:32,425
I'll boost your results.

295
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:33,185
Buy props.

(Obedience Charm, Functional Drink, Doom
Scarf, Mary Sue Ring, Character Mask)

297

(Doom Scarf)

298
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:41,264
Are you sure

299
00:13:41,264 --> 00:13:42,504
to buy the Doom Scarf?

300
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:43,105
Yes.

301
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:49,105
An Yushen,

302
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:52,585
heading to the Island?

303
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:54,705
It's safer to go earlier.

304
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:58,345
Nights are cold.
I've prepared a scarf.

305
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:04,945
Look at you.

306
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,345
You're dressed so lightly.

307
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:08,185
I'm leaving.

308
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:08,945
Hurry back.

309
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:14,825
Wait a moment.

310
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:17,864
Sorry.

311
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:18,744
I am so sorry.

312
00:14:18,744 --> 00:14:19,345
It's okay.

313
00:14:21,384 --> 00:14:21,825
Be careful.

314
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:24,425
Sorry.

315
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:25,185
Sorry.

316
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:33,744
Aotian.

317
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:34,585
What's up?

318
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:35,744
How much longer for Scarf?

319
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:37,425
Four hours.

320
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:54,664
Drive faster.
Catch up with Young An's car.

321
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:56,705
Don't dawdle.

322
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:57,705
Drive when I tell you to.

323
00:14:57,705 --> 00:14:59,345
I am the future lady boss of Ju'an.

324
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:01,185
Lady boss?

325
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:02,825
How come I don't know?

326
00:15:06,985 --> 00:15:07,985
What a coincidence, Luo.

327
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:08,985
It's you.

328
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:14,384
Excuse me.

329
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:15,504
Sorry.

330
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:29,345
Luo Lei, go help her.

331
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:37,465
Mr. Luo,

332
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,465
the locks seem to be broken.

333
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:41,544
Drive straight to
the 4S shop to pick the locks.

334
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:42,225
Okay.

335
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:56,945
Mr. Luo,

336
00:15:57,585 --> 00:15:59,425
the tires have also blown out.

337
00:16:15,744 --> 00:16:16,225
Mr. Luo,

338
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:17,744
shall I call a tow truck then?

339
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:33,425
Fang Lili,

340
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:35,384
don't let me see you again.

341
00:16:51,225 --> 00:16:53,345
(No matter
what flaws An Yushen has revealed,)

342
00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:54,864
(he's too much of a hindrance.)

343
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:58,144
Aotian.

344
00:16:58,825 --> 00:16:59,225
Yes.

345
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,465
Is there any way

346
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:02,384
to erase a character from the program?

347
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:05,824
Erasing on a physical level

348
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,185
is still effective
for the character in the program.

349
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:28,064
Yes, Mr. An.

350
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:29,824
Mr. An,

351
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,705
in today's meeting,

352
00:17:31,945 --> 00:17:33,784
I really didn't mean to be late.

353
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:37,744
I know.

354
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,064
Sorry, Mr. An.

355
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:03,824
Haven't I told you

356
00:18:03,824 --> 00:18:05,225
not to look for me at the company?

357
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:08,024
Rest assured.

358
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:09,385
They've all gone off work.

359
00:18:09,665 --> 00:18:11,064
What happened to you?

360
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,945
What did Mr. An say to you?

361
00:18:16,744 --> 00:18:17,905
He merely told me

362
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,064
he doesn't have just me as his son.

363
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,425
I've waited for so many years.

364
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:26,264
He told me this.

365
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:28,945
Please leave.

366
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:30,705
Don't let it happen again.

367
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:35,625
I thought today I wouldn't

368
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,985
hear anything effective.

369
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:38,185
Unexpectedly,

370
00:18:38,905 --> 00:18:41,145
you introduced
the past situation of the branch

371
00:18:41,145 --> 00:18:43,145
clearly and thoroughly.

372
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:46,465
And you've made a plan
for the next three years.

373
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:48,985
Dad.

374
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:50,304
If there's nothing else,

375
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:51,225
I will take my leave.

376
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:52,544
You go ahead.

377
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:53,824
Let's go.

378
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,474
(Miss Fang)

379
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:07,625
Hello?

380
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:08,665
Hello.

381
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:10,665
I heard you did well this afternoon.

382
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:11,945
Let's celebrate tonight.

383
00:19:13,304 --> 00:19:15,705
I still have wrapping-up work here.

384
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:17,744
I might not be able to get back today.

385
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:19,945
I've already arrived at your place.

386
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:21,465
But I'm a bit lost.

387
00:19:21,465 --> 00:19:22,504
I'm by a lake.

388
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,985
Could you come and pick me up?

389
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:25,504
My phone's dying.

390
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:26,625
Please hurry.

391
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:27,304
I...

392
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:33,024
(How long does
this woman plan to pester me?)

393
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:43,945
Forget it.

394
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:44,945
My fault.

395
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:53,024
Miss Fang.

396
00:19:59,024 --> 00:19:59,905
Miss Fang.

397
00:21:23,968 --> 00:21:25,914
(An Yushen)

398
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,608
(An Yushen)

399
00:21:37,544 --> 00:21:38,584
Where are you?

400
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:40,905
I looked for you at the lakeside,

401
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:41,865
and I didn't see you.

402
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:43,968
You didn't answer the phone.

403
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:48,465
I've found my way.

404
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:50,104
I just charged my phone.

405
00:21:50,705 --> 00:21:51,225
Alright.

406
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,504
Go to my room.

407
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,145
I'll text you the room number.

408
00:21:55,504 --> 00:21:56,225
Hang up first.

409
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:57,185
See you in a bit.

410
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:45,744
It's so cold.

411
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:46,665
You wear so little.

412
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:51,024
I need to dress up for a date.

413
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:54,064
Come in.

414
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:07,064
I just wanted to help you
put down your bag.

415
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:08,985
Why are you so nervous?

416
00:23:11,544 --> 00:23:12,225
Is there

417
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,145
something hidden?

418
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:19,665
A love potion is hidden in it.

419
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:21,385
You'll try the effects later.

420
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:29,425
Come in.

421
00:23:46,504 --> 00:23:47,784
Dinner is ready.

422
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:49,024
So considerate.

423
00:23:51,185 --> 00:23:52,104
It's a date, after all.

424
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:53,744
Basic etiquette.

425
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:58,225
The bread is still warm.

426
00:23:58,544 --> 00:23:59,465
Just out of the oven?

427
00:24:00,985 --> 00:24:01,544
Yes.

428
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:04,544
Bread should be eaten while it's hot.

429
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:06,145
Throw it into the soup.

430
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:09,705
It tastes best.

431
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:27,504
I love steak the most.

432
00:24:27,504 --> 00:24:28,304
How about we...

433
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:37,264
Miss Fang, just tell me

434
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:38,945
what you would like to eat.

435
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:41,064
The knife is dangerous.

436
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:43,225
Be careful.

437
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:03,264
It tastes good.

438
00:25:04,264 --> 00:25:06,945
But it's more fun
to cut the meat by myself.

439
00:25:21,264 --> 00:25:23,024
Miss Fang, enjoy

440
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:24,264
the pleasure of cutting steak.

441
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:25,824
I prepare some fruit for you.

442
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,665
Could Miss Fang do me a favor?

443
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:55,064
Go to the box behind you

444
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:56,465
and get me a band-aid.

445
00:26:02,064 --> 00:26:02,544
Of course.

446
00:26:36,465 --> 00:26:38,064
Could you help me put it on?

447
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:40,705
On the back of my neck.

448
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:50,425
Aren't you curious about

449
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:51,625
how I got hurt?

450
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:56,064
How did you get hurt?

451
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:02,985
I don't know either.

452
00:27:04,145 --> 00:27:06,185
I blacked out at the lakeside

453
00:27:07,064 --> 00:27:08,145
and fell into the water.

454
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:17,264
That's so strange.

455
00:27:17,905 --> 00:27:18,865
Luckily, you're fine.

456
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:24,905
Right.

457
00:27:29,264 --> 00:27:30,425
Thankfully, I'm okay.

458
00:27:38,945 --> 00:27:39,905
Aotian.

459
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:49,264
Who?

460
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:50,185
Hello.

461
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:51,104
Room service.

462
00:27:51,824 --> 00:27:52,504
- Come in.
- Out.

463
00:27:58,945 --> 00:27:59,504
Mr. An,

464
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:00,744
a document for you.

465
00:28:39,504 --> 00:28:41,744
I don't care why you want to kill me.

466
00:28:42,465 --> 00:28:44,185
You went to a lot of trouble.

467
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:47,304
Can you think it through?

468
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:49,865
Who would tie up Party A here?

469
00:28:53,544 --> 00:28:54,985
I don't care who wants to kill me.

470
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:55,784
I will pay double.

471
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:56,264
Let me go.

472
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,064
I will pay triple.

473
00:28:59,744 --> 00:29:00,225
Let me go,

474
00:29:00,225 --> 00:29:00,945
and then kill him.

475
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:01,824
Ten times.

476
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,824
Let me go and kill her.

477
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:03,985
Twenty times.

478
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:05,225
Stop arguing.

479
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:08,145
We are professionals.

480
00:29:08,905 --> 00:29:10,024
You're not Party A.

481
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:13,744
Party A wants you both dead.

482
00:29:14,744 --> 00:29:16,304
After the gasoline arrives,

483
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:19,145
I'll burn you to death.

484
00:29:21,744 --> 00:29:22,225
Go.

485
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:35,784
That's outrageous.

486
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:37,824
As a bankrupt lovesick girl,

487
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:39,024
I even have enemies.

488
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:41,744
So you blame me,

489
00:29:42,225 --> 00:29:43,985
a castoff from a wealthy family.

490
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:45,784
"Castoff" is an understatement.

491
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:47,625
You're a wolf in sheep's clothing.

492
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:48,625
Likewise.

493
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:51,064
You didn't hesitate when you killed me.

494
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:54,425
I didn't kill you.

495
00:29:54,865 --> 00:29:55,665
I fixed errors.

496
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,304
You shouldn't have stayed
with the An family yesterday.

497
00:29:59,304 --> 00:30:00,225
Do you understand?

498
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:00,945
Understood.

499
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:02,744
I don't elope with you,

500
00:30:02,744 --> 00:30:03,945
so you want to ruin me.

501
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:05,504
It makes sense.

502
00:30:05,985 --> 00:30:07,504
The logic of a crazy woman's actions.

503
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:08,625
What?

504
00:30:08,945 --> 00:30:09,544
No.

505
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:10,744
No need to explain.

506
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:12,145
Unnecessary.

507
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:24,225
Hand.

508
00:30:24,225 --> 00:30:25,945
Give me your hand for a moment.

509
00:30:26,264 --> 00:30:26,625
Quick.

510
00:30:26,744 --> 00:30:27,225
Hurry up.

511
00:30:27,544 --> 00:30:28,385
Here.

512
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:32,225
I have a lighter in my pocket.

513
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:42,145
Move closer.

514
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:00,185
I can't reach it. You do it.

515
00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:11,625
It might hurt a little.

516
00:31:12,064 --> 00:31:12,945
Don't be afraid.

517
00:31:14,024 --> 00:31:15,544
Burn slightly to break free.

518
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:31,945
Deception is fair here.

519
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:33,185
I'll go ahead.

520
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,544
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

521
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:45,632
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

522
00:31:46,344 --> 00:31:47,905
Are you kidding me?

523
00:31:48,304 --> 00:31:49,744
Can you handle five people alone?

524
00:31:50,264 --> 00:31:51,504
Hurry up and untie me!

525
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:52,945
Open the door!

526
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:53,504
Hurry up!

527
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:54,385
Open the door!

528
00:31:56,264 --> 00:31:57,064
Open the door!

529
00:31:57,744 --> 00:31:58,544
Quickly.

530
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:00,425
I know. Stop making noise.

531
00:32:01,385 --> 00:32:02,185
Hurry up!

532
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:02,865
Open the door!

533
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:03,584
Open the door!

534
00:32:04,264 --> 00:32:05,104
Do you hear me?

535
00:32:05,104 --> 00:32:05,784
Open the door!

536
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:06,584
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

537
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:07,465
Open the door!

538
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:08,185
Hurry up!

539
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:11,185
Open the door!

540
00:32:11,185 --> 00:32:12,064
If you hide,

541
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,145
I'll still burn you.

542
00:32:13,145 --> 00:32:14,705
(I didn't want to reveal I'm a player.)

543
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:16,225
(Forget it.)

544
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:17,225
(Let Aotian help.)

545
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:19,465
(Deal with the matter first.)

546
00:32:19,744 --> 00:32:20,465
(Fool her later)

547
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:21,385
(about Aotian.)

548
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,504
- Aotian.
- Aotian.

549
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:24,625
I'm here.

550
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:27,824
- You're a real person too.
- You're a real person too.

551
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,145
Open the door!

552
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:29,784
Open the door!

553
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:30,865
Since we are all people,

554
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,304
why not collaborate?

555
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:32,985
Agree.

556
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:33,985

00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:28,104
I've got it.

573
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:33,865
The meal is ready.

574
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:34,865
Hungry?

575
00:33:39,145 --> 00:33:40,784
The people you hired without telling me

576
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:43,104
have been dealt with by An Yushen.

577
00:33:44,784 --> 00:33:45,865
Haven't I said it before?

578
00:33:46,185 --> 00:33:47,544
You don't need to intervene in it.

579
00:33:48,304 --> 00:33:49,744
You want him to disappear.

580
00:33:51,584 --> 00:33:52,905
Then I will make him disappear.

581
00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:55,185
You can be CEO of Ju'an at ease.

582
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:57,145
I'll handle what you don't want to.

583
00:33:57,945 --> 00:33:59,385
Don't let me hear it.

584
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:00,865
I only say it once.

585
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:04,304
No matter what,
it must not result in loss of life.

586
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:18,745
Let's get acquainted.

587
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:19,785
An Hang.

588
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:22,945
Fang Li.

589
00:34:24,184 --> 00:34:25,224
So you are the competitor

590
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:27,624
who intercepted my project halfway.

591
00:34:30,624 --> 00:34:32,144
Before the contract is signed,

592
00:34:32,385 --> 00:34:33,305
everything is possible.

593
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:35,785
It's the interesting part of business.

594
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:38,144
But I have to tell you that

595
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:39,945
I have never been defeated.

596
00:34:42,024 --> 00:34:43,584
Don't speak too confidently.

597
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:46,905
I'm known as "Wild Wolf"
in investing field.

598
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,905
As long as it's the prey I choose,

599
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:50,584
I won't let it go.

600
00:34:51,345 --> 00:34:52,745
If anyone competes with me,

601
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:54,425
I will tear them apart.

602
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:56,104
Miss Fang,

603
00:34:56,865 --> 00:34:58,144
as for competing for the rights,

604
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,265
let's discuss it outside.

605
00:35:00,584 --> 00:35:02,184
Since we're all stuck here,

606
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:04,224
why not be a bit more candid?

607
00:35:05,425 --> 00:35:07,825
My goal is to preside over Ju'an.

608
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:09,024
And yours?

609
00:35:09,544 --> 00:35:09,945
Also,

610
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:11,905
why do you want to kill me?

611
00:35:12,345 --> 00:35:14,385
(This person doesn't look trustworthy.)

612
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,184
(No need to tell the truth.)

613
00:35:18,425 --> 00:35:20,945
My aim is to double Ju'an's profits.

614
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:23,064
I thought you were a fool before.

615
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:25,305
I didn't want you
to be the CEO and hold me back.

616
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,544
The methods were a bit extreme.

617
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:28,544
Sorry.

618
00:35:30,465 --> 00:35:31,224
It's okay.

619
00:35:32,184 --> 00:35:33,305
Since we are the same,

620
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:35,745
let's find a way out together.

621
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:38,504
You can only get out
by completing the mission.

622
00:35:38,905 --> 00:35:39,905
Don't you know it?

623
00:35:41,345 --> 00:35:43,224
Smart people
don't have to follow the rules.

624
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:44,385
Just break the rules.

625
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:45,825
What do you mean?

626
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:47,985
Let's

627
00:35:51,664 --> 00:35:52,825
