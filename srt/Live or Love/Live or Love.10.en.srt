=Live or Love?=

3
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:52,224
=Episode 10=

4
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:01,957
Why do you need me?

5
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:06,756
Congratulations.

6
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:09,637
You boosted Longxing's performance.

7
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:12,157
The company issued commendation.

8
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:15,316
But

9
00:01:16,237 --> 00:01:17,877
someone told me something.

10
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:24,036
Take a look.

11
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:28,032
(An Yushen pledged his shares.)

12
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:29,196
(Reason?)
(Running a supermarket.)

13
00:01:29,196 --> 00:01:31,276
An Yushen pledged his Ju'an shares

14
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:32,717
to run a supermarket?

15
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:34,316
Has he gone mad?

16
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:37,597
Mortgaging company assets privately.

17
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,276
This is betraying the company.

18
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:43,877
This time,

19
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:46,437
even An Liminghui can't save him.

20
00:01:48,597 --> 00:01:49,396
So,

21
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:51,877
this is why you asked me to help him?

22
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,957
Steal his mortgage deed for me.

23
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:57,196
At the next shareholder meeting,

24
00:01:58,157 --> 00:01:59,517
I'll kick him out of Ju'an,

25
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:01,877
even the An family.

26
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:05,077
Do you have to be so ruthless?

27
00:02:07,476 --> 00:02:08,357
Feel sorry for him?

28
00:02:15,357 --> 00:02:16,156
In the afternoon,

29
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:17,917
I will go out with Mr. An.

30
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:20,556
I hope by the time I return,

31
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:22,077
you will have succeeded.

32
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:28,957
Go on.

33
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:30,876
You also want him to leave sooner,

34
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:33,396
right?

35
00:02:46,077 --> 00:02:48,037
(Why isn't she reacting to me?)

36
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,317
(Am I too passionate?)

37
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:52,797
(Does she like it cool and aloof?)

38
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,116
(She definitely still feels insecure.)

39
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,556
(I need to be a bit tougher.)

40
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:11,676
Did you get it?

41
00:03:27,237 --> 00:03:28,357
The quality is not bad.

42
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,996
But this ring's slogan,

43
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:32,317
isn't it a bit too exaggerated?

44
00:03:32,757 --> 00:03:34,396
Anyone would be moved by her?

45
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:36,436
Young An,

46
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:37,917
I just now

47
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:39,556
tried it on at the scene.

48
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:42,197
Very happy.

49
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:14,272
(Share Pledge)

50
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:18,656
(Share Pledge Agreement)

51
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:20,276
This fool.

52
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,396
What are you doing here?

53
00:04:34,596 --> 00:04:35,677
I was looking for you.

54
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:37,356
I...

55
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:39,077
I went to the restroom.

56
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:42,396
All good at the company?

57
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:43,637
Then I'm going home.

58
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:44,476
Wait a moment.

59
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:47,716
Are you free tonight?

60
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:49,156
Do you have any plans?

61
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:50,997
How about

62
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:53,197
we go on a date?

63
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:58,077
I mean, the two of us

64
00:04:58,077 --> 00:05:00,036
have a one-on-one meeting,

65
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,396
to review some work experiences.

66
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:04,716
Sounds good.

67
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:06,197
Then see you tonight.

68
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:07,156
Fang Li,

69
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,916
I've always felt that

70
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,596
the wedding was arranged too hastily.

71
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:15,276
You've been wearing a faux diamond ring.

72
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:16,677
We've made some money.

73
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:18,716
So I bought you a real one.

74
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,557
(What kind of expression is that?)

75
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,637
(Sure, you can't win Fang Li over)

76
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:27,916
(with just a diamond ring.)

77
00:05:31,677 --> 00:05:32,317
Alright.

78
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:33,716
Then put it on me.

79
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:36,596
(I was wrong!)

80
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:41,957
Wedding ring, should be the other hand.

81
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:45,637
My foot hurts.

82
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,796
Foot?

83
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:47,716
Your foot hurts?

84
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:48,608
Foot...

85
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:53,236
My foot is a bit sore.

86
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,396
Let me lean on you.

87
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:58,077
(Her foot is fine.)

88
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:01,036
(Could it be she wants to get close?)

89
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:04,156
- Fang Li...
- Don't move!

90
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,276
Put it on me.

91
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:14,317
(This diamond ring)

92
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:15,997
(it's more than worth it!)

93
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:26,156
Thank you.

94
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:27,476
I really like it.

95
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:29,356
Fang Li,

96
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:31,077
actually, I...

97
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,796
An Hang,

98
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:52,716
get out.

99
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:56,877
Out!

100
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:03,517
Fang Li...

101
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:04,156
Get out!

102
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:04,877
Alright.

103
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,276
What?

104
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,077
What was I thinking?

105
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,117
How could I believe

106
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:20,997
a diamond ring would have such effects?

107
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:41,476
Thank you, Feng,

108
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:42,517
back to volunteer again.

109
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:44,077
You've been a great help to us.

110
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:44,957
It's okay.

111
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:45,557
I'm not rich,

112
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:46,236
but I'm strong.

113
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:47,036
Whatever you need.

114
00:07:48,197 --> 00:07:49,317
Don't worry about money.

115
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:50,877
We are relatively well-off.

116
00:07:51,077 --> 00:07:51,648
That's right.

117
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:53,117
The generous sponsor

118
00:07:53,117 --> 00:07:54,596
of ours has arrived.

119
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:55,997
Let's meet her.

120
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:56,716
Come on, let's go.

121
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:57,836
Okay.

122
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:02,796
Come on, Feng.

123
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:03,517
It's her.

124
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:06,716
Good baby.

125
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:20,796
Um,

126
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:21,476
you...

127
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:23,117
You're quite compassionate.

128
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:25,197
You too.

129
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:28,916
I'm done here.

130
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:29,997
I have to go.

131
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:31,517
You...

132
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:32,277
Wait a moment.

133
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:36,317
I lost my temper with you last time.

134
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:37,836
Sorry about that.

135
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:40,437
I was the one harassing you.

136
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,317
No need to apologize.

137
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:44,476
But my interest in you has worn off.

138
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:46,317
I'll ignore you from now on.

139
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:48,236
That's good then.

140
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:48,957
That's good.

141
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:52,236
No,

142
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,157
I mean,

143
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:55,596
for someone like you,

144
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:56,957
a graceful

145
00:08:57,197 --> 00:08:58,476
and charming girl,

146
00:08:59,037 --> 00:08:59,876
taking a fancy to me

147
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:01,157
is definitely

148
00:09:01,397 --> 00:09:02,437
a moment of folly.

149
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,037
Now you woke up.

150
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:05,716
I'm happy for you.

151
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:12,677
How about you do me a favor?

152
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:14,756
Then we'll move on.

153
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:16,077
What?

154
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:17,716
What favor?

155
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:23,236
Pretend to be my boyfriend.

156
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,797
Come on, let's drink.

157
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:25,836
Come on.

158
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:26,476
Cheers.

159
00:09:26,636 --> 00:09:27,317
Cheers.

160
00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:34,197
Luo,

161
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:36,476
your boyfriend is trained well.

162
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,157
Right.

163
00:09:37,157 --> 00:09:38,157
Teach us how.

164
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:38,917
Right.

165
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:41,437
Then just date someone who's obedient.

166
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:43,197
Have you learned?

167
00:09:43,197 --> 00:09:44,277
Seek a well-mannered one.

168
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:45,437
I've learned.

169
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:46,557
Go ahead and drink.

170
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:47,476
I'll use the restroom.

171
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:47,996
Okay.

172
00:09:47,996 --> 00:09:48,957
Come on, let's drink.

173
00:09:49,516 --> 00:09:50,144
Come on.

174
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:51,072
Come on.

175
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:52,957
You're good at drinking now.

176
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:53,996
Of course.

177
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:04,236
Long time no see.

178
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:06,957
You've barely changed.

179
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:09,317
Really?

180
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,116
You're unchanged too.

181
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:13,996
I've just came back.

182
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:16,116
And you brought your boyfriend.

183
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:18,756
Are you trying to make me jealous?

184
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:21,277
You're overthinking it.

185
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:22,917
I didn't know you'd come today.

186
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:26,957
I've missed you.

187
00:10:35,157 --> 00:10:36,077
To the restroom.

188
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:49,917
Ms. Yin,

189
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,596
using me for cover? Just say so.

190
00:10:58,797 --> 00:11:00,077
So I can be prepared.

191
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:02,836
Don't tell anybody about today.

192
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:03,716
Rest assured.

193
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:06,236
Confidentiality is my
core professional ethic.

194
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:08,037
But,

195
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:09,716
who is he?

196
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:12,996
He

197
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:14,957
is my first love.

198
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:17,077
So you were thinking...

199
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,317
I wasn't thinking anything.

200
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:23,157
Okay then.

201
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:24,876
I don't understand any of it.

202
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:27,756
In any case...

203
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:28,716
In any case, what?

204
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:36,996
You look very beautiful today.

205
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:38,437
Be confident.

206
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:41,836
I'll freshen up.

207
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:57,756
Don't worry.

208
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:04,356
Yin Zhiluo and I
haven't seen each other for years.

209
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:06,557
Now she's got herself

210
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:07,636
a lousy boyfriend.

211
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:11,437
Of course, it's done.

212
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:13,756
Back then, to get my forgiveness,

213
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,876
she stood in the rain at my downstairs

214
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,516
and waited for me for four hours.

215
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:19,157
If I ask her out,

216
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:20,636
would she refuse?

217
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:24,476
Someone with a mind for love like hers

218
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:26,596
is easy to win over.

219
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:50,077
Lin Han, right?

220
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:51,317
I don't know

221
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:52,756
your story with Yin Zhiluo,

222
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:53,957
but a girl

223
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,756
waiting for you for four hours

224
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:57,516
is not something to boast about.

225
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,236
Show some respect.

226
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:01,476
Do you know who I am?

227
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:02,996
You hit me?

228
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,716
I can destroy you!

229
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:05,277
Stop!

230
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:06,557
Stop grabbing my clothes!

231
00:13:06,557 --> 00:13:07,516
Expensive!

232
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:08,716
Let go, let go!

233
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:18,116
Move.

234
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:28,437
Lin Han,

235
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:30,236
the most disgusting thing I've done

236
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:31,356
is having liked you.

237
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:33,476
This is for myself.

238
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:37,356
This is for my boyfriend.

239
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:38,716
And this,

240
00:13:39,077 --> 00:13:40,557
when you started your business,

241
00:13:40,557 --> 00:13:42,356
I gave you all my savings.

242
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:43,317
Yes,

243
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:44,957
I came just to see you today.

244
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:46,596
I'll give you one week.

245
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,157
If you don't pay back the money,

246
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:49,716
then wait for my lawyer's letter.

247
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:11,596
Ms. Wu,

248
00:14:11,756 --> 00:14:13,277
could you fix this light?

249
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:18,957
Do you think

250
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:20,197
I am okay like this?

251
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:22,437
It should be alright.

252
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:23,996
But for this style,

253
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,157
you need to be very handsome.

254
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:28,437
If kiss before confessing my love,

255
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:30,996
will it seem like I'm insincere?

256
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:33,797
You and your wife are married.

257
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:35,116
I think kissing

258
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:36,397
won't be too outrageous.

259
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:37,356
What do you think?

260
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:42,596
By the way, Ms. Wu,

261
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:45,197
go to the basement
and check the circuitry.

262
00:14:45,476 --> 00:14:46,437
This light...

263
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:48,277
All right.

264
00:14:50,677 --> 00:14:51,516
Oh, sir,

265
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:53,157
I've read it in a book

266
00:14:53,437 --> 00:14:54,836
that when confessing your love...

267
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:58,957
What?

268
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:08,157
Ms. Wu?

269
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:13,197
Ms. Wu?

270
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:23,596
Aotian.

271
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:26,197
Aotian?

272
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:28,157
Aotian!

273
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,836
How do you like this photo I took?

274
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:54,636
Wow, that works.

275
00:15:55,356 --> 00:15:56,716
Is this photo good?

276
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:00,157
Not bad.

277
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:03,488
(Share Pledge Agreement)

278
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,197
Wow.

279
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:07,317
So cool.

280
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:07,996
That's amazing.

281
00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:08,596
(Luo Yan)

282
00:16:09,037 --> 00:16:09,996
That even works.

283
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:11,236
I want to learn.

284
00:16:11,797 --> 00:16:13,116
(Luo Yan)
You can try.

285
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:14,037
Not bad.

286
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:17,476
Hello?

287
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:19,476
I saw you from the window.

288
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,917
You've sat in the car for 30 minutes.

289
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,356
What are you hesitating about?

290
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:27,516
Did you get the stuff?

291
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:32,756
I got it.

292
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:33,557
Come on down.

293
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:35,797
Well done.

294
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:37,197
Weren't you...

295
00:16:42,677 --> 00:16:43,197
Hello?

296
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:50,528
(Luo Yan)

297
00:17:22,397 --> 00:17:23,036
Aotian.

298
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:27,117
Aotian, are you there?

299
00:17:57,523 --> 00:17:58,560
(Fang Lili)

300
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:07,360
(An Yushen)

301
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,357
Hello?

302
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:10,437
Hello,

303
00:18:11,076 --> 00:18:12,157
where are you, how are you?

304
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:12,996
I...

305
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:15,357
I'm outside.

306
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:16,437
People disappeared.

307
00:18:16,437 --> 00:18:17,516
Can't reach to Aotian.

308
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:18,756
What on earth is going on?

309
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:20,117
Don't be afraid.

310
00:18:20,397 --> 00:18:21,917
It must be a system malfunction.

311
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:23,117
Tell me your location.

312
00:18:23,117 --> 00:18:24,076
I'll go to you.

313
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:27,756
I am...

314
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:30,397
I am...

315
00:18:30,516 --> 00:18:31,276
Don't be afraid.

316
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:32,316
I am coming to you.

317
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:33,556
Fang Li,

318
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:34,837
rest assured.

319
00:18:34,837 --> 00:18:36,036
I'll protect you.

320
00:18:38,163 --> 00:18:40,416
(Share Pledge Agreement)

321
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:43,236
I have something to tell you.

322
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:44,677
First, tell me your location.

323
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:45,957
Listen to me first.

324
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:47,076
Actually, today I...

325
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:49,637
Hello?

326
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:51,168
Hello?

327
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:52,476
An Hang!

328
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:53,877
Are you okay?

329
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:54,397
An Hang?

330
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:55,996
Fang Li?

331
00:18:56,157 --> 00:18:56,877
Hello?

332
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:03,488
(An Yushen)

333
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:22,796
(An Hang.)

334
00:20:23,236 --> 00:20:24,076
(Don't disappear.)

335
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,996
(I don't want to be left here alone.)

336
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:14,076
Hello?

337
00:22:15,397 --> 00:22:16,357
Is this An Hang?

338
00:22:17,197 --> 00:22:19,076
I am an engineer from Live or Love.

339
00:22:20,877 --> 00:22:22,276
How did you call me?

340
00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:24,677
We saw the distress flares,

341
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,516
then realized the system
was malfunctioning.

342
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:28,597
Your and Fang Li's consciousness

343
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,957
are both trapped in the system.

344
00:22:30,236 --> 00:22:31,236
It's been over a month.

345
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:32,197
And you just noticed?

346
00:22:32,957 --> 00:22:33,957
A month?

347
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:36,837
Our records show

348
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:39,197
only an hour has passed
since your experience began.

349
00:22:40,877 --> 00:22:43,036
(So the time inside is different
from the outside.)

350
00:22:43,437 --> 00:22:44,996
Can I be awakened from the outside?

351
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:47,796
External awakening is too risky.

352
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:49,637
Suddenly cutting off

353
00:22:49,796 --> 00:22:51,957
could damage the brain's neurons.

354
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:53,877
We suggest

355
00:22:54,197 --> 00:22:56,397
waking you up
by extracting your consciousness.

356
00:22:57,357 --> 00:22:57,877
Okay.

357
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,117
What do we need to do?

358
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:00,917
Mr. An,

359
00:23:01,076 --> 00:23:02,756
the technology is not yet mature.

360
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:04,716
We can only extract one consciousness

361
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,637
for rescue.

362
00:23:23,957 --> 00:23:25,197
Upload my consciousness.

363
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:27,036
Are you sure?

364
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:28,316
Confirm.

365
00:23:28,837 --> 00:23:29,397
Okay.

366
00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:31,677
(Live or Love?)
Open the system.

367
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,597
(System Bar)

368
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:36,556
Click settings.

369
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:41,184
(Settings)

370
00:23:42,357 --> 00:23:43,756
Click to open port.

371
00:23:50,707 --> 00:23:52,544
(Open Port On)

372
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:55,117
Transmission will begin.

373
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:56,837
You may feel a bit of an electric shock.

374
00:23:57,157 --> 00:23:58,117
This is normal.

375
00:24:51,677 --> 00:24:52,397
An Hang!

376
00:24:52,516 --> 00:24:53,316
An Hang!

377
00:24:58,236 --> 00:24:59,197
An Hang, what's wrong?

378
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:00,236
An Hang!

379
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,316
An Hang, what's wrong?

380
00:25:03,076 --> 00:25:04,877
(Reconnection complete)

381
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:07,476
Aotian?

382
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:08,796
(I'm here.)

383
00:25:09,357 --> 00:25:10,677
What on earth just happened?

384
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:11,716
What happened to An Hang?

385
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:14,357
(According to the news I received,)

386
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,197
(the outside)

387
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:16,516
(just severed the system)

388
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:17,516
(and pause the game.)

389
00:25:17,957 --> 00:25:18,957
(They reached in)

390
00:25:19,157 --> 00:25:20,957
(and uploaded someone's consciousness)

391
00:25:20,957 --> 00:25:21,957
(to carry out a rescue.)

392
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,637
Rescue one?

393
00:25:25,397 --> 00:25:27,397
(According to the news I received,)

394
00:25:27,597 --> 00:25:29,397
(only one participant can be uploaded.)

395
00:25:34,036 --> 00:25:34,796
So

396
00:25:34,996 --> 00:25:36,236
An Hang uploaded himself

397
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:37,357
without telling me?

398
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,036
(Understanding is correct.)

399
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:41,117
This upload has failed.

400
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:42,597
The technology is being improved.

401
00:25:42,837 --> 00:25:45,117
Participants, please wait patiently.

402
00:25:46,117 --> 00:25:47,716
If the upload is successful,

403
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,117
he would be out by now.

404
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:50,877
And I would be left behind, right?

405
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:54,197
Participants, please wait patiently.

406
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:22,784
(Luo Yan)

407
00:26:25,357 --> 00:26:26,677
Why did you just hang up?

408
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:27,996
I'm already downstairs.

409
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:29,197
Where are you?

410
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:54,637
I'm telling you,

411
00:26:54,637 --> 00:26:56,716
if it weren't for this expensive clothe,

412
00:26:56,957 --> 00:26:58,397
I could've fought him longer.

413
00:26:58,516 --> 00:26:59,357
Wait a minute.

414
00:26:59,677 --> 00:27:01,076
Did we just space out for a moment?

415
00:27:01,397 --> 00:27:01,917
Space out?

416
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:03,556
No, not at all.

417
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:04,837
Don't interrupt.

418
00:27:05,036 --> 00:27:05,597
So,

419
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,917
I haven't removed the tag.

420
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,157
But it has become like this.

421
00:27:09,157 --> 00:27:09,877
Can I return it?

422
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:11,316
Alright, stop nagging.

423
00:27:11,476 --> 00:27:12,756
Biting over a suit?

424
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:13,756
I'm embarrassed.

425
00:27:13,957 --> 00:27:14,556
But...

426
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:16,397
Why didn't you come earlier?

427
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:17,476
The suit is nearly broken.

428
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:18,437
Eight thousand gone.

429
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:19,877
Now you're blaming me?

430
00:27:26,316 --> 00:27:27,117
But,

431
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:28,677
thank you for today,

432
00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:29,877
for those words.

433
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:32,957
You're welcome.

434
00:27:34,397 --> 00:27:35,637
Actually,

435
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,197
meeting that kind of person

436
00:27:40,796 --> 00:27:41,796
is not your fault.

437
00:27:42,276 --> 00:27:43,756
It's just bad luck.

438
00:27:44,157 --> 00:27:45,076
Trust me,

439
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:46,877
you will definitely meet someone

440
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,516
who cherishes you a lot.

441
00:27:49,637 --> 00:27:50,236
Really.

442
00:27:54,437 --> 00:27:55,117
Feng Zhixing,

443
00:27:55,397 --> 00:27:56,076
I promise,

444
00:27:56,437 --> 00:27:57,556
starting today,

445
00:27:57,556 --> 00:27:59,276
I'll have no romantic thoughts for you.

446
00:27:59,597 --> 00:28:01,036
You are like my brother.

447
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,157
Then,

448
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:05,556
"brother",

449
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:07,877
can you transfer the money to me first?

450
00:28:14,516 --> 00:28:15,397
What?

451
00:28:22,796 --> 00:28:23,597
Young An,

452
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:24,796
you're awake.

453
00:28:25,877 --> 00:28:26,556
Yushen,

454
00:28:27,117 --> 00:28:27,796
how do you feel?

455
00:28:29,677 --> 00:28:30,272
I...

456
00:28:31,357 --> 00:28:32,157
What happened to me?

457
00:28:33,157 --> 00:28:34,516
Your wife called and said

458
00:28:34,637 --> 00:28:35,637
that you fainted.

459
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:36,637
I rushed over,

460
00:28:36,637 --> 00:28:38,316
found you passed out in the storeroom.

461
00:28:39,357 --> 00:28:40,076
Yushen,

462
00:28:40,716 --> 00:28:42,597
have you been too tired lately?

463
00:28:43,117 --> 00:28:45,157
Is it alright to rest at home for a bit?

464
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:45,837
Grandma,

465
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:46,877
I'm okay.

466
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:48,197
Where's Lili?

467
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:49,716
She said

468
00:28:49,877 --> 00:28:50,756
she has things to do,

469
00:28:50,756 --> 00:28:51,996
then I couldn't reach her.

470
00:28:52,756 --> 00:28:53,716
And...

471
00:28:55,157 --> 00:28:55,996
Grandma,

472
00:28:56,556 --> 00:28:57,556
I'm a bit hungry.

473
00:28:57,556 --> 00:28:58,437
I want to eat.

474
00:28:59,076 --> 00:28:59,917
Okay, okay.

475
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,236
Soup has been simmered.

476
00:29:01,316 --> 00:29:02,357
I'll go get it for you.

477
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:15,756
What's it?

478
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:16,316
Speak.

479
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:19,157
Mr. An said,

480
00:29:19,556 --> 00:29:20,796
after you wake up,

481
00:29:23,076 --> 00:29:24,476
you should go see him.

482
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:29,877
Did he say why?

483
00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:50,716
How dare you secretly

484
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:52,677
mortgage the company's shares?

485
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:53,917
You brat!

486
00:29:55,637 --> 00:29:56,597
If not,

487
00:29:57,076 --> 00:29:59,117
the supermarket would lack
operating funds,

488
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:01,796
nor could it double profits in a month.

489
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:04,197
For a supermarket,

490
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,397
you sold Ju'an?

491
00:30:07,837 --> 00:30:09,597
Do you know what these shares mean?

492
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:12,316
Is this fair to the An family?

493
00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:15,837
As long as I can double it,

494
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:17,957
the shares will be redeemed immediately.

495
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:19,516
Shut up!

496
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:21,556
Get out of here!

497
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:22,917
Get out immediately!

498
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:24,076
Get out of the company!

499
00:30:24,316 --> 00:30:25,516
Get out of the An family!

500
00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:41,117
I can leave.

501
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:43,197
But if there is to be accountability,

502
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:44,716
those who need to leave

503
00:30:44,716 --> 00:30:45,756
are not just me alone.

504
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:49,728
(Authorizer: An Xiangyang)

505
00:30:56,877 --> 00:30:57,556
What is this?

506
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,597
Please sign the supermarket report.

507
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:11,476
The review process of this contract

508
00:31:11,476 --> 00:31:12,837
is one you have signed off on.

509
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:14,036
In other words,

510
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:15,877
the equity mortgage was approved by you.

511
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:18,036
If the board seeks accountability,

512
00:31:18,236 --> 00:31:19,996
I'm afraid you can't escape the blame.

513
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,117
You set me up?

514
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:24,556
Considered the consequences?

515
00:31:25,756 --> 00:31:27,117
Betting all on a single toss,

516
00:31:27,556 --> 00:31:28,877
first think about how to end it.

517
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:30,597
You taught me that.

518
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:32,756
You really think you are my son,

519
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:35,157
so I'm at my wit's end with you?

520
00:31:35,796 --> 00:31:37,197
I have nothing to lose.

521
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:39,276
Since someone wants to hurt me,

522
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:40,796
I don't mind

523
00:31:40,796 --> 00:31:41,877
dragging anyone down.

524
00:31:42,677 --> 00:31:43,877
Who wants to hurt you?

525
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:46,677
That's a question for you.

526
00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:48,597
This contract was

527
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:50,476
given to you by Luo Yan, right?

528
00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:55,796
I get it.

529
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:14,957
My foot hurts.

530
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:16,076
Foot?

531
00:32:16,076 --> 00:32:16,957
Foot hurts?

532
00:32:17,157 --> 00:32:17,728
Foot...

533
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:24,437
Fang Li,

534
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:25,877
actually, I want to say...

535
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:37,556
Aotian.

536
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:38,957
I'm here.

537
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:41,516
Fang Li's task

538
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:43,516
is to help Luo Yan defeat me,

539
00:32:44,157 --> 00:32:44,716
right?

540
00:32:48,437 --> 00:32:50,796
The system
conceals the experimenter's tasks.

541
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:53,957
But you didn't deny it.

542
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:15,597
Yushen,

543
00:33:16,357 --> 00:33:17,677
you finally came back.

544
00:33:18,357 --> 00:33:19,637
I don't know what happened.

545
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:20,637
Lili wants to leave.

546
00:33:21,076 --> 00:33:22,397
Hurry upstairs and see.

547
00:33:58,957 --> 00:34:00,637
An Xiangyang hasn't done anything to me.

548
00:34:00,996 --> 00:34:01,796
Disappointed, huh?

549
00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:11,317
Disappointed.

550
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:13,397
We'll try again next time.

551
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:16,636
Not planning to

552
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:17,957
continue the show, huh?

553
00:34:19,036 --> 00:34:21,156
When I decided to give Luo Yan
the documents,

554
00:34:22,036 --> 00:34:23,156
I planned to stop this show.

555
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:25,277
My task,

556
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:27,516
help Luo Yan defeat you.

557
00:34:28,676 --> 00:34:29,957
You've been lying to me.

558
00:34:33,596 --> 00:34:34,237
Yes.

559
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,237
I'm guilt-ridden.

560
00:34:37,357 --> 00:34:38,797
But I also reap what I sowed.

561
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,076
Thank you for teaching me a lesson.

562
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:46,036
From now on,

563
00:34:46,357 --> 00:34:47,676
we'll each rely on our skills.

564
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:50,717
I will not go easy on you anymore.
