(I get it.)

(But)

7
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,201
(I want to raise our kid with you.)

(Will you give me the opportunity?)

(Yin Zhiluo)

10
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,960
Who are you?

11
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:45,881
Why are you at my house?

12
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,240
I...

13
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,080
I came to see you.

14
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:50,481
See me?

15
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:52,601
I don't know you.

16
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,240
Go to Iceland.

17
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,800
Go to Iceland.

18
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:10,481
My brother will take me to Iceland.

19
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,400
Go to Iceland.

20
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:15,441

21
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,840
Nuannuan.

22
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,201
Since we've agreed,

23
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:26,800
let's talk about the terms.

24
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,360
Our kid will take my surname
and be registered

25
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,921
to our household.

26
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,761
Do you agree?

27
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:38,001
Yeah.

28
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:38,944
(Custody Agreement)

29
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:40,192
(Party A, Feng Zhixing
Party B, Yin Zhiluo)

30
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:42,800
You'll cover 30 percent
of our child's daily costs

31
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,680
and education fees.

32
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:44,881
No.

33
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:46,601
I'll cover 70 percent of it.

34
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,281
Don't you know how much you make?

35
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,640
How can you afford it?

00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:54,800
(II. Child Support, Educational Fees,
and Payment Methods)

37
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,560
You have to spend

20 hours with the child

39
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:58,441
per week.

40
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,520
Can you do it?

41
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:00,441
Yeah.

42
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:01,321
(III. Visitation Rights)

43
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,120
But

44
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:03,640
you're so busy with work.

45
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:05,601
Should I share your burden?

46
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,680
No need.

47
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,281
I will stay with my baby

48
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,041
until he turns three years old.

49
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,080
What about your own life?

50
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,401
I'm going to be a mom.

51
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't get to live my own life.

52
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:20,961
Just tell me if you agree.

53
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,000
Why do you care?

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,921
After all, I'm the one who caused this.

55
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:26,320
Enough, get out.

56
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,760
If there's anything to add,

57
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,641
I'll let you know.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,680
I won't leave.

59
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,440
I want to stay.

60
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:33,200
Get out.

61
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,800
Fine.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,240
Don't be mad.

63
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,120
I...

64
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:39,481
I'll get some supplements

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,081
and bring them over later.

66
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Hello, darling.

67
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,440
Do you have time?

68
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:02,200
I want to see you.

69
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:04,760

Thorough cleaning.

78
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:01,721
Thorough cleaning.

Thorough cleaning.

82
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,120
Thorough cleaning.

83
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,641
Brother.

84
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,800
I see.

85
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:48,360
Hello?

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,680
Hello?

87
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,440
An Hang.

88
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:57,521
Listen.

89
00:06:57,521 --> 00:06:58,240
The static.

90
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,961
It's just like when the system failed.

91
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,120
Is anyone there?

92
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,200
What's wrong?

93
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,521
Where could we go
so early in the morning?

94
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:22,440
Wait.

95
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
What's wrong?

96
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:29,721
It's nothing, Grandma.

97
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:31,560
We thought there was a power cut.

98
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:34,800
And you got so scared?

99
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,481
You guys are really something.

100
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:37,721
Sit down for breakfast.

101
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,320
(Yin Zhiluo)

102
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,240

00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,641
(Bad signal?)

104
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,440
What happened just now?

105
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:08,841
Madam An.

106
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,041
I went to pick up the tray
from the lady's room.

107
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,000
But she...

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,081
She's gone.

109
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:16,401
What?

110
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,521
Auntie.

111
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:27,161
Auntie.

112
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,440
Xiangyin.

113
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,161
Xiangyin.

114
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:41,521
I put all those

115
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,521
unfair terms
in the contract as requested.

116
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:45,121
But An Yushen

117
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,401
agreed to everything.

118
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:49,761
I had no choice

119
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:51,241
but to sign the contract.

120
00:08:58,281 --> 00:08:59,080
Then I

121
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,361
will take my leave.

122
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:01,521
Go ahead.

123
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,600
Hello.

124
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,960
Auntie is missing.

125
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,041
She just vanished.

126
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,001
What should we do?

127
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:18,800
Calm down. What happened?

128
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:21,881
She just remembered
who I was a few days ago.

129
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:24,761
Auntie was the sweetest to us
when we were kids.

130
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:25,800
Stay calm.

131
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,680
I'll be right there.

132
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,641
Mom.

133
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:17,960
What happened?

134
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,080
Where

135
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,680
could Xiangyin have gone?

136
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:23,800
Why are you asking me?

137
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:25,921
Your sister is gone

138
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:27,281
as soon as you're home.

139
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:30,080
Go look for her.

140
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:31,800
Dad.

141
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,161
We've called the police.

142
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:34,480
They are looking for her.

143
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,281
But it hasn't been 24 hours yet.

144
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:39,200
We have too little information to offer.

145
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,161
Yeah.

146
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:41,761
We don't even know

147
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,200
if she has left the house.

148
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,361
She hasn't left.

149
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:46,761
I've checked
all the surveillance nearby.

150
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:48,121
Auntie hasn't gone out.

151
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:53,960
No way.

152
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,440
No way.

153
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,960
How can a living person

154
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,401
just vanish into thin air?

155
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,641
No way.

156
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,840
How is Grandma doing?

157
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,761
We took her blood pressure.

158
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:40,521
She took her pills

159
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:41,401
and went to rest.

160
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:43,080
But I don't think she can sleep.

161
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:45,200
Who could deal with something like this?

162
00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:47,800
How could Auntie simply disappear?

163
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,361
An Hang.

164
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,320
The system doesn't

165
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,641
assign supernatural tasks, right?

166
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,041
Player, please

167
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,680
complete the instance task.

168
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,720
Mystery in the An Residence.

169
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,881
A-Aotian.

170
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,560
What exactly should we do?

171
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:06,200
The player

172
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,881
only has to uncover the secret
of An Xiangyin.

173
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,840
So there's nothing supernatural.

174
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,401
Right?

175
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,320
A-Aotian.

176
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:18,960
Say something.

177
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:20,736
Ao...

178
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,281
Don't be scared.

179
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:25,921
Don't be scared.

180
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,840
I'm not scared.

181
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,200
It's just a setting.

182
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,241
Are you scared?

183
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,041
Why would I be?

184
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,600
Really.

185
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:43,881
Believe me.

186
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:55,200
Young An.

187
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,840
Why did you ask Ms. Wu

188
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,641
and the servants to leave?

189
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,800
I have to tell you something

190
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,041
that sounds a bit ridiculous

191
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,200
but is very serious.

192
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,001
Auntie might be involved

193
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:10,480
in something

194
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,560
that can't be explained by science.

195
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:15,840
You mean...

196
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,680
Nonsense.

197
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,600
There is no such thing.

198
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:24,041
Besides,

199
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,320
Xiangyin has never harmed even an ant.

200
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:28,480
Why would it

201
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,320
happen to her out of all these people?

202
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:31,560
Grandma.

203
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,001
Believe me.

204
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,840
In our world,

205
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,761
anything is possible.

206
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:02,521
Auntie's negative energy

207
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:03,600
invited an evil spirit.

208
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,401
We can only save her

209
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:06,641
by uncovering the secret.

210
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,041
Lili.

211
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,161
What's going on?

212
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,560
What can a blank sheet of paper prove?

213
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,600
You never went to college at all.

214
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:18,281
But you told everyone

215
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:20,761
that you have returned
from studying abroad.

216
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:24,521
How could you possibly know?

217
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,800
I forgot to tell you.

218
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,361
Lili is quite talented

219
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,641
in this respect.

220
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:33,480
I wonder if you are willing

221
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,281
to believe me at this point.

222
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,041
Don't worry.

223
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:50,680
We'll surely find Auntie.

224
00:14:51,161 --> 00:14:52,521
But I need to know

225
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,881
what happened to her back then

226
00:14:54,881 --> 00:14:57,161
that made her like this.

227
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,041
Xiangyin was very smart
when she was young.

228
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,881
People saw her as a child prodigy.

229
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,560
The whole family
treated her like a real princess.

230
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:20,200
However,

231
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,041
on her tenth birthday,

232
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,401
I heard her

233
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,680
tumbling down the stairs in my sleep.

234
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,200
There was a pool of blood.

235
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:34,600
I was terrified

236
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,001
and rushed her to the hospital.

237
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:40,560
She got several stitches on her chin.

238
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,921
I thought

239
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,281
that was it.

240
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:47,401
However,

241
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,041
she began to talk nonsense
after she woke up.

242
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,881
She's been

243
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,001
dazed and confused

244
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:56,720
until today.

245
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,440
Auntie must have fallen

246
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,361
from here.

247
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
What are you thinking?

248
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,680
I'm thinking

249
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:18,600
what the system wants us to find out.

250
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,800
I'll take a look.

251
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Wait for me.

252
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:47,320
We saw Auntie just now.

253
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,480
She flashed by

254
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:49,161
that doorway

255
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:50,121
and disappeared.

256
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:51,241
I also saw her

257
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:52,440
flash by in the kitchen.

258
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,921
What's going on?

259
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,401
Xiangyin is still at home, right?

260
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:00,761
Don't overthink things.

261
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:02,080
Go upstairs and find her.

262
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:08,321
You dare not go?

263
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:09,601
I'll do it.

264
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,561
I'm not scared of my daughter.

265
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:13,440
Grandma.

266
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:16,760
I'll go.

267
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:20,841
Luo Yan will come with me.

268
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,520
Let's go together.

269
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:26,841
Let's go.

270
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:28,161
Let's go.

271
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,056
Let's go.

272
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,081
You go first.

273
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:54,280
You go first.

274
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,841
Are you scared?

275
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:58,321
No, I'm not.

276
00:17:58,561 --> 00:17:59,240
Are you scared?

277
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,841
Nonsense.

278
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:02,280
So why are you holding me?

279
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,361
I'm protecting you as your big brother.

280
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:05,881
Let's go.

281
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,040
Let's go.

282
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,240
Let's go.

283
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,440
What exactly

284
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,760
did you see just now?

285
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
A figure.

286
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,680
Are you sure it was a person?

287
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:21,720
I have no idea.

288
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:32,321
Yushen.

289
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,480
Luo Yan.

290
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,641
Don't be afraid.

291
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,280
Run.

292
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,960
You've been resting for two hours.

293
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,841
Aren't you any better?

294
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,720
What exactly

295
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:56,480
did you guys see?

296
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,480
No more questions.

297
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:02,601
Don't do anything.

298
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:04,921
Just get through tonight safely.

299
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,760
Shall we stay somewhere

300
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:09,040
for the night?

301
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,040
Better not.

302
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,520
In the movies,

303
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,161
those who leave at this point usually...

304
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:13,720
Okay.

305
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,480
We'll just stay at home.

306
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:18,680
Okay.

307
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,520
Then let's divide the rooms.

308
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:22,361
Given the current situation,

309
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,680
nobody should be alone.

310
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:27,641
Yushen and I will share a room.

311
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:29,161
Luo Yan will share a room

312
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,401
with Dad?

313
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,081
Luo Yan

314
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:39,760
will share a room with Grandma?

315
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,361
We're all family.

316
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
No need to mind.

317
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,121
He can't share a room with me.

318
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:48,200
Good idea.

319
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,841
We're all family.

320
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,881
No need to mind.

321
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:56,240
Lu.

322
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,121
We'll share a room.

323
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:00,680
Does that sound okay to you?

324
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:01,801
Okay.

325
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:30,641
Why don't we chit-chat for a bit?

326
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,881
Okay.

327
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:39,161
What's your zodiac sign?

328
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:41,801
I don't believe in those.

329
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:45,240
Then what kind of movies do you like?

330
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,841
Horror movies.

331
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:50,000
The Conjuring series is my favorite.

332
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:51,280
I can tell you about it.

333
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,121
Those are stories...

334
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:52,841
Wait a minute.

335
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,240
So aren't you scared

336
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:58,921
about what happened today?

337
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:02,240
Not at all.

338
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,921
I think no matter what a person becomes,

339
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,841
they won't hurt people they love.

340
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,321
So we are very safe.

341
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:17,480
Go to sleep.

342
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:33,641
Miss Fang.

343
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:37,641
What's wrong?

344
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:39,000
I forgot to tell you

345
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,641
I have neurasthenia
and a sleep disorder.

346
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:42,000
So I often wake up startled,

347
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,040
especially when I hear noises.

348
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,561
So

349
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,921
you don't snore, do you?

350
00:21:50,641 --> 00:21:53,121
If you are not afraid to sleep alone,

351
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,361
I'm going out to grab a bite.

352
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:09,321
I have severe mysophobia

353
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,040
and avoid physical contact.

354
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,000
And I tend to catch cold easily.

355
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,881
So you must stay one meter away from me.

356
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:15,440
Also...

357
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,121
Wait a minute.

358
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,601
Isn't this my room?

359
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:21,760
Who let you sleep in the bed?

360
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,000
See that sofa?

361
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,440
It's too small. I don't fit.

362
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:28,881
How come I fit there?

363
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,921
How tall are you?

364
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:30,561
I...

365
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:35,801
Fine.

366
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,161
I'll take the sofa.

367
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:38,520
I'll let you have this one.

368
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,641
After all, you've been plotting things

369
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,881
with Mr. Yu regarding the contract
of Yungan Technology

370
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:45,081
but failed to trick me.

371
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:46,496
You...

372
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,641
I didn't say anything.

373
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:48,960
It doesn't mean I'm clueless.

374
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,561
Is it the wind?

375
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,881
No idea.

376
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:04,760
Go close the door.

377
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,601
Why don't you go?

378
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
You're the younger one

379
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
so do as I say.

380
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,601
You're older, so look after me.

381
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:11,841
Fine.

382
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,280
Let the winner decide.

383
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:29,881
Let's go together.

384
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,520
Go.

385
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,401
Go.

386
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,776
Go.

387
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:52,760
Together.

388
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,361
Together.

389
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:14,200
It's fine now, right?

390
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,960
I-I think so.

391
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:21,921
Why are we whispering?

392
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:25,801
No idea.

393
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,361
Why did you come out?

394
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,040
Don't mention it.

395
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:13,601
He's snoring like crazy.

396
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,520
He had the nerve to ask me
not to disturb his sleep.

397
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:18,480
I dare not fall asleep.

398
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,801
So I just listened to him snoring.

399
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,801
You're scared?

400
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:25,561
No.

401
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:27,081
I was just staying alert.

402
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:35,561
I thought you were not scared.

403
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,720
If I were scared,

404
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,040
would you lose interest in me?

405
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:09,000
What was that?

406
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,440
That was my answer.

407
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:12,321
I didn't hear you.

408
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:27,008
Kisses.

409
00:26:27,008 --> 00:26:32,000
Kisses.

410
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,912
Kisses.

411
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,680
Stay here.

412
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,520
I'll go take a look.

413
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,952
Kisses.

414
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:49,728
Kisses.

415
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,680
What's going on?

416
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:04,040
It looked like

417
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:05,440
a video call

418
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,841
with an unstable signal.

419
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,720
Unstable?

420
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,321
No matter what the problem is,

421
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,121
as long as we reveal the hidden truth,

422
00:27:15,321 --> 00:27:16,680
Auntie will be back, right?

423
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:21,240
I think we're meant to

424
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,161
find out how she's become abnormal.

425
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,401
Looking back,

426
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,280
I'm sure she didn't fall by mistake.

427
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,000
Or the system wouldn't give this task.

428
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,280
Grandma said

429
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,081
that Auntie had
many stitches on her chin

430
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:34,680
after she was rushed to the hospital.

431
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:36,200
I've been thinking.

432
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:38,440
When a person falls,

433
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,000
they instinctively use their hands

434
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:42,000
to brace against the ground

435
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:43,321
to protect their faces.

436
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,040
You're saying

437
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,321
that someone pushed her?

438
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,680
Perhaps she was pushed down.

439
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:50,921
Perhaps

440
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:53,280
she was holding something at that time

441
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
and couldn't react.

442
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:58,881
Let's try to follow the system's logic.

443
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,440
She activated the instance at this point

444
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:04,161
because she triggered
a certain scenario, right?

445
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,440
Where was she before she vanished?

446
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,280
Xiangyin.

447
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,121
Xiangyin.

448
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,760
Xiangyin.

449
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:07,161
(Xiangyang.)

450
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:07,960
(Xiangyang.)

451
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,881
(Will you play marbles with me?)

452
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,280
Dad.

453
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:20,881
Is this yours?

454
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:24,000
I have something to ask you.

455
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,321
If I reveal what happened that year,

456
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:40,440
Xiangyin will come back?

457
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:46,321
I don't know how to explain.

458
00:29:46,561 --> 00:29:47,841
But please believe me.

459
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:50,520
Aunt must have disappeared
after seeing this.

460
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:53,081
I bet you know
what it has to do with her

461
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:55,040
more than anyone else.

462
00:29:58,081 --> 00:29:59,760
I don't believe what you're saying.

463
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:02,801
But I don't want to hide

464
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,081
this secret anymore.

465
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:07,520
When I was young,

466
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,361
everyone praised Xiangyin

467
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:10,680
for being smart.

468
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,200
As her older brother,

469
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,841
I was seen as the useless son

470
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:20,000
in the An family.

471
00:30:21,081 --> 00:30:22,561
What are you doing at school?

472
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,361
Have you been studying at all?

473
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,720
If you had studied,

474
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,240
you wouldn't have scored so low.

475
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:29,361
Are you really our child?

476
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,601
You're not just disgracing yourself.

477
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:33,520
You're a disgrace
to the entire An family.

478
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,801
Hands out.

479
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,561
Hands out.

480
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,720
Alright.

481
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:40,641
Stand here as punishment.

482
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:41,801
No food for you.

483
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:50,561
I didn't know

484
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:53,440
that I even hated

485
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:55,121
my own sister.

486
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,081
That night,

487
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,601
everyone had gone to sleep.

488
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:00,480
She pestered me to play.

489
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,000
Brother.

490
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:05,040
Brother.

491
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,440
Play with me.

492
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,240
Go away.

493
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:09,720
Play with me, please.

494
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,881
Go away.

495
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,401
I told her to pick up
all the marbles as a punishment.

496
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,440
However,

497
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,000
Xiangyin slipped on them and fell down.

498
00:31:48,921 --> 00:31:49,841
She lay on the ground

499
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,601
with a handful of marble beads.

500
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,641
I don't know what came over me.

501
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,280
The first thought

502
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:01,921
that came to me

503
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,240
was that she'd better just die.

504
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,081
I was scared the adults would find out,

505
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,841
so I collected all the marbles

506
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:14,121
and went back to my room to sleep.

507
00:32:19,401 --> 00:32:21,520
So you didn't push Auntie
down the stairs.

508
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,440
I've decided to confess.

509
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,361
Why would I lie about it?

510
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:30,081
You didn't push her.

511
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,280
But you are still to blame.

512
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:33,520
Grandma.

513
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,801
How come you're awake?

514
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:45,921
If you had taken her

515
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:47,561
to the hospital right away,

516
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:50,960
she might be healthy right now

517
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:54,881
without having suffered for years.

518
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:57,960
Get out of here.

519
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,680
Before I take my last breath,

520
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,720
