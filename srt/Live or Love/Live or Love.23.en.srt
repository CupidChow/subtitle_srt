4
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:00,736
Aotian.

5
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:01,792
I'm here.

6
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,736
What happened to me just now?

7
00:01:06,137 --> 00:01:07,057
I've found

8
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:08,536
that player An Hang

9
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,137
has developed a brain lesion

10
00:01:10,497 --> 00:01:11,857
due to transmission failure,

11
00:01:12,577 --> 00:01:13,976
which has pressed on the nerve.

12
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:20,376
What will happen to me?

13
00:01:21,736 --> 00:01:23,376
Given your current physical condition,

14
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:25,777
life risks are not ruled out.

15
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:32,816
Aotian,

16
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:35,976
will I die in the program?

17
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:38,297
It's possible.

18
00:01:41,176 --> 00:01:42,657
If I die in the program,

19
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:45,816
Luo Yan will be the sole successor.

20
00:01:47,577 --> 00:01:48,697
That is to say,

21
00:01:49,497 --> 00:01:50,976
at least Fang Li can get out.

22
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:51,816
Right?

23
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:53,857
Correct.

24
00:01:58,536 --> 00:01:59,777
How much time do I have left?

25
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:02,657
Your body data has been analyzed.

26
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,777
It's about a week.

27
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:17,097
Young An.

28
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:19,857
What did you say?

29
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:22,176
What's wrong?

30
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:23,776
You look pale.

31
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:24,736
Nothing.

32
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:26,776
Just a bit tired.

33
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:28,577
I'd like some time alone.

34
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:29,736
It's snowing.

35
00:02:30,577 --> 00:02:32,176
If you're not feeling well,

36
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:33,616
let me take you home first.

37
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:43,736
Snow over the chaotic mountains.

38
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:46,017
I'm in solitude.

39
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:02,656
Okay.

40
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:08,297
Let's talk later.

41
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,736
(Ju'an Group)

42
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:17,656
It's snowing.

43
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:19,496
It's so beautiful.

44
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:29,537
Snow is water vapor in the air

45
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:31,377
formed after meeting the nuclei,

46
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:34,216
and the nuclei are dust
in the atmosphere.

47
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:36,056
It looks white,

48
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:38,496
but it's actually not clean.

49
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:45,977
When we get off work,

50
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:47,817
let's build a snowman together.

51
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:49,697
Okay.

52
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,697
It will warm up tonight.

53
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:54,297
At that time,

54
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:55,817
the snowman will turn into meltwater.

55
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:57,537
Those who are bound to leave

56
00:03:57,896 --> 00:03:59,656
won't be kept no matter what.

57
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:03,577
I'll go up first.

58
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,297
Are you sick,

59
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:11,017
An Yushen?

60
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:11,817
Yes,

61
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:13,776
I am sick.

62
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,377
(It's September 27th,)

63
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:26,577
(the first day of snow here.)

64
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:29,737
(It's also the 25th day
since I fell in love with Fang Li.)

65
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,577
(Yet I am about)

66
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:32,937
(to die.)

67
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,416
(When the time comes,)

68
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,776
(she will harbor lifelong regrets)

69
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:37,896
(when leaving this place.)

70
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:40,497
(I must make her dislike me
as soon as possible)

71
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:43,377
(so that she can embrace a new life.)

72
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:46,017
(Fate will not be kind to love,)

73
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,536
(but I will.)

74
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:57,776
Who is talking about me again?

75
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:17,137
It's snowing.

76
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:21,177
I suddenly want to eat hot pot.

77
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:28,288
(An Yushen)

78
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:29,096
(After work,)

79
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,856
(bring some freshly sliced lamb home.)

80
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,697
(What do you want to eat lately?)

81
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:52,257
(I'll make it for you.)

82
00:05:52,697 --> 00:05:54,416
(The remaining meals are limited.)

83
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:06,697
(Okay.)

84
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:17,811
(Friends Circle.
Lu Yao: The journey is long...)

85
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:19,891

87
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:23,177
(First Day Back in the Country)

88
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:34,976
After that supermarket incident,

89
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,976
my dad wouldn't let me
touch the family business.

90
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,216
However,

91
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:39,536
I've come around.

92
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:41,776
I have to admit
when I've made a mistake.

93
00:06:42,456 --> 00:06:43,416
Now,

94
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,257
I'm self-reliant,

95
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,377
starting from scratch.

96
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:47,536
Once the procedures are done,

97
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:49,257
I'll start a business abroad

98
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:50,737
and

99
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,257
get married to my boyfriend.

100
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:54,617
Get married?

101
00:06:59,737 --> 00:07:00,336
Look.

102
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,377
My boyfriend Charles

103
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:03,737
looks

104
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:05,177
way more handsome than you.

105
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:08,377
Congratulations.

106
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:09,937
He looks very healthy.

107
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:11,096
He should be long-lived.

108
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:14,856
Is this how you compliment people?

109
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:17,137
Being healthy is the best blessing.

110
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:22,976
I really don't know
what I saw in you before.

111
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:25,017
So

112
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:26,937
you rushed to ask me out

113
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:28,896
just to have me act in a play with you

114
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:30,656
to make your girlfriend dislike you, right?

115
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:34,257
She is still so young.

116
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:35,817
I don't want to hold her up.

117
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:40,416
What a melodrama.

118
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:41,617
But

119
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:43,336
I am willing to help you out.

120
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:44,976
Consider it my good deed.

121
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:46,017
After all,

122
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:48,937
I also want to see the anxious look
on Fang Lili's face.

123
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:56,336
Young An,

124
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:56,976
take a look.

125
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:00,577
This won't do.

126
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:01,497
It's too blurry.

127
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:02,896
I can't see it clearly at all.

128
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:03,896
Turn on the flash.

129
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:06,817
Does it need to be so clear?

130
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:07,617
Okay.

131
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:10,096
Bro,

132
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:11,416
our paparazzi's principle

133
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,937
is to not use the flash.

134
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,656
No principle with money.

135
00:08:14,656 --> 00:08:15,536
Open it if told to.

136
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:17,536
Alright.

137
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,017
Young An,

138
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:24,536
look.

139
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:27,976
It's much clearer now.

140
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:29,656
It's to the extent
that it can't be denied.

141
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:31,296
But, look.

142
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:32,257
The composition

143
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:33,176
still has some issues.

144
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:34,737
Adjust the angle slightly

145
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:35,737
to make it look like

146
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:37,457
we're really going to kiss.

147
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:38,176
Make it look like

148
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:40,017
we can't deny it at all.

149
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:41,737
Also,

150
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:43,416
this expression of mine

151
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,217
is too serious.

152
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:45,737
Capture some more

153
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:46,896
sleazy-looking ones of mine.

154
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:48,096
Sle...

155
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:49,137
Sleazy?

156
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:30,056
Young Master.

157
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:35,056
Why is there such a strong scent
of perfume on you?

158
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:37,857
Is that so?

159
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:39,656
Ms. Wu, take this inside.

160
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,497
You are so late.

161
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:51,617
I had no choice

162
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:52,576
but to socialize.

163
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:54,617
Socialize?

164
00:09:57,656 --> 00:09:58,536
Where's my meat?

165
00:09:58,737 --> 00:10:00,257
Didn't I tell you to bring meat home?

166
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,656
Hotpot without lamb meat lacks soul.

167
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:04,737
That's it?

168
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:06,896
Have you noticed

169
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:08,377
something different about me today?

170
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:09,576
Yes.

171
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:11,337
Did you sprain your neck?

172
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:13,176
I want to see your mistress.

173
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,176
Yes, we want to see her.

174
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:14,816
Let us in.

175
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:15,656
Who are you?

176
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,497
What's the fuss?

177
00:10:16,497 --> 00:10:18,017
Ms. Wu, let them in first.

178
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:19,816
Yes.

179
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:25,896
You must be Mr. An's wife, aren't you?

180
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:27,377
So what if I am?

181
00:10:30,737 --> 00:10:31,896
Ms. Yin

182
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:32,737
secretly met

183
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:34,416
married Mr. An.

184
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,097
Take a look.

185
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:36,017
They were intimate.

186
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:37,497
Give us two million now.

187
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:38,737
Or we'll go to the press.

188
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:44,816
(Honey,)

189
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,296
(sorry)

190
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:48,696
(that I have to say goodbye
to you this way.)

191
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:51,776
(Because I don't want you to leave)

192
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:53,656
(with pain and tears.)

193
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:56,097
Go ahead.

194
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,176
A good anvil does not fear the hammer.

195
00:10:58,536 --> 00:11:01,257
My husband had the guts
to have an affair?

196
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,816
Don't be joking.

197
00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:05,776
They were definitely talking about work.

198
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:08,536
No, look.
They were passionately kissing.

199
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,497
You mean this one?

200
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,217
They kissed passionately?

201
00:11:12,696 --> 00:11:14,896
And Yin Zhili's lipstick
was clinging on so firmly?

202
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:15,977
Which brand is it?

203
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:17,977
I must bring it into our store.

204
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:18,857
Well...

205
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:20,176
Paparazzi nowadays

206
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:22,377
would do anything for money.

207
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:24,377
You'd make it public tomorrow.

208
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:25,617
Perfect.

209
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:27,377
The bigger the fuss, the better.

210
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:29,257
I'll sue you for every penny you've got.

211
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:30,497
Wait.

212
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:31,497
Ma'am...

213
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:32,137
Well...

214
00:11:32,137 --> 00:11:34,097
It's not easy for us to make money.

215
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:35,896
You can't blame us entirely for this.

216
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:37,737
Young An,

217
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:39,137
look at what you did.

218
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:41,337
I-I did nothing.

219
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,272
I...

220
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:44,137
You followed me and took the photos.

221
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:46,496
I'll kick them out.

222
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:47,137
Get out.

223
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:47,712
Wait.

224
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:49,296
Don't harass my family at my home.

225
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,056
This way.

226
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:50,737
Hurry.

227
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:51,696
Get out.

228
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:54,296
Out.

229
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,337
Get out.

230
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:57,776
I'm so sorry.

231
00:11:58,536 --> 00:11:59,536
Double pay.

232
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:00,936
Sorry.

233
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:02,737
Young An,

234
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,377
for years in the industry,

235
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:06,576
I've never seen such a con game.

236
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:07,617
I'm impressed.

237
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:08,816
Let's go.

238
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:26,097
I can't believe those paparazzi
in the system.

239
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:27,816
Well,

240
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:29,656
can't the screenwriter

241
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:30,737
write anything else

242
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:32,217
other than exposing scandals?

243
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:33,257
You're right.

244
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,296
Right?

245
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:35,737
I must sue him.

246
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:37,617
There's no lawless land on the internet.

247
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:39,176
You're still mad?

248
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,257
Of course.

249
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:41,977
How dare he try to swindle me?

250
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:42,696
If not taught

251
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,137
a lesson, he will get too cocky.

252
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:44,977
Calm down.

253
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:45,656
Don't...

254
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,257
Don't be so petty, alright?

255
00:12:52,377 --> 00:12:53,097
Don't you think

256
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:54,896
you've always been mean to NPCs?

257
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:55,497
I...

258
00:12:55,497 --> 00:12:56,857
We're all trying to make a living.

259
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:57,977
Life is tough for everyone.

260
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:01,936
When you were poor before,

261
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:03,137
you worked as a paparazzo too?

262
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:04,257
No.

263
00:13:04,377 --> 00:13:05,776
Though I've never been a paparazzo,

264
00:13:05,776 --> 00:13:06,656
I know

265
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:08,217
the heavy burden on their conscience

266
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:09,617
when they extort and blackmail.

267
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:11,776
What you'll lose is just some money,

268
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:13,816
but what they'll lose
is their own conscience.

269
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:14,737
Can't you

270
00:13:14,936 --> 00:13:16,656
have a little empathy?

271
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,217
An Hang,

272
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:20,737
Should I

273
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:22,776
first take you to the hospital
for a checkup?

274
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:24,776
Are you out of your mind?

275
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:25,656
No.

276
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:26,896
My mind is fine.

277
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:27,576
Absolutely fine.

278
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:28,536
I am not sick.

279
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:42,017
I won't help.

280
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,416
It's so troublesome.

281
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,176
Please, Ms. Yin.

282
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,576
I can agree to any demands you have.

283
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:49,696
Just help me one last time.

284
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,296
If that's the case,

285
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:53,776
you have to promise

286
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:56,056
to let our products enter
all of your large supermarkets,

287
00:13:56,217 --> 00:13:57,416
and they must take

288
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,017
the prime counters on the first floor.

289
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,377
Okay, no problem.

290
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:08,896
(It's September 28th,)

291
00:14:09,377 --> 00:14:11,696
(the 26th day
I fell in love with Fang Lili,)

292
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:14,617
(and the first day our love will end.)

293
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,017
(In ten minutes,)

294
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:19,296
(she will hate me to her guts.)

295
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:22,497
(And I am already content
with this world.)

296
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:24,737
(There are sunsets,)

297
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:26,056
(stars,)

298
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:27,936
(and memories.)

299
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:16,416
(General Manager's Office)

300
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:33,936
Ms. Fang,

301
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:35,816
aren't you proud and self-respecting?

302
00:15:36,257 --> 00:15:38,176
Now everyone outside knows

303
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:39,776
that An Yushen doesn't love you.

304
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:41,936
Why are you still pestering him?

305
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:43,497
It's just your one-sided story.

306
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:47,337
If he truly loved you,

307
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:48,977
would he ask me to have it out with you?

308
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:50,977
Aren't I right,

309
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,776
Yushen?

310
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:55,056
(I'm sorry.)

311
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:57,337
(This is the last love I can give you.)

312
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:05,776
So you two hooked up while abroad?

313
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:06,536
That's right.

314
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:09,576
You came back to the country
to make him take responsibility?

315
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:10,656
Yes.

316
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:12,816
The two of you are mutually in love,

317
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:14,737
and I'm actually the third wheel?

318
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:16,656
It's good that you know.

319
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:18,896
Did you hear all that,

320
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:19,656
Charles?

321
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:22,217
What?

322
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:23,536
Charles?

323
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:26,896
Luo,

324
00:16:27,056 --> 00:16:28,936
your sister came back to get married?

325
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:29,977
That's right.

326
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:31,377
She'll leave after the procedures.

327
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:35,296
I see.

328
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:45,217
You lied to me, Yin Zhili.

329
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:49,377
So you went back to the country
to see that man?

330
00:16:49,377 --> 00:16:50,656
No, Charles.

331
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:51,696
Let me explain.

332
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:53,137
(Charles)
I won't listen.

333
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,536
It's over for us.

334
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:55,896
Charles,

335
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:57,337
there was a misunderstanding.

336
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:58,936
Ms. Yin will explain it to you.

337
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:04,776
Ms. Yin,

338
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:07,937
it's best not to get into some trouble.

339
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:10,056
I'm reminding you once again.

340
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,376
Running into you two

341
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:17,816
is truly a curse for me.

342
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:26,177
Speak.

343
00:17:26,657 --> 00:17:27,776
What is all this for?

344
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,096
I...

345
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:33,816
I...

346
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:37,257
You have three seconds.

347
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:38,937
Three.

348
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:40,897
Two.

349
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:43,376
An Hang?

350
00:17:44,536 --> 00:17:45,536
An Hang, what's wrong?

351
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:48,096
What's happening?

352
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:01,897
Fang Li.

353
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:04,816
Aotian told me everything.

354
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:07,737
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:09,536 --> 00:18:11,096
I can't be with you anymore.

356
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:13,576
Given what you've done lately,

357
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:14,376
is it because

358
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:15,697
you think you are about to die?

359
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:18,457
I...

360
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:19,376
Do you think

361
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:20,737
that if anything happens to you,

362
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:22,536
I will remember you for a lifetime?

363
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:25,376
Wouldn't you?

364
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:26,816
Aotian.

365
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:27,697
I'm here.

366
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:30,017
If An Hang leaves the system soon,

367
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:31,217
will he be better?

368
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:32,217
Yes.

369
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:33,776
After disconnecting,

370
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:36,056
the system will no longer
affect his consciousness.

371
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:40,336
You never mentioned any of this
to me before.

372
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:41,977
Sorry.

373
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,336
AI can only answer the questions
you pose.

374
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:46,177
An Hang,

375
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:47,457
I'm warning you.

376
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:49,897
I really hate
the whole devoted dedication thing.

377
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:51,257
Hurry up and get well.

378
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:52,616
And find a way to get out.

379
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:54,417
What will you do if I get out?

380
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:56,056
You said it yourself.

381
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:58,576
Smart people
don't have to follow the rules.

382
00:18:58,576 --> 00:18:59,897
They can just break the rules.

383
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:02,457
If you and Luo Yan both win,

384
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,177
can't the both of us get out?

385
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:08,177
Congratulations

386
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:09,697
on unlocking the hidden plot:

387
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:11,257
a win-win ending.

388
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:19,840
(Ju'an Group)

389
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:33,657
I heard

390
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,296
you fainted at the company yesterday.

391
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:38,457
Are you okay?

392
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:43,257
Luo Yan,

393
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,217
I have something to tell you.

394
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:46,816
Okay?

395
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:56,017
Go ahead.

396
00:19:58,296 --> 00:19:59,217
Let's

397
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:00,697
reconcile.

398
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:04,177
As it is now, the company

399
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:06,336
can be inherited by us together.

400
00:20:06,697 --> 00:20:08,017
Isn't that pretty good too?

401
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:13,657
You said before
that you must bring me down.

402
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,177
Having gone through
a lot of things recently,

403
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,056
I've realized

404
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:21,816
we are brothers.

405
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:24,296
After fighting for so long,
we haven't had an outcome.

406
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:26,977
And even if you persist to the end,

407
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:28,737
you may not necessarily beat me.

408
00:20:30,217 --> 00:20:31,017
Of course,

409
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:31,856
the same goes for me.

410
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:34,536
Even if I get the position of the heir,

411
00:20:34,737 --> 00:20:37,657
I have to avoid being marginalized
by other veteran shareholders.

412
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:39,897
Why don't we join hands

413
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:42,096
to firmly keep Ju'an in control

414
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:43,376
of us, who are family?

415
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:47,056
Family?

416
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:49,017
My surname is Luo.

417
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,296
Your surname is An.

418
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,816
Since when did we become family?

419
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:55,017
If you're not my family,

420
00:20:55,017 --> 00:20:56,697
why did my father value you so much?

421
00:20:58,697 --> 00:20:59,697
In his eyes,

422
00:21:01,017 --> 00:21:03,017
everyone is a tool that can be used.

423
00:21:05,136 --> 00:21:06,056
I am just

424
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:08,497
more suitable for the heir position.

425
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:11,776
However, compared to An Liminghui,

426
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:13,737
he does value me.

427
00:21:14,697 --> 00:21:16,177
Don't say that.

428
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:17,897
In fact, after you went in,

429
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:19,177
Grandma was very worried

430
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,257
and anxious too.

431
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:25,257
She was afraid that I would bring shame

432
00:21:25,897 --> 00:21:27,376
to the group as an illegitimate son.

433
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:29,616
Don't try to persuade me.

434
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:31,937
Rather than wasting time on me,

435
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,776
you might as well ask Grandma

436
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:35,457
whether she is willing to let me

437
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,457
share Ju'an equally
with her beloved grandson.

438
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:40,856
No way.

439
00:21:40,856 --> 00:21:41,856
Absolutely not.

440
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:44,576
I have persisted for so many years

441
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,856
just to hand over Ju'an to you.

442
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:47,657
Grandma,

443
00:21:47,657 --> 00:21:49,417
I didn't say I don't want Ju'an.

444
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:51,497
I just want to manage it
together with Luo Yan.

445
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:52,616
No.

446
00:22:00,217 --> 00:22:01,576
Grandma.

447
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:03,096
Grandma.

448
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,737
Yushen, you're so kind-hearted.

449
00:22:08,856 --> 00:22:09,897
But Luo Yan

450
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:11,816
is nothing but a wolf.

451
00:22:12,616 --> 00:22:14,096
If you keep him by your side,

452
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:15,937
he might bite you someday.

453
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:19,136
Grandma,

454
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,457
why would you think that way?

455
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:24,257
I was not in the company
for the past few years,

456
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:26,096
but I know exactly what has happened

457
00:22:26,457 --> 00:22:28,017
in the company.

458
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:31,776
Luo Yan acts ruthlessly

459
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:32,977
and is merciless.

460
00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:35,856
When a person without emotion

461
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:38,177
masters resources and power,

462
00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:39,657
it will have a terrible impact

463
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:42,217
on the entire society.

464
00:22:43,457 --> 00:22:44,136
Grandma,

465
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:46,497
actually, he is not bad by nature.

466
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:47,576
The past is the past...

467
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:48,296
Alright.

468
00:22:49,257 --> 00:22:49,977
Never mind.

469
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:52,336
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

470
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:54,417
I've invited Qin Honghong
to the company.

471
00:22:54,657 --> 00:22:55,657
Qin Honghong?

472
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:57,657
It's Grandma Qin.

473
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,576
She is the widow of the chairman
of Xingye Entertainment.

474
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:03,616
She has decision-making power
in the company.

475
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,657
Receive her well

476
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:07,776
and secure that business deal from her.

477
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:10,457
Then your place as the heir

478
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:12,536
will be completely secure.

479
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:17,856
Okay, Grandma.

480
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:18,616
Rest assured.

481
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:19,897
I will not disappoint you.

482
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:21,697
Good.

483
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:25,497
This is rare.

484
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:28,776
I didn't expect you
to invite me to catch up.

485
00:23:30,257 --> 00:23:32,096
You've lost your husband,

486
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:33,576
and your child is abroad.

487
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,897
I was afraid that you'd be lonely.

488
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,536
Really?

489
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:40,977
I think it's mainly

490
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:43,017
for the movie investment fund, right?

491
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:46,056
Well,

492
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:48,296
having been at odds for so many years,

493
00:23:48,536 --> 00:23:50,576
we've kind of been old friends
by now, right?

494
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:52,856
Not to mention anything else,

495
00:23:53,136 --> 00:23:55,457
you know my style of doing business.

496
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:58,417
You can rest assured
of cooperating with me.

497
00:24:00,576 --> 00:24:01,737
That is true.

498
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:03,136
Actually,

499
00:24:03,136 --> 00:24:04,336
you needn't say more.

500
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:06,217
I've already

501
00:24:06,217 --> 00:24:08,576
sent the fund agreement
to your grandson.

502
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:09,856
If all goes well,

503
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:12,177
our legal personnel can meet this week

504
00:24:12,177 --> 00:24:14,336
and then proceed
with the contract process.

505
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,616
What are you doing here?

506
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,457
He is...

507
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:24,296
I told him to come.

508
00:24:24,457 --> 00:24:26,136
Grandma Qin, let me introduce you.

509
00:24:26,536 --> 00:24:28,376
This is my younger brother, Luo Yan.

510
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:30,376
I asked him to come over

511
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:31,697
and listen to the discussion.

512
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:34,576
I came in order to return your favor.

513
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:35,616
I know.

514
00:24:36,937 --> 00:24:38,017
He is your

515
00:24:38,017 --> 00:24:39,776
other grandson, right?

516
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:40,737
Alright.

517
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:43,056
Since you are here, have a seat.

518
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:44,177
Sit.

519
00:24:53,017 --> 00:24:54,296
Luo

520
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:55,977
is indeed handsome.

521
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:58,056
Looking at him,

522
00:24:58,056 --> 00:25:00,457
you know his mother is a great beauty.

523
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:03,616
No wonder Xiangyang
couldn't resist her then.

524
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:07,737
Hello, Ms. Qin.

525
00:25:08,657 --> 00:25:10,177
I came today to help

526
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:12,657
my brother

527
00:25:13,257 --> 00:25:15,177
deal with the movie fund affairs.

528
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:18,136
I have no choice.

529
00:25:18,296 --> 00:25:20,497
I am not very familiar
with the entertainment industry.

530
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:23,376
I have read the agreement you sent.

531
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:25,816
There are no issues
from a capital perspective.

532
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:27,536
But from a business standpoint,

533
00:25:27,737 --> 00:25:29,177
there are still significant risks.

534
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:30,136
First of all,

535
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:32,257
your company's collateral

536
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:33,536
is an unreleased movie.

537
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:36,536
Although the cast and production crew
are very luxurious,

538
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:38,776
there are significant uncertainties.

539
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:39,657
Secondly,

540
00:25:40,257 --> 00:25:41,816
your company's projects next year

541
00:25:41,816 --> 00:25:44,096
will all star Cindy,
the artist of yours.

542
00:25:44,457 --> 00:25:45,657
Although she ascended

543
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:47,856
to the ranks of top-tier actresses
last year,

544
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:50,737
putting all the chips on one person

545
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:52,056
isn't quite proper.

546
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:56,457
Xingye is a leading company
in Jincheng's entertainment industry

547
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:57,657
after all.

548
00:25:57,816 --> 00:25:58,457
What?

549
00:25:58,776 --> 00:26:01,017
Are you doubting our capabilities?

550
00:26:02,257 --> 00:26:03,616
It's not related.

551
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:05,737
I respect Xingye's status,

552
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,776
but I must point out the issues

553
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:08,977
and risks that exist.

554
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:10,136
Otherwise,

555
00:26:10,296 --> 00:26:11,296
rushing into this deal

556
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:12,536
will only make our company

557
00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:13,776
a fallback for your company.

558
00:26:14,776 --> 00:26:15,697
I chose

559
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:17,977
to cooperate with Young An
on this project

560
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,616
because of the An family's sake.

561
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:21,657
What does it

562
00:26:21,816 --> 00:26:22,977
have to do with you?

563
00:26:25,136 --> 00:26:27,017
I am one of the executives at Ju'an.

564
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,657
I have the right and obligation
to supervise.

565
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:31,576
You are the son of a mistress.

566
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:33,417
Now you consider yourself an An?

567
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:34,296
How could you...

568
00:26:34,296 --> 00:26:35,056
Enough.

569
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:38,257
We're here to discuss business,

570
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:39,257
not to quarrel.

571
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:40,457
Exactly.

572
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:41,616
Some people

573
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:43,017
are just here to spoil the mood.

574
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:45,296
They can't even put themselves
in the right place.

575
00:26:45,497 --> 00:26:46,296
Exactly.

576
00:26:46,296 --> 00:26:47,136
It's you,

577
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:48,177
Qin Honghong.

578
00:26:50,257 --> 00:26:51,737
You're in my company.

579
00:26:52,096 --> 00:26:53,536
But to my family,

580
00:26:53,536 --> 00:26:55,497
you spoke such nonsense.

581
00:26:56,296 --> 00:26:58,977
Do you have
any elders' manners and decency?

582
00:27:01,257 --> 00:27:01,920
But...

583
00:27:02,136 --> 00:27:02,977
Isn't he just...

584
00:27:05,096 --> 00:27:06,056
Li Minghui,

585
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,897
you'd better think it through.

586
00:27:08,257 --> 00:27:09,977
For such an illegitimate child,

587
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:12,257
would you abandon
the collaboration with Xingye?

588
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:14,576
Let's go.

589
00:27:15,257 --> 00:27:16,737
Let's go home for the festival.

590
00:27:18,977 --> 00:27:19,497
Let's go.

591
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:31,457
Qin Honghong

592
00:27:31,657 --> 00:27:32,737
went too far.

593
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:33,657
Exactly.

594
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:36,177
Fortunately, you stood up
for Luo Yan, Grandma.

595
00:27:41,056 --> 00:27:42,217
I will sort out

596
00:27:42,217 --> 00:27:43,217
all Xingye's problems.

597
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:44,616
Just review the report later.

598
00:27:47,497 --> 00:27:48,776
Excuse me.

599
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,376
Do the men in this household not cook?

600
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:53,536
Luo Yan,

601
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:54,977
don't you cook?

602
00:27:57,937 --> 00:27:58,657
Me?

603
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,336
You two usually argue pretty fiercely.

604
00:28:22,497 --> 00:28:23,737
But you can't handle housework?

605
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:26,657
Hurry up.

606
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:28,376
Tonight at eight o'clock,

607
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,737
the dinner must start.

608
00:28:47,217 --> 00:28:48,177
Let me try.

609
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:53,136
Not bad, little brother.

610
00:28:55,296 --> 00:28:56,017
Let me wipe it.

611
00:29:03,096 --> 00:29:04,096
Yours is also quite good.

612
00:29:30,697 --> 00:29:32,336
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival,

613
00:29:32,336 --> 00:29:33,737
a day for family reunions.

614
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:35,977
It's also the first time

615
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:40,697
for our whole family

616
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,376
to gather together for dinner.

617
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:45,536
May our family be as complete
as the full moon.

618
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:47,257
May we be smooth and in good health.

619
00:29:48,257 --> 00:29:49,096
Enough said.

620
00:29:49,296 --> 00:29:50,336
Let's eat mooncakes.

621
00:29:55,017 --> 00:29:56,816
Who baked these mooncakes?

622
00:30:03,657 --> 00:30:05,737
You're so filial.

623
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:11,744
(Filial)

624
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:13,417
An Yushen,

625
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:16,096
you don't think

626
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:17,536
that by deliberately doing so today,

627
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:18,720
I would say yes, right?

628
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,880
(Filial)

629
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:29,136
I've endured for so many years.

630
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:31,977
Just a dinner won't erase everything.

631
00:30:33,056 --> 00:30:34,497
I'd rather be out

632
00:30:35,056 --> 00:30:36,457
than be part of the An family

633
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:38,257
and share the inheritance with you.
