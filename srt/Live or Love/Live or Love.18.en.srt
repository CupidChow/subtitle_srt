=Live or Love?=

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,832
=Live or Love?=

3
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:52,288
=Episode 18=

4
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:54,552
Stay calm.

5
00:00:54,952 --> 00:00:55,671
Stay calm.

6
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,592
Let go of the savior complex.

7
00:00:57,711 --> 00:00:59,111
Respect others' destinies.

8
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:00,391
Nonsense.

9
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:01,952
I just want to skin him alive.

10
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,512
Well,

11
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:03,751
blame the screenwriter.

12
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:04,551
It's not his fault.

13
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:06,352
Then I'll skin him today first,

14
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:07,471
and adjust settings later.

15
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:09,232
No one can bully my people.

16
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:10,911
Feng Zhixing is one of my people, too.

17
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:12,072
He's hospitalized due to me.

18
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,471
Yin Zhiluo has helped you so many times.

19
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:15,072
She saved

20
00:01:15,072 --> 00:01:16,632
you from Li Zheng's trap.

21
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:21,352
Are you taking men's side now?

22
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,191
No, no.

23
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:22,872
I wouldn't dare.

24
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:25,271
That, um...

25
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:28,992
Wait, just a moment.

26
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:30,352
Young An,

27
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:31,191
Madam,

28
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:33,632
what were you saying
about the screenwriter?

29
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,352
Why did you call me

30
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,831
here today?

31
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:39,592
Well, well, Feng,

32
00:01:39,952 --> 00:01:41,471
still pretending to be innocent?

33
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:44,911
You acted like an honest person,

34
00:01:44,952 --> 00:01:46,632
now you've got someone pregnant,

35
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:47,632
shirking responsibility.

36
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:48,911
What are you saying?

37
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:51,111
About the baby,

38
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,271
I already know.

39
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,712
I...

40
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:55,751
I will take responsibility.

41
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:58,712
The child is mine,

42
00:01:58,712 --> 00:01:59,712
nothing to do with you.

43
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:02,432
There's no need
to discuss taking responsibility.

44
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:04,352
How is it not my concern?

45
00:02:04,712 --> 00:02:05,391
Clearly...

46
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,072
If I say no, then it's no.

47
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:09,151
Have you misunderstood something?

48
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:11,312
Show the guest out.

49
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:15,192
Mr. Feng,

50
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:15,991
please leave.

51
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:29,871
I guess I've found out

52
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:31,711
not a single one of you men is honest.

53
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:33,871
Same leader, same followers.

54
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:36,352
You're largely responsible
for your subordinate's conduct.

55
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:44,352
Calm down, will you?

56
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:47,431
Didn't he go to Yin Zhiluo?

57
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:48,591
Wait a moment.

58
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:54,711
I've checked out that man of Luo Yun.

59
00:02:55,952 --> 00:02:56,792
Indeed, problematic.

60
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:00,632
He's unemployed,

61
00:03:00,632 --> 00:03:01,912
and a professional gambler.

62
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:03,952
Relying on his good looks,

63
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:05,551
he mingles among various women

64
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:07,512
until he's drained them dry.

65
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:08,551
And then he abandons them.

66
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:09,671
Send these documents

67
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:10,792
to Luo Yun.

68
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:15,271
To wake someone who's faking sleep,

69
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:16,991
just showing her this is not enough.

70
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:19,391
She will continue to make excuses
and deceive herself.

71
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,551
She needs to see with her own eyes

72
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:23,192
the true color of this man.

73
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:26,792
How?

74
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:30,671
To make a man show his true colors,

75
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:32,232
what other way could there be?

76
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,192
I understand.

77
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:42,991
I've got a cash cow recently,

78
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,312
and have been keeping it for long.

79
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:46,312
I'll have money soon.

80
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:57,671
I'm sorry

81
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,512
I bumped into you.

82
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:00,711
It's alright.

83
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:02,591
Anyway, it's not too valuable.

84
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:05,072
From your accent,

85
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:05,871
you're from Hong Kong, China?

86
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:07,472
You can tell?

87
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:10,151
I once lived there.

88
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:12,232
Then we are fellow townspeople.

89
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,512
My family business is all there.

90
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:15,992
My husband is busy doing business.

91
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:17,591
So I came to Jincheng to relax.

92
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:19,791
But I'm not very familiar with it here.

93
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:22,591
I'm familiar.

94
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,752
What you want to know?

95
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:24,632
Ask me anything.

96
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,151
That's great.

97
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:27,791
You can be my guide.

98
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,112
I'll pay you.

99
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:31,672
It would be an honor.

100
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:33,312
But there's no need for payment.

101
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:35,271
Delighted to be with a beauty like you,

102
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:36,231
traveling Together.

103
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:38,112
It's already the best reward.

104
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:42,271
Then let's get in the car.

105
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:43,591
Please.

106
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:51,711
Let me.

107
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,031
Ma'am,

108
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:06,231
sorry

109
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:07,351
to have left you lonely.

110
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:09,471
Mind your own business

111
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:10,552
and just drive.

112
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:11,752
Okay, ma'am.

113
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,072
Luckily I met you today.

114
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:35,552
I had a lot of fun.

115
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,031
Then...

116
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:38,672
See you next time.

117
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:41,471
(Three,)

118
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:42,351
(two,)

119
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:43,112
(one.)

120
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:43,632
Wait.

121
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:49,552
It's a bit shabby,

122
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:50,711
but

123
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,552
I just saw it at the florist.

124
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,911
It suited you well.

125
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:55,151
So I bought it.

126
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:57,632
I have siblings at home.

127
00:05:57,632 --> 00:05:58,791
I must send money to them.

128
00:05:59,312 --> 00:05:59,911
So, I

129
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:01,432
can only get you one flower.

130
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:04,791
Turns out you're so responsible.

131
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:06,952
But

132
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:08,911
pink is so cute.

133
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:11,672
Compared to a lonely woman like me,

134
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,432
it should suit a young girl better.

135
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:17,351
In my eyes,

136
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,271
you are the young and beautiful girl.

137
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:27,231
How come
you never looked at me this way?

138
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:36,031
Not tricking him to home?

139
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:37,231
So do you want me to...

140
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,552
Do you

141
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:44,072
want to go up and sit for a while?

142
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:47,512
Okay.

143
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:56,151
Good, Fang Li.

144
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:57,471
You're an expert.

145
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:15,831
Miss Fang.

146
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:17,312
One question.

147
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:18,872
How come

148
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,192
I don't
know my girlfriend enough at all?

149
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:22,911
Blame yourself then

150
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:24,231
for limited experience.

151
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:26,992
That one.

152
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:28,632
So

153
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:30,151
why are you usually so mean to me?

154
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:33,591
Be honest with me.

155
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:34,672
Tell me,

156
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,632
who did you learn these tricks from?

157
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:38,312
Do I need to learn?

158
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,151
Every woman knows how.

159
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,872
But you men

160
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:43,831
just like innocent little girls.

161
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,632
There's a flaw in your aesthetics.

162
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:49,151
If you regret it, just say so.

163
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:51,752
I wouldn't dare.

164
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,752
I'll never regret it.

165
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:54,791
I'm just into someone like you,

166
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:55,791
so unrestrained.

167
00:07:58,351 --> 00:07:59,112
I got champagne.

168
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,312
Help me get it.

169
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,432
Okay.

170
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:10,791
Champagne delivered.

171
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:12,911
Why don't we have a talk?

172
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:26,632
What are you doing here?

173
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:27,992
I...

174
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:29,432
Of course it's to get close to me.

175
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:30,351
Look,

176
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,351
he gave me a rose worth ten yuan.

177
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:35,072
So sincere.

178
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:39,272
So you called me

179
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:40,312
not to sign a contract?

180
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,511
It's for the contract.

181
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,231
But before that,

182
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,072
I think you need to understand

183
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:47,912
the man you're supporting
by going against the An family.

184
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,912
He can be with any woman.

185
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:50,912
With money,

186
00:08:50,912 --> 00:08:52,272
he can be with just any woman.

187
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:55,312
Yun,

188
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:58,591
you haven't got the money for long.

189
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:00,072
I really need to pay off debts.

190
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:02,072
You know,

191
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:02,871
out here,

192
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:04,272
dealing with these women

193
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,392
makes me feel bad too!

194
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:05,912
I...

195
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:06,952
I want to be with you.

196
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:08,032
But look,

197
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:09,392
have you tried?

198
00:09:10,631 --> 00:09:11,471
You see?

199
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,831
He's still trying to spin the truth,
even now.

200
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:14,392
So he can...

201
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:15,111
That's enough.

202
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:18,032
You finally figured it out.

203
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:19,751
I mean you, enough.

204
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:22,552
Does he like me for who I am
or for my money?

205
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:23,952
I really don't care.

206
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:26,032
As long as he's by my side,

207
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:27,471
that's all I want.

208
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:30,272
Is that so?

209
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:32,792
Is he really willing to stay
by your side?

210
00:09:35,152 --> 00:09:35,912
I sent it to you.

211
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:36,871
Have a look yourself.

212
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:42,912
These are fifteen

213
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:44,152
personal accident insurance.

214
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:46,231
The total coverage is thirty million.

215
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,392
He's secured substantial policies,

216
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:50,312
and the beneficiary is himself.

217
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:52,111
Did you know about all of this?

218
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:53,392
Your lover

219
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,032
bought you so many accident insurances.

220
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:56,272
Are you sure

221
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:57,991
that he's after your money,

222
00:09:58,152 --> 00:09:59,351
and not your life?

223
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:02,152
Yun,

224
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:03,552
listen to me,

225
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:04,631
all these

226
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:05,991
are just in case.

227
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:07,272
I have also

228
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:08,912
taken out insurance on myself,

229
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:09,991
with you as the beneficiary.

230
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:11,032
Have a look...

231
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:12,631
You hit me?

232
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:17,952
I've been tolerating you

233
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:19,672
out of pity for you.

234
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:22,591
You want me dead?

235
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:24,751
Well, let's just see

236
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,711
who can be more

237
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:27,871
reckless.

238
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,192
Ms. Luo,

239
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:50,552
what do you plan to do?

240
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:53,952
I'm going to

241
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:55,432
leave Jincheng.

242
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:57,471
I should never have come back.

243
00:10:58,072 --> 00:10:59,631
Leaving already?

244
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:01,591
We haven't signed our agreement yet.

245
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,351
An Xiangyang owes you compensation.

246
00:11:03,351 --> 00:11:04,432
It's what you deserve.

247
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:08,591
So tomorrow,

248
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:09,912
we'll sign the agreement.

249
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:11,471
Don't stand me up.

250
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:30,792
Still angry because of Luo Yun's matter?

251
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:33,831
I'm having some regrets.

252
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:35,072
Why?

253
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:38,111
I was just anxious
to make her see clearly before.

254
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:39,831
Only now do I feel

255
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:42,231
I've suddenly subjected her
to such a great shock.

256
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:43,831
Will she do something foolish?

257
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:45,312
No, she won't.

258
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,231
People learn.

259
00:11:47,312 --> 00:11:48,192
After a setback,

260
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:49,392
we learn to protect ourselves.

261
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:52,831
You're quite good at
saying these profound things, huh?

262
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:55,552
What exactly have you experienced?

263
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:57,711
It's just

264
00:11:57,711 --> 00:11:59,552
a story by ordinary poor people.

265
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:00,831
Shall I tell you?

266
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,111
If it's an unpleasant memory,

267
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:10,111
wipe it clean.

268
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:11,952
I will protect you.

269
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:12,711
Did you hear that?

270
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:19,111
Let's go.

271
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:52,952
Baby,

272
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:54,552
can you wait here for me?

273
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,351
I will go and buy you some candy.

274
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:57,432
Okay.

275
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:16,751
Mom!

276
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:19,192
Mom!

277
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:23,111
Mom!

278
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:25,152
Mom!

279
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:28,471
Mom!

280
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:31,111
Mom!

281
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:33,552
Mom!

282
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,231
Mom!

283
00:13:38,711 --> 00:13:40,312
Mom!

284
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,872
(Fang Lili)

285
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,231
(Luo Yun will visit
the An family tomorrow.)

286
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:17,728
(Compensation Agreement)

287
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:25,312
(40 million in economic aid)

288
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:26,792
Forty million?

289
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:29,192
Why is the price so high?

290
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,952
Luo Yun agrees to surrender
this recording,

291
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:37,152
which was recorded by your side
back then.

292
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:38,871
How about I play it for you

293
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:40,711
and see if it's worth forty million?

294
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:52,312
This money isn't for extortion
or coercion.

295
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,312
It's the compensation you owe
to this woman.

296
00:14:56,351 --> 00:14:57,991
I believe, with your grace,

297
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,831
you wouldn't haggle over this.

298
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:05,792
I understand.

299
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:09,711
Let's leave it there.

300
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:46,392
Lu.

301
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:47,871
Who is it?

302
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:49,432
It's...

303
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:50,952
It's Mr. Luo.

304
00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:57,591
I'll go and tell Grandma.

305
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:58,912
Please wait a moment.

306
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:00,871
Let him in.

307
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:08,792
What brings you here?

308
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:09,991
I...

309
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:12,792
I'm reporting to Mr. An about work.

310
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:15,511
Go ahead.

311
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:18,192
She's upstairs.

312
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:48,096
(Party A: Luo Yun)

313
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:50,656
(Date: 2023.9.21)

314
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,111
Ms. Luo,

315
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:55,912
this agreement officially takes effect
from today.

316
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:58,312
I hope we can all adhere to the terms,

317
00:16:58,471 --> 00:16:59,831
and avoid triggering breaches.

318
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:00,711
Rest assured.

319
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:01,952
The things I've promised,

320
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:02,952
I won't regret.

321
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:05,271
I think you should be free now.

322
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:06,432
The path ahead

323
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:08,231
is for you to walk on your own.

324
00:17:08,912 --> 00:17:09,872
What?

325
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:15,152
I mean to say,

326
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:16,952
each of our backgrounds

327
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:19,031
and people we meet when we're young

328
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:21,192
are like plot setting.

329
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:22,711
But the road ahead

330
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:24,192
can be decided by ourselves.

331
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,152
You're quite an interesting person.

332
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:31,711
However, Miss Fang,

333
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,231
I have one more request.

334
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:38,592
I want to see

335
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:39,511
my son.

336
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:42,471
Okay.

337
00:17:42,872 --> 00:17:43,872
I'll give him a call.

338
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:48,896
(Luo Yan)

339
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:15,311
Mind a drink together?

340
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:19,071
I do mind.

341
00:20:20,632 --> 00:20:21,952
Are you here to mock me?

342
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:25,432
I could do that at the company,

343
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:26,751
no need to make a special trip.

344
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,031
Whiskey for two.

345
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:28,872
Alright.

346
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,352
Can't we even have a drink together?

347
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:39,632
What exactly do you want?

348
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:40,832
Like I said,

349
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:41,672
a drink together.

350
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:23,592
Why?

351
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:29,112
(I have a friend,)

352
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:30,471
(named Hang.)

353
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:32,551
(Very much like you.)

354
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:34,632
(His dad is a bad guy,)

355
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:36,231
(and his mom remarried.)

356
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,071
(He wanted to do business,)

357
00:21:39,872 --> 00:21:41,832
(but was cheated
by his girlfriend at the time.)

358
00:21:43,112 --> 00:21:43,872
(That day,)

359
00:21:44,432 --> 00:21:46,192
(he was going to propose.)

360
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:47,711
(Nonsense.)

361
00:21:48,511 --> 00:21:50,112
(How could you befriend such a person?)

362
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:51,832
(Don't say that.)

363
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:54,231
(I think he is very handsome.)

364
00:21:55,352 --> 00:21:56,672
(He's doing well now.)

365
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,392
(Because)

366
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:00,791
(he already forgave himself.)

367
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:42,751
(Ju'an Group)
Lili?

368
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:44,071
Wasn't she sent back home?

369
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:45,231
Yes.

370
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:46,511
What is she doing here?

371
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:06,071
Hello, Mr. An.

372
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:07,392
Hello, all.

373
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:08,471
Lili,

374
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:09,872
perfect timing.

375
00:23:10,352 --> 00:23:11,872
I was about to announce

376
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,352
that starting today,

377
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:15,392
you will return to work at the company,

378
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:18,791
still holding a position
in Yushen's Investment Division.

379
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:21,192
But, sir,

380
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:22,432
Fang Lili, before...

381
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:24,551
What happened before is in the past.

382
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:27,471
Lili has reflected upon it.

383
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:29,432
The company

384
00:23:29,432 --> 00:23:31,192
needs capable people.

385
00:23:31,471 --> 00:23:32,952
About her return,

386
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:35,471
I am informing you,

387
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:36,592
not consulting.

388
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:38,632
Thank you, sir.

389
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:40,192
I will not let you down.

390
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:45,791
So let's call it a day.

391
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:55,471
I have done what I promised you.

392
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:58,352
Since you're back, just work hard.

393
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:00,751
Don't cause any more trouble for me.

394
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:11,311
Miss Fang,

395
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:13,872
could I have a word with you?

396
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:18,711
Mr. Luo,

397
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:21,152
she is now mine.

398
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,031
Our departments

399
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:24,471
are in direct competition.

400
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,991
You meeting her like this

401
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:26,991
isn't quite appropriate.

402
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,071
Young An,

403
00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:29,112
don't worry.

404
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:31,432
Mr. Luo will not poach this time.

405
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:34,592
He probably
just wants to celebrate my return

406
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:36,311
and catch up on old times.

407
00:24:38,632 --> 00:24:39,152
Okay.

408
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:41,471
But I can only give you five minutes.

409
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:43,192
Thank you.

410
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:45,352
I know you helped my...

411
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,872
You helped Luo Yun

412
00:24:49,872 --> 00:24:51,311
get some extra compensation.

413
00:24:52,231 --> 00:24:53,192
You're overthinking it.

414
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:54,751
Only by solving her problem

415
00:24:54,751 --> 00:24:56,071
can I return to the company.

416
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:58,432
This is the condition
I reached with Mr. An.

417
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:02,672
If your only goal was this,

418
00:25:03,592 --> 00:25:05,352
why help her with that thirty million

419
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:07,711
and make Mr. An so displeased?

420
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:10,352
Do you want the truth?

421
00:25:10,832 --> 00:25:11,352
Of course.

422
00:25:12,832 --> 00:25:14,071
The truth is,

423
00:25:14,152 --> 00:25:14,832
in that moment,

424
00:25:14,832 --> 00:25:16,791
I wasn't dwelling on our entanglement,

425
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:18,832
nor your relationship with Luo Yun.

426
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:21,192
I simply saw her as a woman.

427
00:25:21,592 --> 00:25:23,311
She did nothing wrong,

428
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:24,311
yet for An Xiangyang

429
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:25,471
and an unlit relationship,

430
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:26,952
she paid with her youth.

431
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,311
So no matter what,

432
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:29,791
she cannot become the one

433
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,352
who ends up with nothing.

434
00:25:32,352 --> 00:25:33,832
Since this matter came to me,

435
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:36,071
as a woman,
I am obligated to help another woman.

436
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,791
An unlit relationship.

437
00:25:44,392 --> 00:25:45,271
You're right.

438
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:48,551
No one else should

439
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,112
become such a sacrifice.

440
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:54,112
Mr. Luo,

441
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:56,112
five minutes is up.

442
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:03,392
We'll be leaving.

443
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,112
Bye.

444
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:28,832
What's wrong,

445
00:26:28,832 --> 00:26:29,592
Secretary Lin?

446
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:34,511
This is the contract I've revised.

447
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:35,791
Please sign it.

448
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:48,432
I'll be leaving next week.

449
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:51,791
There are documents to be processed.

450
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:55,352
Okay.

451
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:01,872
About the resignation,

452
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:03,192
I've already submitted it.

453
00:27:07,152 --> 00:27:08,071
You're in a rush?

454
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:10,112
What's left,

455
00:27:10,352 --> 00:27:11,672
I'll have Luo Lei take over.

456
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:13,711
No need to come tomorrow afternoon.

457
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:20,352
Take this.

458
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,112
Lin Lu,

459
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:02,672
wish you

460
00:28:04,872 --> 00:28:06,392
a pleasant life there.

461
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:08,511
All the best.

462
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:14,672
Thank you.

463
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:31,031
Mr. Luo,

464
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:33,952
here's the revised contract
for Hengxing Building.

465
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,352
Please take a look.

466
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:40,471
Okay.

467
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:41,311
No problem.

468
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:43,511
Then I'll go make the formal one.

469
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:44,551
At that time,

470
00:28:44,711 --> 00:28:45,912
you'll need to stamp it.

471
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:48,432
We need to mail this contract

472
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:49,352
to Mr. Lu today.

473
00:28:49,991 --> 00:28:50,392
Right.

474
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:51,071
Go.

475
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:24,231
Here to pick up Lin Lu?

476
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:27,551
Right.

477
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:29,192
To apply for a visa.

478
00:29:29,832 --> 00:29:30,711
We'll leave next week.

479
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:38,031
Actually,

480
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:41,071
going out to live
in a different environment

481
00:29:42,592 --> 00:29:43,952
is a good thing for her.

482
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:46,551
Over the years, in here,

483
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,352
she has not lived happily.

484
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:52,872
Raised in the An family since youth,

485
00:29:56,432 --> 00:29:57,511
we all remain outsiders.

486
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:01,192
Every single day of her life

487
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:02,832
has been lived with caution,

488
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:07,511
because she has no family to rely on.

489
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:12,071
What any girl

490
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:13,872
can easily obtain,

491
00:30:15,471 --> 00:30:17,352
for her, is unattainable.

492
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:20,031
Her leaving here

493
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:22,031
means she no longer has to

494
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,271
live by reading others' faces.

495
00:30:25,711 --> 00:30:27,271
I won't fret over her errors, too.

496
00:30:28,112 --> 00:30:28,952
Errors?

497
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:33,311
It's okay.

498
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:35,592
It's just carelessness at work.

499
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,471
I no longer have to worry for her.

500
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:49,711
