00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:47,842
=Live or Love?=

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,672
=Live or Love?=

3
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:52,320
=Episode 17=

4
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:05,449
Lili, you've worked hard today.

5
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,329
These dishes

6
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:10,648
were all personally made by our Lili.

7
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:12,729
This soup

8
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,689
has been simmered... How many hours?

9
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:17,288
Three hours.

10
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:20,529
Did you hear it?

11
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:22,208
Three hours.

12
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:23,969
Lili is really capable.

13
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:25,049
Lili,

14
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:26,809
introduce this soup for us.

15
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:28,729
It's quite exquisite.

16
00:01:33,488 --> 00:01:34,729
15 grams of ginseng,

17
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:35,729
15 grams of Chinese yam,

18
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:36,848
two quails,

19
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:38,529
and 250 grams of lean meat.

20
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:39,408
It has

21
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:40,928
beneficial to stomach and spleen.

22
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,449
Yushen, how do you know so well?

23
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,768
Because

24
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,848
I watched my wife make them.

25
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:55,408
Take a look.

26
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,249
What a good relationship.

27
00:01:57,848 --> 00:01:59,169
Our Yushen

28
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:00,848
cherishes his wife a lot.

29
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:06,408
Lili,

30
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,088
why are you so clumsy?

31
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:10,289
Yeah.

32
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:11,968
Not nimble at all,

33
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:13,368
making thumping noises,

34
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:15,808
which even scared me.

35
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:17,928
Lili,

36
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,129
as a daughter-in-law in the An family,

37
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:22,569
you can't just put on an act.

38
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,889
You need to be appropriate
in every aspect.

39
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:26,729
Yeah.

40
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,129
When having a meal,

41
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,009
you even dropped your chopsticks.

42
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:32,248
So clumsy.

43
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:35,609
It's okay.

44
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:36,928
I'll go get you a new pair.

45
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:37,928
Yushen,

46
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:39,488
what did you say?

47
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:40,729
Here's the thing.

48
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:42,289
In our family,

49
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:44,569
we don't place so much emphasis
on superficial seniority.

50
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,808
Lili is superior to me in every way.

51
00:02:46,928 --> 00:02:48,528
She teaches me about life and work,

52
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:50,808
that's why I respect her very much.

53
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:52,409
Auntie,

54
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:55,409
how about
you also show Lili some respect?

55
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:56,528
We're family after all.

56
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:57,688
Be nice.

57
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:58,528
It's nothing.

58
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:00,449
I...

59
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:01,289
I...

60
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:03,208
I'm going to the restroom.

61
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:04,488
I'll go with you.

62
00:03:04,928 --> 00:03:05,368
Let's go.

63
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,680
(As You Wish)

64
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:31,208
Mr. Luo,

65
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:33,208
we've been in line all day today.

66
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:35,009
Should we buy more for our friends?

67
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,248
Are you only buying one?

68
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,968
Yes, for just one person.

69
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:43,569
Mr. Luo,

70
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:45,289
you traveled far

71
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:46,289
for this gift.

72
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:48,609
It's for that friend, isn't it?

73
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,129
Have you told her

74
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:51,289
you don't want her to go?

75
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:55,488
Once she sees this,

76
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:57,248
she'll understand.

77
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:13,528
Lu,

78
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:14,528
is your hand okay now?

79
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:15,409
Let me do it.

80
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:16,649
It's fine.

81
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,169
This minor injury is no big deal.

82
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:20,248
You weren't scared just now, were you?

83
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,128
Every time they're here, it's like this

84
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:24,008
I'm used to it.

85
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:29,289
Have they ever bullied you?

86
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:32,289
They wouldn't bully me.

87
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:34,289
It's as if I'm invisible to them.

88
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:38,729
Don't move.

89
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,488
I've never looked at you this closely.

90
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:46,289
You really are very beautiful.

91
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,209
Lift your head,

92
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:52,409
and be more confident.

93
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:54,568
Anyone will surely

94
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:55,688
notice you.

95
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:02,448
Sorry.

96
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:03,609
I'll take a call.

97
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:21,120
(Luo Yan)

98
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:24,688
Hello?

99
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,289
After work tomorrow,

100
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:28,609
I need to talk with you.

101
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,928
Meet you at the same cafe.

102
00:05:43,072 --> 00:05:47,648
(Stay calm)

103
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:55,008
You've worked hard.

104
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:05,849
Let's discuss it.

105
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:08,969
Maybe I should just tell An Xiangyang

106
00:06:09,248 --> 00:06:10,409
I can't live without you.

107
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,688
You must come back to the company
with me now.

108
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:14,448
What?

109
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:16,368
No helping with my homework?

110
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,368
Yes,

111
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:18,448
I'm willing to.

112
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:20,289
But I think

113
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:23,049
I'm getting more and more charming.

114
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:28,008
Keep working hard.

115
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:31,089
You wish.

116
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:33,488
Yushen,

117
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:34,609
I want to speak to you.

118
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:37,089
It's nothing.

119
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:37,769
Go on.

120
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:46,328
I'm going out to grab a bite.

121
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,128
Fresh pigskin,

122
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:06,688
springy and smooth.

123
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:09,248
What did you say?

124
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:10,248
Ouch!

125
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:11,169
I'm sorry!

126
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:11,969
Sorry!

127
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:13,089
Sorry!

128
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:14,649
Sister.

129
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:16,128
Sister.

130
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:17,609
Sister.

131
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:22,568
I want to see An Xiangyang.

132
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:24,008
Ms. Luo, you can't go in.

133
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:25,888
An Xiangyang, come out here.

134
00:07:26,049 --> 00:07:26,688
Ms. Luo,

135
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:27,248
without appointment,

136
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:27,808
you can't...

137
00:07:27,808 --> 00:07:28,888
An Xiangyang!

138
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:30,888
Ms. Luo, please leave.

139
00:07:30,888 --> 00:07:32,169
You can't yell here.

140
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,128
Ms. Luo,

141
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:37,248
may I ask what you need with Mr. An?

142
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:38,609
If it's business,

143
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:40,808
please make an appointment
at the company.

144
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,209
I want to see him.

145
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:45,008
Since when
do I need to make an appointment?

146
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:46,849
Not going to the company

147
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:48,128
would be showing him respect.

148
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:50,529
It's okay if you don't let me see him.

149
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:53,448
Anyway, he will come to me in the end.

150
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:54,888
Just tell him

151
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:56,128
that I am...

152
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:58,328
I am not to be bullied.

153
00:07:58,688 --> 00:07:59,769
This time I came back

154
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:01,248
to settle

155
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,888
the old scores.

156
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:05,688
If I were to speak out
the messed-up things

157
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:07,008
An Xiangyang did back then,

158
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:09,209
he wouldn't be able to get away with it.

159
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:15,888
Hurry up and take care

160
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:16,808
of that woman.

161
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:19,209
If she

162
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,488
cause any negative impact to the group,

163
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:22,488
your position

164
00:08:23,248 --> 00:08:24,448
as the chairman

165
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:26,248
may become unstable!

166
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:41,529
Wait a minute.

167
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,409
I have something to say.

168
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,088
Not Yushen.

169
00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:48,808
You.

170
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:51,688
Me?

171
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:54,208
You want me to negotiate with her?

172
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,369
But you have to tell me who she is

173
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:01,808
and what her relationship with you.

174
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:04,848
I think

175
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:06,769
you've probably guessed it.

176
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:09,769
She is Luo Yan's mother,

177
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:11,529
Luo Yun.

178
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,088
Back then,

179
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:16,489
Madam An, to consolidate Ju'an Group,

180
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:17,649
forced me into marriage.

181
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:19,328
I had no choice.

182
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:23,249
In order to spite her,

183
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:25,289
after getting married,

184
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:27,529
I had quite a few

185
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:29,009
brief romances.

186
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:31,169
Luo Yun was one of them.

187
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:34,208
I thought it was just a fling.

188
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:35,968
I didn't expect

189
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:39,088
she actually, without my knowledge,

190
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:40,369
gave birth to Luo Yan.

191
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:43,489
(These kinds of soap opera twists)

192
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:45,009
(never end.)

193
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:47,289
(I don't want to do
this kind of side task.)

194
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:50,049
The year Luo Yan turned five,

195
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:52,808
Luo Yun left him at the doorstep

196
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:53,889
and then disappeared.

197
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:57,568
I didn't expect

198
00:09:57,808 --> 00:10:00,009
that after so many years,
she would show up again,

199
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:01,848
saying she wants to settle old scores.

200
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:06,249
Actually,

201
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:07,808
I do feel guilty towards her.

202
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:11,249
As long as her conditions
are not excessive,

203
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:12,968
I can agree to them.

204
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:15,049
But,

205
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,649
she must sign the agreement

206
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:20,249
to ensure
she never shows up in Jincheng again.

207
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:23,688
(He's just finding an excuse
for his mistakes.)

208
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,049
(In the end, it's the woman
who became the sacrifice.)

209
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:28,848
But you are the person she wants to see.

210
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:31,928
About such matters,

211
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:34,049
Madam An and I

212
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:35,728
should both avoid.

213
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:37,808
If I send Yushen talk to her,

214
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,529
that would only make her more repulsed.

215
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:42,448
You are the most suitable one.

216
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:45,328
You are both women.

217
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:46,769
I think,

218
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:48,808
it should be easier for you.

219
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:51,208
(What have women ever done to you?)

220
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:53,568
You entrust this matter

221
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:55,728
to someone who disturbed Ju'an.

222
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:57,808
Aren't you afraid
that I will mishandle it?

223
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:00,369
About this matter,

224
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,169
let's drop it for now.

225
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,608
I can do this task you ask,

226
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:07,608
but on one condition.

227
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:09,088
Tell me about it.

228
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,688
I want to return to Ju'an

229
00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:11,968
to assist Yushen.

230
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:16,489
Okay.

231
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:18,169
I agree.

232
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:19,808
Then I

233
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,568
will also take it as you agreed.

234
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:22,968
It's a deal.

235
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:31,008
(Shigengzi)

236
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:33,529
Beauty,

237
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:34,968
you're alone, huh?

238
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:36,808
Why are you here?

239
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:38,688
Just finished work.

240
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:40,169
There's an embroidery class tomorrow.

241
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:41,769
Helping you back to the company

242
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,088
is my top priority.

243
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:44,568
You do have a conscience.

244
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:46,409
The drinks later...

245
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:47,088
On me.

246
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:53,529
Please.

247
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:17,688
Who's there?

248
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:19,848
Hello,
I am An Xiangyang's daughter-in-law,

249
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:20,568
Fang Lili.

250
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:22,049
I'd like to have a talk with you.

251
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:24,848
I want to see An Xiangyang.

252
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:26,769
What use is a daughter-in-law?

253
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:36,728
Who is it again?

254
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:39,688
Speak.

255
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:40,928
Hello, I am

256
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:41,848
An Xiangyang's son,

257
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:42,649
An Yushen.

258
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:44,568
May I speak with you?

259
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,688
The son he had with someone else,

260
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:49,049
what do I have to do with you?

261
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:50,169
Get lost.

262
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:53,009
Mr. Zhou,

263
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:54,129
I'll have to trouble you.

264
00:12:54,568 --> 00:12:55,409
Our family

265
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:57,489
does not wish for Luo Yun
to perform here.

266
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:59,088
Please hire someone else.

267
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:08,409
- Hi.
- Hi.

268
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:10,928
Ms. Luo,

269
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,249
Mr. An agrees I represent him fully.

270
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,049
You can make any requests.

271
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:15,889
Okay,

272
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:17,808
I want money.

273
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:18,688
Okay.

274
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:19,529
How much?

275
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:21,448
Ten million.

276
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:23,328
That's easy.

277
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:24,928
I can agree to it right now.

278
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:28,169
I'm talking about ten million a month,

279
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:29,808
until the day I die.

280
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:34,568
Ms. Luo,

281
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:37,289
I have come with sincerity.

282
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,009
I have already shown great sincerity.

283
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:42,249
Ten million

284
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:43,568
a month.

285
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:45,289
An Xiangyang can afford it.

286
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:47,448
And about his dark history,

287
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:48,568
I know a lot.

288
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:50,208
Any of that can make

289
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,369
so-called

290
00:13:52,608 --> 00:13:54,088
stock market value of Ju'an...

291
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:56,649
Maybe

292
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,409
it'll drop by several hundred million.

293
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,848
I underestimated you before.

294
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:06,208
Well,

295
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:08,328
girl,

296
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:10,728
as someone older than you,

297
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:12,489
I suppose I've been through more.

298
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:14,289
Here's a piece of advice.

299
00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:17,568
Wealthy families are cold and ruthless.

300
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:19,448
Now they are using you as a pawn,

301
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:21,088
and later they'll cast you aside.

302
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:22,968
Be careful,
or you might end up worse than me.

303
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:29,608
Ms. Luo,

304
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:32,009
my wife and I
have a very good relationship.

305
00:14:33,848 --> 00:14:35,529
Whether in poverty or wealth,

306
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:38,009
in sickness and in health,

307
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:40,769
I will always love her,

308
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,889
comfort her, respect her,

309
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:44,088
and protect her.

310
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:49,328
Kid,

311
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:52,769
what are you trying to pull off here?

312
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:54,568
Playing the loving husband?

313
00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:58,088
Those old tricks of the An family,

314
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:00,009
don't try to fool me with them.

315
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:01,608
I have no time.

316
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,009
I'm giving you one week.

317
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,129
Either accept my conditions,

318
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:09,009
or we'll meet on the news.

319
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:10,968
Goodbye.

320
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:29,529
Did you bring it?

321
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,369
Yes.

322
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,409
Why need sulfuric acid?

323
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:35,249
Don't ask.

324
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:35,889
Whatever happens,

325
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:36,649
you're out of it.

326
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:37,448
Fine.

327
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:38,328
Then I'm leaving.

328
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,848
(To Lin Lu)

329
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:52,728
(I'm almost there.)

330
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:53,328
(You?)

331
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:33,769
Luo Yan?

332
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:36,688
Ouch!

333
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:37,728
Ouch!

334
00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:40,608
(Sulfuric acid)

335
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:41,608
Sulfuric acid?

336
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,369
(I can't believe
I considered Lin Lu a good one.)

337
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,249
(Never thought
you were in cahoots all along!)

338
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:54,009
(She even schemed against me for you.)

339
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:55,448
(I lost my job.)

340
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,369
(She threatened me,)

341
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:57,489
(and wanted to silence me.)

342
00:16:57,728 --> 00:16:58,848
(You people)

343
00:16:58,848 --> 00:16:59,889
(all deserve to die!)

344
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:01,129
(Is everything you said true?)

345
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:02,489
(I'm going to make her pay!)

346
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:03,409
(Of course it's real!)

347
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:05,529
(I'll give you money.)

348
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:07,328
(Consider it as compensation.)

349
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,249
(It should cover your debts.)

350
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:12,289
(My friend's company
needs an office manager.)

351
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,929
(I can recommend you.)

352
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:15,808
(But you must ensure)

353
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,648
(that you will not
cause any more trouble for Lin Lu.)

354
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:19,969
(Do you hear me?)

355
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,376
♪The stubbornness at a certain moment♪

356
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:27,776
♪I let go of my reason♪

357
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:29,984

♪Disrupting the established order♪

361
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:37,689
Why are you so late?

362
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,449
Haven't you arrived early?

363
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:43,368
I met Andy.

364
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:46,689
He came for you.

365
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:49,009
What does he want?

366
00:17:49,128 --> 00:17:50,648
The issue is resolved.

367
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:52,489
He won't come again.

368
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,209
But you must tell me

369
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:57,729
how many things like this
you've done behind my back.

370
00:17:58,449 --> 00:17:59,209
Andy,

371
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:00,009
An Yushen,

372
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:01,449
how much more I don't know about?

373
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:02,689
Do you know

374
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:03,449
among those people,

375
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,689
how many are like Andy?

376
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,009
I'm sorry.

377
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:15,168
I will be careful from now on.

378
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:16,568
From now on?

379
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:19,929
Lin Lu,

380
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:21,289
I don't want to be

381
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:22,769
dragged down by you someday.

382
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:31,769
Okay.

383
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:35,408
I understand.

384
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:38,209
Sorry.

385
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:41,729
For all this time,

386
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:43,888
I've caused you trouble.

387
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:50,449
I thought

388
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:53,608
that today,

389
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:56,088
you came to ask me to stay.

390
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:00,289
It was wishful thinking on my part.

391
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:02,009
Right.

392
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,009
It's just your wishful thinking.

393
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:07,729
The sooner you leave,

394
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:09,929
the sooner I can live in peace.

395
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:17,049
Luo Yan,

396
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:20,729
this is the last thing you say to me.

397
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:23,489
I will always remember it.

If you want to see her,

404
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:42,729

Luo Yan.

417
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:36,128
No matter why you're here,

418
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:36,848
please leave.

419
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:38,489
It's about your mother.

420
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,848
If you have nothing to say,
then get out.

421
00:21:06,568 --> 00:21:08,088
I met Luo Yun today.

422
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:09,449
She expects we

423
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:11,009
pay her ten million each month.

424
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:12,808
Or, she will expose Mr. An's scandal.

425
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:16,368
It's her affair.

426
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:17,529
How does it involve me?

427
00:21:18,689 --> 00:21:20,088
Do you really not care?

428
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:23,009
A woman who disappeared for decades

429
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:25,289
suddenly needs
such a large sum of money.

430
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:26,088
What's the reason?

431
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:27,729
What exactly do you want to say?

432
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:30,168
Do you know

433
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,289
she might've encountered some problems?

434
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:35,449
Her family or friends may need money.

435
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:39,088
What makes you think I would know?

436
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:41,529
A person
who abandoned me twenty years ago

437
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:45,729
is just a stranger after all.

438
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,088
I don't know her family.

439
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:50,648
I don't care about her matters either.

440
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:57,489
I understand.

441
00:21:58,289 --> 00:21:59,769
You have reasons to hate her.

442
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:01,408
I came today

443
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:02,929
not to say any hypocritical words.

444
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:04,529
I just wanted to have a try.

445
00:22:05,648 --> 00:22:06,489
I'll leave you alone.

446
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:11,648
Luo Yan,

447
00:22:12,568 --> 00:22:14,049
if you still want to see her,

448
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:15,888
I'll send you the address.

449
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:41,689
Spent so long meeting with Luo Yan.

450
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:42,729
It's getting late.

451
00:22:48,648 --> 00:22:49,289
Aotian.

452
00:22:49,608 --> 00:22:50,249
I'm here.

453
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,408
Do Luo Yan and Fang Lili
have a romantic storyline?

454
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:56,408
In the original setting,

455
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:58,449
the two only have a romantic storyline.

456
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:00,969
Do you even know how to talk properly?

457
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,009
Yushen,

458
00:23:05,368 --> 00:23:06,969
- who are you talking to?
- Grandma.

459
00:23:08,168 --> 00:23:08,729
I...

460
00:23:09,328 --> 00:23:10,408
I'm practicing rapping.

461
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:13,808
After Lili came back,

462
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:15,769
your mood has been
getting better and better.

463
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,568
I just want to give you some advice.

464
00:23:19,128 --> 00:23:21,249
Now that you and Lili are so close,

465
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:24,009
I really hope
that you two will start a family soon.

466
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:25,929
Come on.

467
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:28,689
This is a little gift from me.

468
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:35,648
Grandma,

469
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:38,209
this is quite bold, isn't it?

470
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:41,328
What are you talking about?

471
00:23:41,969 --> 00:23:43,328
Men and women.

472
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:44,689
Yin and yang in harmony.

473
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:46,408
It's the way of nature.

474
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:48,088
Give it a try.

475
00:23:48,568 --> 00:23:49,489
If not satisfied,

476
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:50,848
I will get you a new one.

477
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:05,689
It can't be that soon, right?

478
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:10,168
It won't.

479
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,128
What if...

480
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:55,769
What should I do?

481
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:58,368
Couldn't get anything out of Luo Yan.

482
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:00,049
He's not familiar with Luo Yun.

483
00:26:00,168 --> 00:26:02,088
Even if he were,
he wouldn't want to talk.

484
00:26:02,088 --> 00:26:02,848
He gave one word,

485
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:04,969
don't go to him
for matters regarding Luo Yun.

486
00:26:05,168 --> 00:26:07,568
I can't even get
a clear reading on Luo Yun's situation.

487
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:11,128
He was not willing to talk,

488
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:12,449
yet you talked for so long?

489
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:14,009
It seems you get along well.

490
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:16,328
An Hang,

491
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,929
you're jealous of an NPC, right?

492
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:22,529
I'm not.

493
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:23,608
I'm very reassured.

494
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:25,368
Earlier, at the company,

495
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:26,808
he pulled you into his arms.

496
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:27,608
His feelings to you

497
00:26:27,608 --> 00:26:29,529
are definitely of pure friendship.

498
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:32,408
You remember that clearly?

499
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:33,689
Anything else?

500
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:34,489
Tell me more.

501
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:35,689
I can't remember.

502
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:36,368
It's late.

503
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:37,128
I need to sleep.

504
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:46,848
I have an idea.

505
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:48,729
Clairvoyance.

506
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:49,929
What's that?

507
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:50,888
An item.

508
00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:51,969
I was also jealous before,

509
00:26:51,969 --> 00:26:53,289
using it on you and Yin Zhili...

510
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:56,249
What did I just hear?

511
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:58,608
Not real.

512
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:00,289
And you said I'm jealous?

513
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:02,249
Aren't you also jealous of an NPC?

514
00:27:02,449 --> 00:27:03,049
No.

515
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:04,049
I misspoke.

516
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:05,209
Come on.

517
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:05,929
Tell me.

518
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:06,848
When did you fall for me?

519
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:07,648
Love at first sight?

520
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:09,368
Come on, say it.

521
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:11,489
Quickly buy me the item!

522
00:27:11,808 --> 00:27:13,328
You've used up all my points.

523
00:27:14,408 --> 00:27:15,168
Alright.

524
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:15,929
I'll buy it now.

525
00:27:37,128 --> 00:27:39,049

526
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:41,408

529
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:45,009
Okay.

530
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:48,168
That thing,

531
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:48,888
how did it go?

532
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,568
What thing?

533
00:27:53,368 --> 00:27:54,368

No.

535
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:58,969
Can you give me a bit more time?

536
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,088
How much time do you need?

537
00:28:00,568 --> 00:28:01,888
I'm in a rush.

538
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:04,049
I don't have time to waste with you.

539
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:08,489
Nuo, don't go.

540
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:12,009
Didn't I just give you four million
last time?

541
00:28:16,168 --> 00:28:17,808
That was a long time ago.

542
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:19,769
You said you'd have money
back in Jincheng.

543
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:20,529
Where is the money?

544
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:22,529
It's not I can't get it.

I just haven't received it yet.

Maybe

547
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:28,088
you should stop gambling for now.

548
00:28:28,088 --> 00:28:28,888
Is that okay?

549
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:30,529
Mind your own business.

550
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:34,088
Bring me the money you promised.

551

00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:33,449
Although he hasn't been born yet,

571
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,209
look at

572
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:36,969
these little hands and feet

573
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:37,969
have all grown out.

574
00:30:39,608 --> 00:30:40,489
I'll leave.

575
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:55,009
Miss Fang,

576
00:30:55,608 --> 00:30:57,529
we have done all the checks for her,

577
00:30:57,729 --> 00:30:58,689
and found external injuries,

578
00:30:58,929 --> 00:30:59,608
but nothing else.

579
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:01,209
Thank you, doctor.

580
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:02,489
Rest well.

581
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:11,449
I thought you were very shrewd.

582
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:14,049
Asking the An family for money
for that scumbag?

583
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:17,969
What do you know?

584
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:20,489
If it weren't for Nuo,

585
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:23,128
I would have died countless times.

586
00:31:23,408 --> 00:31:24,729
Wake up.

587
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:27,049
He's only by your side for your money.

588
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:30,088
Then agree to my terms
and give me the money.

589
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:31,568
Being here in the hospital doesn't

590
00:31:31,568 --> 00:31:33,289
give you the right to tell me
what to do.

591
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:34,689
Are you out of your mind?

592
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:35,608
Lili,

593
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:37,529
go home.

594
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:38,848
Grandma is waiting.

595
00:31:52,648 --> 00:31:54,648
Is a woman in love really that silly?

596
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:56,808
Aware it's for her money,
yet still willing to give.

597
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:58,289
Did he save Luo Yun's life?

598
00:31:59,368 --> 00:32:00,969
People met in good times

599
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:02,088
can easily drift apart,

600
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:03,568
and the ones meeting in bad times

601
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:04,568
make you feel safe.

602
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:07,368
So what about me?

603
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,009
What kind of time did you meet me?

604
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:15,729
Just the right time.

605
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:25,249
Baby,

606
00:32:25,689 --> 00:32:28,729
I'm sorry.

607
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:31,729
I almost thought about taking you out.

608
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:38,209
Doctor,

609
00:32:38,808 --> 00:32:39,769
no surgery.

610
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:41,929
I'm going to keep this child.

611
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:47,808
Luo,

612
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:49,408
