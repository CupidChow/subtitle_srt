5
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,096
(will you always protect me?)

6
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:44,055
(Don't worry.)

7
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:46,215
(No one is allowed to bully you.)

8
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:57,176
Hey,

9
00:01:57,176 --> 00:01:58,376
lend me some money, huh?

10
00:01:58,976 --> 00:02:00,335
Brat.

11
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:01,295
Go away.

12
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:03,256
Give me your wallet,
or you'll get beaten.

13
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:13,216
Don't move.

14
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:16,615
Give me back my wallet.

15
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,895
The old guy is

16
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:18,695
dressed so decently,

17
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:19,575
and has just 200?

18
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:20,575
Get lost.

19
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:21,695
Give me back my wallet.

20
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:23,656
Let's go.

21
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:36,735
Grandma, what's wrong?

22
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:40,295
I feel uneasy.

23
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:44,295
Didn't you say Xiangyin could come back?

24
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,216
When exactly?

25
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,216
(Achievement: Mystery of the An Family)
Player has completed the instance task.

26
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:55,936
(System repair: system bug deletion)
System bug deletion in progress.

27
00:02:58,496 --> 00:02:59,336
Bug?

28
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,496
Grandma?

29
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:09,376
Just like last time.

30
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:11,056
Luo Yan?

31
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:12,455
Lin Lu?

32
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:13,895
Is anyone there?

33
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,295
Congratulations.

34
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:18,720
You've completed the task.

35
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:23,855
After the character An Xiangyin

36
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:25,295
triggered the unexpected plot,

37
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:26,735
the system was disordered,

38
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:29,216
unable to continue character setting.

39
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:30,536
Currently,

40
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:32,056
this character is being deleted

41
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:33,575
to repair system bug.

42
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:35,855
Other NPCs'

43
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:37,376
memories about An Xiangyin

44
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:39,295
will also be deleted.

45
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,695
Yushen, Lili.

46
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:47,336
Auntie.

47
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:49,135
I...

48
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:51,695
I am very happy.

49
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:54,175
If Xiangyang forgets me,

50
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:55,615
he won't

51
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:58,175
blame himself anymore.

52
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:03,376
Deletion process started.

53
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:58,735
Why are you

54
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,615
in his room?

55
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:03,375
I don't know.

56
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:07,216
Really.

57
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:15,536
I...

58
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:16,495
Come to help. Hurry.

59
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:17,696
Okay.

60
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:18,456
Well,

61
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:20,815
why was I in your room last night?

62
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:22,976
You blacked out yesterday.

63
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:23,776
Don't you remember?

64
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:26,735
Blacked out?

65
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:27,976
Exactly.

66
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:30,336
You were feeling down
and went talking with me.

67
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:31,735
Everyone blacked out.

68
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:35,656
What could I talk about with you?

69
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:39,055
You said you missed home a lot,

70
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:40,776
and wanted Grandma to recognize you.

71
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:43,456
Impossible!

72
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:44,216
How could I...

73
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:44,935
It's true.

74
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:46,016
I can testify.

75
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:47,696
He also said

76
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:49,935
that your snoring is noisy.

77
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:17,576
Still thinking about Auntie?

78
00:06:20,536 --> 00:06:21,855
If I had known she would leave,

79
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:23,576
I wouldn't have taken on this task.

80
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,055
So upset over an NPC?

81
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:30,096
For us, this is fake.

82
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:31,696
But for her,

83
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:33,495
all of these is real.

84
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,735
Auntie wanted to be forgotten,

85
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:38,415
because she hoped for family reunion.

86
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:39,855
What we can do

87
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:41,456
is to help her complete this lie.

88
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:42,855
An Hang.

89
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:44,815
I miss home too.

90
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:47,896
We'll be back soon.

91
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,175
Trust me.

92
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:03,976
Miss.

93
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,375
Let me put these shoes away for you.

94
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:09,136
You'll need to wear flat shoes
for a while.

95
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:11,536
Don't say that to me for now.

96
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:17,375
Let me calm down.
I'll open the door.

97
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:18,375
It's Lili.

98
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:26,375
Honey!

99
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:28,055
You finally came.

100
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:29,255
Hi!

101
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:32,815
We don't welcome men to visit now.

102
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:39,055
We are all humans.

103
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:41,656
Why should women give birth
while men don't have to?

104
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:42,896
You're right.

105
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:43,815
Calm down.

106
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:46,096
Nuwa is also a woman.

107
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:47,776
Why didn't she consider

108
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:49,495
us women?

109
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:51,055
She just gave birth

110
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:52,456
by creating clay figures.

111
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:53,896
Caring nothing about us

112
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:55,136
who must do it physically!

113
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,495
In a few more months,

114
00:07:57,495 --> 00:08:00,216
I'll gain weight, get spots,
and stretch marks.

115
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:03,855
After the baby is born,

116
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:05,615
I have to be prepared all day and night.

117
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:06,935
I won't have any personal time.

118
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:08,375
I'll be disconnected from society.

119
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,656
No longer the same as

120
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:13,576
those single girls.

121
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:19,776
I'll go to the kitchen.

122
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:23,735
Don't touch my Jimmy Choo!

123
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:27,055
Man,

124
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:28,055
get out!

125
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:32,375
I'll open the door.

126
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,135
No need.

127
00:08:33,336 --> 00:08:33,936
Sit down.

128
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:43,416
Don't touch my shoes.

129
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:50,936
You won't be like this
when you're pregnant, will you?

130
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:52,535
Who's getting pregnant?

131
00:08:57,895 --> 00:08:58,655
Well...

132
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:00,096
I was looking for you.

133
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,456
May I come in?

134
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:02,255
No.

135
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,336
I have guests now.

136
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:08,135
But I don't see any guest.

137
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:09,216
No guest?

138
00:09:10,735 --> 00:09:12,135
Hey, where are you two?

139
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:16,696
Now,

140
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:17,895
can I come in?

141
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:19,015
No.

142
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:21,056
I don't want to see you today.

143
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:27,775
What's up?

144
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:29,615
Since

145
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:31,216
you don't want to see me,

146
00:09:32,495 --> 00:09:33,816
I'll just talk to you here.

147
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:36,495
I thought about it all day.

148
00:09:37,456 --> 00:09:39,416
If we're going to sign the agreement,

149
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:42,015
I have conditions too.

150
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,696
My condition is that,

151
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:46,696
compared to the baby,

152
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:48,895
I hope

153
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,296
you can make yourself happy first.

154
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:54,816
You should live the life you want.

155
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,296
Go travel,

156
00:09:58,255 --> 00:09:59,495
dress up yourself,

157
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,816
and make new friends.

158
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,816
I hope you are Yin Zhiluo first.

159
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:09,936
Just be yourself.

160
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,176
Leave the rest

161
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:12,696
to me.

162
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:15,696
I know I'm an ordinary person

163
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:17,416
with no special qualities.

164
00:10:17,855 --> 00:10:19,336
But I always keep my word.

165
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:21,936

The airline just called to ask

187
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:42,576
if you need the tickets to Iceland.

188
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:44,416
Iceland?

189
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:45,375
Right.

190
00:11:45,576 --> 00:11:46,936
You book flight there every year.

191
00:11:47,096 --> 00:11:49,336
But you didn't go because of work.

192
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:51,775
Did I mention anyone to go with me?

193
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:53,176
Not really.

194
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,576
But you always booked two tickets.

195
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,135
(Xiangyang,)

196
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,576
(when I grow up,
can you take me to Iceland?)

197
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,416
Young An.

198
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:15,135
It is ready.

199
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:15,808
Okay.

200
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:18,144
(Radiation-proof suit)

201
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,855
This radiation-proof suit is on sale.
I've bought it for you.

202
00:12:21,855 --> 00:12:22,735
It'll arrive soon.

203
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:24,775
Honey, I've already bought it.

204
00:12:24,895 --> 00:12:26,895
Many cute clothes for the baby too.

205
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:27,495
Look.

206
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:28,135
Let me see.

207
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:35,135
Feng Zhixing has made the meal.

208
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,375
You two haven't had a bite.

209
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,456
Alright, stop showing off.

210
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:39,296
Come eat.

211
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:39,855
Okay.

212
00:12:53,015 --> 00:12:54,535
This one is especially for you.

213
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:57,775
Pay attention to your diet.

214
00:12:57,895 --> 00:12:59,176
I'll prepare it for you.

215
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:00,735
Then, thank you.

216
00:13:01,576 --> 00:13:03,255
Your relationship is quite good, huh?

217
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:04,936
You get along very well.

218
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:07,096
Of course.

219
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:09,576
Who says having a baby means
we must get married?

220
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:12,696
A marriage without love
is the biggest harm to the baby.

221
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:14,015
So, right now, we are

222
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:15,495
friends raising a baby together.

223
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:17,775
You two don't seem to have no love.

224
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:21,336
Baby,

225
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:22,056
be closer.

226
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:23,976
Shut up.

227
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,512
(Chairman Retirement Notice
of Ju'an Investment Group)

228
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:38,735
Mr. An is going to retire early?

229
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:39,696
- What?
- What?

230
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:41,775
Check the company email.

231
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:52,655
(Xiangyang)

232
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:53,296
Mom,

233
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,735
I really decided to take a rest.

234
00:13:57,936 --> 00:13:59,336
I'm at this age,

235
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:00,816
but I don't have my own life.

236
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:02,135
What's the point?

237
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:05,296
Today I keep thinking

238
00:14:05,535 --> 00:14:07,015
about a little girl who asked me

239
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:09,976
if I could take her to Iceland
when she grows up.

240
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:13,615
I've thought for a while,
wondering who she could be.

241
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:15,735
(Could it be Auntie?)

242
00:14:16,015 --> 00:14:17,255
(Not be deleted completely?)

243
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:19,255
(Couldn't the system
be such unreliable?)

244
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:22,096
It must be Li Yuanyuan,
our neighbor when I was young.

245
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:23,936
Back then,

246
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,176
we were childhood sweethearts.

247
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:29,296
Never mind.

248
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:30,735
She's in Iceland now.

249
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:31,735
I'm at the airport.

250
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:32,655
I'll hang up now.

251
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:38,456
What's wrong with him?

252
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:40,655
At such an age,

253
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:42,655
he cast Ju'an aside to date!

254
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:44,296
Grandma.

255
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:45,775
Please calm down.

256
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:50,056
Alright.

257
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:52,615
It's better that he retires earlier.

258
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:55,135
Then, Yushen can take over Ju'an sooner.

259
00:14:56,056 --> 00:14:57,495
Now that you're doing so well,

260
00:14:57,895 --> 00:14:59,096
the board members

261
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:00,936
won't favor Luo Yan anymore, right?

262
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,976
I'll talk with them tomorrow.

263
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:05,296
Next week,

264
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:07,775
you'll take over as the CEO of Ju'an.

265
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,135
Has the phone rung?

266
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:26,255
No.

267
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:30,096
Aotian, have you made contact?

268
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,456
I've tried the 52nd time.

269
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:35,615
Unable to contact the outside world now.

270
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:40,416
Aotian, what's going on exactly?

271
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,056
An Hang is about to clear the game.

272
00:15:42,056 --> 00:15:43,456
Can he get out?

273
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:47,336
According to system settings,
players clearing the game can leave.

274
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,416
What about her?

275
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:49,696
I'll go out first

276
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:50,655
and be back to save her.

277
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:51,336
Is that feasible?

278
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:53,735
The system doesn't have such a setting.

279
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:55,655
Confirmation is needed
by the program team.

280
00:15:57,735 --> 00:15:59,495
But we can't contact them now.

281
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:02,936
I've tried the 53rd time.

282
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:04,976
Hello,

283
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:05,936
Mr. An.

284
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:07,775
How are you and Miss Fang doing now?

285
00:16:07,855 --> 00:16:08,936
I can clear the game now.

286
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:10,336
I want to confirm with you.

287
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,135
If I go out first,

288
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:13,336
can you take this opportunity
to restart the system

289
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:14,216
and save her out?

290
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:16,416
We've been trying

291
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,816
what you mentioned too.

292
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:19,296
But so far we haven't found

293
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:20,416
a foolproof plan.

294
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:21,895
If it fails,

295
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:23,576
Miss Fang will remain in the system

296
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:25,135
and start the experience over.

297
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:26,976
Start over?

298
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:28,895
Then how long
does she have to stay here?

299
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:32,135
Hello?

300
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:32,655
Hello?

301
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:36,576
Signal interrupted.

302
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:49,824
(Ju'an Group)

303
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,096
Mr. An is going to retire early.

304
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,135
Did you know that?

305
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:01,495
I've arrived at the company.

306
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:02,535
See you in a bit.

307
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:22,176
Since everyone is so silent,

308
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,495
let me start first.

309
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:27,015
This is Ju'an Group.

310
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:29,456
Since Mr. An wants to retire early,

311
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:31,335
it's only right for Young An

312
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:32,696
to take over as the CEO.

313
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:35,696
Ms. Sun, that's too arbitrary.

314
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:37,055
Everyone knows

315
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:38,976
Mr. An has more than one son.

316
00:17:39,535 --> 00:17:40,775
And over the years,

317
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,575
Mr. Luo has been working with Mr. An.

318
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:44,896
He is most familiar with the business.

319
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:46,856
Only when Mr. Luo takes over as CEO

320
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:49,376
can our company
quickly regain normal operations.

321
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:51,095
Over this period,

322
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:52,376
Young An's performance

323
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:54,095
has been recognized by everyone.

324
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:57,015
Although Mr. Luo did
achieved some results before,

325
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,376
it was under Mr. An's guidance.

326
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:04,015
Whether the entire group
can be entrusted to him,

327
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:05,376
I'm afraid,

328
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:07,255
it's up for discussion.

329
00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:09,456
We are here now

330
00:18:09,616 --> 00:18:11,055
for discussion, aren't we?

331
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:13,616
Since there are different opinions,

332
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:15,216
let's

333
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,416
vote on it.

334
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,055
I agree.

335
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:21,616
Let's just vote.

336
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:23,616
Those in support of Young An

337
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:25,015
can vote now.

338
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:27,015
I vote for him.

339
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,335
It seems

340
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:37,055
there's no need

341
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:39,535
to vote for Mr. Luo.

342
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:41,456
Young An

343
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:42,775
is the wished one of us all.

344
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:52,936
Wait a minute.

345
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,376
I vote for Luo Yan.

346
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:01,656
And Grandma, too.

347
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:04,095
I vote for Luo Yan on her behalf.

348
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:05,936
So now we are tied.

349
00:19:07,535 --> 00:19:08,136
Everyone,

350
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:11,216
the reason why Ju'an has come this far

351
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:12,735
is due to loyalty,

352
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:13,696
righteousness,

353
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:14,696
and unity.

354
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:18,216
So I hope everyone can remember

355
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:20,416
we are one family.

356
00:19:32,216 --> 00:19:33,495
That was a close one.

357
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:34,775
Almost...

358
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:37,856
Alright.

359
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:39,255
As long as we can tie the vote,

360
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:40,376
everything will be fine.

361
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:45,015
But what if the balance
is broken one day?

362
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:46,176
How about

363
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:47,775
letting Luo Yan win first?

364
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:48,735
You may leave.

365
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:49,696
Okay.

366
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:51,896
If you say that again,

367
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:53,095
I'll kill you.

368
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:00,856
Killing me is also a solution.

369
00:20:01,976 --> 00:20:04,136
Don't worry about things
that haven't happened.

370
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:04,976
Understood?

371
00:20:17,936 --> 00:20:19,095
An Yushen, come out!

372
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:20,255
Why?

373
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,495
Why! Why!

374
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:24,775
What...What's wrong?

375
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,015
What do you mean?

376
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:27,696
Pity me?

377
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:29,136
Mr. Luo.

378
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:30,696
I really admire you.

379
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:31,495
Sincerely.

380
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:32,936
Are you fooling me?

381
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:34,495
No, I'm not.

382
00:20:34,495 --> 00:20:35,656
Am I not sincere enough?

383
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:38,976
You two.

384
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:40,856
You two talk here.

385
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,095
I'm leaving.

386
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:47,896
An Yushen.

387
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:49,376
Remember this.

388
00:20:49,936 --> 00:20:51,335
I don't need your pity.

389
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:52,976
It's not over between us.

390
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:12,576
(Ju'an Group)

391
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,575
Honey.

392
00:21:19,015 --> 00:21:21,295
He's really hard to please.

393
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,735
The boss persona.

394
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:23,616
Bear it.

395
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:35,255
You're back.

396
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,775
Good boy, you've worked hard.

397
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:41,335
Not at all, Grandma.

398
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:42,856
We'll go back to the room to rest.

399
00:21:45,335 --> 00:21:46,255
You two

400
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:48,976
voted for Luo Yan on my behalf.

401
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:51,015
How filial you are!

402
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,307
(Filial)

403
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:01,696
Still not heartfelt.

404
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:03,696
Lacking in spirit.

405
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:06,015
Write it 30 more times

406
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,055
until you remember it.

407
00:22:44,403 --> 00:22:48,064
(Ju'an Group)

408
00:23:00,656 --> 00:23:01,255
Hello?

409
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:02,495
Nuo.

410
00:23:03,136 --> 00:23:05,055
Today's matter isn't over yet.

411
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:09,015
If you don't pay the money back,
it won't be just a beating next time.

412
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:10,335
Understood?

413
00:23:29,015 --> 00:23:29,575
Sorry.

414
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,616
You can't enter without invitation codes
or employee ID.

415
00:23:31,616 --> 00:23:33,015
I'm up to find someone.
It'll be quick.

416
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:33,616
No way.

417
00:23:34,856 --> 00:23:36,376
I am your Mr. Luo's stepfather.

418
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:38,456
His mother is Luo Yun, right?

419
00:23:39,656 --> 00:23:40,416
Please leave.

420
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:42,335
Sorry.

421
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:45,176
I know him.

422
00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:00,775
Why do you want to meet Mr. Luo?

423
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:02,575
What for?

424
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,055
Why should I tell you?

425
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:11,376
I want to meet Mr. Luo.

426
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:13,535
As you can see,

427
00:24:14,216 --> 00:24:15,295
you can't meet him now.

428
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:21,856
I'm the secretary of Ju'an's CEO office
and a foster daughter of the An family.

429
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,376
You can tell me

430
00:24:23,376 --> 00:24:24,335
what you want.

431
00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:29,504
(Lin Lu)

432
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:31,416
Okay.

433
00:24:42,456 --> 00:24:43,456
This woman,

434
00:24:44,335 --> 00:24:45,535
although a bit older,

435
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:47,255
still retains her charm.

436
00:24:48,335 --> 00:24:49,216
Moreover,

437
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:51,015
she was once An Xiangyang's lover

438
00:24:51,696 --> 00:24:53,055
and also Mr. Luo's mother.

439
00:24:54,856 --> 00:24:57,015
If this photo gets out,

440
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,295
it'll make a stir, right?

441
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:03,416
Don't think about deleting it.
I have a backup.

442
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,015
What do you want to do?

443
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:13,456
Nothing.

444
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:15,856
I just owe some money.

445
00:25:16,936 --> 00:25:17,896
Luo Yun promised

446
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,015
to pay it back for me.

447
00:25:19,376 --> 00:25:22,176
But I can't find her.
No time to look for her.

448
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:24,815
How much?

449
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:27,735
It is

450
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:29,055
not up to you, right?

451
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,255
Let's wait until Mr. Luo returns.

452
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,015
He is on a business trip.

453
00:25:33,735 --> 00:25:35,416
I don't know when he'll be back.

454
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:37,335
How about this?

455
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,416
I'll give you 500,000.

456
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:41,095
This photo

457
00:25:41,815 --> 00:25:42,696
shall be deleted.

458
00:25:46,456 --> 00:25:47,055
It's a deal.

459
00:25:51,136 --> 00:25:51,815
Got it.

460
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:53,735
Okay.

461
00:25:57,775 --> 00:25:58,495
Miss Lin.

462
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:00,295
Are you sure to withdraw

463
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:01,775
all your investments and savings?

464
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:03,656
Yes.

465
00:26:03,656 --> 00:26:04,656
Withdraw them all.

466
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:06,335
In addition,

467
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:07,856
I would like to consult

468
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:09,735
about the loan services.

469
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:12,376
Mr. Chen.

470
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:15,055
The project you mentioned before

471
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:16,015
is particularly great.

472
00:26:16,136 --> 00:26:17,616
Perfect for the current market.

473
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:20,136
Okay.

474
00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:22,095
Let's schedule a time to meet up.

475
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:24,616
Sure.

476
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:36,335
No problem at all.

477
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:38,775
Okay, waiting for your message.

478
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:44,896
Alright, Mr. Chen.

479
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:48,735
We're settled then.

480
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:52,192
Alright.

481
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:16,696
(Lin Lu)

482
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:18,176
(Do you want to watch a movie today?)

483
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:22,936
(I'm not feeling well today.)

484
00:27:23,335 --> 00:27:24,616
(Just go on with your work.)

485
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:29,936
500,000 for this week is received.

486
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:31,495
Next week,

487
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,535
bring another 500,000.

488
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:40,216
Look.

489
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,775
This requires multiple deletions.

490
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:48,136
Give it to me.

491
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:52,216
You'd better be obedient.

492
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:56,936
Think about why you came here.

493
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,295
I haven't been with

494
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:08,815
