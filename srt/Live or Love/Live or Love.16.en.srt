Isn't that Secretary Lin?

About to be late? Get in.

7
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:32,288
No need, thank you.

8
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:33,807
I'll go by myself.

9
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:38,087
Mr. Luo.

10
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:38,688
Shall we

11
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:39,607
go to the company now?

12
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:40,848

Right.

00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,767
Nor force the way past the boundary.

39
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:58,968
What about me quitting

40
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:00,008
and let Luo Yan win?

41
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:01,727

find a way to save me.

If players stop unlocking the story,

44
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:07,647
the system will restart

45
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:08,927

You go out first,

48
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,408
then save me out.

49
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,767
Thank you, Miss Fang.

50
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:26,167
How should I explain it

51
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:27,088
to Luo Yan?

52
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:28,568
Don't panic.

53
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:31,528
Isn't this like

54
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:33,487
canceling the deal
right after making it?

55
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:35,927
Don't say that.

56
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:38,968
Why am I always the bad guy?

57
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:39,887
Stop.

58
00:03:40,607 --> 00:03:41,727
Or I'll explain to him.

59
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:43,128
Anyway, I have thick skin.

60
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:44,767
What do you plan to do?

61
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:47,248
I'll say that our old flame

62
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:48,128
has reignited fiercely.

63
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,327
You wanna go back to my side.

64
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:50,447
He'll understand, right?

65
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,528
I'll say it myself.

66
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:13,088
Come in.

67
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:25,168
Mr. Luo.

68
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:27,248
This is my letter of resignation.

69
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:28,527
Please approve it.

70
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:34,008
Fang Lili.

71
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:37,488
Am I just a tool

72
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:39,128
in your relationship with An Yushen?

73
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:41,728
Once you eased your relationship,

74
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:42,808
you asked for resignation.

75
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:44,527
Please believe me.

76
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:46,967
I truly wanted to help you.

77
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:49,048
But what happened recently

78
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:50,248
made me realize

79
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:52,048
I'll stand by An Yushen's side.

80
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:54,407
To you,

81
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:56,647
I am very sorry.

82
00:04:58,647 --> 00:04:59,407
Then,

83
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:00,527
what can I say?

84
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,048
Should I wish you well?

85
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:04,847
Fang Lili, listen.

86
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:06,048
If you don't provoke me,

87
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:07,287
I won't target you.

88
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:09,568
But now you've betrayed me.

89
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:11,967
I will make you pay.

90
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,008
I understand.

91
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:17,967
I will be prepared.

92
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:20,168
Get out now.

93
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:42,688
Carrying the burden of responsibility.

94
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:45,207
Whose wife are you? How capable!

95
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:53,728
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:55,728
You're always the one at a loss.

97
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:57,407
Last time, it was me who

98
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:58,488
caused your brain damage.

99
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:00,368
Why be so serious?

100
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:01,688
How pretentious.

101
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:03,368
Got it, boss.

102
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:04,688
Boss,

103
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,847
Miss Fang, and wife.

104
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,608
My title's changed
three times this morning.

105
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:09,928
Can you settle on one?

106
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:12,928
Isn't this because

107
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:15,568
the change is too sudden?

108
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:16,767
I don't know

109
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:17,928
what to call you.

110
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:20,407
Tell me the truth.

111
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:22,647
How old are you really?

112
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,008
About

113
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:28,168
the same age as you.

114
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:30,087
One.

115
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:31,447
Two.

116
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,568
Two and a half.

117
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:36,207
Twenty-seven.

118
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,447
You are younger than me.

119
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:40,407
Call me sister.

120
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:42,488
Forget it.

121
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:43,647
It's embarrassing.

122
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:45,128
What's there to be embarrassed about?

123
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:46,287
Call me sister.

124
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,447
Right now.

125
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:51,407
Well.

126
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:53,767
Which one of Jay's songs do you like?

127
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:02,248
Young An.

128
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:03,368
Anything to report

129
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:04,568
at the quarterly meeting later?

130
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:05,527
I'll go prepare.

131
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:08,327
Yes.

132
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:38,728
All directors,

133
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:40,887
before the work report,

134
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:42,248
I have something to announce.

135
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:43,808
That is, Miss Fang

136
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:46,207
will return to our Investment Division.

137
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:51,368
An Yushen.

138
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,008
Check the corporate email.

139
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:03,407
I gave Fang Lili a chance

140
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:04,928
to return to Ju'an to work.

141
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:07,048
Unexpectedly,

142
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:09,847
she incited Yin Zhiluo

143
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:12,527
to develop a cemetery nearby,

144
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:15,608
forcing you to buy
the Yin family's land at a high price.

145
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,368
Then she reported Shi Yu,

146
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:19,488
making you unable to pay the Yin family.

147
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:22,728
As a result,

148
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:24,967
Fang Lili caused Ju'an

149
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:27,568
to owe Yinxiang two hundred million.

150
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:32,728
What's your intention?

151
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:33,407
Dad.

152
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:33,848
Mr. An.

153
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,088
I really didn't expect

154
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:36,448
Fang Lili secretly

155
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,927
did so many things
that harmed the group.

156
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:39,887
Luo Yan, you...

157
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,848
(The email was definitely sent by him.)

158
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:44,328
(He had set everything up,)

159
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:45,407
(leaving evidence against me.)

160
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:47,208
(But I don't have any against him.)

161
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,047
(Forget it.)

162
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,488
(The more I explain, the worse.)

163
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,527
(Better to keep silent.)

164
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:53,687
Dad.

165
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:55,728
Actually, for this matter,

166
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:57,047
I am aware of it.

167
00:08:57,927 --> 00:08:58,728
But Lili

168
00:08:58,728 --> 00:09:00,448
never expected things
to turn out this way.

169
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:03,208
The fact that Yinxiang
no longer reclaimed

170
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,407
the money was negotiated by her.

171
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,927
She has known her mistakes.

172
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:06,968
I believe

173
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:08,968
that she will keep her word.

174
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:12,208
If there's any problem in the future,

175
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:13,608
I'll take responsibility.

176
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:15,287
You take responsibility?

177
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:17,927
Sounds rather easy.

178
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:19,167
Exactly.

179
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:20,128
For a woman,

180
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:21,567
you disregard the bigger picture.

181
00:09:22,368 --> 00:09:23,368
I thought

182
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,287
Young An had matured.

183
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,128
It seems not.

184
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:29,567
He only cares about his family.

185
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:30,647
How can we

186
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:32,047
entrust Ju'an to him?

187
00:09:32,047 --> 00:09:33,248
Exactly.

188
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:34,887
He is not qualified.

189
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:36,328
All directors,

190
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:37,368
let me say something.

191
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:39,567
You are all right.

192
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:41,328
I made a mistake

193
00:09:41,328 --> 00:09:42,567

194
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:44,287
I announce,

195
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:45,448
from today on,

196
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:46,728
I'm leave Ju'an

197
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:48,008
and will reflect on myself.

198
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:30,248
Mr. Luo,

199
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:31,167
congratulations.

200
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:32,767
You've kicked Fang Lili out.

201
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,848
A person who cannot work for me

202
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:38,567
can never work for others.

203
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:40,848
Tonight, I'll have dinner with Mr. Zhou.

204
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:42,368
Go prepare the car.

205
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:45,488
Well, Mr. Luo.

206
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:46,647
I...

207
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,527
I took a leave from you yesterday.

208
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:50,448
I have to leave early today.

209
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:54,088
Anything urgent?

210
00:10:55,647 --> 00:10:56,407
Well...

211
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:57,608
I'm

212
00:10:58,328 --> 00:10:59,248
in love now.

213
00:11:00,088 --> 00:11:01,128
It's her birthday today.

214
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:03,208
Understood.

215
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:03,848
Go quickly.

216
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:05,208
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

217
00:11:06,728 --> 00:11:07,608
By the way, Mr. Luo.

218
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:09,887

219
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,047
I think

220
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,608
if you don't want her to leave,

221
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:13,887
just tell her directly.

222
00:11:20,248 --> 00:11:21,208
I'm leaving.

223
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:39,608
Hello, Mr. Luo.

224
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:41,248
When will Mr. An return?

225
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,088
Around 3 PM.

226
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:44,567
Okay.

227
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:45,927
Give this to him in time.

228
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:46,728

00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:47,208

00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:04,767

338
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,167
I have nothing to do.

339
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,767
I'll prepare together with Lili.

340
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:46,488

Thank you, Lu.

347
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:08,408
Let me do it.

348
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:10,807
You can't do it.

349
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:11,928
Let me do it.

350
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:12,928
I'm used to it.

351
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:15,047

353
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:23,448

355
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,847
abandon Mr. Luo back then?

356
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:32,087
Hard to explain in a few words.

357
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:33,888
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

358
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:43,087

359

360
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:49,008

361
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:52,087
What about you?

362
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:54,047
You're so beautiful.

363
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:55,208

364
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:03,367
Not yet.

365
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,208
Watch your hands.

366
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:14,047
Thank you.

367
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:15,888
I can do it myself.

368
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:43,134
(Animal Rescue Shelter)

369
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:15,648

371
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:19,168
lately?

372
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:20,728
Not good.

373
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:22,208
What's wrong?

374
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:24,127
I...

375
00:19:24,688 --> 00:19:26,367
I have something to tell you.

376
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,807
Long time no see, Ms. Yin.

377
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:30,168
You've come at just the time.

378
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:32,168
There are many adopters today.

379
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:34,008
Look. We need help with the surveys.

380
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:34,767
Come on, Ms. Yin.

381
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:36,087

00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:38,087
The adopters are all waiting.

384
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:38,888
Hurry up!

385
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:44,527
Do you currently have a stable income

386
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:45,408
and your own house?

387
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,648
I do have a stable income.

388
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:49,807
But as for independent housing,

389
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:51,408
I'm currently sharing a rental.

390
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:54,807
What's up?

391
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:57,928
Does this affect cat adoption?

392
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,728
Whether your roommates can accept a pet

393
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:02,888
and whether you'll move

394
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:04,287
frequently in the coming years

395
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:06,008
are all risks we'll consider.

396
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,488
We actually prefer

397
00:20:07,488 --> 00:20:08,807
adopters with a stable life.

398
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:11,008
Because only when you are stable,

399
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:12,127
you can take on

400
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,968
the responsibility
of caring for a new member.

401
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:15,807
I think you...

402
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:16,888
What do you mean by that?

403
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:19,287
Is someone having a car
and a house stable?

404
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:21,327
Or is someone having millions stable?

405
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:25,728
I don't mean you must be rich.

406
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:26,688
I mean,

407
00:20:27,248 --> 00:20:29,127
before welcoming a new life,

408
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,408
one should think it through.

409
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:31,767
However, in life,

410
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:33,327
some things just happen suddenly.

411
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:34,728
No time to think so much.

412
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:36,047
Then...

413
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:39,087
Acting impulsively without thinking.

414
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:40,127
Don't you think

415
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,847
it's irresponsible?

416
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:42,888
Okay.

417
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:44,488
What about acting first

418
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:45,688
and bearing the consequences?

419
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:48,408
Acting on impulse is wrong.

420
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:50,287
Why bear the consequences?

421
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:51,607
Say it again.

422
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:54,607
You...

423
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:56,367
What's wrong with you?

424
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:00,287
I'll take my leave.

425
00:21:01,248 --> 00:21:02,087
Now?

426
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:04,008
Well,

427
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,087
I also have things.

428
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:06,008
Can we continue?

429
00:21:06,888 --> 00:21:07,488
Okay.

430
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:08,087
Let's continue.

431
00:21:08,087 --> 00:21:09,127
Sorry.

432
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:28,527
Do I look virtuous in this?

433
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:29,807
Yes.

434
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:33,648
I...

435
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:34,928
Let's have a talk.

436
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,527
Aren't you a workaholic?

437
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:37,208
Maybe

438
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,287
I'll find a way

439
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:39,287
to get you back to Ju'an.

440
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:40,567
No.

441
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,248
I want

442
00:21:42,248 --> 00:21:43,208
to enjoy my vacation

443
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,607
while dealing with businesses.

444
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:51,408
Have you called me

445
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:52,367
sister yet?

446
00:21:54,408 --> 00:21:55,567
Don't you think

447
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,607
it would make us seem distant?

448
00:21:58,408 --> 00:22:00,607
Respect for age is a virtue.

449
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,968
Then don't you think this makes me

450
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:04,527
so weak as a bird?

451
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:08,888
Liking a bird is nice.

452
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:10,488
Chirp for me.

453
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:12,968
Sister.

454
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:13,567
Well...

455
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:14,367
This is not okay.

456
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:15,648
This can't be taken as a gift.

457
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:18,968
How can you talk like that, Yushen?

458
00:22:19,448 --> 00:22:20,527
This time,

459
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:21,888
you can't make Lili angry anymore.

460
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:24,607
Well,

461
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:25,688
the guests will arrive soon.

462
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:26,888
Go wait in the living room.

463
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:29,248
By the way,

464
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:30,448
there's something

465
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:31,847
you need to pay special attention.

466
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,248
What is it, Grandma?

467
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:35,208
When strangers come to the house,

468
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:36,928
don't let Xiangyin come up.

469
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,047
If anyone asks about her,

470
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:40,928
just say she's abroad.

471
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:53,168
Is An Li Minghui hiding her daughter?

472
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,287
Probably trying to
cover up a family disgrace.

473
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:58,287
After all, she's her daughter.

474
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:00,208
Isn't that too callous?

475
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:14,807
Auntie.

476
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:16,607
You're here.

477
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:17,408
Here!

478
00:23:17,408 --> 00:23:18,527
Come play marbles

479
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:19,408
with me.

480
00:23:19,688 --> 00:23:20,888
I don't know how to play it.

481
00:23:20,888 --> 00:23:22,168
Shall we play something else?

482
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:48,488
Two!

483
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,527
So cool!

484
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:53,488
Let's play hide and seek later,
shall we?

485
00:23:53,688 --> 00:23:54,127
Listen.

486
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:56,287
As long as you don't leave the room,

487
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:57,968
I guarantee I'll give

488
00:23:57,968 --> 00:23:59,607
many marbles for you.

489
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:01,847
Okay.

490
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:02,847
Then,

491
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,448
I will definitely hide well.

492
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:06,087
I will win!

493
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,448
I've hidden well.

494
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:26,767
Three.

495
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:27,728
Two.

496
00:24:28,287 --> 00:24:28,888
One.

497
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:30,448
They've arrived.

498
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,488
- Hello!
- Hello!

499
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,127
You must be Yushen's wife,

500
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:41,928
Lili, right?

501
00:24:42,087 --> 00:24:43,888
How beautiful!

502
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:46,287
Exactly.

503
00:24:46,448 --> 00:24:47,567
No wonder there are

504
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:49,567
romantic rumors about her and Luo Yan.

505
00:24:49,928 --> 00:24:51,248
I've heard that Lili

506
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:53,567
is also from a prestigious family.

507
00:24:53,968 --> 00:24:54,968
But it's

508
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:56,248
bankrupt now.

509
00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:58,087
Let me tell you.

510
00:24:58,087 --> 00:25:00,127
It seems that a girl
from the wealthy family

511
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:02,047
might not be a better wife

512
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:03,248
than our daughters.

513
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:05,767
The key is,
they've been married for so long,

514
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:06,767
but there's still

515
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:07,847
no sign of a baby.

516
00:25:07,968 --> 00:25:09,248
Exactly.

517
00:25:11,688 --> 00:25:13,127
They are

518
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:14,327
Grandma's relatives,

519
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:15,448
Auntie Lan,

520
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:16,607
and Auntie Xiang.

521
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:21,567
- Auntie.
- Auntie.

522
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:26,728
It looks slightly unappealing.

523
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:28,287
Can you accept it?

524
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:29,688
It's okay.

525
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:30,847
As long as you made it,

526
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:32,648
I promise to eat every last bit.

527
00:25:36,488 --> 00:25:37,607
Can you go out first?

528
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:38,888
Give me another chance.

529
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:41,408
Grandma.

530
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:49,327
Miss Fang.

531
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:50,488
This is

532
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:52,008
today's dinner, right?

533
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:58,688
Let's just order takeout.

534
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:01,648
Didn't you make a cake for me before?

535
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,208
That was also takeout.

536
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,728
I just put a strawberry on it.

537
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:30,648
Come on.

538
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,127
Help me wear the apron.

539
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:33,008
