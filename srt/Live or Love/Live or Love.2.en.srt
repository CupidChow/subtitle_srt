=Episode 2=

3
00:00:56,992 --> 00:00:58,632
Before, she'd rather escape the wedding.

4
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:00,111
Now she claims

5
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:02,032
she is Yushen's wife and wants to help.

6
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,751
Can Fang Lili

7
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:05,111
be trusted?

8
00:01:05,312 --> 00:01:06,631
It has only been three days.

9
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,751
How has she changed so quickly?

10
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:10,751
Yushen,

11
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:12,152
listen to me.

12
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:13,631
For this kind of woman,

13
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:15,872
you should stay away from her.

14
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:16,831
Grandma,

15
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:17,351
Dad,

16
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,631
I have a few words to say.

17
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:20,712
Go ahead.

18
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,471
In fact, I always have feelings for her.

19
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:26,592
A person

20
00:01:26,872 --> 00:01:28,032
follows her own heart,

21
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:29,432
no matter how others think.

22
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:30,432
This is not wrong.

23
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:31,872
On the contrary, I feel

24
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:34,271
such a person is more deserving of love.

25
00:01:34,872 --> 00:01:36,271
You call this

26
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:37,991
following her heart?

27
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:39,991
If Lili were an ordinary girl,

28
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:41,191
for someone she likes,

29
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:42,872
she would make breakfast, take the bus.

30
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:44,111
This sounds

31
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:45,471
probably more touching.

32
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:47,191
But unfortunately, she's too rich.

33
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:48,991
When she treats someone well,

34
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:50,991
she just spends money on them.

35
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,351
Is that her fault?

36
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:54,032
She just gives her all.

37
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,471
Why should we look down on her for that?

38
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:00,831
Grandma,

39
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:02,152
Lili

40
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:03,751
was into Luo Yan before.

41
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:05,152
I had no comment.

42
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:07,152
But now she has chosen me.

43
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:09,751
I don't want to miss her.

44
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:11,872
I have no time to listen to you ranting.

45
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:13,992
If she's willing to help you,

46
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:14,992
that's her business.

47
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:16,592
About this,

48
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:18,992
don't come asking my advice anymore.

49
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:23,712
Grandma.

50
00:02:30,432 --> 00:02:32,432
If she's willing pay for you, let her.

51
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:35,152
You two aren't officially married.

52
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,312
Let her stay in another room for now.

53
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:38,592
Thank you, Grandma.

54
00:02:49,432 --> 00:02:50,392
(What's going on?)

55
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,471
(Why should I care so much?)

56
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:53,872
(If not for him,)

57
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:55,312
(I might have gotten out already.)

58
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,231
(Forget it.)

59
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:00,671
(Consider it the game experience.)

60
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,671
(I need to get him to sign it soon.)

61
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:04,112
(I'll trap him just the same.)

62
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:12,992
Sorry, I startled you.

63
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:14,671
It's fine.

64
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:16,552
How did the talk go?

65
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:18,751
I guess they agreed.

66
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,552
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,351
It was me who borrowed money from you,

68
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:23,552
yet you had to defend me.

69
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:26,152
Your business is my business.

70
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,552
We are friends, after all.

71
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:29,671
So, can we sign the contract?

72
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:30,351
Of course.

73
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:33,432
But, Miss Fang,

74
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:35,911
you said that you were mine.

75
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:38,592
Were you serious about that?

76
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:40,071
Ah?

77
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:43,112
I knew it.

78
00:03:43,312 --> 00:03:44,231
You were simply kind.

79
00:03:45,231 --> 00:03:47,552
(What does his disappointed look mean?)

80
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:51,552
Don't worry.

81
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,671
Although Grandma let you move in,

82
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:54,592
as soon as possible,

83
00:03:54,872 --> 00:03:55,992
I will still make it clear.

84
00:03:56,432 --> 00:03:56,872
Wait.

85
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:00,471
Move into the An family?

86
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:03,992
Miss Fang,

87
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:05,751
lights are off. Rest early.

88
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:07,671
Madam An asked me to relay the message.

89
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:09,552
Yushen and you are not yet married.

90
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,872
Please uphold the propriety.

91
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:20,192
(Why do I feel like I've been duped?)

92
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:28,111
Mr. Luo. We arrived.

93
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:31,311
Mr. Luo?

94
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:39,632
Why am I here?

95
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:40,551
Mr. Luo,

96
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:42,512
you called me to get you
from the An's place.

97
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:44,991
From the An's place?

98
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:47,592
When was that?

99
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:52,871
Are you satisfied now?

100
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:54,871
Our family affair

101
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:56,871
is none of your business.

102
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:57,871
Then, I'll be leaving.

103
00:04:58,072 --> 00:04:58,952
Please take care.

104
00:04:59,192 --> 00:04:59,952
Madam An.

105
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:01,392
Why am I here?

106
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:03,991
Mr. Luo, you called me to get you
from the An's place.

107
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:27,632
Is Madam An asleep?

108
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,072
She just went to bed.

109
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:31,192
What about An Yushen's key?

110
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:32,351
Has it been handed over?

111
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:36,192
Yes, but

112
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:38,272
Fang Lili

113
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:39,632
covered his shortfall,

114
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:41,952
so

115
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:44,311
he can't leave Ju'an yet.

116
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:45,632
Fang Lili?

117
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,712
When did she go there?

118
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,752
She came right after you left.

119
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,712
Didn't you see her?

120
00:05:57,311 --> 00:05:58,512
Doesn't she hate An Yushen?

121
00:05:58,512 --> 00:05:59,072
Why?

122
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:01,311
I don't know.

123
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:03,192
What did Dad say?

124
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:06,512
Madam An agreed.

125
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:08,072
So,

126
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:10,311
Mr. An had nothing to say.

127
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:15,392
She, for An Yushen,

128
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:17,952
can tolerate Fang Lili.

129
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:21,192
Yet they can't let me join the family.

130
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:24,871
Haven't had dinner yet, have you?

131
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:26,871
I'll make you something.

132
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:37,392
You're a member of the family.

133
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:38,752
Sooner or later you will be.

134
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:19,752
What are you thinking?

135
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,471
As long as Madam An is around,

136
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,592
I can't rightfully inherit Ju'an.

137
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:29,192
And An Yushen will always

138
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:31,111
bother me like a fly.

139
00:07:34,072 --> 00:07:36,111
Grandma has bought a house abroad.

140
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,952
She should know

141
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:41,192
An Yushen won't stay in Ju'an for long.

142
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:46,791
Once An Yushen leaves,

143
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:48,832
Ju'an will be yours.

144
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:51,712
I'll always be with you.

145
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,392
You should go back.

146
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:56,752
Madam An may grow suspicious.

147
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,512
Gran-Grandma?

148
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:32,112
What are you doing here?

149
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:33,992
What?

150
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:36,352
Can't I come to your room?

151
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:38,112
It's so late.

152
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:39,112
Where have you been?

153
00:08:40,112 --> 00:08:40,632
I...

154
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:44,352
I went to the office to get something.

155
00:09:00,392 --> 00:09:00,992
Lin Lu.

156
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:04,752
You're newly graduated.

157
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:08,112
Intern in the office of Ju'an's CEO

158
00:09:09,352 --> 00:09:11,112
is a rare opportunity.

159
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:13,392
I know.

160
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:15,911
Grandma, you helped me

161
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:17,791
and care about me.

162
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,872
I'll keep it in mind.

163
00:09:19,512 --> 00:09:21,272
Your parents had an accident.

164
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:24,112
I adopted you,

165
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:27,352
regarding you as a member of our family.

166
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:30,551
This time, Li Zheng and the others
resigned together,

167
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:31,992
why didn't you

168
00:09:32,392 --> 00:09:33,872
inform Yushen in advance?

169
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:38,752
Grandma,

170
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,711
my place is not high enough.

171
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:43,352
There are many things I didn't know.

172
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:45,992
If I had known,

173
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:48,992
how could I not have told Yushen?

174
00:09:52,112 --> 00:09:52,911
Grandma,

175
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:55,272
I know what I need to do.

176
00:09:57,711 --> 00:09:59,112
Everything I have today

177
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:00,711
is given by you.

178
00:10:10,624 --> 00:10:11,776
(Ju'an Group)

179
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:20,551
Please sit.

180
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:26,392
Thank you.

181
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:33,152
I've reviewed the biweekly trend charts,

182
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,791
today is the best time to buy crude oil.

183
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:39,992
(After this, you'll lose everything)

184
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:41,632
But before that,

185
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:42,551
sign the contract.

186
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:43,352
No problem, right?

187
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:43,791
Yes.

188
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:48,352
My key was taken away by my dad.

189
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:50,232
I have to fill out an application form

190
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,512
to retrieve the key.

191
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:52,512
What company key?

192
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:54,591
The one used for account transactions.

193
00:10:54,632 --> 00:10:55,512
Luo Yan and I

194
00:10:55,512 --> 00:10:56,392
each have one.

195
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:57,911
But

196
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,512
if I can't get it back,

197
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:01,112
the transaction cannot proceed.

198
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,752
Is this at odds with contract signing?

199
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:04,112
What is the date today?

200
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:05,872
July 25th.

201
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:06,632
Okay, thank you.

202
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:10,752
(Is he pretending to be ignorant?)

203
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:12,671
(Does he not want to sign?)

204
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:16,512
Mr. An,

205
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:18,992
I always thought you were
a person of integrity.

206
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:20,112
If you don't sign,

207
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:20,872
I'll withdraw.

208
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:21,752
Do you understand?

209
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:25,752
Are you signing or not?

210
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:32,152
I...

211
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:33,512
I'll sign.

212
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,835
(Loan Agreement)

213
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:38,992
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:40,232
I...

215
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:41,992
I didn't do it on purpose.

216
00:11:42,472 --> 00:11:42,992
Well,

217
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:44,992
I'll have Feng make another copy.

218
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:46,752
You can go directly to him.

219
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:47,791
I'll get key.

220
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,872
I'm going to get the key.

221
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:50,512
You do the contract.

222
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,512
I should go.

223
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:55,911
Ten minutes later,

224
00:11:56,352 --> 00:11:57,711
I want to see the contract.

225
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:05,272
Who are you?

226
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:06,032
Scheduled?

227
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:07,112
How can you barge in?

228
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:09,872
I am An Yushen's fiancée.

229
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:11,112
(Contract)
I need his key.

230
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:13,992
So you are

231
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:15,911
that one.

232
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:18,152
I've heard about you.

233
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,591
So,

234
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:21,632
can I go take it now?

235
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:22,752
Miss Fang,

236
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,872
per the rules,

237
00:12:23,872 --> 00:12:25,632
I need to check with Mr. An

238
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,032
and then review your form.

239
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:28,112
After all,

240
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:29,752
the key of Ju'an

241
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:32,272
can't simply be given to just anyone.

242
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,465
(Mr. Luo)

243
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:43,872
In order to avoid further problems,

244
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:44,831
I think

245
00:12:45,272 --> 00:12:46,152
we should

246
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:48,791
discuss future investment strategies.

247
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:49,911
Client's call.

248
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:54,632
Mr. An,

249
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,711
please take a look.

250
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:02,992
Hello?

251
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:04,032
Hello,

252
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:04,911
Mr. An?

253
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,272
Young An wants the key back.

254
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:10,711
Hold them back.

255
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:12,671
Understood.

256
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:18,392
Can it be arranged now?

257
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,112
Yes.

258
00:13:22,992 --> 00:13:24,472
However, it's already twelve o'clock.

259
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:25,711
It's time for a lunch break.

260
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:26,752
Lunch break?

261
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:29,152
The form will take you five minutes.

262
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:30,872
Sign it and then it will be good to go.

263
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:34,512
Miss Fang,

264
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:35,791
you probably never worked

265
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,112
in such a big company, right?

266
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:40,032
We have hundreds of forms daily.

267
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:41,272
I have to

268
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:43,591
check them one by one.

269
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:45,392
It's not yet your turn.

270
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:48,232
Can't or won't you review it?

271
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:49,911
Miss Fang,

272
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,872
that was somewhat unfair, wasn't it?

273
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:53,352
Why do I feel

274
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:54,551
that you are

275
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:56,992
lack of manners?

276
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,272
I'm sorry,

277
00:13:59,272 --> 00:13:59,872
I forgot you've

278
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:01,711
made your father die in anger.

279
00:14:06,872 --> 00:14:07,752
Sorry, Miss Fang.

280
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:08,791
I have low blood sugar.

281
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:10,472
I need to go and have lunch first.

282
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:20,872
Sorry,

283
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,272
I didn't mean it.

284
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:33,752
Stop watching!

285
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:40,472
I hate the roles play too many tricks.

286
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:47,512
Your key.

287
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:50,551
You...

288
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:51,711
How did you get it?

289
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:53,152
Hurry up and buy your crude oil.

290
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:54,232
(Ju'an Group)

291
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:55,112
Mr. An!

292
00:14:55,272 --> 00:14:56,112
Mr. An!

293
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:58,191
This must be thoroughly investigated.

294
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:59,152
Look! This crazy woman

295
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:00,272
hurt me so bad!

296
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:01,591
She's gone too far.

297
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,272
She attacked me in public!

298
00:15:03,272 --> 00:15:04,112
Mr. An!

299
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:06,352
You must make her pay the price!

300
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:07,671
Mr. An!

301
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:08,591
See!

302
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:10,112
Forcibly getting the key,

303
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:11,352
assaulting others.

304
00:15:11,472 --> 00:15:12,951
It was all this crazy woman's doing!

305
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:14,752
Dad,

306
00:15:15,112 --> 00:15:16,392
we needed the key

307
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:17,711
to buy futures.

308
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:19,112
He's been giving me trouble.

309
00:15:19,512 --> 00:15:20,711
Who's giving you trouble?

310
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:22,112
Do you mean

311
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:23,392
as a member of the An family,

312
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:24,752
you can jump the queue?

313
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:25,831
Mr. An,

314
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,992
just tell us if he has this privilege.

315
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:28,671
If he does,

316
00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:30,632
then I have nothing more to say.

317
00:15:30,992 --> 00:15:32,752
I'll apologize to Young An.

318
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:34,272
Calm down.

319
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:37,152
Given your penchant
for citing company policies,

320
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:38,352
let me ask you,

321
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:39,512
Ju'an Enterprise regulations,

322
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:41,032
what is Section Seven, Rule Six?

323
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:42,791
Any matter involving the company's keys

324
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,272
is deemed an urgent matter,

325
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:45,671
eligible for expedited review.

326
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:48,232
How do I know what you'd use it for?

327
00:15:48,431 --> 00:15:49,671
What right have you to know

328
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:51,272
the purpose of Young An?

329
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:52,752
Today, if you

330
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,591
delayed his plan,

331
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:56,392
will you cover the company's loss?

332
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:03,352
Since you're clear about the rules,

333
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:04,791
you could've say so to Andy.

334
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:06,392
Why bother?

335
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,472
(I'm helping you.)

336
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:10,992
(You better stop talking.)

337
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:14,512
Because he won't give us the key.

338
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:17,352
Make it clear.

339
00:16:17,872 --> 00:16:18,512
Andy,

340
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:20,512
I've reviewed all your applications.

341
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:22,191
Most of them are from An Yushen.

342
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,512
There are even some
from three months ago.

343
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:26,232
How's that for a coincidence?

344
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,272
The ones awaiting are all An Yushen's.

345
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:29,752
There's not one from Luo Yan.

346
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:32,591
You are Mr. An's secretary.

347
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,152
Or are you wearing multiple hats?

348
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:37,791
Is this really happening?

349
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:39,032
Mr. An,

350
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:40,992
I'm just worried about Young An

351
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:42,392
getting impulsive sometimes,

352
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:43,752
Whether he gets impulsive or not,

353
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:46,112
do I need you to decide for me about it?

354
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:53,512
No need to come to the office tomorrow.

355
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:56,512
Mr. An?

356
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:57,591
Mr. An!

357
00:16:58,112 --> 00:16:58,632
Mr. Luo.

358
00:16:59,152 --> 00:16:59,911
Mr. Luo?

359
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:01,272
Mr. Luo!

360
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:02,392
Mr. Luo!

361
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:19,752
Luo Yan,

362
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:22,831
what I give you is yours.

363
00:17:23,672 --> 00:17:24,232
Understand?

364
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:26,272
Yes, Dad.

365
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:28,032
At the company,

366
00:17:28,752 --> 00:17:29,591
call me Mr. An.

367
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:31,952
Yes, Mr. An.

368
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,244
(Loan Agreement)

369
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:43,093
(Party B, An Yushen)

370
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,351
It's signed.

371
00:17:54,712 --> 00:17:56,192
Thank you for helping me again today.

372
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:57,032
No problem.

373
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:58,192
I should be thanking you.

374
00:17:58,472 --> 00:17:59,151
Thank me?

375
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:00,151
Thank me for what?

376
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:01,712
Thank you

377
00:18:02,992 --> 00:18:04,151
for the investment chance.

378
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:07,912
(Thanks for being so foolish,)

379
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:09,752
(making it so easy for me to win.)

380
00:18:11,552 --> 00:18:12,452
(Loan Agreement)

381
00:18:15,071 --> 00:18:16,272
You've altered my contract?

382
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:20,351
Some of my original clauses are missing.

383
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:24,192
When it was reprinted,

384
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,351
legal team reviewed it.

385
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:26,512
Maybe they made changes.

386
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,512
You showed it to the legal department?

387
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:31,752
Isn't it too harsh now?

388
00:18:32,032 --> 00:18:32,752
No problem.

389
00:18:33,272 --> 00:18:34,752
I'll take you to reason with them.

390
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:35,831
We can change it back.

391
00:18:36,912 --> 00:18:37,631
No rush.

392
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:42,032
Maybe another day.

393
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:43,432
Young An,

394
00:18:44,272 --> 00:18:45,311
you did right buying gold.

395
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:46,432
Oil prices are plummeting.

396
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:47,391
Everyone is selling off,

397
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:48,151
switching to gold.

398
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:49,591
Luckily we got in early.

399
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,712
The principal doubled.

400
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:53,151
Purchasing gold indeed yields profit.

401
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:55,232
Gold?

402
00:18:55,631 --> 00:18:56,912
Weren't you buying crude oil?

403
00:18:57,712 --> 00:18:58,472
Here's the thing.

404
00:18:58,631 --> 00:18:59,952
The master called me

405
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,952
said I must buy gold today.

406
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:04,512
Truly, heaven's plans reign supreme.

407
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:05,232
Feng,

408
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,472
let the master perform another ritual.

409
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:08,151
Yes, sir.

410
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:13,111
(This NPC,)

411
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,712
(is he really foolish or pretending?)

412
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:17,912
Oh,

413
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,591
today's company banquet

414
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,551
will be held at home.

415
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:21,992
We'll go home early to get changed.

416
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:23,791
Okay.

417
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:26,912
Aotian.

418
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:28,111
I am here.

419
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:29,591
For An Yushen, the NPC,

420
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:30,512
is there a loophole?

421
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:31,432
No.

422
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,551
So this loser really got me

423
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:35,432
lose fifty million,

424
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:36,591
and the contract was altered?

425
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:38,432
Understood correctly.

426
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:39,032
Be quiet.

427
00:19:40,071 --> 00:19:41,752
(He said it yesterday)

428
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:44,272
(he'll exit leadership
once Grandma's wish is met.)

429
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:47,351
(Maybe I can convince him to quit.)

430
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,472
(Attending to a tyrant man,)

431
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:53,712
(of course we need)

432
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:55,311
(Mary Sue)

433
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:56,912
(Purchased "Mary Sue" ring)

434
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:58,551
Mary Sue ring.

435
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:08,752
Miss Fang.

436
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:12,952
Thanks for your eagerness to assist.

437
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:14,272
I...

438
00:20:14,351 --> 00:20:15,232
You!

439
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:19,151
No need to thank me.

440
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,992
After spending so many days with me,

441
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:22,672
do you not know my feelings yet?

442
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:26,232
Your feelings?

443
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:28,512
(This "Mary Sue" mode,)

444
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:30,071
(is it so intense?)

445
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:33,432
Mr. An...

446
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:34,791
Miss Fang,

447
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:35,591
you...

448
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:37,272
Haven't you always liked Luo Yan?

449
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:39,272
You bad!

450
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:40,952
Luo Yan?

451
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,192
Are you laughing at me too?

452
00:20:43,631 --> 00:20:45,472
Miss Fang, are you drunk?

453
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:46,912
I am not.

454
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:06,871
(Did I just fall flat on the ground)

455
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:08,311
(and even did a spin?)

456
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:10,151
Take me away,

457
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:12,032
to where no one knows us.

458
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:13,232
A place just for us.

459
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:14,472
Right here,

460
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:17,912
I feel like everyone is mocking my past.

461
00:21:22,551 --> 00:21:23,791
(a 45-degree profile,)

462
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,272
(a tear rolls down the cheek.)

463
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,712
(Even this detail is touched upon?)

464
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:29,912
Miss Fang,

465
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:31,672
I...

466
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:33,952
(What's with my hand?)

467
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:35,952
(Why make unnecessary motions?)

468
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,111
(Well.)

469
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:37,871
(Whatever.)

470
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:39,831
Don't talk.

471
00:21:40,472 --> 00:21:41,272
Kiss me.

472
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:45,992
Fang Lili.

473
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:10,551
Baby.

474
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:14,672
Come on, look!

475
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:16,111
How do I look today?

476
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,871
Are you talking to me?

477
00:22:22,232 --> 00:22:23,311
What else?

478
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:24,311
What are you doing?

479
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:27,232
Do you really plan to marry this

480
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:28,391
"pick-up" guy?

481
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,151
Well,

482
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:34,351
you guys talk.

483
00:22:35,151 --> 00:22:36,071
Listen to me first.

484
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:37,151
I'm not close with her.

485
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:38,272
I don't know her.

486
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,192
You don't know me?

487
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:41,591
Me,

488
00:22:41,952 --> 00:22:43,071
Yin Zhiluo.

489
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:46,871
The beautiful and wealthy
eldest daughter of the Yin family.

490
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:49,432
Have you lost your memory?

491
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:51,151
We've been sisters for years,

492
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:52,952
a very long time.

493
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:55,151
And now we're not close?

494
00:22:56,712 --> 00:22:57,512
You, for him,

495
00:22:57,712 --> 00:22:59,151
why are you pretending here?

496
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:01,432
(Where did this dramatic)

497
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:02,432
(female NPC come from?)

498
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,111
(I feel speechless.)

499
00:23:07,232 --> 00:23:07,912
(Okay, enough.)

500
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:09,831
(Consider it a wasted effort.)

501
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:18,111
Miss Yin,

502
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:20,351
I don't care what happened before.

503
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:22,272
She is now my fiancée.

504
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:24,272
She says she doesn't know you.

505
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,512
I hope you won't bother her again.

506
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:28,272
We do not welcome you.

507
00:23:30,871 --> 00:23:31,791
Fang Lili,

508
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:32,952
say something?

509
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,752
(This "Mary Sue",)

510
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,192
(is it really so powerful?)

511
00:23:36,591 --> 00:23:37,351
Miss Yin,

512
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,791
there's nothing to say.

513
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:40,032
Please leave.

514
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:43,831
Excuse me.

515
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:51,432
(No way.)

516
00:23:51,672 --> 00:23:52,992
(Falling flat again?)

517
00:23:54,871 --> 00:23:56,071
Did you twist your ankle?

518
00:23:56,752 --> 00:23:57,272
(Wait.)

519
00:23:57,551 --> 00:23:59,831
(It can't be that plot...)

520
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:02,311
(Forget it.)

521
00:24:02,752 --> 00:24:03,631
(Let it be.)

522
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:19,752
Are you okay?

523
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:22,432
I'll get you some water.

524
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:44,071
you said you wanted to leave with me.

525
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:45,992
I still feel it's not quite right.

526
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:50,311
You should rest for a bit.

527
00:24:50,712 --> 00:24:52,151
I'll find you help shortly.

528
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:55,871
An Yushen.

529
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:57,912
I'll tell you once again,

530
00:24:58,472 --> 00:25:00,071
what I just said was sincere.

531
00:25:00,752 --> 00:25:01,631
If tomorrow,

532
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:03,071
you don't leave here with me...

533
00:25:05,111 --> 00:25:05,432
You...

534
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,032
What are you going to do?

535
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:09,871
I will just

536
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,192
not live anymore.

537
00:25:15,871 --> 00:25:16,712
Three seconds.

538
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:18,311
Three,

539
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:20,631
two...

540
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:21,952
No, no...

541
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:23,672
Hold off on being impulsive.

542
00:25:23,912 --> 00:25:24,631
I promise you,

543
00:25:24,912 --> 00:25:26,151
I will go with you tomorrow.

544
00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:29,311
Put the knife down first.

545
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:34,712
Good boy.

546
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:37,672
Remember to announce your withdrawal
on stage later.

547
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:52,912
Fang Lili,

548
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:54,111
where are you?

549
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:54,912
Come out!

550
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:58,032
Fang Lili?

551
00:26:03,752 --> 00:26:04,952
Fang Lili!

552
00:26:04,952 --> 00:26:06,351
Come out and explain!

553
00:26:06,472 --> 00:26:07,912
For the sake of a man,

554
00:26:07,912 --> 00:26:09,232
you severed ties with me?

555
00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:10,111
Fang Lili!

556
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:11,551
Where are you, Fang Lili?

557
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:13,631
How can there be someone
even dumber than Fang Lili?

558
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,712
I can't believe there's someone
dumber than you.

559
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,151
You're here too?

560
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:21,871
I...

561
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:23,871
Can't you stay away from me?

562
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:28,071
You've got it wrong.

563
00:26:28,151 --> 00:26:29,831
I'm really not here to see you.

564
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,232
So,

565
00:26:41,672 --> 00:26:42,591
this is why you

566
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:43,712
provoked me today?

567
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:46,311
Draw back

568
00:26:46,512 --> 00:26:47,672
to get my attention?

569
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:49,551
I...

570
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:50,712
I'll say it again.

571
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:52,232
When I see you,

572
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,192
I just feel disgusted.

573
00:27:04,992 --> 00:27:06,432
Our previous collaboration was good.

574
00:27:06,512 --> 00:27:08,311
I hope we can continue to collaborate.

575
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:08,952
No problem.

576
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,351
Excuse me.

577
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,432
A glass of champagne.

578
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:28,472
Thank you.

579
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:31,712
Okay.

580
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,712
An Yushen will take the stage later.

581
00:27:42,752 --> 00:27:43,992
Guess what he is going to say.

582
00:27:46,591 --> 00:27:47,391
Whatever he say,

583
00:27:47,391 --> 00:27:48,672
Dad has already promised me

584
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:50,992
to announce his exit from management.

585
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:54,591
After so many years,

586
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:56,871
you're finally getting it.

587
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:05,831
(30th Anniversary Celebration)

588
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:06,752
Don't be nervous.

589
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:10,591
(He looks rather pleasing now.)

590
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:12,032
(Once I get out,)

591
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,871
(I'll definitely give you more parts.)

592
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,791
I heard you've made
a fool of yourself again.

593
00:28:33,871 --> 00:28:35,232
Hasn't the Fang family taught you

594
00:28:35,232 --> 00:28:36,591
the meaning of shame?

595
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:38,151
Show some dignity.

596
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:39,351
Leave the An family.

597
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:40,952
Don't make me say it again.

598
00:28:42,752 --> 00:28:43,831
Come back here.

599
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:46,032
Who are you talking to?

600
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:47,912
I'm about to go out right now.

601
00:28:47,912 --> 00:28:48,752
Time is limited,

602
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:50,432
So I'll scold you for five minutes.

603
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:51,311
Fang Lili.

604
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:51,871
You...

605
00:28:58,192 --> 00:28:59,151
An Xiangyang, right?

606
00:28:59,752 --> 00:29:00,952
Who named you?

607
00:29:00,952 --> 00:29:02,032
Such an awful name.

608
00:29:02,311 --> 00:29:03,631
Although you're not human,

609
00:29:03,631 --> 00:29:05,551
I still aim to teach you some
human principles.

610
00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:07,551
Man acts, Heaven watches.

611
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,512
A character like you will
not meet a good end.

612
00:29:10,512 --> 00:29:11,272
Fang Lili,

613
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,992
I will make you pay for these words.

614
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:14,712
Sorry.

615
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:16,472
I'll be out in a minute.

616
00:29:16,752 --> 00:29:17,752
You have no chance.

617
00:29:17,752 --> 00:29:18,631
Hello everyone.

618
00:29:19,151 --> 00:29:20,192
Thank you all

619
00:29:20,672 --> 00:29:22,912
for attending
the appreciation banquet of Ju'an Group.

620
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:24,551
I want to take this opportunity

621
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:25,952
to announce something.

622
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:27,232
Over the years,

623
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,472
my power is limited,

624
00:29:28,992 --> 00:29:30,871
and have led to losses for the company.

625
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:32,631
My father

626
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:33,912
is advanced in years.

627
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:35,831
And he has been choosing

628
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:37,871
someone to lead Ju'an into the future.

629
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:38,912
I know,

630
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:40,591
perhaps Luo Yan

631
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:43,192
is more suited to be CEO
of Ju'an Group than I am.

632
00:29:43,591 --> 00:29:45,272
But I still want to make an effort.

633
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,192
For the one I love,

634
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,192
those who have helped me,

635
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:50,512
and for myself as well,

636
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:54,672
I believe that I can lead Ju'an

637
00:29:54,952 --> 00:29:55,831
towards the future.
