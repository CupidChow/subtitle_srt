00:00:47,842 --> 00:00:48,640
=Live or Love?=

3
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:52,256
=Episode 12=

4
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,039
I have told you not

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,359
to cause any loss of life.

6
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,840
What exactly do you want?

7
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,399
I know.

8
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,199
I know what to do.

9
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,960
And you did something like this?

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,080
If you keep doing this,

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,440
don't come back.

12
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:14,640
Luo Yan,

13
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:17,960
I am not as smart as you

14
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,279
or Fang Lili.

15
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,600
I am the most ordinary one.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,679
But I want to help you.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,559
The only thing that makes me better

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,880
is that I fear nothing.

19
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:39,559
Hungry, huh?

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,199
I'll leave once done.

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,279
Very soon.

22
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,080
Where is Feng Zhixing?

23
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,200
He was frightened last time.

24
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,159
I've granted him leave.

25
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,800
Your people are a bit too weak.

26
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
That is unimportant.

27
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,240
Character matters most.

28
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,279
I have to go.

29
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,679
After all, you're not in a hurry.

30
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:04,320
You've not yet secured the property,
so you must be quite free.

31
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,040
You...

32
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,039
How could that be?

33
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:45,880
Fang Lili said

34
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,200
An Yushen buried those
cultural relics himself.

35
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,919
The workers aren't stupid.

36
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,799
Just buried in,

37
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:52,719
the soil turned over.

38
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:53,919
Couldn't they tell?

39
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,039
I have already verified it.

40
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Those indeed belong to An Liminghui.

41
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,880
At the time,

42
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,080
if you could be smarter,

43
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,839
your current troubles wouldn't exist.

44
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,560
My fault.

45
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:12,599
So now, this land

46
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:13,919
is in An Yushen's hands.

47
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,599
What should we do?

48
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,479
Mr. Shi,

49
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,239
you take a break first.

50
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,880
Fang Lili said she has a way.

51
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:28,479
I'll leave it to her to handle.

52
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:32,200
Fine.

53
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,039
I want to see Yin Zhiluo.

54
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,680
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,120
She is not in.

56
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,880
How about

57
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,159
you come in and sit down?

58
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,224
Oh?

59
00:06:05,716 --> 00:06:07,328
(Fang Lili)

60
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,359
I heard you fainted from fear.

61
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,680
Let me calm your nerves.

62
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,880
No drinking.

63
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,279
I have to go to work tomorrow.

64
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,328
(Fang Lili)

65
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,399
Hello?

66
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:37,719
Hello? Lili?

67
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,719
It was my driver.

68
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,080
My home?

69
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,200
I came out for exercise.

70
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,760
Wait for me.

71
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,880
I'll be right back.

72
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:04,680
Honey,

73
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:05,960
how did you get here?

74
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
You exercised in this outfit?

75
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,880
I went to dance.

76
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Dance?

77
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,399
What kind of dance?

78
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,880
Pole dance.

79
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,599
Pole dance?

80
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,640
With whom?

81
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,640
With...

82
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,640
No, I really went dancing.

83
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,159
I've been very stressed.

84
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,239
My sister left.

85
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,599
My dad tracks my performance.

86
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,519
I...

87
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,759
I dance

88
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,839
to relieve stress.

89
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,440
Alright then.

90
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,920
I believe whatever you say.

91
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,639
Want some help with KPI?

92
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,080
Help with KPI?

93
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,479
Your family got this land
a few years ago.

94
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,759
It's adjacent
to the former glass factory site.

95
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,359
Turn it into a cemetery?

96
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,119
No need to worry about the plan.

97
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,359
Your dad will like it.

98
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,239
Fang Lili, have you gone mad?

99
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,040
A cemetery is a tough task.

100
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,759
For obtaining land
development privileges,

101
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,680
all points were deducted.

102
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,960
Young An,

103
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,800
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,639
I am late.

105
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,960
Didn't I give you the day off today?

106
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,800
Did you forget?

107
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:39,599
Where to?

108
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,759
I will

109
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,599
go home.

110
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,560
Why do you seem so distracted?

111
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,999
Are you in love?

112
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,119
I am not.

113
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,456
I...

114
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,359
I...

115
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:53,239
Nothing.

116
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,639
All good.

117
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,176
Young An,
a few investors want to see you

118
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:03,328
and withdraw investments.

119
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:04,400
What to do? Shall we meet?

120
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,440
Withdraw investments?

121
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:06,880
(Ju'an Group)

122
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,479
How could you keep it secret from us?

123
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,280
They're just scamming for money.

124
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,080
Even for a luxurious residential area

125
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,359
near a graveyard,

126
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,719
there won't be a single buyer.

127
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,999
Pay us the money back!

128
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,839
Let's go.

129
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,960
How did you come up with

130
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:38,239
building a cemetery
by the residential area?

131
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,920
Such a sneaky trick.

132
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,119
I like it.

133
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,359
I learned a lot

134
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,320
from you.

135
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,239
After spending so much time with you,

136
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,879
I've learned all kinds of tactics.

137
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,080
What to do now?

138
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,080
We're planning a housing development.

139
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,680
They got a cemetery nearby.

140
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
Who's so malicious?

141
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,280
It's Yinxiang Group's land.

142
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,040
Of course, it's Yin Zhiluo.

143
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:19,392
She...

144
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,639
It's her.

145
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,119
But such tactics

146
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,320
are beyond her.

147
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,560
If you ask,

148
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,719
you have to ask Fang Lili.

149
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,560
She is behind this?

150
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,160
Young An,

151
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,160
what's happening between you both?

152
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,040
Maybe you should go talk to her.

153
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,359
Don't make it such a big deal.

154
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,239
Business is business.

155
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,519
At this moment,

156
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:41,839
we need to stay rational.

157
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:49,280
(CEO Office)

158
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,800
When did you crave for sweets?

159
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,879
Miss Fang,

160
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
you learn underhanded tricks quite fast.

161
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,960
Well,

162
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,519
is that against the rules?

163
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,879
Building residential area is fine.

164
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,200
Think carefully.

165
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,040
Perhaps,

166
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,160
we'll collaborate.

167
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,040
Buy a house and get a free burial space.

168
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,560
Open the window and honor ancestors.

169
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,320
Thank you for being so considerate.

170
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,359
You're welcome.

171
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,080
What?

172
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,759
Can't I talk a bit more

173
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:31,599
with my wife?

174
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,879
Who's your wife?

175
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,359
You're quite immersed.

176
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,560
Is the divorce agreement finalized?

177
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,359
Young An,

178
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,160
what're you talking about?

179
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,280
You're not blaming others

180
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,400
for bad luck, right?

181
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,320
I discussed domestic matters with Lili.

182
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,239
How does it concern you?

183
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,599
Sorry.

184
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:52,999
Fang Lili

185
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:54,400
is now a member of our department.

186
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:55,999
I'm taking her to a meeting.

187
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:58,400
Excuse me.

188
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,719
This member of your department

189
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,119
is a member of our family.

190
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,160
Please wait a moment.

191
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:16,320
Be careful.

192
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,280
Young An.

193
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,239
Let me tell you this.

194
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,280
Even I lose all money on this project,

195
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,280
I'll ensure Luo Yan's total defeat

196
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,200
and make Fang Lili feel ashamed.

197
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,239
Didn't you just say

198
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,119
we should stay rational?

199
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,239
Miss,

200
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,479
Young An is here.

201
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:15,759
An Yushen?

202
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:17,839
What's he here for?

203
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,800
I...

204
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,879
I'm going to the restroom.

205
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:45,320
An Yushen,

206
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,999
why are you here now?

207
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,119
I'm here to discuss partnership.

208
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,960
Ms. Yin, I heard you have

209
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,759
recently taken an interest
in real estate.

210
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,440
So I want to ask you

211
00:14:58,719 --> 00:14:59,920
if you are interested

212
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,119
in joining me.

213
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,359
About real estate,

214
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,839
I only do that for my dad.

215
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,359
I don't have much ambition.

216
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,920
Let's skip this.

217
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,560
Let's talk about you and Lili.

218
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,080
Are you two fighting again?

219
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,320
Do you want me

220
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,479
to help you two make up?

221
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,519
Luo,

222
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,479
I just wanted to ask for your advice.

223
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,759
Spouses shouldn't
harbor overnight grudges.

224
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,239
Lili and I had a fight.

225
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:22,160
If it leads you

226
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,352
to developing this good land
into a cemetery,

227
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:25,536
don't you think it's a pity?

228
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,599
Since you already know,

229
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,320
I won't beat around the bush.

230
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,759
The cemetery development

231
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,479
is something
I have considered thoroughly.

232
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Setting that aside,

233
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,599
I've already promised Lili.

234
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,080
If you want to cooperate,

235
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,759
fine.

236
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,519
Make up with Lili.

237
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,040
If she is okay with it,

238
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,879
I'll agree.

239
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:42,759
Luo,

240
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:44,719
you are Lili's friend,

241
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:45,879
and also my friend.

242
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,719
And I would

243
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:49,599
do everything for my friends.

244
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,479
I heard Yinxiang has encountered
financial issues.

245
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,359
If you're willing,

246
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:56,479
I can finance the purchase of this land,

247
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,800
in cash,

248
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,320
paid in full at one time.

249
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,519
I won't make you wait.

250
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:03,320
Yinxiang has financial issues.

251
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:04,599
How do you know?

252
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,160
I heard about it.

253
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,080
Luo,

254
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,759
I'm doing this for you.

255
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,560
Hello.

256
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,999
What's happening with the bank?

257
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,719
When were you told?

258
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,040
What is the specific reason?

259
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:32,920
Risk assessment?

260
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,599
How did they know?

261
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,320
Alright.

262
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,080
I understand.

263
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,320
Hey.

264
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,280
Answer it.

265
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,320
Hello?

266
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,599
Where are you?

267
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,639
How come you vanished once we got here?

268
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,640
I'm downstairs.

269
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,479
Come down quickly.

270
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,759
I...

271
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:10,479
Vanished once you got here?

272
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,799
Are you hiding from me?

273
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,319
No,

274
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,079
I didn't.

275
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,039
Feng Zhixing,

276
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:15,999
what to hide from?

277
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:17,160
We're all adults.

278
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,079
Let's forget what happened last night.

279
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,559
It's not a big deal.

280
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,120
Just like that?

281
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,600
So what?

282
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,200
Do you

283
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,880
want me to take responsibility for you?

284
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,559
No need.

285
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,319
Absolutely not.

286
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,319
I'll leave now.

287
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,360
About what happened yesterday,

288
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:39,319
sorry.

289
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,519
No need for apologies.

290
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:42,840
No one is at a loss.

291
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,120
Okay.

292
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,039
Just go.

293
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,239
Still here?

294
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,960
To deal with me,

295
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,920
so hardworking.

Thank you, Aotian.

Never mind.

307

The heaven wants me home.

308
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,719
Go home to eat.

309
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,960
You...

310
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,719
Where to?

311
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,719
Power's out.

312
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,680
I'm going home.

313
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,960
I just came from the front desk.

314
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,239
Access's dead. We can't exit.

315
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,239
Where are you going now?

316
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,719
I'll have instant noodles.

317
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,600
What's up?

318
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,559
Nothing.

320
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:27,559
You're not scared, are you?

321
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,319
No, not at all.

322
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,400
I...

323
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
I...

324
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:34,920
I want instant noodles too.

325
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,279
Let's go.

326
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,200
Should I add the spicy packet for you?

327
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,719
Add half of it, thank you.

328
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,079
You offered to make me instant noodles.

329
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,239
You're not drugging me, are you?

330
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,680
You've watched too many period dramas.

331

At scheming,

332
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
I'm not as good as you.

333
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,519
I'm simply learning from you.

334
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:10,400
Not like you, talent at full level

335
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400

Everyone has their strengths.

337
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,039
But what you're best at

338
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,279
is being

339
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,400
two-faced.

340
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,559
Otherwise,

341
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,360
you couldn't have been Mrs. An.

342
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,440
Compared to you,
I am at kindergarten level.

343
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,799
When you pretend to be pitiful
as An Yushen,

344
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,440
didn't I also get fooled by you?

345
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,680
It's already 12 AM.

346
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,160
There is no cake.

347
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,640
Just take instant noodles

348
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,160
as longevity noodles.

349
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,160
Happy birthday.

350
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,999

00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:57,880
I

352
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,999
always believe

353
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:00,160
that knowing your enemy

354
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,319

360
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,400
you've remembered my birthday?

361
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,519

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
I'm sorry.

387
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,799
Our group
is having some cash flow problems.

388
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,200
An Yushen said he can buy this land.

389
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:30,400
I really need the money right now.

390
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,960
I might not be able to help you.

391
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,719
Sorry.

392
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,440
I need to go.

393
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,200
An Hang,

394
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,479
this is the good news you mentioned?

395
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,039
The power is on.

396
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,039
Isn't this good news?

397
00:23:59,072 --> 00:23:59,680
Fang Li,

398
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,519
calm down.

399
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,799
Eat some noodles first.

400
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:02,960
We'll continue tomorrow.

401
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,120
(Why are you saying sorry?)

402
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:08,704
♪Unloading my luggage,

403
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:12,576

(just pretend it never happened?)

00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:34,112
♪I Let go of what should be let go♪

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:03,584
Luo Yan,

412
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,719
if you want An Yushen to lose,

413
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:07,279
halt his glass factory development.

414
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,120
Yin Zhiluo is just short of some cash.

415
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,479
And Yinxiang Group has deep roots
in Jincheng.

416
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,640
Once they get the cash,

417
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,079
the money can quickly be repaid.

418
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:16,999
What's more important now is

419
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:19,239
if we can temporarily fill this gap,

420
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,640
Yin Zhiluo won't be forced

421
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,880
to sell the land to An Yushen,

422
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,880
and our plan can continue.

423
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:26,920
As long as the cemetery is finalized,

424
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,600
even if someone invests in An Yushen,

425
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,440
his project can only rot
in his own hands.

426
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:33,200
He'll lose all the money.

427
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,360
And Yin Zhiluo has already said

428
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,559
after the cemetery is built,

429
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,479
she'll surrender a share.

430
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:41,519
You will be able to get a share
of all the income.

431
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,719
Tell her,

432
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,600
I'll lend her the money

433
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,680
without interest.

434
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,880
Are you sure?

435
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,999
I spent the morning
investigating at the bank.

436
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,559
An Yushen made

437
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,360
a risk assessment report on Yinxiang,

438
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,120
urging the bank not to lend to me.

439
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,960
Attempting to undermine me?

440
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,719
I even wanted you two back together.

441
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:20,400
Awful!

442
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,600
Now I fully support you to divorce him.

443
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,360
I am determined to build this cemetery.

444
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,600
Calm down, Luo.

445
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,479
Rest assured.

446
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,640
I will definitely make you money.

447
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,719
Trust me.

448
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,999
Reach out to all channels

449
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,279
to market the cemetery.

450
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,479
A higher profile is best.

451
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,319
Three days.

452
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,680
Within three days,

453
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,759
if it can't be dealt with,

454
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,039
we'll all withdraw our investments.

455
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:58,432
(Mr. Li from Party A)

456
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,880
Young An,

457
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,759
how come

458
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,559
they can build the cemetery now?

459
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,200
What on earth is going on?

460
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:11,960
Feng,

461
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,160
in the business world,

462
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,479
you must remember

463
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,440
if there are other choices,

464
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,079
don't mess with women.

465
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,680
Make an appointment with Yin Zhiluo.

466
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,239
Join me to meet her later.

467
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,272
What?

468
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:33,999
It's nothing.

469
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:35,880
I'll make the appointment.

470
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,279
Ms. Yin,

471
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,840
Young An from Ju'an has arrived.

472
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,759
Hello, Ms. Yin.

473
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,559
Call me Ms. Yin today?

474
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,440
You change your tune pretty quickly.

475
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,200
I'm here today for business.

476
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,719
Ms. Yin sounds more appropriate.

477
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:01,400
I know you and Lili are good friends.

478
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,120
You're also a businessperson.

479
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,360
As long as your land is open to sell,

480
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,559
I have good price.

481
00:29:12,096 --> 00:29:15,488
(Land Transfer Contract)

482
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,160
I offer two hundred million yuan

483
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,360
to buy this land.

484
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,840
Here is the drafted contract.

485
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,039
You can raise any concerns.

486
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,920
You likely won't see this price again.

487
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,079
You seem to be fighting with no way out.

488
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,319
You must stop the cemetery development

489
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,960
before satisfying the developers.

490
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,840
I'm not very good at negotiation.

491
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,960
But I got a friend
to discuss this with you.

492
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,479
You can talk it over.

493
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,319
I have a spa appointment.

494
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,239
So I'll take my leave.

495
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,440
Young An,

496
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,680
we're friends here.

497
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,279
You rushed to the bank
to trouble Yinxiang.

498
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,920
How can two hundred million yuan

499
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,279
mend your rift with Ms. Yin?

500
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,999
A flat price,

501
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,680
four hundred million yuan.

502
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Fang Lili,

503
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,039
why don't you just rob me?

504
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:27,559
If you don't want it,
we'll convert it into a cemetery.

505
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
Then consider your real estate project
doomed.

506
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:32,279
And if you do buy,

507
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,079
I truly wonder

508
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,640
how you'll get all that money.

509
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,160
Young An,

510
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:41,680
doing business isn't easy.

511
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,160
No problem.

512
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:48,680
I can afford it.

513
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,999
Oh really?

514
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:54,559
One additional clause to the contract.

515
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,360
You must pay in full within three days.

516
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:59,920
Otherwise, pay 20 percent
of penalty for contract breach.

517
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:02,279
If you can't pay on time,

518
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:04,840
you lose.

519
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,840
Rest assured,

520
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,079
I will definitely find a way

521
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:13,519
