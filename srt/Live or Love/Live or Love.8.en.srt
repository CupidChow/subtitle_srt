00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:47,842
=Live or Love?=

2
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:48,640
=Live or Love?=

3
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,256
=Episode 8=

4
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:07,329
Why bother me here
instead of being with your Zhili?

5
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,288
Why are you picking on her?

6
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:13,329
I pick on anyone
who questions my abilities,

7
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:14,528
including you.

8
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:16,368
I'm doing my rounds shortly.

9
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:17,728
You can go home

10
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:19,088
or hang out with Yin Zhili,

11
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:20,129
whatever.

12
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:21,329
Wait.

13
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:27,129
Ever since you took on this event,

14
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:28,528
you've been working so hard.

15
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:30,489
It's definitely not to bring down Ju'an.

16
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:32,609
I shouldn't have doubted you.

17
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:33,288
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,489
I haven't finished my work yet.

19
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,648
You've got something in your hair.

20
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:51,569
Here, for you.

21
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:53,209
My apology.

22
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:55,808
You

23
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,288
are pretty nimble.

24
00:01:58,849 --> 00:01:59,728
Not bad.

25
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:00,728
Just practiced yesterday.

26
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:01,808
Gave it to an NPC.

27
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,728
What NPC?

28
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:06,728
A little girl.

29
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:07,728
Quite cute, actually.

30
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:12,049
I figured I could score some points.

31
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,489
Turned out I got nothing.

32
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:15,248
Points?

33
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:16,449
Don't you know?

34
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:18,729
Helping the old, young, and vulnerable,

35
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:19,648
especially women,

36
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:21,128
usually gets you reward points.

37
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:22,688
I helped that little girl

38
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:24,808
figuring I'd get at least
a few hundred points.

39
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:26,329
Turns out, I got nothing.

40
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,289
I so regret it.

41
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:30,088
You regret it?

42
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:31,169
Nah.

43
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:31,968
You know.

44
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:34,049
I won two thousand in the lottery

45
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:35,329
and just gave it to her.

46
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:36,568
Two grand!

47
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:37,609
I could've done anything!

48
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:40,528
Where are you going?

49
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:41,688
Work.

50
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:42,609
I'll go with you.

51
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:43,808
Just go away.

52
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:47,568
What's wrong with her?

53
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,049
Ridiculous.

54
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:54,568
(An Hang.)

55
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:56,169
(If I ever think of you again,)

56
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:57,609
(I'll poke myself in the eye.)

57
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:02,568
(At least 20 percent off
for Qixi Festival)

58
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:03,449
Happy Qixi Festival.

59
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:04,185
Thanks.

60
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,920
- Happy Qixi Festival.
- Happy Qixi Festival.

61
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,656
Thank you.

62
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:07,248
Hello.

63
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:08,528
- Happy Qixi Festival.
- Right.

64
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:09,889
- Happy Qixi Festival.
- Happy Qixi Festival.

65
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,408
Thanks.

66
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:11,329
Here you are.

67
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:12,408
Look much fancier.

68
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:12,992
Have some tea.

69
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:13,648
Exactly.

70
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:14,929
Even Yin has moved in.

71
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:16,248
- Happy Qixi Festival.
- Thank you.

72
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:17,808
Happy Qixi Festival.

73
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:19,368
- Thanks.
- Happy Qixi Festival.

74
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:20,489
- Tea, please.
- Thank you.

75
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:23,449
- Happy Qixi Festival.
- Thank you.

76
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:24,248
Prepare more.

77
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:25,688
Just a moment.

78
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:26,528
Tea's coming soon.

79
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:29,209
Check there later.

80
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,368
Alright, let's check it out.

81
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,009
An Hang

82
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:36,489
really doesn't lift a finger.

83
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,049
I haven't even had a bite to eat
all morning.

84
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:45,929
Bad news.

85
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:47,889
Bad news, Miss Fang.

86
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:48,889
Some...

87
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:50,289
Something's up.

88
00:03:57,609 --> 00:03:58,889
The sales say there's still

89
00:03:58,889 --> 00:03:59,848
a huge line waiting.

90
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,848
But we've only got 50 creams left.

91
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:03,128
Selling that fast?

92
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,808
We've only had a few hundred people.

93
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:06,729
It's Yin's first youth product launch,

94
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:08,568
so a bunch of scalpers showed up,

95
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,209
and bought dozens each.

96
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:11,848
Fifteen hundred? No.

97
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:12,609
Just for one.

98
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:13,329
Add more.

99
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:14,088
Two. I want two.

100
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:14,889
No way.

101
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:16,008
Sir.

102
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,688
No scalping here.

103
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:19,489
Go, go.

104
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:20,289
Wait.

105
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:22,304
What's it?

106
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,729
Please return these products.

107
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,089
I queued,

108
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:29,368
and paid for them myself.

109
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:30,688
Why return them to you?

110
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:31,729
I've said,

111
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:34,929
no scalping here.

112
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:38,049
Got any proof?

113
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:42,049
Stop right there.

114
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:43,328
What are you doing?

115
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:43,936
What's it?

116
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:44,529
Seriously?

117
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:45,409
What do you want?

118
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,409
Miss Fang, let it go.

119
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:47,929
They are not

120
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:49,049
worth our time.

121
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:56,969
I've been queuing for half an hour.

122
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:58,529
Do you have any stock?

123
00:04:58,529 --> 00:04:59,609
(Special offer)
Exactly.

124
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:01,649
Are there products available?

125
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:02,768
Just let us know.

126
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:03,368
It's been ages.

127
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:04,169
Exactly!

128
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:05,248
We are busy.

129
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:06,208
Any stock or not?

130
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,128
Any stock left?

131
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:07,888
No more queuing.

132
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:08,489
Time-wasting.

133
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:09,169
Give us notice!

134
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:10,529
Waiting for half an hour.

135
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:11,289
Leaving.

136
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:13,248
A waste of time.

137
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:14,729
No product?

138
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:16,808
Dear all, we sincerely apologize.

139
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:18,289
To ensure that all our customers

140
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:19,808
can get Yin creams,

141
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:22,448
we've set purchase limits.

142
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,049
Each customer in line

143
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:25,808
can buy one cream only.

144
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:27,489
To express our apology,

145
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:29,529
we're offering a coupon for each.

146
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,409
What? We've been queuing for ages.

147
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,729
Why those before us don't have limits?

148
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:35,568
Why can we buy only one?

149
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:36,289
Right?

150
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:37,089
Right.

151
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:37,849
Exactly.

152
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:38,849
What does this mean?

153
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:39,768
What's this all about?

154
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:41,289
Isn't this just bullying the weak?

155
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:43,808
- Yeah.
- Totally!

156
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,289
You are just picking on the weak!

157
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:46,609
Isn't this bullying?

158
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:48,808
What a waste of time!

159
00:05:49,368 --> 00:05:50,688
What bad luck!

160
00:05:51,688 --> 00:05:52,969
Any integrity in this mall?

161
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:53,849
It's outrageous!

162
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:56,208
What's going on?

163
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:57,849
Right.

164
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:01,368
So unfair!

165
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:02,368
Everyone.

166
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:03,489
Don't worry.

167
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:05,688
There'll be no purchase limits.

168
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:08,368
You can have as many as you want.

169
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,969
Please stay in line.

170
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,729
To make up for our mess,

171
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:13,929
we're offering each of you a coupon.

172
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,128
Good.

173
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:16,849
It's better.

174
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,049
Then please queue up.

175
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:20,208
Thankfully, Yushen came to me
to save the day.

176
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:21,609
He said

177
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:23,169
someone's all talk

178
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,008
and no action.

179
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:39,089
Great work, everyone!

180
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:41,768
Today's event was a huge success.

181
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:44,328
We sold 5,000 units,

182
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,248
way over our target.

183
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,289
Big thanks to Miss Yin for showing up

184
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:52,688
and saving the day.

185
00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:54,688
I don't know what we could do
without her.

186
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:58,169
Having so many people attend our event

187
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,768
means that

188
00:06:59,768 --> 00:07:00,688
we nailed the planning.

189
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:03,368
As for those little hiccups,

190
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:05,328
it's understandable that Miss Fang

191
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:06,649
didn't anticipate everything

192
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:07,448
that could happen.

193
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,208
My bad, everyone.

194
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:14,568
I apologize for my mistake.

195
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,368
And huge thanks to you
for getting Miss Yin to help us out.

196
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:22,448
She's definitely more reliable
than I am.

197
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:25,208
Actually, we discussed this before.

198
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,529
The stock isn't enough.

199
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:29,184
Listen to what everyone has to say.

200
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:29,768
Don't...

201
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:31,089
Don't always be all talk

202
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,448
and no action.

203
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:40,328
What's wrong with you?

204
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:41,808
I'm simply stating facts.

205
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:42,489
Nothing.

206
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:43,688
I am just wrapping up.

207
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:45,089
Then why are you angry?

208
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:46,969
I've said,

209
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:48,208
your planning is perfect.

210
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,368
But your stock prep has some issues.

211
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:51,808
If an issue comes up, we discuss.

212
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:53,169
That's why we have meetings.

213
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:55,688
Understood.

214
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,289
I'm going to the restroom.

215
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:07,969
What's that?

216
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:26,489
Fang Lili.

217
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:30,409
Do you know

218
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,929
what your biggest problem is?

219
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:37,049
Spoiled girls like you,

220
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,728
with rich daddies,

221
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:41,049
always think you're better than others.

222
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:43,088
You have no clue

223
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:44,208
how many times

224
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,769
people have covered for you.

225
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,728
Your biggest problem

226
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,328
is arrogance.

227
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:51,409
Arrogance?

228
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,129
Are you talking about me?

229
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:54,529
I know.

230
00:08:54,728 --> 00:08:55,568
I'm arrogant too.

231
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,728
That's because I don't make mistakes.

232
00:08:59,129 --> 00:08:59,728
By the way,

233
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,409
tonight,

234
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:02,769
I'm having dinner with Yushen.

235
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:04,328
Just the two of us.

236
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:41,649
Lu.

237
00:09:41,968 --> 00:09:43,049
Today's Qixi Festival.

238
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,488
Going on a date with your boyfriend?

239
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,249
No.

240
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:48,328
I don't have a boyfriend.

241
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:49,448
Why be so shy?

242
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:50,009
When will you

243
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,088
introduce him to us?

244
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:55,249
See you later.

245
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:16,328

(is arrogance.)

256
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:27,129
Any other suggestions

257
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,169
about my proposal?

258
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:33,208
No.

259
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:33,984
It's perfect.

260
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:35,808
It's just that we need some time

261
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:37,249
to handle your proposal.

262
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,009
We'll feed back to you by next week.

263
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:40,208
Let's make it quick.

264
00:11:40,736 --> 00:11:41,369
Dad.

265
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:42,088
I have a call.

266
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:42,929
Excuse me.

267
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,000

if we're really gonna

271
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,049
go with this plan,

272
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:53,129
we gotta

273
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:54,289
fix a bunch of holes

274
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:55,369
first.

275
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:56,649
Otherwise,

276
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,049
we're gonna have trouble

277

280
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,009
to pitch in a little extra.

281
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:06,529

Not coming.

295
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:50,049
Sis,

296
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:51,049
when can I ever live

297
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:52,409
a different life?

really awesome?

300
00:12:56,169 --> 00:12:57,088
Can you make me

301
00:12:57,088 --> 00:12:58,488
a basketball star in it?

302
00:12:58,608 --> 00:12:59,529
Of course.

303
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,529
After the game goes live,

304
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,328
I'll set you up
with a special character.

305
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,848
Max out your shooting percentage,

00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:05,769
height, and physical stats.

307
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:08,649
Also give you the most handsome one.

308
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:10,088
I'm good, sis.

309
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:12,529
I think I'm pretty handsome already.

310
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:14,808
Don't get ahead of yourself.

311
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:15,568
Let go.

312
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:16,488
Let go of me.

313
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:17,208
Let me see.

314
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:18,169
- Ouch.
- See.

315
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:21,929

I miss my dad and Zhi.

317
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:26,608
Can I exit?

318
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:28,649
Players must complete tasks

319
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:29,889
to exit the game.

320
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:01,889
Aren't you going to the dinner?

321
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:02,929
It fell through.

322
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,369
She had something come up.

323
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:07,769
So, you owe me a favor for this.

324
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,289
Treat me to dinner tonight?

325
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:12,769
Sorry, Miss Yin.

326
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:14,769
It's Qixi Festival.

327
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:16,409
Gotta go home to the wife.

328
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:18,968
Let's celebrate at the feast

329
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:20,208
after the shopping festival.

330
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,088
So, you got stood up?

331
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:28,688
Yeah,

332
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:31,169
which gave me a chance
to give Miss Fang her umbrella.

333
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:34,369
Where'd you get that?

334
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:36,769
Your proposal.

335
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:38,889
You checked the forecast, saw rain,

336
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,249
and had umbrellas for the customers

337
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:42,968
as gifts for Qixi Festival.

338
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,529
I thought no one would notice.

339
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:47,608
How could that be?

340
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:49,208
In your proposal,

341
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:50,488
I like this part best.

342
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:55,369

343
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:56,968
about branding

344
00:14:57,409 --> 00:14:58,608
and discounts is fine,

345
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:00,169
but this umbrella

346
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:01,688
is the real deal.

347
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,728
Some people seem very arrogant,

348
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:07,968
but they've got their soft spots too.

349
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:12,889
Look.

00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:31,328

00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:36,649

Well,

407
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:25,849
you alone?

408
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:28,569
Not strange.

409
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,609
It's Valentine's Day,
time with girlfriends.

410
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:32,369
Who will join you, such a workaholic?

411
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:34,809
Aren't you also alone by yourself?

412
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,008
Where are your followers?

413
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,409
I can see them anytime.

414
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:41,369
I definitely do not want to miss

415
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:43,089
seeing you so down and out.

416
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:43,688
You...

417
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:46,409
Just bear with it.

418
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:48,129
Let's spend the festival together?

419
00:18:48,968 --> 00:18:51,329
I do have a particular craving
for noodles on South Street.

420
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:52,849
Used to go there often.

421
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,448
Not sure if it's still open.

422
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:55,968
Going there

423
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,288
just because of you.

424
00:18:57,889 --> 00:18:59,329
Love the taro balls on North Street.

425
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:01,288
Aren't you cutting out sugar?

426
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:01,929
Noodles.

427
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:02,728
Not for today.

428
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:03,528
Taro balls.

429
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:05,129
Dream on.

430
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:06,089
Noodles.

431
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:07,609
Taro balls.

432
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:09,528
Noodles, let's go.

433
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:13,792
Aotian.

434
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,569
Even if I don't sleep tonight,

435
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:16,528
I'm gonna show Yin Zhili

436
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:17,688
who the real daddy is.

437
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:19,649
Get me a list of

438
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:20,609
all the stores nearby.

439
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:22,208
I'm making a follow-up plan.

440
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:25,809
Aotian.

441
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:26,569
Are you there?

442
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:29,089
(I'm thinking about)

443
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:30,809
(the question from Player An Hang.)

444
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:33,248
What did he ask?

445
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,369
(Some groundless statements.)

446
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:44,169
Are you serving us both simultaneously?

447
00:19:44,968 --> 00:19:46,688
Can I get some information from you?

448
00:19:47,248 --> 00:19:48,728
(Such operations are banned.)

449
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:50,728
Let's discuss it.

450
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:51,768
Think about it again.

451
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:54,248
Seize the chance.

452
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,129
This is my follow-up plan.

453
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,528
Couples who shopped

454
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,248
at Longxing at Qixi Festival

455
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:00,688
and get married within a year

456
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:01,809
get a special gift package

457
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,728
by showing their marriage certificate.

458
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,008
That's great.

459
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,369
My girlfriend and I
bought Yin products this festival.

460
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:09,768
Feng.

461
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:11,329
Release it on the official platform.

462
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:12,320
No problem.

463
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:13,809
Emergency. Emergency.

464
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:15,688
Bosses go viral.

465
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:16,649
Really?

466
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:17,448
Let me see.

467
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:18,208
Look.

468
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:19,488
This quick?

469
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,369
Trending topic for couples.

470
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:22,488
A ton of fans as well.

471
00:20:23,008 --> 00:20:23,649
Exactly.

472
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:25,409
Our supermarket also gets exposed.

473
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:26,688
Check these comments.

474
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:27,929
(It's exhilarating.)

475
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:29,528
(Tycoons are so approachable.)

476
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:31,089
(The umbrella looks great.)

477
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,169
(I want one too.)

478
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:34,609
(Time to go to Longxing Supermarket.)

479
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:38,329
Let's go back to work.

480
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:40,048
Work.

481
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:40,809
Work.

482
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,008
You don't think I would naively believe

483
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,129
these are just coincidences?

484
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,329
No marketing company behind events

485
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:48,448
that can go viral online?
Does it make any sense?

486
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:51,409
Mr. An, you planned all this,
didn't you?

487
00:20:52,488 --> 00:20:53,889
The photo was not planned.

488
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:55,089
But I did add some fuels

489
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,369
to the fire.

490
00:20:57,768 --> 00:20:58,768
I knew it.

491
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:01,569
Miss Fang,

492
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,248
don't always be this gruff with me.

493
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:05,929
After all, we are public figures.

494
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,569
Watch our words and actions.

495
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:10,809
So what?

496
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:19,584
(Honey, no fuss. Hubby hug)

497
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:24,929
Young An.

498
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:26,929
Please sign this purchase contract.

499
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:29,409
How's your hand?

500
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:34,008
You really care about me.

501
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:37,089
I care about work.

502
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,409
Worried you'll hold things up.

503
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:43,008
Young An.

504
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:44,008
I'm here to take you to

505
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:45,448
the Group.

506
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:46,889
Hello, Madam.

507
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:56,889
My finger hurts.

508
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:58,329
Can't hold the pen.

509
00:21:58,488 --> 00:21:59,768
How about you sign for me?

510
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,089
Madam.

511
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:06,649
Just help him sign it.

512
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:07,809
The Group is waiting for him.

513
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:14,849
I haven't reviewed it yet.

514
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:23,089
Turn pages.

515
00:22:39,448 --> 00:22:39,968
Honey.

516
00:22:39,968 --> 00:22:40,736
I'm thirsty.

517
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:43,889
Who is your honey?

518
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,448
We have audience.

519
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:46,488
Don't give it away.

520
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:53,208
Okay.

521
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:04,048
Thank you, honey.

522
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:06,169
Young An.

523
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:08,329
Show off your lovey-dovey stuff
in daylight.

524
00:23:09,048 --> 00:23:10,569
I'll just wait in the car.

525
00:23:11,248 --> 00:23:11,904
Got it.

526
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:18,400
Alright.

527
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:20,736
The contract is fine. Sign it.

528
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:31,169
Young An.

529
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:32,569
Unless necessary,

530
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:34,248
do not increase the workload

531
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:42,968
of your fake wife.

532
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,368
(Meet Your Love)

533
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:49,208
Miss Fang.

534
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:51,569
Yin's creams are selling really fast.

535
00:23:51,968 --> 00:23:53,809
(Special offer)
Our stock is running low.

536
00:23:54,008 --> 00:23:54,688
No worry.

537
00:23:54,688 --> 00:23:56,329
Mr. An has signed the purchase contract.

538
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:57,809
New stock will arrive this afternoon.

539
00:23:58,248 --> 00:23:59,208
That's great.

540
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:00,008
Get to work.

541
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:02,569
Miss Fang.

542
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:09,728
Miss Yin inspects our small store
personally.

543
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,129
I should've prepared.

544
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:13,448
We are not talking about work today.

545
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:15,089
I came for you.

546
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:16,929
Let's talk about something personal

547
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:18,929
somewhere else?

548
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:21,089
Personal?

549
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:24,248
(Ju'an Group)

550
00:24:24,248 --> 00:24:25,089
All directors,

551
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:26,849
we're all here.

552
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:28,169
Let's start our meeting.

553
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:41,809
Why is Young An here?

554
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:43,369
For the meeting.

555
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:47,008
Mr. An.

556
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:49,728
Today we're discussing core business.

557
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,208
Young An

558
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:52,768
is not in charge of any project.

559
00:24:52,768 --> 00:24:54,528
So he was not invited for the meeting.

560
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:56,929
Do you think...

561
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,528
I asked Yushen to come.

562
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:01,369
Take a seat.

563
00:25:09,248 --> 00:25:10,248
He's been doing great

564
00:25:10,528 --> 00:25:12,728
in managing Longxing lately.

565
00:25:13,968 --> 00:25:16,089
I'd love for him to share his insights.

566
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:18,809
I believe it could

567
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:20,089
benefit other divisions

568
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:20,929
really.

569
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:23,929
Mr. An is right.

570
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:26,369
Grassroots sales experience

571
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:28,889
enhances our market insight.

572
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:31,688
We've all been to Longxing.

573
00:25:31,968 --> 00:25:33,208
Truly worth learning.

574
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:34,528
We're all friends here.

575
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:35,809
I'll give it a shot.

576
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:36,768
Alright.

577
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:39,369
Yushen speaks first.

578
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,089
Although Longxing

579
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,409
is just a small part of Ju'an,

580
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:50,849
our success

581
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,528
this time

582
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:53,728
comes down to

583
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:55,809
tapping into a younger demographic.

584
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:57,169
Miss Yin.

585
00:25:57,528 --> 00:25:58,728
Feel free to speak your mind.

586
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:00,649
Lots to do at the supermarket.

587
00:26:02,248 --> 00:26:02,809
Okay.

588
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,129
I like being straightforward.

589
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:06,929
Straight to the point then.

590
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:08,728
I came here

591
00:26:09,008 --> 00:26:10,369
for issues about An Yushen.

592
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,488
Then,

593
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,569
you should go to him.

594
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:15,849
Why come to me?

595
00:26:16,528 --> 00:26:17,409
Because

596
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:19,849
I want you to divorce him.

597
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:23,048
Name your price.

598
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:24,889
Fifty million?

599
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:28,329
(Fifty million for divorce?)

600
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,248
(What a melodrama.)

601
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:33,488
Fifty million?

602
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:34,809
I didn't expect

603
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:36,528
An Yushen was worth so much.

604
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:39,968
You must have heard about it.

605
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:41,809
An Yushen and I

606
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:43,528
are childhood sweethearts.

607
00:26:44,248 --> 00:26:46,169
If I hadn't been sent abroad,

608
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,288
we'd surely be a couple now.

609
00:26:48,688 --> 00:26:50,208
You wouldn't be in the story.

610
00:26:50,968 --> 00:26:51,809
So,

611
00:26:52,248 --> 00:26:54,329
while I'm still being nice,

612
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:56,849
make a smart decision.

613
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:02,169
Miss Yin.

614
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:04,728
I admire your courage

615
00:27:04,728 --> 00:27:05,889
to pursue love.

616
00:27:06,688 --> 00:27:07,849
But I, Fang Lili,

617
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:09,248
do not like being threatened.

618
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:12,609
To put it in the words
of domineering bosses like you,

619
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:15,048
you've touched my

620
00:27:15,688 --> 00:27:16,288
raw nerve.

621
00:27:16,728 --> 00:27:17,409
Fang Lili.

622
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:19,688
Think about it.

623
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:21,649
Are you good enough for Yushen?

624
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:23,889
You angered your father to death.

625
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:26,089
Harassed Luo Yan like a clown.

626
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:28,448
And now married to Yushen.

627
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:31,369
Possibly with hidden agendas.

628
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,329
I married An Yushen

629
00:27:38,768 --> 00:27:39,569
to piss you off.

630
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:44,329
Fang Lili.

631
00:27:45,768 --> 00:27:47,169
I'll ask you one last time.

632
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:50,208
If Yushen chooses me,

633
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:51,329
will you divorce?

634
00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:55,328
You...

635
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:02,208
Hello, Miss.

636
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:03,569
Anything you're not happy with?

637
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:06,496
Nothing.

638
00:28:07,448 --> 00:28:08,528
This cup,

639
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:10,849
I don't like it.

640
00:28:15,768 --> 00:28:17,728
An Xiangyang backed you
in today's meeting?

641
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:19,129
Of course.

642
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,448
So, him supporting Luo Yan before

643
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:24,089
doesn't mean he favored

644
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:24,889
that illegal child.

645
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:27,008
It's just that An Yushen

646
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,008
was so useless before.

647
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:29,409
He had no choice.

648
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:31,369
Makes sense.

649
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:34,889
This world is just a program to us,

650
00:28:35,288 --> 00:28:37,329
but it's real to them.

651
00:28:37,528 --> 00:28:39,448
They have their own emotions.

652
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:44,609
So, do you think

653
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:46,728
we, as players,

654
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:49,728
can develop feelings for the characters?

655
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:55,688
That's a deep question.

656
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:57,728
There's a novel,

657
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:59,008
Androids Can...

658
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,649
Stop hedging.

659
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:01,528
Answer my question.

660
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:06,889
I think it's possible.

661
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:09,809
For example,

662
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:11,809
you know Yin Zhili is an NPC.

663
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:13,728
But you still get angry with her.

664
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,248
Could this possibly be a kind of

665
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:20,649
jealousy?

666
00:29:22,448 --> 00:29:23,008
Mute.

667
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:24,129
No talking.

668
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:25,768
Just a bit more.

669
00:29:26,248 --> 00:29:26,968
I got you?

670
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:30,728
No worry.

671
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:34,288
It's just a straight-up skills showdown
between me and Yin Zhili now.

672
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:35,649
No jealousy at all.

673
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,248
Now?

674
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,889
That means

675
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:42,569
there was before.

676
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:43,288
When was that?

677
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:45,169
Never!

678
00:29:46,048 --> 00:29:46,929
Go to sleep.

679
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:52,569
You started the chat.

680
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:54,288
Now go to sleep.

681
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:03,809
Mr. An. Miss Fang.

682
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:04,609
Go check it out.

683
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:05,329
Something's up.

684
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:11,809
Call your boss here.

685
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:12,688
Please calm down.

686
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:13,929
Our boss will be here shortly.

687
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:14,889
Calm down?

688
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:16,369
How can I calm down with this face?

689
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:16,889
You tell me.

690
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:17,728
How can I calm down?

691
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:19,048
Our boss will be here shortly.

692
00:30:19,048 --> 00:30:19,929
Just one moment.

693
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:20,488
Right.

694
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:21,248
Stay calm.

695
00:30:21,248 --> 00:30:22,448
Young An. Miss Fang.

696
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:24,609
- Are you in charge here?
- Right.

697
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:26,432
We're from Jincheng Quality Bureau.

698
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:29,329
Last week, this lady

699
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,688
bought Yin cream

700
00:30:30,688 --> 00:30:31,609
at your supermarket

701
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:33,728
and had a bad allergic reaction
after using it.

702
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:34,609
She suspects

703
00:30:34,728 --> 00:30:36,169
that you are selling counterfeits.

704
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:37,248
We're here to inspect.

705
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:38,409
You sell counterfeits

706
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:40,129
to make money. It disfigured me.

707
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,768
I'll sue you to bankruptcy.

708
00:30:41,768 --> 00:30:43,248
Madam, please calm down first.

709
00:30:43,248 --> 00:30:44,849
We work directly with Yinxiang Group,

710
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:46,169
the brand owner of Yin.

711
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:47,048
All is authentic.

712
00:30:47,248 --> 00:30:49,329
If there really is a problem,

713
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:50,208
as the distributor,

714
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:51,488
we'll get the manufacturer

715
00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:52,409
to explain.

716
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:53,329
Explain?

717
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:55,169
I've used this cream for 7 or 8 years,

718
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:56,768
with no issues.

719
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,329
Yours must be fakes.

720
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:00,208
You keep saying our products are fakes.

721
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,528
Where's your proof?

722
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:02,080
This is why

723
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,329
we're here to check

724
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,968
if you have any purchase order.

725
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:06,048
Of course.

726
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:07,129
I can show it right now.

727
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:07,849
Miss Fang.

728
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:08,929
We've checked.

729
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:10,089
That purchase order

730
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:11,248
disappeared.

731
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:12,488
Well, well.

732
00:31:12,488 --> 00:31:13,649
We all heard it.

733
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:15,329
They don't have a purchase order at all.

734
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:17,329
Selling fakes and trying to justify it.

735
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:19,528
Check out my face.

736
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:22,768
These shady dealers are to blame.

737
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:24,649
If this were to happen to your faces,

738
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,528
perhaps you would be more anxious.

739
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:27,528
That's gross.

740
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:28,448
Give us some time.

741
00:31:28,448 --> 00:31:30,248
We'll surely give you
a satisfactory answer.

742
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:31,688
Don't just say nice words.

743
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:33,329
Your face isn't ruined.

744
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:34,609
You can't feel the pain.

745
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:35,929
You should taste

746
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:36,849
how it feels.

747
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:37,528
Let go of me.

748
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,649
- Calm down.
- I want her to experience it.

749
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,120
- Leave it to our staff.
- Get away.

750
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:42,816
- I'll rip her face off.
- Stay calm.

751
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:43,889
Let us handle it.

752
00:31:44,248 --> 00:31:44,968
Let go of me.

753
00:31:44,968 --> 00:31:45,632
Miss.

754
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:46,448
Calm down.

755
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:46,976
Let go.

756
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:47,728
Let go of me.
