Aotian,

00:00:58,151 --> 00:00:59,992
good deeds can earn points, right?

7
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:01,391
Right.

8
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:02,391
Okay.

00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:09,512
(Jincheng Weilan Nursing Home)
Thanks for help.

10
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:11,512
Our work here is not easy.

11
00:01:11,952 --> 00:01:13,232
You should be mentally prepared.

12
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:15,991
Currently there are cooking,
doing laundry,

13
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,312
and caring for the elderly.

14
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:18,391
Which one

15
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:19,152
will you do?

16
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:23,032
I'll do them all.

17
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:25,911
Ladies and gentlemen,

18
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:26,792
time for a sun bath.

19
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:29,072
Miss, don't rush.

20
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:30,111
Wait a moment.

21
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:31,751
Bar-top flower!

22
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:33,351
Pay up.

23
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:35,672
I can't wait.

24
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:36,592
Hand over the money.

25
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:37,232
Money.

26
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:44,751

Hello, where are you?

31
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:43,992
I need to see you urgently.

32
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,392
Okay.

33
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:48,791
I've something to tell you, too.

34
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:50,671
I'll send you an address.

35
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:52,671
Okay, see you in a bit.

36
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:01,671
An Hang,

37
00:03:04,872 --> 00:03:06,312
I have retrieved your memory.

38
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:08,231
What?

39
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:09,152
Look.

40
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:11,231
Here is what has happened

41
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,671
since you entered the game.

42
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:13,872
Come on,

43
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:14,671
Miss Fang,

44
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,471
don't make such jokes.

45
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,832
I'm not joking.

46
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:18,671
Take a look first.

47
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:19,751
Miss Fang.

48
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:21,832
I have something else to tell you.

49
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:22,631
We'll talk later.

50
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:23,911
Then you'll recall it all.

51
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:25,392
No matter what, I'm not An Hang.

52
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,152
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,351
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:37,992
I really didn't mean to.

55
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:41,152
Miss Fang,

56
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,231
just let me off.

57
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:44,872
I'm really not An Hang.

58
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:47,671
I don't remember us getting married.

59
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:48,511
I came today...

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,736
(Divorce Agreement)

61
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:54,712
I came today

62
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:56,872
to bring you the divorce agreement.

63
00:03:57,432 --> 00:03:58,312
Rest assured.

64
00:03:58,631 --> 00:03:59,552
I don't want anything.

65
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:00,832
You can have everything.

66
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:02,992
If it's not enough,

67
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:04,951
I'll ask Grandma for more.

68
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,432
Miss Fang,

69
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:12,351
please leave me alone.

70
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:13,071
All right?

71
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:19,072
An Hang,

72
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:21,632
I won't bother you anymore.

73
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:23,431
You stay here by yourself.

74
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:27,712
You...

75
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:30,111
What's wrong with you?

76
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:40,952
Then...

77
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:42,111
Then,

78
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,952
I'll take my leave.

79
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:59,152
You can only

80
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:00,791
save one person?

81
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:03,712
This is temporary.

82
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:07,072
The consciousness extraction technology
is not yet fully-developed.

83
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:08,471
If it fails,

84
00:05:08,712 --> 00:05:11,272
it may cause
irreversible damage to the brain.

85
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:15,272
Upload my consciousness.

86
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:16,752
Are you sure?

87
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:18,512
Yes, I'm sure.

88
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:21,632
I can't let her take the risk.

89
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:27,632
I can't let her take the risk.

90
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:31,911
Who is she?

91
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:34,431
The technology's not fully-developed.

92
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:35,832
Even for only one person,

93
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:36,911
it may still cause

94
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:38,431
irreversible damage to the brain.

95
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,392
We found that

96
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:47,111
the last transmission experiment

97
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:49,431
has caused consciousness damage
to player An Hang.

98
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:50,551
That's probably

99
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,592
the reason for his unconsciousness.

and every single thing

00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:09,071
is just a string of code,

165
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:10,752
running on a predefined program.

170
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:17,472
Go away.

171
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,671
They are NPCs here.

172
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:22,951
Whenever I need,

173
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:24,311
they will repeat once.

174
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:25,671
You...

175
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:27,951
Who are you?

176
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,512
I am the person having you exit.

177
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:32,872
Because you are the only real one here.

178
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:34,831
Wait.

179
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:36,632
There's also Fang Lili.

180
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,711
This is your last memory.

181
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:44,191
But before that,

182
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:45,311
I must remind you

183
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:46,791
if you don't open it,

184
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,632
all you need to remember

185
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:49,992
is that Fang Lili is your opponent.

186
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:51,071
Defeat her,

187
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:54,232
and then you can leave.

188
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:58,191
But if retrieve your memory,

189
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,872
you might regret it.

190
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:03,311
Trust me.

191
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,551
You will face even harder choices
than now.

192
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:45,911
I hope An Hang and I

193
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,591
will leave together.

194
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,911
Mr. Zhang, you must be tired.

195
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:08,632
After today,

196
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:10,311
I'll take you to the resort

197
00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:11,392
to freshen up.

198
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:12,671
Mr. An, you're so nice.

199
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:13,831
Well, a businessman

200
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:15,191
do travel around.

201
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:21,512
(Where are you?)

202
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:22,911
(Why haven't you come yet?)

203
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:23,951
(Have you memorized it?)

204
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:32,992
Mr. An,

205
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:35,512
you really spoiled your son.

206
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:37,951
I've never waited this long before.

207
00:11:40,071 --> 00:11:41,032
Uh...

208
00:11:50,232 --> 00:11:50,911
Mr. Zhang,

209
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:52,191
I'm truly sorry.

210
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:54,392
An Yushen prepared late into the night.

211
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:55,791
He is already on his way.

212
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:00,071
You are...

213
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:00,992
Fang Lili.

214
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:02,872
I've heard of you,

215
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:05,071
the one who bankrupted

216
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:06,311
the Fang family, right?

217
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:08,152
I'm talking with Mr. An here.

218
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:09,791
You probably shouldn't butt in.

219
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:12,752
Mr. An,

220
00:12:13,591 --> 00:12:14,112
well,

221
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:15,591
my time is limited.

222
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:16,551
I'm leaving.

223
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:30,671
My wife explained for me.

224
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:31,951
What was inappropriate here?

225
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,032
She lowered herself
to talk to a scammer.

226
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:47,632
I actually find that inappropriate.

227
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,472
What are you talking about?

228
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:50,992
Zhang Changgui,

229
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:52,671
stop it.

230
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:55,152
The Hope Group has been defunct
for five years.

231
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:56,551
It exists in name only now.

232
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:59,272
The so-called perovskite solar cells

233
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:01,352
are only at
the initial development stage,

234
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:04,071
(Hope Group LLC)
and lacks production qualifications.

235
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:11,232
Mr. An,

236
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:17,512
I think Mr. Luo

237
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:18,992
must have been kept in the dark.

238
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:20,032
After all,

239
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,472
he doesn't have the guts

240
00:13:21,472 --> 00:13:22,512
to use fake projects

241
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:24,071
to embezzle company funds.

242
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:25,752
It's just that

243
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:27,071
he was too eager to climb up

244
00:13:27,352 --> 00:13:28,951
and fell into a scammer's trap.

245
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:30,032
Cut the crap.

246
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:30,831
That's defamation.

247
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:31,591
I can sue you!

248
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:32,352
Okay.

249
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:34,431
About your company's credentials,

250
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:35,671
overseas debt situation,

251
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,791
and product performance,
I have backups for all.

252
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:39,512
Whether it's defamation or not,

253
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,152
let's leave it to the law.

254
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:42,392
Maybe

255
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:43,752
I can even get you a lawyer.

256
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:55,992
Hidden mission of exposing

257
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:57,311
Zhang Changgui is completed.

258
00:13:57,831 --> 00:13:58,992
Player Fang Lili

259
00:13:58,992 --> 00:13:59,831
gained points

260
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:00,752
of five hundred.

261
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,152
Why don't I get a reward for this?

262
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:07,752
Miss Fang,

263
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:08,752
I just recovered.

264
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:09,752
Don't hit me in the head.

265
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:12,191
An Hang,

266
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:13,431
when did you wake up?

267
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:14,512
How did you wake up?

268
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:18,311
The night when you were crying.

269
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:20,831
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

270
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:22,392
Miss Fang,

271
00:14:22,911 --> 00:14:24,911
after all, I have other works to do.

272
00:14:25,352 --> 00:14:27,232
I'd also like to know

273
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:29,232
why you helped me like this.

274
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,272
Is it out of guilt,

275
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:32,551
or because you were touched?

276
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:33,911
Or, is it due to some

277
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:34,911
other reasons?

278
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:48,096
(Luo Yan)

279
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:00,071
Hello.

280
00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:01,152
Fang Lili,

281
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:02,791
about Mr. Zhang,

282
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,512
was it you who helped An Yushen?

283
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:06,032
No.

284
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,191
I appreciate your abilities.

285
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:13,352
But it doesn't mean
I will always indulge you.

286
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,872
You must choose
between An Yushen and me.

287
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,071
You should know the one

288
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:20,431
who doesn't take sides

289
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:22,951
will end up in the worst situation.

290
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:25,992
I want your answer before tomorrow.

291
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,472
Fang Li,

292
00:15:45,232 --> 00:15:45,911
are you hungry?

293
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:47,632
Let's go have a meal first.

294
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:53,632
Come in.

295
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,352
Mr. Luo,

296
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:03,032
these require your signature.

297
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:14,311
I've heard about that incident.

298
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,872
How could this happen?

299
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:17,752
I'm sure he's lost his memory.

300
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:20,191
Just don't ask about that matter.

301
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:24,872
I'm truly certain he's lost his memory.

302
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:28,551
There's a mistake here.

303
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,911
Why didn't you check?

304
00:16:31,872 --> 00:16:32,831
Sorry about that.

305
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:34,311
I was too rushed.

306
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:38,152
Mr. Luo,

307
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:40,551
I just saw Fang Lili getting in the car
with An Yushen.

308
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:44,872
Get out.

309
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,272
Do you care that much about Fang Lili?

310
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:57,112
I don't care about her.

311
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:58,512
She's just more useful.

312
00:17:05,672 --> 00:17:06,992
I'll revise the document.

313
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,591
It'll be done by tomorrow if lucky.

314
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,272
Where to? I'll drive.

315
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,591
This is at the company's entrance.

316
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,032
Hurry and get in, then no one will see.

317
00:18:12,311 --> 00:18:13,432
Please enjoy your coffee.

318
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:20,591
Back when we were at school,

319
00:18:20,712 --> 00:18:21,992
you always rode a bike.

320
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:23,472
Right.

321
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,551
When you hurried along the road,

322
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:28,712
and I offered to take you to school,

323
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,071
you always refused.

324
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:34,432
What do you know?

325
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:36,712
Back then,

326
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:38,871
all the girls in school liked you.

327
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:41,192
Every time I went to school with you,

328
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,151
they would say

329
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:45,672
I was your maid in the An family,

330
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:47,192
and had a crush on you.

331
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:49,952
Then why did you never mention it?

332
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:53,712
Because it was true.

333
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:56,351
I do like you.

334
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:15,831
I really want to go back
to high school times.

335
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:17,551
We leave school together.

336
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:20,912
Back then, it felt so ordinary.

337
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:24,032
Too bad we can't go back now.

338
00:19:26,952 --> 00:19:27,752
That's right.

339
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:29,912
We can't go back.

340
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:32,672
New Zealand has few people.

341
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:34,591
It's not easy to gather a group.

342
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:39,272
Luo Yan,

343
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:41,672
do you not

344
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:43,712
want me to go to New Zealand?

345
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:48,432
This is your life.

346
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:50,551
What hopes could I have?

347
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:58,952
I forgot to tell you.

348
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:01,232
I came here to wait for my brother.

349
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:03,952
Okay.

350
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:04,752
I'll leave.

351
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,232
Mr. Luo,

352
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,992
you brought Lu here?

353
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:11,631
Right, we were on the way.

354
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:25,871
Lili,

355
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:27,151
here, try this.

356
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:27,952
Thank you, Grandma.

357
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:34,712
Lili,

358
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,272
Yushen has been too tired recently.

359
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:38,831
He has worn out his health.

360
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:41,111
Thanks to your care for him.

361
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:43,071
I see it all.

362
00:20:55,232 --> 00:20:55,992
Lili,

363
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,151
I will just say it straight.

364
00:20:58,472 --> 00:21:00,992
No matter what squabbles you two had,

365
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:02,992
I've been through it all.

366
00:21:03,391 --> 00:21:04,712
I can tell

367
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,351
Lili really cares about you.

368
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:09,391
So today,

369
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:11,151
you must give Lili a promise

370
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:12,912
that you'll listen to her,

371
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:14,351
and live a good life.

372
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:20,831
Say something.

373
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:22,591
Tell Lili to stay.

374
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:34,472
Grandma,

375
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:37,192
when I was homeless,

376
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:38,752
An Yushen took me in.

377
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:39,952
I took care of him

378
00:21:39,952 --> 00:21:41,672
to repay his kindness.

379
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:42,952
There's no other meaning.

380
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:44,752
If you see it that way,

381
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:46,111
I won't even dare to come here

382
00:21:46,111 --> 00:21:47,151
again in the future.

383
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:49,631
I'm leaving after the meal.

384
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,032
Sorry, Grandma.

385
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:23,791
Aotian,

386
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,752
for An Hang and I,

387
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,912
is it true only one of us can leave?

388
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:35,512
I can't think of a way

389
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:41,391
(A way to leave together)
to go out together.

390
00:22:43,752 --> 00:22:45,391
Can you tell me?

391
00:22:53,512 --> 00:22:55,391
Attempted for the fifty-first time.

392
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:57,591
Unable to connect with the outside.

393
00:22:58,992 --> 00:22:59,752
Try again.

394
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:10,232
Grandma.

395
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:11,232
Still up?

396
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,232
Yushen,

397
00:23:15,871 --> 00:23:17,992
how can I go to sleep?

398
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:20,591
Yushen,

399
00:23:22,071 --> 00:23:23,672
tell me the truth.

400
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:26,791
Why didn't you ask Lili to stay?

401
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:29,391
Don't you love her anymore?

402
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:36,032
Since you still love her,

403
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:37,551
why didn't you say something?

404
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:40,551
Are you afraid she doesn't love you?

405
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,272
I am afraid that she does love me.

406
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:46,512
Are you writing poetry here?

407
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,351
What are you being so sentimental about?

408
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:51,871
Grandma,

409
00:23:52,232 --> 00:23:54,351
if I use this to coerce her now,

410
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,111
then she...

411
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,071
I can't explain clearly.

412
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,192
Then you don't need to explain.

413
00:24:02,351 --> 00:24:03,151
Yushen,

414
00:24:04,631 --> 00:24:06,752
you have made rapid progress recently,

415
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:08,272
but I know

416
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:11,192
you've never been clever
since you were little.

417
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:13,591
Lili is so capable.

418
00:24:14,512 --> 00:24:15,672
I hope

419
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:17,391
that someone can take care of you.

420
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:19,631
Grandma,

421
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:22,672
but I hope to take care of her.

422
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:25,232
I don't know how to do it.

423
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:41,551
Warning.

424
00:25:41,912 --> 00:25:43,432
The player has not completed the task,

425
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,311
unable to exit the system boundary.

426
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:57,071
Warning,

427
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,912
player has not completed the task,

428
00:25:59,272 --> 00:26:00,831
unable to exit the system boundary.

429
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:26,551
Warning.

430
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:27,952
Forcing boundary breach

431
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:29,232
will cause the player

432
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:30,111
injuries.

433
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:35,872
(Luo Yan)

434
00:26:39,912 --> 00:26:40,631
Fang Lili,

435
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,432
get an answer yet?

436
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:43,912
Are you helping me or An Yushen?

437
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:45,591
I don't know.

438
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:46,472
Fang Lili,

439
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:47,391
what's wrong with you?

440
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,672
What do you really want?

441
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:51,591
I don't know.

442
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,591
But listen, Luo Yan,

443
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,272
I just can't make

444
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:56,631
An Yushen back out.

445
00:26:58,071 --> 00:26:59,472
Is this your choice?

446
00:26:59,871 --> 00:27:00,512
Yes.

447
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:19,512
Fang Li,

448
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,032
do you know what you are doing?

449
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:26,871
Why are you here?

450
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:28,952
If I get out,

451
00:27:29,472 --> 00:27:30,351
what will you do?

452
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,151
I will smash it open and get out.

453
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,111
It won't work.

454
00:27:35,192 --> 00:27:36,111
I've tried.

455
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:41,151
Fang Li,

456
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:43,871
you don't want to face it,

457
00:27:44,432 --> 00:27:45,272
neither do I.

458
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:47,831
But shall we just pretend
this didn't happen?

459
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:50,192
Then what do you want me to do?

460
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:52,631
I still can't believe

461
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,591
something so ridiculous actually
happened to me.

462
00:27:54,952 --> 00:27:56,631
I'm trapped in an invisible,

463
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:57,871
intangible wall.

464
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:00,111
The only way out is to trap you here.

465
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:02,672
I don't know what to do.

466
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:03,151
I...

467
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:05,871
I just feel so useless.

468
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:15,391
If you are useless,

469
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,311
then I'm even more useless.

470
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:19,712
I think every day

471
00:28:19,912 --> 00:28:21,752
why I can't be a bit smarter

472
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:24,111
and come up with a way
to leave with you.

473
00:28:25,512 --> 00:28:26,871
No matter how absurd,

474
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:28,472
for me,

475
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:29,791
this is reality.

476
00:28:30,952 --> 00:28:32,272
You're in this reality.

477
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:35,712
Fang Li,

478
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:38,551
I won't run away again.

479
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:40,032
Let's go out together.

480
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:42,631
I'm sure I can think of a way.

481
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:44,591
I definitely can.

482
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:45,432
Trust me.

483
00:28:49,752 --> 00:28:50,512
Idiot.

484
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:54,551
You're smarter than me.

485
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:56,672
Simply do what you should,
and you can get out.

486
00:28:57,952 --> 00:28:59,111
If you didn't try saving me,

487
00:28:59,391 --> 00:29:00,391
you'd have been out.

488
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:02,631
You're foolish,

489
00:29:02,912 --> 00:29:03,752
and so am I.

490
00:29:04,631 --> 00:29:05,791
What are you trying to say?

491
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:09,432
I want to tell you

492
00:29:10,871 --> 00:29:11,912
to trust me.

493
00:29:12,071 --> 00:29:12,591
I...

494
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:16,032
You what?

495
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:21,272
I like you.

496
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:35,272
Forget it.

497
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:37,952
