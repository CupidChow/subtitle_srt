(Lin Lu)

6
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,800
Lu, get in the car.

7
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,360
Okay.

8
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,400
It's getting late.

9
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:28,352
(Total Amount in RMB: 81,560,000)

10
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:32,280
Luo Lei.

11
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:36,560
Yes, Mr. Luo?

12
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,881
Have you sent

13
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:39,161
the stamped contract to Mr. Lu?

14
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:39,881
Yes, I have.

15
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:41,321
I sent it via intra-city express.

16
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,601
It should be there soon.

17
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:43,680
Ask to meet him.

18
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:45,120
Now.

19
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,081
You think you can
change your mind about the price

20
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:04,481
written in black and white?

21
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:06,601
I don't care what you said.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,481
I'm sticking to the contract.

23
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:09,280
You hear me?

24
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,680
Now,

25
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,000
get Mr. An here.

26
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:14,441
Who is in there?

27
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:15,161
What happened?

28
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,240
I think the contract
Mr. Luo sent to the supplier

29
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:18,400
had the price wrong.

30
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,120
So we're losing a lot of money?

31
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:22,321
At least forty million, I heard.

32
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,441
Isn't Mr. Luo

33
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,881
doomed this time?

34
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,280
Mr. Luo seems quite careful.

35
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,720
How could he make such a mistake?

36
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,560
There are only two reasons

37
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,761
why a man becomes reckless.

38
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:33,800
Enlighten me.

39
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,280
Either he's fallen in love,

40
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,560
or he's been ditched.

41
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:38,881
Is it possible that

42
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:40,960
he's tormented by unrequited love?

43
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:43,800
I bet you are aware

44
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,641
that there is a mistake with the price.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,041
We agreed on a unit price
of less than 10,000.

46
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,481
You see.

47
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,041
Since you haven't signed it,

48
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,960
why don't you show some understanding

49
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,400
and invalidate this contract?

50
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,201
I don't care about

51
00:03:58,201 --> 00:03:58,960
our agreement.

52
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:01,321
I'm going by the contract.

53
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,161
Mr. Lu,

54
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,321
the fault does lie with us

55
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,881
regarding this contract.

56
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,321
I sincerely apologize.

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,161
I invited you over today

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,040
to discuss a long-term collaboration.

59
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,600
Actually, we have always felt

60
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,681
that your company

61
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,520
has the potential to become a leader.

62
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:24,600
It just lacks a long-term plan.

63
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,681
How about

64
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,600
we turn this cooperation

65
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,681
into a long-term one?

66
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,360
We will pay 50 million

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,081
as contracted.

68
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:33,520
But we are buying

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,201
your supplies for the next five years.

70
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,040
Mr. Lu, Ju'an would

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,520
like you to become
our strategic partner.

72
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,400
Mr. Luo.

73
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,160
You're beating around the bush

74
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
just to get me to void the contract.

75
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
It looks like you still don't get it.

76
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,520
The contract has been delivered
to my company.

77
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
As soon as I stamp it,

78
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,681
you must make the payment.

79
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,681
Mr. Luo.

80
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,121
Mr. Lu.

81
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,360
I was wrong about the contract.

82
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:24,681
I haven't sent it out yet.

83
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,040
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:36,321
What...

85
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,160
No way.

86
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:38,441
That's impossible.

87
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,201
It was you.

88
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,241
You retrieved the contract, didn't you?

89
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,360
Mr. Lu.

90
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:46,720
There's nothing else to say.

91
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:49,241
I'm going by the contract.

92
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,081
What are you doing?

93
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,840
Many people saw us.

94
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,040
Why did you come back?

95
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:07,480
I saw them gossiping in the group chat.

96
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,480
So I went to Hengxing Building

97
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,400
to intercept the contract.

98
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,761
Tell me why you came back.

99
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:15,520
You've already resigned.

100
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,761
You are going to New Zealand.

101
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:26,641
You're leaving, right?

102
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:28,321
No.

103
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:30,960
I'm not leaving.

104
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,480
Why not?

105
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,360
Because I'm certain

106
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:37,920
that I am useful to you.

107
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:41,960
Because I'm certain

108
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,600
that as long as I'm around,

109
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,001

Lu.

134
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Are you seeing someone?

135
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:05,121
No...

136
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:05,881
Not really.

137

I'll get some drinks.

139
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,761
I peeled these for you.
Won't you have any?

No need, thanks.

Don't be so polite.

143
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,681
Oh right.

144
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,081
I heard about what happened today.

145
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,000
You retrieved the contract, didn't you?

146
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:35,840
Miss Fang, don't get me wrong.

147
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,880
I just wanted to help the company.

148
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,521
Let me boil some milk.

149
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,000
(Kiss me.)

(Come on, kiss me.)

152
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:00,921
Stop pretending to be asleep.

153
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,240
It's your turn to sleep on the sofa.

154
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,321
I was just messing with you.

155
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,840
Take the bed.

156
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:09,880
Wait a second.

157
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:12,600
I have something to say.

158
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,521
There is something wrong with Lin Lu.

159
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:19,120
It's about Lin Lu?

160
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,360
Alright.

161
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:24,480
I don't think

162
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,480
she wants anything to do with Luo Yan.

163
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,120
Don't you agree?

164
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:33,521
Really?

165
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:34,120
I...

166
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:35,480
I didn't notice.

167
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,321
But,

168
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:44,360
it's understandable.

169
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:47,120
Madam An doesn't like Luo Yan.

170
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:49,321
So Lu has to hide it from her.

171
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,401
Right?

172
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,561
Yushen.

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,720
Your second uncle has called.

174
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:12,161
Come on.

175
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:13,760
Have a word with him.

176
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,681
Alright, Grandma.

177
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:28,561
Where...

178
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:29,600
Where is my phone?

179
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,921
Xiangyin.

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,321
Get well soon.

181
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay, Wu Cong.

182
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,480
What did you call me?

183
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,240
What did you just call me?

184
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:04,480
Say it again.

185
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:07,640
Wu

186
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,441
Cong.

187
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,480
Wait here.

188
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,521
I'm going to tell Madam An.

189
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,120
Mom.

190
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:28,921
Yushen.

191
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:35,000
Auntie,

192
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,000
she is Lili.

193
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,960
Do you remember her?

194
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,321
Lili.

195
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:50,120
Lu.

196
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,521
Lu.

197
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:57,000
You've grown up.

198
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,880
Lu.

199
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,360
You are so pretty.

200
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,521
Lu.

201
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,360
Have you been good?

202
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,640
Were you ever bullied

203
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,321
by anyone at school?

204
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,720
What's wrong?

205
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,801
Lu.

206
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,041
There are signs of improvement.

207
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,521
If you take good care of her,

208
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:20,201
I believe it can lead to

209
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:21,240
her full recovery.

210
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:25,921
It's a sign from above.

211
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:27,240
It's a divine intervention.

212
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,521
Tomorrow.

213
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:30,880
Tomorrow.

214
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:33,201
Come with me
to the temple to give thanks.

215
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:36,120
Mom.

216
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,120
Can you not go?

217
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,441
Stay home to play with me.

218
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:42,521
Okay.

219
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,960
What do you want to play?

220
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,760
I want to play

221
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:49,480
"thorough cleaning".

222
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Let her do things within her power

223
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,441
to adapt to family life.

224
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,161
It helps with her recovery.

225
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,401
We should encourage her more often.

226
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't restrain her too much.

227
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:05,201
Okay.

228
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,801
Thorough cleaning.

229
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:09,161
Thorough cleaning.

230
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:10,720
Thorough cleaning.

231
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,480
Thorough cleaning.

232
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,000
Keep Auntie company today.

233
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,921
Thorough cleaning.

234
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,081
Auntie.

235
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,640
That's about it, right?

236
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,480
You've done it twice.

237
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,720
No.

238
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,480
I haven't had enough fun.

239
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,880
Even if

240
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,240
I'm done with the living room.

241
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,840
I haven't cleaned the bedrooms.

242
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,041
Okay.

243
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,960
Let's clean your bedroom.

244
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:38,120
My bedroom doesn't need cleaning.

245
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,921
My room is very clean.

246
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,600
Whose room do you want to clean then?

247
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,360
I want to clean

248
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,201
all of yours.

249
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,161
Lu.

250
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:51,120
Let's start

251
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,480
with your room today.

252
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:56,480
I'll tidy up the cabinet.

253
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,600
The bookshelf doesn't need cleaning.

254
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,281
It does!

255
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:02,120
It needs cleaning more than anything.

256
00:15:05,408 --> 00:15:05,960
Auntie.

257
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,000
What are

258
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,880
all these?

259
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:13,760
What are these?

260
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:19,720
Rebirth: The Dominant Boss's
Charming Wife.

261
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:24,161
Long Aotian's sturdy arms held me tight.

262
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:25,561
I couldn't break free.

263
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,000
I enjoy this suffocating pleasure.

264
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,960
Ye Wudao sneered.

265
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,401
This woman

266
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,960
is surprisingly sweet.

267
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:37,840
Lin Lu.

268
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:39,960
So you're

269
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,281
into this type of thing.

270
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:44,561
Please.

271
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,480
Stop it.

272
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:50,480

00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:58,441
It's nothing.

277
00:15:58,681 --> 00:15:59,521
I was just amazed.

278
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:07,561
That's about it, right?

279
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,201
No rush, Grandma.

280
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:11,561
We haven't cleaned the floor
under the bed.

281
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,801
And under the table.

282
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,521
Wait...

283
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:22,240
Mom.

284
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,640
Don't snatch my box.

285
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,360
Don't snatch my box.

286
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,960
Those are all things from my youth.

287
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,201
There's nothing to see.

288
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:35,161
Shuhuan,

289
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:37,720
since our last farewell at West Lake,

290
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,480
I've been sleepless.

291
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,760
I miss you dearly.

292
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:43,720
I wonder if you intend to be with me.

293
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:45,401
Grandma.

294
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:48,240
When you were young...

Well...

301
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,921
This is Mr. An's study.

302
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:04,640
Isn't it inappropriate?

303
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,920
Here.

304
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:32,761
How to become a breakdance master?

305
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,241
Come on.

306
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:04,561
Let's drink.

307
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,721
Let's keep cleaning in the afternoon.

308
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:08,600
Cheers.

309
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,120
Come on.

310
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,400
Auntie, you can't drink.

311
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,561
I can drink.

312
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:12,400
You can't.

313
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,880
I want to drink.

314
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,521
Auntie, you can't drink.

315
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,840
I can.

316
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,400
Cheers.

317
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,321
No, you can't.

318
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,824
Yushen.

319
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:00,281
You have indeed made great progress.

320
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:03,160
Departments One and Two

321
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,200
are neck and neck

322
00:19:05,481 --> 00:19:06,640
in the investment return.

323
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:09,640
I remember a tech company

324
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Yushen invested in

325
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,561
has soared in sales.

326
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:16,041
It's Yungan Technology, I think.

327
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,360
Once Yushen collects the profits,

328
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:22,321
he will surpass you.

329
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,360
Dad.

330
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,880
I won't let you down.

331
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,456
Alright.

332
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,120
That was all I had to say.

333
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:36,360
You may leave.

334
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,721
Dad.

335
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:39,640
There's something I want to tell you.

336
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:44,600
Okay.

337
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:46,801
Luo Yan.

338
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:48,680
You may leave.

339
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,761
Why do we have to

340
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,360
talk in private?

341
00:20:02,976 --> 00:20:03,640
Dad.

342
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,561
It's a family matter.

343
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,521
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear it.

344
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,400
Auntie was able

345
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,721
to recognize us today.

346
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:14,880
She doesn't remember us clearly,

347
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,281
but she can roughly make out who we are.

348
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,521
Grandma wants you

349
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:20,120
to go home and keep Auntie company.

350
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:22,321
You haven't been home for a long time.

351
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:28,160
I've been busy.

352
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,200
I'll go home when I'm free.

353
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:34,481
You may leave.

354
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,801
I have a client coming.

355
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,721
Okay.

356
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,160
(Young An.)

357
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,801
(Boss)
(Something important happened.)

358
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:13,721
(I need a day off.)

359
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:14,561
(Sorry about that.)

360
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:28,320
Why

361
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,961
didn't you answer my call?

362
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,001
This is weird.

363
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,081
Who are you to me?

364
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:34,281
Do I have to answer your calls?

365
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,200
I'm worried about you.

366
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:37,721
How have you been?

367
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:38,680
Are you feeling unwell?

368
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,961
Are you done?

369
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,440
I'm going on a date.

370
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:42,360
A date?

371
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,680
You can't go on a date.

372
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,481
You have to rest plenty.

373
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,761
Yin Zhiluo.

374
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:04,081
Here is your dessert.

375
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:04,721
Please enjoy.

376
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:06,761
I bet you've learned

377
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:08,680
everything you need to know about me.

378
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,481
May I get you something?

379
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:10,400
I know very well

380
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,160
the hardship of a single mother.

381
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:13,321
Rest assured.

382
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:14,640
I promise I will

383
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
take good care of you

384
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,120
and the baby.

385
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,481
Excuse me.

386
00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:25,360
I have to get this.

387
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,400
Hello.

388
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:30,640
What's wrong?

389
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,160
Nothing. I'm working.

390
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:41,120
Yeah.

391
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:42,521
It's okay.

392
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:44,041
Alright.

393
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,081
I'll be back soon.

394
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:46,048
Be good.

395
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,761
Baby.

396
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:47,600
Love you.

397
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,041
May I help you?

398
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,640
You have a girlfriend?

399
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,721
Yeah, I do.

400
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,160
And you promise to take care of
someone else's kid?

401
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,561
Does your girlfriend

402
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:04,281
know about this?

403
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:05,001
She...

404
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:06,521
She knows.

405
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:07,440
Besides,

406
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,321
if I don't do it,

407
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,920
how can I make money to marry her?

408
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:10,721
You...

409
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:11,521
Wait.

410
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:12,680
Let me sort this out.

411
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:15,120
You

412
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,241
do this on a regular basis.

413
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,961
And

414
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:18,041
she knows about it.

415
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:19,081
And she accepts it?

416
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,761
This is how I make money.

417
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,041
Why wouldn't she accept it?

418
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:23,920
I...

419
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,248
(Young An)

420
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,920
Hello, Young An.

421
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,840
I'm dealing with an emergency.

422
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,160
I'll call you back later.

423
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:43,961
Ms. Yin.

424
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:45,481
If everything's fine with you,

425
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:46,521
let's go to your place

426
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:47,920
to get prepared.

427
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:48,961
I forbid that!

428
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,321
How can you bring such a man home?

429
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,400
What's your problem?

430
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,721
What does it have

431
00:23:55,721 --> 00:23:56,600
to do with you?

432
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,081
H-He has a girlfriend.

433
00:23:59,081 --> 00:23:59,840
I don't care.

434
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,400
He's done this kind of thing

435
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,321
more than once.

436
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,001
So he's experienced.

437
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:05,880
Come on.

438
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,961
Yin Zhiluo.

439
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,041
Don't you have a bottom line?

440
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,001
No, I don't.

441
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:10,200
We're talking about our kid.

442
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
I'm obligated

443
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,801
t-to protect him.

444
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:16,360
Is there a misunderstanding?

445
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,440
Ms. Yin.

446
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:18,801
Please handle it first.

447
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:19,680
But

448
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,200
as a childcare specialist,

449
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:22,801
it's my job to remind you

450
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,041
that nothing matters

451
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,481
more than the parents' companionship

452
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:27,321
throughout the baby's growth.

453
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:35,920
Child...

454
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,440
Childcare?

455
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:45,160
Well...

456
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,801
Can we talk?

457
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,281
What is there to say?

458
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,360
Yin Zhiluo.

459
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,200
Actually,

460
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,360
I came to propose to you today.

461
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:01,721
I'm not good with words

462
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:03,160
and don't know what to say.

463
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,521
I just bought this diamond ring.

464
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:07,880
A 30-point diamond.

465
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,521
I know it's small.

466
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:12,281
But

467
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:14,761
it's the biggest one I can afford.

468
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:17,640
If you are willing to marry me,

469
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,920
I swear I will be

470
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,920
the most competent husband

471
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:23,241
and

472
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,721
the best father

473
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:27,081
to give our kid a loving home.

474
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:35,400
Would you

475
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,001
marry me?

476
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:41,120
So you're proposing to me

477
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,001
to be a responsible man?

478
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,321
What's wrong

479
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,721
with trying to be

480
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,281
a responsible man?

481
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
Nothing.

482
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:53,721
Isn't there anything else?

483
00:25:57,281 --> 00:25:58,440
Feng Zhixing, listen to me.

484
00:25:58,561 --> 00:26:00,640
I don't need anyone
to take responsibility.

485
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,840
Nor do I need you

486
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,961
to pity me and marry me.

487
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:03,840
Do you understand?

488
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,561
Do you know what I want?

489
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,241
What do you want?

490
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:11,761
A car?

491
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,600
A house?

492
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,640
Should I get plastic surgery?

493
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:16,961
I want you out of my sight!

494
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:18,961
Yin Zhiluo.

495
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:23,481
Do you want our kid to grow up

496
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:25,200
without a father?

497
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:30,561
We can raise the child together,

498
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,600
but we won't be married.

499
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,504
But...

500
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:34,360
Say no more.

501
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:36,081
If you disagree,

502
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:37,440
don't show up again.

503
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:53,760
(Financial Statement)

504
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,680
(Audit Report)

505
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,680
So?

506
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,160
Have you decided?

507
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,840
Mr. Yu.

508
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:07,880
You took the initiative
to ask me to invest.

509
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,761
We agreed on a 20% return

510
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,761
written in the contract.

511
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,321
How come it became 2%

512
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:14,561
once you made a profit?

513
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,200
This is

514
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,400
the final decision

515
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
we made after a serious discussion.

516
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:23,360
We offer a 2% return ratio

517
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:26,561
to buy out
your original investment shares.

518
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:29,081
Young An, why don't you

519
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,481
think it over?

520
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:32,081
Serious discussion?

521
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,880
If it weren't for
the 10 million I invested,

522
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:38,120
your company might have gone bankrupt.

523
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,081
Young An,

524
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:43,081
I'm very grateful for your support.

525
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,961
But starting a business is not easy.

526
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,600
That's the best

527
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,041
we can offer

528
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:51,160
at this point.

529
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:52,961
The financial report is here.

530
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:54,400
Please

531
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,160
don't listen to those rumors.

532
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,041
Our company hasn't

533
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,400
profited so much.

534
00:28:00,736 --> 00:28:02,440
You think I would believe this?

535
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,241
I...

536
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:09,824
(Fang Lili)

537
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:12,400
Hello, honey.

538
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,321
Miss me?

539
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:14,680
We cleaned the room today

540
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,120
and found so many secrets.

541
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,001
Do you know An Xiangyang
likes to breakdance?

542
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:20,840
Breakdance?

543
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,721
I'll tell you everything
once you're home.

544
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:26,120
Auntie is about to clean our room.

545
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,561
You have nothing weird there, right?

546
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:32,200
O-Of course not.

547
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:33,761
I'll let you work.

548
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:34,600
Come home early.

549
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:40,241
Young An.

550
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:42,721
Isn't it a bit disrespectful

551
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,400
to take personal calls
during the meeting?

552
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:45,360
Mr. Yu.

553
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,440
I'm really sorry.

554
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:47,281
Something came up.

555
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:48,001
I have to go.

556
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:48,721
Let's talk again.

557
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,600
Young An.

558
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:52,440
It's almost the deadline
for the investment contract.

559
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,001
Sign it.

560
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:53,561
Now.

561
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:54,880
Are...

562
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,001
Are you sure?

563
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:57,321
Just sign it like this.

564
00:28:58,721 --> 00:29:00,521
So you're fine with the terms?

565
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:02,120
Print and stamp it now.

566
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,521
Never mind, I'll do it.

567
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,880
Clean carefully.

568
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,120
Don't hold back.

569
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:54,600
Lili.

570
00:29:55,081 --> 00:29:56,440
Look, I'm a little bunny.

571
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,640
Little bunny.

572
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,360
Hop...

573
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
An Yushen.

574
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,801
What are these?

575
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:08,840
Well...

576
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,481
These are my gifts for you.

577
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,880
Surprise.

578
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:30,920
Raise your head.

579
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:33,200
Look at me.

580
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,721
Tell me.

581
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:37,920
What were you thinking?

582
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:40,561
Listen.

583
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,521
Those were from Grandma.

584
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,521
She wanted us

585
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,241
to have kids.

586
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:47,761
Grandma is a real lady.

587
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:48,761
She got us those?

588
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,680
Keep lying.

589
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,440
Seriously.

590
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,761
I swear to god.

591
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:54,920
Aotian.

592
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,360
Can you testify for me?

593
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,961
The system should
stay out of household affairs.

594
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:03,481
Fine.

595
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,321
I'll sleep in the study

596
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,241
if you feel insecure.

597
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:07,001
Wait.

598
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:09,160
Change the mattress.

599
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:11,840
What's wrong?

600
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,640
It hurts my back. Don't you know?

601
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:15,481
For real?

602
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:17,001
It's quite cozy for me.

603
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:18,160
You're thick-skinned.

604
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,120
That's why it's cozy.

605
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,041
Try it again.

606
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,001
It's just fine.

607
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,160
Relax.

608
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:36,120
How can you feel it if you don't relax?

609
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Take a deep breath.

610
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:40,321
In.

611
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:42,120
Out.

612
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,241
Close your eyes.

613
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,081
Five-second countdown.

614
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:47,761
Five.

615
00:31:48,961 --> 00:31:49,521
Four.

616
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:51,840
Three.

617
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,041
Two.

618
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:55,640

619
00:31:58,521 --> 00:31:59,440
