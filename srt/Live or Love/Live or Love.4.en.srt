=Episode 4=

3
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:57,048
Let's hold a wedding.

4
00:01:12,088 --> 00:01:12,847
Sorry,

5
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:14,647
my charm has bewitched you.

6
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:17,287
But now, I just focus on my career.

7
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:18,728
I'm not interested in marriage.

8
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:20,088
Miss Fang,

9
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:22,927
you are too confident in yourself.

10
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:24,767
I'm not so interested in you either.

11
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:26,608
My purpose of marrying you

12
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:28,328
is just to get a sum of money

13
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:29,767
to fund the wedding from my family.

14
00:01:29,808 --> 00:01:32,168
Didn't you swindle 50 million from me?

15
00:01:32,808 --> 00:01:33,487
How come？

16
00:01:33,847 --> 00:01:35,487
You're still not satisfied?

17
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:37,448
That 50 million of investment funds

18
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:39,088
is withdrawable next year.

19
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:40,767
But I need the money right now.

20
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:43,448
What for?

21
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:44,927
For sending a signal.

22
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:47,608
If we keep honest like this,

23
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,567
nobody knows

24
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,168
when we can finish our tasks.

25
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:52,528
But if in the game world,

26
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:54,048
a spectacular scene appears,

27
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:55,248
I think

28
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:56,927
the game team outside

29
00:01:56,927 --> 00:01:58,048
will definitely take notice.

30
00:01:58,048 --> 00:01:59,608
Your spectacular scene refers to...

31
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:00,528
In the wedding,

32
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:01,888
we set off giant fireworks

33
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:03,088
with the shape of

34
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,168
an SOS signal.

35
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:07,328
Sending an SOS signal to the team?

36
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:07,808
Exactly.

37
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:10,448
I've estimated the cost required.

38
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:11,767
At least 3 million.

39
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:14,048
With the An family's resources,
it's entirely feasible.

40
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:18,487
Miss Fang,

41
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:20,168
let's go out together.

42
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:24,048
Deal.

43
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,048
Yushen,

44
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:36,608
you're up so early today.

45
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:37,807
Why not sleep a little longer?

46
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:38,608
It's ok, Grandma.

47
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:39,767
I've already recovered.

48
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:42,448
Today, while everyone is here,

49
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:43,728
Lili and I

50
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:45,247
would like to announce something.

51
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:46,288
We have decided

52
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:47,448
to hold the wedding again.

53
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:51,367
I've already fallen for Lili,

54
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:53,448
and Lili has also stayed by my side.

55
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:55,848
Everyone has witnessed this.

56
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:58,048
Since we've decided to be together,

57
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:58,927
as her husband,

58
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:01,408
I'll definitely make her feel special.

59
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:06,608
This matter will be

60
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:08,048
discussed another day.

61
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:09,527
Lili is chosen

62
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:11,288
by you for me.

63
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:12,408
Being together is

64
00:03:12,728 --> 00:03:14,207
also your wish.

65
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,728
So, we'll prepare for the wedding promptly,

66
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:18,288
and get married this weekend.

67
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:20,367
I got it.

68
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:24,408
I'll ask my secretary

69
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:25,967
2 million?

70
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:27,608
Yes.

71
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:28,848
2 million.

72
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,608
You've already had a wedding before.

73
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:32,927
So, this time,

74
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:34,408
keep everything simple.

75
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:35,288
No matter how simple,

76
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:36,527
the An family

77
00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:38,807
is a reputable in Jincheng.
This budget...

78
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:39,408
Yeah,

79
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,207
all in Jincheng is watching.

80
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:43,048
We can't make it too shabby.

81
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,168
You know the whole city is watching,

82
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,048
yet you fled before

83
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:48,807
but wish to hold it again now.

84
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:50,288
Wasn't it embarrassing enough?

85
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:51,487
That...

86
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:52,408
I've already decided.

87
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:56,408
If you don't accept it,
there's no penny.

88
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:57,408
Only for your dignity.

89
00:03:58,008 --> 00:03:59,487
You haven't been home all year,

90
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:01,008
and are mad at them upon return.

91
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,408
I think from now on,

92
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:03,608
you shouldn't come back.

93
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:05,408
Fine.

94
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:07,087
My apartment is close to the office.

95
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,168
I'll leave after dinner.

96
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,208
I wonder if An xiangyang

97
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,408
is really An Yushen's father?

98
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:26,567
Being so stingy for his son's wedding?

99
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:29,088
The budget is 3 million.

100
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:30,208
Besides his 2 million,

101
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:31,567
I have some savings on hand.

102
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:32,887
It's just about enough.

103
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:34,447
But the wedding...

104
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:35,447
Keep simple

105
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,007
as it can be.

106
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:39,288
Use all the money saved for fireworks.

107
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:48,384
(Invitation)

108
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:51,608
What are you doing?

109
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:52,487
Making invitations.

110
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,007
Emails are free of charge.

111
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:57,687
Miss Fang, remember Song font size four,

112
00:04:57,687 --> 00:04:58,687
centered and bold.

113
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:00,608
I know.

114
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:06,848
Hello, check out.

115
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:08,807
Van Cleef & Arpels,

116
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:09,487
Chaumet London,

117
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:10,127
and Tiffany,

118
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:11,367
everything you need is here.

119
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:12,447
Looks good?

120
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:14,567
Do you think this is ok?

121
00:05:14,807 --> 00:05:15,648
It looks good.

122
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:17,408
Who'd doubt a noble lady carries fakes?

123
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:25,807
Want some? I've another one.

124
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:27,088
No need.

125
00:05:27,687 --> 00:05:29,768
Noble lady doesn't eat this.

126
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:32,892
(Wedding Ring)

127
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:34,327
Based on both of your statuses,

128
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:36,447
I recommend our store's treasure.

129
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:39,048
Is it dreamy?

130
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:41,728
Is it prestigious?

131
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:44,687
Would you like to give it a try?

132
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:45,567
No need.

133
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:47,048
Bring me the cheapest one.

134
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:49,327
Wait a moment.

135
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:51,048
Honey,

136
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:52,728
if you like, try it.

137
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:53,968
No need.

138
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:55,728
He can't afford it.

139
00:05:56,088 --> 00:05:57,288
Don't say that.

140
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:58,367
Trying is free.

141
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:37,367
So beautiful.

142
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,447
It's as if it were tailor-made for you.

143
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:40,728
There's no need for alterations.

144
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:41,768
How much is it?

145
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,608
I still want the cheapest one.

146
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:51,247
Alright.

147
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:00,768
Sales, I'm here

148
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:01,687
to pick up the yarn.

149
00:07:02,528 --> 00:07:03,768
Alright, coming right up.

150
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,648
Isn't this Miss Fang?

151
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:17,447
What?

152
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:19,528
Big shots have big forgetteries.

153
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:21,768
Don't remember us common folks anymore?

154
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,608
I was your desk mate in high school,

155
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:25,648
Zhao Mengmeng.

156
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,367
Are we acquainted?

157
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:28,768
You...

158
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,624
Already bought.

159
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:31,968
Let's go.

160
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,687
Isn't this wedding dress beautiful?

161
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,007
Why buy such cheap stuff?

162
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:38,887
What?

163
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,168
After being kicked out by the An family,

164
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:43,608
this second marriage

165
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:44,528
isn't great?

166
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:45,887
Are you done?

167
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:47,247
I'll leave.

168
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:47,768
You...

169
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:50,336
What are you doing?

170
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:53,367
I'll take this wedding dress.

171
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:55,447
If you can't afford it, take it off now.

172
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:58,007
What are you doing?

173
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:00,887
I'm her husband,

174
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:01,608
An Yushen.

175
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:03,168
Furthermore,

176
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:04,648
Lili isn't remarried,

177
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,247
and she wasn't kicked out.

178
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:10,408
She's just marrying me again.

179
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:22,487
What are you thinking?

180
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:27,288
Fang Lili's setting is melodramatic.

181
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,088
She's cursed wherever she goes.

182
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:31,968
But you.

183
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:33,687
When others cursed me,

184
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,008
you used to be quite happy.

185
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:37,048
Why were you standing by me today?

186
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:53,288
Because you are my ally now.

187
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:55,768
No one can bully you,

188
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:00,847
except for me.

189
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:04,488
I...

190
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:17,408
(Ju'an Group)

191
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:19,768
Come in.

192
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:22,248
Boss Luo,

193
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:23,888
the whistleblowing material is ready.

194
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:27,687
Let us prepare a grand

195
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:30,048
wedding gift for An Yushen.

196
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:35,826
(Wedding Invitation)

197
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:38,288
Everything

198
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:39,607
for the wedding is prepared.

199
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:42,368
Prepared?

200
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:44,687
I think you still keep a close eye

201
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,168
on your wife.

202
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:48,408
Be careful of her

203
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:49,768
running away from marriage again.

204
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:52,927
We did not know each other before.

205
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,888
Her behavior is quite normal.

206
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:57,368
Now that we've been through so much,

207
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:58,967
she won't do that again.

208
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:00,768
Yeah.

209
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,648
I am committed to An Yushen for life.

210
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:05,168
Since I agree to marry him,

211
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:06,847
I will certainly do as I say.

212
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:09,768
I won't abandon him for anything.

213
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:12,847
You...

214
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:16,368
May I ask who An Yushen is.

215
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:18,593
(Summons)

216
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:21,128
Here.

217
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:23,567
Someone has reported
your company has been colluded

218
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,408
with overseas speculative capital groups.

219
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:26,727
Please cooperate with us.

220
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,128
Why are you arresting him?
Do you have evidence?

221
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,048
We need his cooperation.

222
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,327
On financial misconduct,

223
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,768
we must investigate thoroughly.

224
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:34,888
If he's unrelated to this,

225
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:36,648
we'll never wrongly accuse an innocent.

226
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:40,648
It doesn't matter.
I have a clear conscience.

227
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:06,567
(What is the situation?)

228
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:09,168
(An Hang is suddenly going to jail.)

229
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,327
(Does that mean I am going to win?)

230
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:14,128
Miss Fang,

231
00:11:14,648 --> 00:11:16,607
I've prepared some daily necessities.

232
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:18,528
Let's take them to Yushen.

233
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,368
I got scared just now.

234
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:24,248
I feel uncomfortable in the chest.

235
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:25,727
Wait until I recover,

236
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,768
I will go to see him.

237
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,128
Even spouses may abandon each other
in hard times.

238
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:35,168
I wouldn't have expectation of her.

239
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:45,768
You have to find a way to save Yushen.

240
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:47,648
After all, he is your son.

241
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:49,128
But Ju'an Group doesn't

242
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:50,847
need a criminal as vice president.

243
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:53,207
How could you be so heartless.

244
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:54,768
You only considered company

245
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,327
but not father-son affection.

246
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:58,168
You spoil him

247
00:11:58,168 --> 00:11:58,888
and always

248
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:00,847
deal with his problems.

249
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:02,687
without a grandma like you,

250
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,327
he wouldn't dare to commit a crime.

251
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:06,528
I'm not surprised at

252
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:08,368
your grandson's behavior.

253
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,888
What?

254
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:12,607
If you don't watch him,

255
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:14,607
someone will.

256
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,008
Just let him stay

257
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:18,488
in prison.

258
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:35,768
Mr. Chen,

259
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:36,528
it's me.

260
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:37,888
You now

261
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:39,408
quickly do something for me.

262
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:40,888
It's extremely urgent.

263
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:45,528
Materials are prepared.

264
00:12:46,128 --> 00:12:48,048
Should be enough for a temporary delay.

265
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,048
Rest assured.

266
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:50,488
Ok.

267
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:54,888
Mr. Chen,

268
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:56,528
long time no see.

269
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:59,488
Twenty years ago, you helped me

270
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:02,168
with the adoption procedures.

271
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:06,488
Luo Yan?

272
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,768
Where are you headed to?

273
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:12,447
It seems to have nothing to do with you.

274
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:14,008
To the detention center?

275
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:15,727
Mr. Chen,

276
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:18,248
I advise you not to meddle

277
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:21,888
in An Yushen's affairs.

278
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:30,528
Entrusted by Madam An,

279
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:33,368
I will wholeheartedly rescue him.

280
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:36,008
As for what you did today,

281
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:38,168
I will also report it to her truthfully.

282
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:41,008
Why go to such lengths？

283
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:44,008
I can offer you

284
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:45,008
more benefits

285
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:47,248
than what Madam An gave you.

286
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:53,288
Madam An and I
shared a lifetime collaboration.

287
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,648
Besides interests now,

288
00:13:56,248 --> 00:13:57,408
we also have affection.

289
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,408
Using this to tempt me

290
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:03,368
is meaningless.

291
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:05,847
Are you willing to sacrifice your son

292
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:09,008
for someone else's grandson?

293
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,248
It's really touching.

294
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:17,607
You diligently serve Madam An

295
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,248
to pay off your son's gambling debts.

296
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:21,528
Dad.

297
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,087
Dad.

298
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:22,967
Please,

299
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:24,368
can you give me a few more days?

300
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:25,927
I'll definitely repay the debt.

301
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:06,447
(It's just a game.)

302
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,888
(Why should I feel guilty?)

303
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:14,048
(Even if it's a game,)

304
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:16,447
(I've promised him to go out together.)

305
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:18,567
(No.)

306
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,168
(Avoid foolish errors.)

307
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:21,927
(Letting things be)

308
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:24,128
(can yield the greatest benefit.)

309
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:49,528
Hello.

310
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:51,008
Hello,

311
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:53,327
is that Boss Yin's friend, Fang Lili?

312
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:55,727
She's drunk and keeps calling your name.

313
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:56,888
Could you please come over?

314
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:58,488
Boss Yin?

315
00:15:58,888 --> 00:15:59,687
I don't know her.

316
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:01,327
Fang Lili

317
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:04,048
has agreed to stay single with me.

318
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:06,327
Now she has abandoned me.

319
00:16:06,327 --> 00:16:08,048
She only thinks about herself.

320
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:08,807
I'll go.

321
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:09,727
Where are you?

322
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:12,888
Fang Lili,

323
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,207
you don't keep your word.

324
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:16,927
We agreed to remain unmarried together.

325
00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:19,168
But you're getting married,

326
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:21,807
and you dare send me an invitation.

327
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:23,967
In the whole Jincheng,

328
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:26,087
I'm the only one abandoned.

329
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:29,488
Do you know

330
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,248
how painful to be

331
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:33,368
abandoned by you.

332
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:42,048
No,

333
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:43,408
I just...

334
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:44,368
You just what?

335
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:45,447
They are all excuses.

336
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,447
If you have a clear conscience,

337
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:51,368
drink all

338
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:52,687
this wine.

339
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:54,727
Drink it all.

340
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:56,528
But I feel guilty.

341
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:13,167
I don't want you to get married.

342
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:13,647
Here.

343
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:16,448
Miss Fang.

344
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:17,847
- What's up?
- Help me get her down.

345
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:18,928
She's clinging to me.

346
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:20,528
Hurry up.

347
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:22,488
I don't want it.

348
00:17:22,928 --> 00:17:23,847
I don't want it.

349
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:26,887
Don't...

350
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:27,528
Hurry up.

351
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:32,248
What are you doing?

352
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:34,528
Don't leave me.

353
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:36,968
My leg...

354
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:40,728
Please help me take her home.
Take a taxi back and the fare is reimbursed.

355
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:41,327
Ok.

356
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:42,448
Miss Fang...

357
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:43,607
Just leave me alone.

358
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:44,847
I need silence.

359
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:45,448
Ok.

360
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:46,167
Lili.

361
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:46,688
Let's go.

362
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,008
Lili.

363
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:50,288
Lili.

364
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:51,807
Fang Lili.

365
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:53,567
Fang Lili.

366
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,688
I won't allow you to get married.

367
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:58,688
Fang Lili.

368
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:02,327
Hello,

369
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:03,567
you

370
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,248
arrived.

371
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:09,928

Hello, Miss Fang.

385
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:51,567
I'm sorry to deliver

386
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:52,968
your wedding dress so early.

387
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:54,048
Please sign for it.

(Wedding Dress)

389
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:58,407
But this is not the one I ordered.

390
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,968
Your husband ordered it for you.

391
00:19:59,968 --> 00:20:05,728
♪Always hoping the promise remains♪

392
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:06,688
I am her husband.

393
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:07,928
Let's have a wedding.

394
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,647
She's just marrying me again.

395
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:11,847
This is for you.

396
00:20:13,688 --> 00:20:15,728
(It's better for you to dress up a bit.)

397
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:18,607
(After all, clothes make the woman.)

398
00:20:20,616 --> 00:20:24,320
♪But now the longing is across the sea♪

399
00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:26,688
(Anyway, it's just one day later.)

400
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:27,647
(An Hang,)

401
00:20:27,847 --> 00:20:29,448
(I don't want to owe you any favors.)

402
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:31,208
(No one can bully you.)

403
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:32,127
Young An

404
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:33,768
I've tried my best on my end.

405
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:34,768
Currently,

406
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:35,647
I still haven't found

407
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:36,928
evidence to refute the charge.

408
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:38,647
(Your call content is being monitored.)
Madam An has fallen ill,

409
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:40,887
and Mr. Chen's family had an emergency.

410
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:41,647
So...

411
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:45,528
What about Fang Lili?

412
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,448
Miss Fang

413
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,968
(Your call is being monitored.)
went to sing and drink yesterday.

414
00:20:53,728 --> 00:20:55,887
It seems she wanted to enjoy herself

415
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:56,768
before leaving.

416
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:57,607
What?

417
00:20:59,087 --> 00:20:59,607
It's nothing.

418
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:01,288
This is human nature.

419
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,087
You go back.

420
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,407
Ok.

421
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:28,087
Li Zheng.

422
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:38,048
Is the salary Luo Yan pays you

423
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,407
so high?

424
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:41,488
It's Miss Fang.

425
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:44,208
How much bonus did Boss Luo give me

426
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:45,607
is nothing to do with you.

427
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:47,807
This car is at least 2 million.

428
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:49,248
What bonus?

429
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:50,327
So generous!

430
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:52,887
A bonus for framing An Yushen?

431
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:53,647
I don't know

432
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,567
what nonsense are you spouting.

433
00:21:56,407 --> 00:21:58,167
When you were working under An Yushen,

434
00:21:58,367 --> 00:21:59,367
you registered many

435
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,887
companies and accounts in his name.

436
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,048
And now you are

437
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:03,647
using his name to transfer

438
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:04,928
funds to overseas institutions

439
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:06,567
and framing him for insider trading.

440
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,008
Have I made myself clear now?

441
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:11,008
Miss Fang,

442
00:22:11,728 --> 00:22:13,208
do you have any evidence?

443
00:22:13,728 --> 00:22:16,807
He is the company's legal person.
The signature is also written by him.

444
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,728
Legally speaking,

445
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:20,008
there is no loophole.

446
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:21,488
I give you one minute

447
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:22,728
to get out of here immediately.

448
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,127
Otherwise, I will call the police.

449
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:26,407
You and your husband

450
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:27,928
will go to prison together.

451
00:22:29,407 --> 00:22:30,008
What?

452
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:31,728
Brought a voice recorder?

453
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,847
What will you accuse me of,
insulting women?

454
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,087
With your reputation,

455
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:38,367
it's unnecessary, isn't it?

456
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:39,647
Miss Fang.

457
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:40,208
You'll

458
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,367
just be this way forever.

459
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,647
It's Iker's fate.

460
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:46,647
(Joint Investment Agreement)
This is the contract you just signed.

461
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:47,728
40 million.

462
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:50,008
You claimed to sign on behalf of Ju'an,

463
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:51,928
but no one in the Ju'an knows.

464
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:53,248
I remember

465
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:55,928
Illegal possession of company funds over a certain amount

466
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:57,768
can lead to over 3 years in prison.

467
00:22:58,087 --> 00:22:59,167
Between the two of us,

468
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:01,167
you deserve to be imprisoned.

469
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:01,928
You...

470
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:03,776
This is impossible.

471
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:05,008
You must be lying to me.

472
00:23:05,528 --> 00:23:07,167
You couldn't possibly get this contract.

473
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:07,928
Impossible.

474
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,208
It's true.

475
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:17,567
My company invests in the one
partnering with your family.

476
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:18,887
You're suspected of fraud.

477
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,407
I will sue you as well.

478
00:23:21,488 --> 00:23:22,248
Fang Lili,

479
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:23,847
I'm not through with you.

480
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:28,768
Speak nicely.

481
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:29,887
Don't get physical.

482
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,647
I'll drive you to the station.

483
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:32,968
Don't thank me.

484
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:34,248
On the way for me.

485
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:40,864
(Keep Quiet)

486
00:23:58,944 --> 00:24:02,176
(Jincheng Detention Center)

487
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:12,807
Seize the time.
Go home and marry me.

488
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:20,807
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

489
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:22,647
I know

490
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:24,968
you didn't plan to save me at first.

491
00:24:25,488 --> 00:24:27,288
Why did you change your mind in the end?

492
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:28,448
Leaving a day

493
00:24:28,448 --> 00:24:29,288
earlier and later

494
00:24:29,288 --> 00:24:30,127
has no difference.

495
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:33,127
I primarily want to try on
that wedding dress.

496
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:34,807
After all, when wearing it,

497
00:24:35,288 --> 00:24:36,488
I'm breathtakingly gorgeous.

498
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:39,528
Thanks to you for saving my life.

499
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,528
But I heard,

500
00:24:41,528 --> 00:24:42,968
during the days I was away.

501
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,248
you had quite a good time.

502
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:49,248
Who's been tattling?

503
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:52,127
Let's go.

504
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,288
Let me see how gorgeous you look.

505
00:24:59,248 --> 00:24:59,768
Let's go.

506
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:09,048
Just put it here.

507
00:25:09,048 --> 00:25:09,448
Ok.

508
00:25:10,528 --> 00:25:10,968
Right.

509
00:25:13,248 --> 00:25:13,768
That

510
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:16,008
flower over there
should be positioned upright.

511
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:16,728
Ok.

512
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:22,528
I heard it was Fang Lili who saved him.

513
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:25,968
You mean

514
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:27,847
it was Fang Lili who saved Yushen?

515
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,728
Could it be me

516
00:25:35,728 --> 00:25:36,968
misjudge her?

517
00:25:46,248 --> 00:25:47,448
How did An Yushen come out?

518
00:25:49,327 --> 00:25:50,248
I heard Fang Lili

519
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,607
found evidence against Li Zheng.

520
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:52,688
Fang Lili?

521
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:56,887
Since when did she get so smart?

522
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:01,248
You look really beautiful today.

523
00:26:01,248 --> 00:26:03,127
Catch the bride's bouquet later

524
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,327
to get married soon.

525
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:28,992
What's the matter?
Are you in love with me?

526
00:26:30,304 --> 00:26:31,528
Is everything ready?

527
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:32,407
Don't worry.

528
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:33,607
3,000 rounds of fireworks,

529
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:34,367
not one less.

530
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:35,768
Ten minutes later,

531
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:37,048
an SOS signal will appear

532
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:38,288
across the sky in Jincheng.

533
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:39,327
3,000 rounds?

534
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:40,768
How did you manage it?

535
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:43,087
After all, it's your first wedding.

536
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:44,807
I can't be stingy

537
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:45,807
on such an occasion.

538
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:48,048
You didn't go over the budget, did you?

539
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:50,968
Exceeded by 3 million?

540
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:52,607
Netted thirty million.

541
00:26:53,768 --> 00:26:54,847
The catering is sponsored,

542
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,488
and the drinks are product placements.

543
00:26:56,607 --> 00:26:57,087
And

544
00:26:57,448 --> 00:26:58,807
your wedding dress

545
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:00,448
was also a business deal.

546
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:07,208
Boss An is really
a natural-born businessman.

547
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:08,647
Just average.

548
00:27:09,647 --> 00:27:10,367
Ten minutes to go.

549
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:10,928
Let's go.

550
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:24,928
Distinguished guests.

551
00:27:24,928 --> 00:27:25,728
Ladies

552
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:26,567

558
