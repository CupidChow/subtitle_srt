=Episode 6=

4
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:18,417
An Hang, why didn't you wake me up?

5
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:22,376
An Hang?

6
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:39,008
Morning.

7
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:44,417
What's this supposed to mean?

8
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:48,096
Not sure what you would do to me.

9
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:49,137
So I moved to the study.

10
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:53,017
What I would do to you?

11
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:55,497
You wanna fight against Ju'an.

12
00:01:55,497 --> 00:01:57,137
I wanna be its CEO.

13
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:58,336
It's natural

14
00:01:58,497 --> 00:01:59,497
that I stay more careful.

15
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:00,456
I...

16
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:16,656
An Hang.

17
00:02:16,656 --> 00:02:18,336
Why always follow me?

18
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,137
Aren't you taking me to the office?

19
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:22,176
You wanna ruin the An family.

20
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,977
I'd better not take you to the office.

21
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:28,377
Never mind.

22
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,496
I get it.

23
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:31,776
Businessmen are cautious. It's fine.

24
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:33,977
I'll lay it all out for you.

25
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:35,616
If I wanted to ruin the An family,

26
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:37,496
why would I have invested fifty million?

27
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:41,336
Now that you mention it, I do recall.

28
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:43,216
You wanted me to buy crude oil, right?

29
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:44,496
With your skills,

30
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:46,097
you couldn't see the price would fall?

31
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:49,496
I...

32
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:50,776
Come up with a better story.

33
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:51,817
I'm outta here.

34
00:03:12,857 --> 00:03:13,577
Feng,

35
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:15,377
waiting for Young An?

36
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:18,297
Yes.

37
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:20,616
He should be out soon.

38
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:21,417
I'm gotta go.

39
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:22,056
Wait.

40
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:24,896
Your umbrella.

41
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:26,056
Last time, thanks.

42
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:28,377
You're welcome.

43
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:37,137
Feng.

44
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:39,137
We see each other every day.

45
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,257
But I don't think

46
00:03:40,257 --> 00:03:41,817
we've ever grabbed a bite together.

47
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:45,697
I'm gotta go now.

48
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:46,977
Let's dine together tonight.

49
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:58,304
Hello?

50
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:00,097
Go to a dinner with me tonight.

51
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:00,977
I'll get you soon.

52
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:03,297
Mrs. Yin.

53
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:07,656
I'm on a business trip.

54
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:09,216
The signal is weak.

55
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:10,697
Hang up first.

56
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:12,577
Hello?

57
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:18,057
How dare you hang up!

58
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:23,937
(Now Luo Yan doesn't trust me.)

59
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:25,377
(An Hang is on guard against me.)

60
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:26,937
(If this keeps up,)

61
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,336
(I'll only lose.)

62
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:30,697
(I've gotta trick An Hang)

63
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:31,737
(to get him back.)

64
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:32,817
(If I want to win this,)

65
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:34,617
(I shall play some mind games.)

66
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:42,536
Lili,

67
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:46,177
stay focused on the embroidery.

68
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,737
Sorry, Grandma.

69
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:49,416
I'm thinking about the technique.

(Harmony Breeds Prosperity)

71
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:53,536
Lili,

72
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:55,497
you should work on

73
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:57,617
your embroidery skills.

74
00:05:00,497 --> 00:05:02,937
Grandma wants you to embroider
"Harmony Breeds Prosperity",

75
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:06,057
so you'll always remember them.

76
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:07,697
Someday,

77
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:10,257
you'll be running our family.

78
00:05:11,697 --> 00:05:13,096
Starting today,

79
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:14,976
Grandma's got you enrolled

80
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:17,096
in the 100 Lessons for a Proper Lady.

81
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:19,257
Put your heart into the study.

82
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:21,296
100 lessons?

83
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:39,296
Back?

84
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:40,976
Let's get started.

85
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:50,416
So,

86
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,257
my mission
was to double the profits of Ju'an.

87
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:54,296
That fifty million
was to make you lose money.

88
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,656
My real purpose

89
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,057
was to become part of Ju'an.

90
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:00,275
(Fang Lili's Action Plan)
(Invest-Loss-Join)

91
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:02,432
(Contract-Transfer-Revitalize)

92
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:04,697
Remember the contract I gave you?

93
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,617
If you'd signed,

94
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:07,737
all your subsidiaries would've been
transferred to me.

95
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:09,257
Then I could've dedicated myself

96
00:06:09,257 --> 00:06:10,497
to Ju'an,

97
00:06:10,497 --> 00:06:11,456
completely legit.

(Fang Lili's Action Plan)

99
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:16,257
Logically,

100
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:17,257
it makes sense.

101
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:21,057
But how can you prove
you'll run them well

102
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:22,216
after you get them?

103
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:22,976
Got any proof?

104
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:25,817
Lili.

105
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,177
Time for class.

106
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:40,377
Calm down.

107
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:41,377
Focus your attention.

108
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:47,656
Your subsidiaries own less than
five percent of Ju'an.

109
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:49,497
You think I'd try to take down Ju'an

110
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,137
with just this?

111
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:53,456
But marrying me
out of the blue like this...

112
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:55,856
Are you planning to split my stuff
via divorce?

113
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:56,497
Lili.

114
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:57,216
Time for class.

115
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,096
Still going on?

116
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:00,456
Natural formation.

117
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:02,737
Profound implications.

119
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:06,976
(Prenuptial Agreement)
I get nothing if we divorce.

120
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:08,896
Happy now?

121
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:09,856
Good.

122
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:11,697
But my lawyer

123
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:13,257
needs to look it over.

124
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:14,257
Time for class.

125
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,137
Seriously?

126
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:24,937
Not bad.

127
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:27,497
Let's call it a day.

128
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,656
Have a good rest.

129
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:32,617
Lili.

130
00:07:32,937 --> 00:07:34,257
Why aren't you getting up?

131
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:36,937
It's okay, Grandma.

132
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,377
Can't feel my legs.

133
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:39,617
It's fine.

134
00:08:00,177 --> 00:08:01,017
You've worked hard.

135
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:02,776
I've reviewed the contract.

136
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:04,057
Everything looks good.

137
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:07,137
Let's sign it now.

138
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:17,984
(The 50 million prenuptial investment
is a gift from the bride.)

139

An Hang.

140
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:21,737
The 50 million investment

141
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:23,096
is a gift from the bride?

142
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,057
You've altered my contract again.

143
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:27,456
If you really wanna
revitalize the An family,

144
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:29,336
why would you mind such a little money?

145
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:30,817
I'm doing this

146
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:32,656
to see how sincere you are, Miss Fang.

147
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:35,176
Let me tell you.

148
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:36,576
I'm gonna destroy the An family.

149
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:38,296
I wanna see you all on the streets.

150
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:39,536
We're done.

151
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:40,296
Give me back

152
00:08:40,457 --> 00:08:41,416
50 million.

153
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:43,176
No one messes with Fang Li.

154
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:45,176
No one can.

155
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:47,696
It's either me or you today.

156
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,377
Don't be mad.

157
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:51,536
Businessmen

158
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:52,936
are cautious.

159
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:54,696
Miss Fang, you definitely get it.

160
00:08:55,656 --> 00:08:56,416
Actually

161
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,857
I'm only about

162
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:59,017
half-suspicious of you.

163
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:00,017
After all,

164
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,977
we're, like,
fifty percent friends, right?

165
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:02,896
Shut up.

166
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:04,296
Either pay me back

167
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,257
or we partner up.

168
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:06,217
Choose now.

169
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:07,936
No way I pay you back.

170
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:10,457
Fine, we'll partner up.

171
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:18,688
Okay, fine.

172
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:21,176
Consider me magnanimous.

173
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:50,056
Hey.

174
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:50,936
Come. Take a seat.

175
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:55,337
I've ordered some signature dishes.

176
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:56,936
See if there's anything you wanna add.

177
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:00,097
All's good.

178
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,617
You just took over the supermarket.

179
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:06,936
Must be quite busy.

180
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:09,497
I didn't expect
you'd still join me for a meal.

181
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:12,097
It's alright.

182
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:14,257
It's alright.

183
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:17,017
Well then,

184
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,056
is everything going well

185
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:19,176
with the supermarket?

186
00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:23,296
Hey.

187
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:25,056
Mrs. Yin.

188
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:25,936
Why are you...

189
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:27,217
Miss Lin is here.

190
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:28,656
Xing asked me out for dinner.

191
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:29,977
I thought it was just us.

192
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:31,217
When did I...

193
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:31,816
It's fine.

194
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:32,737
We all know each other.

195
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:33,696
Let's dine together.

196
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:35,816
Waitress.

197
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:37,056
Hello.

198
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:43,296
I'll have this.

199
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:44,377
Okay.

200
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,296
This, and this.

201
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:46,337
Put it on my bill.

202
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:47,696
Okay, please wait a moment.

203
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:50,217
Why wait?

204
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,257
Help yourself.

205
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:52,936
Here.

206
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:55,176
Miss Lin, help yourself.

207
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:09,056
Feng.

208
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:10,137
Next time, we...

209
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:10,696
Miss Lin.

210
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:12,257
Shall we grab another drink?

211
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,017
Probably not.

212
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:16,377
I've still got some work to do.

213
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,416
Then see you.

214
00:11:19,176 --> 00:11:19,816
See you.

215
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:21,176
See you.

216
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:21,824
See you.

217
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:33,760
(Luo Yan)

218
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:38,536
Hello?

219
00:11:38,936 --> 00:11:39,936
I'm outside.

220
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:42,337
Just listen to what I say.

221
00:11:43,457 --> 00:11:44,017
Okay.

222
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:47,097
No need to ask Feng Zhixing anymore.

223
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:48,377
For Longxing,

224
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:50,337
I have plans.

225
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:51,776
Sorry.

226
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,576
I didn't help much.

227
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:08,576
Mr. Yang,

228
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:09,576
Ju'an's leader is here.

229
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:10,536
Ju'an?

230
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:12,257
Is it Young An?

231
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:13,857
No.

232
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:17,257
It's me.

233
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:28,576
Mr. Yang has been

234
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:30,617
supplying Longxing all along, right?

235
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:33,656
You should know

236
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:35,416
that An Yushen now oversees Longxing.

237
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:38,617
Mr. Luo.

238
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,337
You don't have to come to me.

239
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:41,696
No matter

240
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:42,896
who oversees Longxing,

241
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:45,017
I'm just doing my business.

242
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:47,737
Your issue with Young An

243
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:50,536
shouldn't be my business.

244
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:58,176
You'd like to supply An Yushen.

245
00:12:58,776 --> 00:12:59,977
I totally get it.

246
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:02,936
But you don't really believe

247
00:13:03,097 --> 00:13:04,176
that my useless brother

248
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:05,576
could compete with me for the heir

249
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:08,017
with just a single supermarket, do you?

250
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:14,296
Mr. Yang.

251
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:17,776
Picking the wrong side
can be quite troublesome.

252
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:21,377
Our Yangcheng Group is not as good

253
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:23,257
as your group.

254
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,816
But we're not pushovers either.

255
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:27,576
Who I partner with

256
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:29,536
is none of your business.

257
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:31,896
Besides,

258
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:32,704
Mr. Luo,

259
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:35,497
you can't even explain

260
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:36,977
your own background.

261
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:39,377
You're in a shaky position,

262
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:41,017
with plenty of people watching.

263
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:44,257
Kid, you're way too cocky.

264
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:46,017
That's not ending well.

265
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:47,737
Really?

266
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:53,497
Here's a gift for you.

267
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:06,217
Is this a photo

268
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:08,816
of you and your, uh, special friend?

269
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:10,896
I know

270
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:13,816
Mr. Yang built all this
on your father-in-law's back.

271
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:16,656
Eighty percent of the board

272
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:18,296
are your wife's family.

273
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:22,936
What do you think she'll do

274
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:24,696
if she sees

275
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:26,457
this juicy pic?

276
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,257
What do you want?

277
00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:32,576
Look,

278
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:34,296
having an in-law run the show

279
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:36,097
is already sketchy.

280
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,936
Everyone's watching.

281
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:40,056
At this age,

282
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:41,296
stay alert.

283
00:14:42,696 --> 00:14:44,337
You know what to do, right?

284
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:04,576
Empty shelves.

285
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:05,337
What's going on?

286
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,416
Young An.

287
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:07,457
This morning,

288
00:15:07,457 --> 00:15:08,896
many big suppliers

289
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:10,056
cut off their supplies.

290
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:11,936
We've tried everything.

291
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:16,217
Young An.

292
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:18,377
(Making the City Happy)
I've checked.

293
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,617
Someone's told the suppliers

294
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:22,017
not to supply to Longxing.

295
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:23,296
Should we

296
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:25,137
find out who's behind it?

297
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:26,977
Fix the problem first.

298
00:15:27,617 --> 00:15:28,857
Figuring out who's behind this

299
00:15:28,857 --> 00:15:29,737
can wait.

300
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:32,656
What's your plan?

301
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:35,816
Wife.

302
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:36,977
Time's up.

303
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,776
You should go home.

304
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:38,977
Go home?

305
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:41,416
I promised Grandma.

306
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:42,896
You come here in the morning.

307
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:43,977
Go to afternoon classes.

308
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,337
You agreed we partner up yesterday.

309
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:48,576
I did not agree.

310
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:50,056
You are full-time, aren't you?

311
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:51,776
I can't say no to the goodwill

312
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:52,936
from the elderly lady, can I?

313
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:55,056
But, to be honest,

314
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:56,977
you seem a bit unlucky.

315
00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:58,176
Better stay away from me.

316
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:00,936
What did you say?

317
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:02,617
You're a Virgo, right?

318
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:03,977
I'm a Pisces.

319
00:16:03,977 --> 00:16:05,137
We are, like,

320
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,377
totally clash.

321
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,017
Since I met you,

322
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:09,296
my life's been a mess.

323
00:16:09,497 --> 00:16:10,097
Obviously,

324
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:10,816
you're jinxing me.

325
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,056
Young An.

326
00:16:20,257 --> 00:16:21,176
I'll get to my stuff.

327
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:23,056
By the time I return,

328
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:23,776
you'll be gone.

329
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:32,536
How does he know I'm a Virgo?

330
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:34,296
Mr. An is arriving.

331
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:35,296
Mr. Luo is with him.

332
00:16:36,737 --> 00:16:38,176
Luo Yan is well-informed.

333
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:39,617
What should we do now?

334
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:41,737
Seeing the empty shelves, will Mr. An...

335
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:42,977
Stay calm.

336
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:44,097
Follow my lead.

337
00:16:58,896 --> 00:16:59,488
Dad,

338
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:01,257
why not tell me you were coming?

339
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:02,137
I could pick you up.

340
00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:04,177
Just dropping by
to see how you're doing.

341
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:05,296
No need for that.

342
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:06,784
Brother, I heard

343
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:08,937
Longxing's reorganization's going well.

344
00:17:09,177 --> 00:17:10,257
Thought I'd come and learn.

345
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:11,776
Don't mention it.

346
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:14,096
You might be disappointed today, though.

347
00:17:14,697 --> 00:17:15,360
Alright.

348
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:16,017
Let's get in.

349
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:17,096
Hurry up.

350
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:18,336
I've an afternoon meeting.

351
00:17:40,177 --> 00:17:40,776
Not bad.

352
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:43,056
It's a right choice to make you

353
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:44,536
in charge of Longxing.

354
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:48,576
Luo Yan.

355
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,977
Did I disappoint you today?

356
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:54,257
Not at all.

357
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:56,816
Brother is indeed an able manager.

358
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,217
I learned a lot.

359
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:01,536
It's getting late, Yushen.

360
00:18:01,737 --> 00:18:03,177
We should go back for a meeting.

361
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,056
I'll leave now.

362
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:05,336
Sure. This way.

363
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:23,680
Feng,

364
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:25,536
you were quick on your feet,

365
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:26,816
and let us fill the shelves

366
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:27,616
with the stocks.

367
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:29,136
He didn't suspect a thing.

368
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:31,737
But now the warehouse is empty,

369
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:33,017
what about tomorrow?

370
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,217
Stay calm.

371
00:18:37,336 --> 00:18:38,816
Follow Young An's lead.

372
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:48,147
(Nursery)

373
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:56,800
(Call Luo Yan)

374
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,536
(Luo Yan)

375
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:02,656
(Fang Lili)

376
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:05,816
This Luo Yan.

377
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:07,816
Missing calls when it really matters.

378
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:12,776
(An Hang.)

379
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:15,457
(These past two days,
I embroidered thirty pieces)

380
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:16,937
(and wrote 300 calligraphy pages.)

381
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:19,336
(I gotta show you)

382
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:20,856
(what life's all about.)

383
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:23,904
Aotian.

384
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:24,576
I'm here.

385
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:25,296
Buying items.

386
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:27,424
(Kids Candy)

387
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:31,737
Purchase items.

388
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,417
Kids Candy.

389
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:34,536
A hundred points deducted.

390
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:49,417
Yushen.

391
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:50,497
Keep up the work.

392
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:52,776
The future of Ju'an

393
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:54,017
lies in your generation.

394
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:56,576
Dad, rest assured.

395
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:57,937
I won't let you down.

396
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:02,056
Luo Yan.

397
00:20:03,457 --> 00:20:04,657
Thank you for coming.

398
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:06,376
Longxing's gonna be greater.

399
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:07,576
Then let's meet in Ju'an.

400
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:10,417
Good luck.

401
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,417
We'll leave then.

402
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:14,457
Uncle.

403
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:15,136
Sorry.

404
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:17,056
Alright.

405
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:18,368
(Warehouse is empty)
Let's go.

406
00:20:19,296 --> 00:20:19,816
Mr. An.

407
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:20,417
Wait a moment.

408
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,336
An Yushen.

409
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:41,296
What's going on here?

410
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:44,816
Dad.

411
00:20:44,816 --> 00:20:45,937
Nothing to explain.

412
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:48,217
The stock issue is my responsibility.

413
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:49,977
I'll find a solution shortly.

414
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:51,296
How shortly?

415
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:53,336
Three days.

416
00:20:55,937 --> 00:20:56,497
One day.

417
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:01,497
Okay.

418
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:11,017
Young An.

419
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:12,417
Tomorrow.

420
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:13,737
What should we do?

421
00:21:14,376 --> 00:21:15,136
Don't worry.

422
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:16,737
It's all settled already.

423
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Hello?

424
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,616
Have you landed?

425
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:26,560
Okay.

426
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:27,417
See you tomorrow.

427
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:31,217
Young An.

428
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:33,017
Who is it?

429
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,257
It's a secret.

430
00:21:34,897 --> 00:21:36,296
Watch the great show tomorrow.

431
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:37,977
Where's Lili?

432
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:40,096
You asked her to go home.

433
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:41,217
She should be back.

434
00:21:41,737 --> 00:21:42,272
Okay.

435
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:43,697
Let's go back too.

436
00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:03,737
Aotian.

437
00:22:03,937 --> 00:22:04,657
I'm here.

438
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:07,136
How can I get back?

439
00:22:07,737 --> 00:22:08,856
The kids mode

440
00:22:08,856 --> 00:22:10,497
will last until dark.

441
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:11,497
Dark?

442
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:23,336
(My store.)

443
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,737
(It's not really stealing, right?)

444
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:27,257
(Just borrow some.)

445
00:22:45,217 --> 00:22:46,017
Little girl.

446
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:46,977
What were you doing?

447
00:22:47,177 --> 00:22:48,257
What's in your pocket?

448
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:49,217
What happened?

449
00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:51,697
This little girl is stealing.

450
00:22:52,897 --> 00:22:54,217
Stealing at such a young age?

451
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:55,536
Nobody taught you manners?

452
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:56,497
Han Meimei.

453
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,336
(Han Meimei?)

454
00:22:59,056 --> 00:22:59,977
(Calling me?)

455
00:23:01,737 --> 00:23:03,536
Weren't you to wait for me
at the office?

456
00:23:03,536 --> 00:23:04,657
Why wandering around?

457
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:14,776
I saw you
outside the supermarket earlier.

458
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:15,737
Your parents?

459
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:16,536

Children shouldn't steal.

463
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:27,776
When I was a kid, we were poor

464
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:29,056
and I was always hungry.

465
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,657
So I worked as hard as I could.

466
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:34,017
Then I'd buy a ton of my favorite foods.

467
00:23:34,697 --> 00:23:36,376

469
00:23:38,336 --> 00:23:39,937
You helped me stock shelves today,

470
00:23:40,136 --> 00:23:42,576
so chocolate is like you earned it
by working.

471
00:23:42,977 --> 00:23:44,417
It's not stealing.

472
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:46,056

473

my little girl character.

517
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:04,336

So he's just genuinely good.

00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,657
And yesterday, I...

00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:19,336
I think I was totally imagining things.

Hello, darling.

526
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:32,776
Let me ask you something.

527
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:35,497
Do you really like An Yushen?

528
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:37,856
How could that be?

529
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:39,937
Absolutely not.

530
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:41,977
Fine then.

531
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:44,217
You know my sister is coming back today.

532
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:45,616
Your sister?

533
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,056
Which one?

534
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,336
Don't pretend it, okay?

535
00:26:49,336 --> 00:26:50,576
So petty.

536
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,776
So you're not that into An Yusheng,

537
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,417
then no worry.

538
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:00,017
What's even going on?

539
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:02,816
Why is she suddenly asking

540
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,737
if I like An Yushen?

541
00:27:05,897 --> 00:27:07,056
I'm going to Longxing now.

542
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:08,937
Wait for me.

543
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:13,257

it's gonna be hard to return to Ju'an.

547
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,056
Why are you so concerned
about the stock?

548
00:27:28,776 --> 00:27:30,376
You contacted the suppliers, didn't you?

549
00:27:32,737 --> 00:27:34,136
You managed to handle Zhang Chao.

550
00:27:34,897 --> 00:27:36,376
But you can't handle a few suppliers.

551
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:38,376
What a waste of time.

552
00:27:40,217 --> 00:27:41,017

You haven't met her before.

559
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:29,336
She controls the supply channels

560

561
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:33,657
Her first business back in the country

562
00:28:33,977 --> 00:28:35,616
