=Episode 14=

3
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,641
(Within such a short time,
getting money into the account.)

4
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,681
(Who did An Yushen
borrow the money from?)

5
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,681
(Could it be An Liminghui?)

6
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:09,120
(No way.)

7
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:12,280
(If Grandma had that much money,
he would have borrowed it long ago.)

8
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:16,120
Mr. Luo.

9
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,360
Having lunch together?

10
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,721
Could it be Shi Yu?

11
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:37,000
Don't look at me like that.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,521
I never thought that I would

13
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:42,521
be tricked by An Yushen one day.

14
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,881
We have lost this time.

15
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:51,081
Not yet.

16
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,321
An Yushen got such a large sum of money
so quickly.

17
00:01:58,321 --> 00:01:59,881
I suspect Shi Yu lent it to him.

18
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Shi Yu?

19
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:06,000
Last time, Shi Yu tampered with

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
An Yushen's car.

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,200
He might have been caught.

22
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:10,281
If An Yushen agrees
to settle it privately,

23
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:11,520
Shi Yu will lend him the money.

24
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:13,321
But the real problem is

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,680
I've checked the financial report

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
(2023 Financial Report)
of Shi Yu's company.

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
It's impossible
he has two billion on paper.

28
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,281
You mean, if Shi Yu's money is illicit,

29
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:27,161
An Yushen must give it back anyway.

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,321
We can now prove
Shi Yu's funds are illicit,

31
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,281
we can still

32
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:32,121
turn this around.

33
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:43,841
But I've known Mr. Shi

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,480
since I was young.

35
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,680
(You won't go soft now, will you?)

36
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:52,161
We must investigate immediately.

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,480
I'll go with you.

38
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:02,401
An Yushen thought he had the upper hand.

39
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:04,480
But he didn't know

40
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,881
I took the opportunity

41
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,920
to get

42
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:10,800
our overseas funds

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,841
laundered.

44
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,480
No matter who of them wins,

45
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,920
I won't be at a loss.

46
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:20,800
And Fang Lili, that annoying woman.

47
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:22,401
Just a newcomer.

48
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,841
Dare to boss me around?

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,920
How ridiculous!

50
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,441
Exactly.

51
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,240
Mr. Shi, you are a visionary

52
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,281
strategist.

53
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,680
Mr. Shi.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
The car has arrived.

55
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,360
Will you drive me home or not?

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,161
Yes.

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,161
Mr. Shi.

58
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:36,240
Let me see you out.

59
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,360
Thoughtless!

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,480
Go back and sing.

61
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:41,041
Tonight, no calls!

62
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:42,920
Understood.

63
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,281
Let's go, honey.

64
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:46,601
Let's go home.

65
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,441
Take care, Mr. Shi.

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,001
Miss me?

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,561
Of course.

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,240
Shi Yu has gone, right?

69
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,080
Come over and sit.

70
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,960
The others can go to the next room

71
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,200
and have fun.

72
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:07,800
It's on me today.

73
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,000
Mr. Luo.

74
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,880
Miss Fang.

75
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,641
I don't know why

76
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:21,480
you've asked me here.

77
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,560
The money An Yushen got was from Shi Yu,
wasn't it?

78
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,360
Miss Fang,

79
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,680
don't make baseless accusations!

80
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:33,800
I understand

81
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,120
you're a newcomer,

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,961
and need to establish yourself.

83
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,401
But you can't stir up

84
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,201
trouble between Mr. Luo and Mr. Shi.

85
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,320
I heard three months ago, Mr. Shi

86
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,240
went to Las Vegas several times

87
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,761
and invested in an underground casino.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
Is it true?

89
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,000
Miss Fang.

90
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,440
You have gone too far.

91
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:54,440
We are a subsidiary of Ju'an.

92
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,120
But you,

93
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Fang Lili,

94
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,761
who do you think you are?

95
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,401
Daring to rant without proof.

96
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:02,841
I swear

97
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,761
tomorrow,

98
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,480
I will sue you for slander!

99
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:09,521
Go ahead.

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,641
I don't mind.

101
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,480
Come in.

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,000
What are you doing?

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,920
Let me go!

104
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,721
Do you think
there are surveillance cameras?

105
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:39,000
What do you think?

106
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:40,560
Of course not.

107
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:44,841
Then, are your people reliable?

108
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:46,041
Don't worry.

109
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:47,800
They are all experts.

110
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:53,081
Mr. Luo.

111
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:53,841
Miss Fang.

112
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:55,841
This is a lawful society.

113
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:56,920
What you are doing

114
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,841
is illegal!

115
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,081
Mr. Luo.

116
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:08,841
Mr. Luo!

117
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:09,360
Please,

118
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:10,440
let me go.

119
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,281
What did you say?

120
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,240
I'll tell you.

121
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,880
I'll tell you.

122
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,440
As long as you let me go,

123
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,920
I'll tell you

124
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,601
everything I know.

125
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,161
How was it?

126
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,480
Did I act well?

127
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,800
As experienced actors,

128
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
we acted in many dramas.

129
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:46,041
In any crew,

130
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:47,440
we are professional.

131
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,920
Right.

132
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,560
We even

133
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,961
wrote character backstories.

134
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,601
The two people we act

135
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:54,480
are smugglers from Thailand.

136
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:55,440
So,

137
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,601
we don't speak Chinese.

138
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,120
The less we talk,

139
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,721
the scarier

140
00:06:58,721 --> 00:06:59,601
we seem.

141
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,120
A silent threat!

142
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:03,480
Thank you.

143
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:05,961
There are only small roles.

144
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,800
No easy actors.

145
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,120
About the payment...

146
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,041
Will you...

147
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,041
You've worked hard.

148
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,841
No.

149
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:24,880
Not at all.

150
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,081
Educating those

151
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:28,000
bad guys laundering money overseas

152
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,161
is our contribution to seeking justice.

153
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,360
Exactly!

154
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,841
Any other task like this,

155
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,201
remember to call us.

156
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:36,240
We'll go now.

157
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,041
We're leaving.

158
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
I did not expect you

159
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,601
to come up with such a sneaky idea.

160
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,401
Imagine it as a game.

161
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:54,680
If you lose, you die.

162
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,000
Then you'll come up with numerous ideas.

163
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:01,240
How come I never noticed

164
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:02,961
you had this potential?

165
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,721
I learnt from you.

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,000
Haven't you known it?

167
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:12,320
Shi Yu's money has been
confirmed as illicit.

168
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,480
What do you plan to do?

169
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:15,601
This is a lawful society.

170
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:16,800
We need to report it.

171
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,120
So An Yushen

172
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
can't use it.

173
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,961
What's wrong?

174
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:28,521
Feeling sorry?

175
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Impossible.

176
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,440
Wait.

177
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:43,960
Who are you?

178
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,680
Please come in.

179
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:49,600
Hello, sir.

180
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,720
We are from the bank's anti-money

181
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,481
laundering center.

182
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:53,481
We received a report

183
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:54,600
and found Shi Yu

184
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,881
was involved in
a major money laundering case.

185
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,641
He's now in police custody.

186
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,521
Additionally, we've identified

187
00:09:00,521 --> 00:09:01,881
a recent transfer

188
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:03,361
from Shi Yu to your account

189
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:04,960
of two hundred million yuan.

190
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,121
That's true.

191
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,840
But it was a legitimate loan.

192
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,001
Mr. An,

193
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,560
that's precisely why we're here.

194
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,920
Given your good credit history
and the possibility that you were

195
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,881
unaware of the case,

196
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:18,881
you need to return it

197
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:20,080
to the designated account

198
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,840
in three days.

199
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:24,720
I can't do that in three days.

200
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:25,720
Mr. An.

201
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:27,641
We're here to inform you.

202
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:29,600
Hope you will cherish this opportunity.

203
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,600
Otherwise, the situation may escalate.

204
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,401
We hope you can cooperate.

205
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,320
What should we do?

206
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,080
If we hand it over,

207
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
our funding will dry up.

208
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,881
Drive to the bank.

209
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,041
Young An.

210
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,200
What's wrong?

211
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:50,241
Young An!

212
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:53,121
Young An!

213
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:07,680
What happened?

214
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,641
Distracted all day long.

215
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:10,840
Nothing.

216
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:12,600
I didn't sleep well last night.

217
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,440
I just heard

218
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,521
the bank has sent people
to see An Yushen.

219
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,560
He must be anxious now.

220
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:25,840
His funding will dry up.

221
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:28,481
If it's so serious that
Dad has to clean up his mess,

222
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,840
he'll really be kicked out of Ju'an.

223
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:35,960
I just hope it ends soon.

224
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,361
I've always been curious

225
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:42,840
about your feelings for An Yushen.

226
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:45,680
Do you really not care
if he's kicked out?

227
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,361
What about you?

228
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,401
I've never asked you

229
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:53,960
why you dislike An Yushen so much.

230
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,080
Ever lost something to someone?

231
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,440
That's why I don't like

232
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,800
people like you.

233
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,241
Born with everything,

234
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,560
while always wearing a look
of smug confidence.

235
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,241
This is also why
I don't like people like you.

236
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,481
Polite on the surface.

237
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:21,281
Deep down,
thinking the whole world owes you.

238
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,440
Why are you here?

239
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:51,481
You can't let the guests see you.

240
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,121
Want to embarrass the young master?

241
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:54,041
Go back to your room.

242
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,641
Don't punish yourself

243
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,361
because of other's mistakes.

244
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,161
No need to be moved.

245
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I just said it casually.

246
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:21,440
What's wrong?

247
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,560
An Yushen fainted.

248
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:49,800
Madam, you're here.

249
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:51,440
What's wrong?

250
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,001
After the staff
from the bank left today,

251
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:55,401
Young An suddenly got a headache,

252
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,641
and then fainted.

253
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,281
The doctor has already checked him,

254
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:00,641
and said it's nothing serious,

255
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:02,161
just too much stress.

256
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:03,001
He needs rest.

257
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,720
Mr. Luo,

258
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:16,320
should we

259
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,161
go visit An Yushen to show our concern?

260
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:19,361
No.

261
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,320
But...

262
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:25,504
(Lin Lu)

263
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:27,720
I am outside.

264
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,920
I know.

265
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:30,080
Listen to me.

266
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,481
An Yushen is fine.

267
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:32,521
Don't worry.

268
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,960
I don't.

269
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,560
I know you do.

270
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,200
You just want him to leave,

271
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:42,560
without being harmed.

272
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:50,840
Mr. Luo.

273
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,200
Are we really not going?

274
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,600
No.

275
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,920
You're awake.

276
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,361
Well...

277
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:17,521
I don't know that...

278
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:18,241
Uh...

279
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,600
Miss Fang,

280
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:21,481
didn't you escape the wedding?

281
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,320
Why are you in my room now?

282
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,600
Escape the wedding?

283
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,281
It's...

284
00:14:26,521 --> 00:14:27,080
You...

285
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,600
Well.

286
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:29,800
Didn't you want to marry my brother?

287
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:30,960
Your brother?

288
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,761
Luo Yan?

289
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,320
Are you out of your mind, An Hang?

290
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,361
Who is An Hang?

291
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:40,481
Of course, it's you.

292
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,960
I am not An Hang.

293
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,161
My name is An Yushen.

294
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:46,840
No.

295
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,121
Then Do you know

296
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,161
who I am?

297
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
Fang Lili.

298
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:56,001
The match my dad found for me.

299
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,600
Stop pretending, An Hang.

300
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,080
I am Fang Li.

301
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,521
We're trapped in this system.

302
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,800
An Yushen and Fang Lili

303
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,440
are just our identities in this system.

304
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,200
How could you forget...

305
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:13,161
Young Master,

306
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,200
are you awake?

307
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:18,920
Mr. An asked you to meet him downstairs.

308
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,600
Are you afraid of An Xiangyang?

309
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,720
My dad

310
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,281
always calls me useless.

311
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:45,600
(What exactly happened to An Hang?)

312
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,920
(Considering what he was like just now,)

313
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:49,680
(it can't be an act.)

314
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,800
(A memory lost?)

315
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:55,161
(Believing that he is an NPC here?)

316
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,761
(I take the chance to defeat him,
and then, I can get out.)

317
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:01,401
(But...)

318
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:15,881
Lili.

319
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,481
How is Yushen?

320
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:18,641
He

321
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,600
still hasn't woken up.

322
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:27,641
Grandma, please sit down first.

323
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,720
Just a little pressure
would let him become like this.

324
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:33,960
How can I dare entrust Ju'an to him?

325
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,281
Your son is exhausted to faint.

326
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,641
Still not satisfied?

327
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:40,800
Talk about business in the company.

328
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,241
This is not the place for blaming.

329
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,641
Didn't they say it's nothing serious?

330
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,521
How can he keep sleeping until now?

331
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,720
What's wrong with the money from Shi Yu?

332
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:53,481
He almost dragged
the whole company down.

333
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,641
Never thinking thoroughly before acting.

334
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,720
Acting like this,

335
00:16:57,161 --> 00:16:58,521
he might as well quit.

336
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:00,440
What do you mean?

337
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,281
Can't you see the achievements
Yushen has made before?

338
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:08,041
You want to kick him out of Ju'an?

339
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,560
Why are you so biased towards Luo Yan?

340
00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:13,961
I am not biased.

341
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:15,640
I only care about ability.

342
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,080
(Forget it.)

343
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,080
Mr. An.

344
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,961
Shi Yu's money
hasn't been transferred to us.

345
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,120
And he has intentionally concealed it.

346
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,800
Fortunately,
Yushen discovered it in time.

347
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,360
That means

348
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,080
he doesn't have enough funds
to buy the land of the Yin family.

349
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,761
Is that so?

350
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,840
I really thought he was qualified
to compete for the inheritance.

351
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:42,400
But it turns out

352
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:43,961
he's still...

353
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,120
I'll try to negotiate with Yin Zhiluo

354
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:50,360
to extend the payment deadline.

355
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,681
Fang Lili.

356
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,001
Sometimes I really don't understand

357
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,600
which of my sons

358
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,761
you really want to help.

359
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,681
Alright,

360
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,521
are you done?

361
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,961
Then get out.

362
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:06,201
It would be best

363
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:07,560
you stay in Ju'an forever.

364
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,320
Thank you for just now.

365
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,441
Lili.

366
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:20,800
I know,

367
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,481
no matter what happened,

368
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:24,640
you still care about Yushen.

369
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,800
He is not in good condition right now.

370
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,800
If you can stay to take care of him,

371
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,840
I would be

372
00:18:33,201 --> 00:18:34,521
at ease.

373
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:40,961
Thank you.

374
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,120
An Hang,

375
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:47,400
I don't care what's happened.

376
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,721
You'd better recover quickly.

377
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,441
I already let you off,

378
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,001
not taking advantage of the weak.

379
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,472
It won't happen again.

380
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Hurry up and catch up.

381
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,441
Be quick.

382
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,360
An Hang.

383
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,241
Wait.

384
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,120
Miss Fang,

385
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,880
why are you still in my home?

386
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,961
What are you going to do?

387
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,600
Why am I in your house?

388
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,120
Haven't we already married...

389
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,160
Haven't we not yet divorced?

390
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,201
I can't explain it clearly.

391
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,160
Just get well soon

392
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,600
and fight me fairly.

393
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,681
Don't let An Xiangyang find
you're useless.

394
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,360
I am useless indeed.

395
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,041
Nothing to feel inferior about.

396
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,921
I remember you're useless too.

397
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,160
You!

398
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:41,481
You might as well

399
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:42,721
rest now

400
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:44,441
for your recovery.

401
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:48,400
Can I finish this round?

402
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:49,800
No!

403
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,640
I won't continue.

404
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,600
But,

405
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,800
can we sleep separately?

406
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:55,600
What are you thinking about?

407
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:10,241
Aotian.

408
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:11,320
I'm here.

409
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,241
Has An Hang

410
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,961
already left?

411
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,640
Am I the only one in the system now?

412
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:22,080
Player An Hang has never left.

413
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,281
So, he

414
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:28,080
did hurt his head badly?

415
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,761
I can try

416
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,160
to retrieve player An Hang's

417
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,320
data in the system

418
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,521
to find out the reason.

419
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,921
An Hang.

420
00:20:58,201 --> 00:20:59,320
Wake up.

421
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:07,080
An Hang?

422
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,721
Let's have dinner together tonight.

423
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,080
Okay.

424
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,961
See you tonight.

425
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,320
Young An.

426
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,281
Why are you...

427
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:29,441
If she hears it, I'll be doomed.

428
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:31,961
She...

429
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,441
Close the door!

430
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:53,800
Is she Fang Lili?

431
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,481
Didn't she call off the marriage?

432
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,800
How did she suddenly

433
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:01,360
become my wife?

434
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:05,481
She even urged me to work.

435
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,120
You know,

436
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,961
I hate to go to the company the most.

437
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,320
What if I meet Dad...

438
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,360
Are you saying

439
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:21,041
you don't want to go to the company

440
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:22,840
to compete for the CEO position?

441
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,681
That's my question.

442
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:29,400
Hasn't it already been decided
that Luo Yan will be the next CEO?

443
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:31,921
Why bother aimlessly?

444
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:40,281
Lin Lu,

445
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,080
you are like my sister.

446
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:46,320
Tell me the truth.

447
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,281
Have I

448
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,840
really forgotten something?

449
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:53,560
No.

450
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,721
You haven't.

451
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,400
It's all caused by Fang Lili.

452
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,640
Since she married into the An family,

453
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,880
she's been forcing you
to improve yourself.

454
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,521
It's okay.

455
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,961
If you want to hide,

456
00:23:06,961 --> 00:23:08,080
just stay here.

457
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:09,761
I'm off to work first.

458
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,800
Go ahead.

459
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,921
When did I get married?

460
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,840
Can I get a divorce?

461
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,521
An Yushen!

462
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:31,080
An Yushen, come out!

463
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
An Yushen!

464
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:36,281
Mid lane!

465
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:36,921
Mid lane!

466
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:37,360
Quickly.

467
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,120
Bullying me?

468
00:23:49,481 --> 00:23:52,041
I'll buy three million
worth of game equipment.

469
00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:53,560
Let's see who's stronger.

470
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:54,360
This way!

471
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,041
This way!

472
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:57,320
Lin Lu?

473
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,521
Haven't left yet?

474
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,640
Grab some breakfast for me.

475
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,120
To avoid Fang Lili,

476
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,800
I haven't eaten anything up to now.

477
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,481
Here.

478
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:06,481
It's here!

479
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,840
It must be tough on you.

480
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:26,464
(Ju'an Group)

481
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,640
Young An.

482
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,481
Madam.

483
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,441
We've arrived.

484
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,560
You better sit tight at your desk.

485
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:39,360
Otherwise, you'll really die here.

486
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:40,640
I'm not joking with you.

487
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,441
Feng.

488
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:46,961
You've seen Young An's condition now.

489
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,441
Until he recovers,

490
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:49,761
everything must be confidential.

491
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:50,880
Don't let anyone

492
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,160
but you and I know it.

493
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,800
Understood.

494
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,080
For urgency, message me.

495
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:57,840
Okay.

496
00:24:58,761 --> 00:24:59,721
But Madam,

497
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,320
I'm curious.

498
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:04,160
You had a falling out with Young An,

499
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,481
then you went to help Mr. Luo.

500
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:07,640
Now you're protecting Young An.

501
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:10,721
Well...

502
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,400
I get it.

503
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,080
It's you two

504
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,640
planned all these, right?

505
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:22,640
Cool.

506
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:41,880
(Wait ten minutes
before going upstairs.)

507
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:51,281
Come in.

508
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:55,041
Good morning.

509
00:25:57,761 --> 00:25:58,360
Morning.

510
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,800
You're in a good mood today.

511
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,320
Making coffee yourself?

512
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,360
I prepared it in case you got too tired

513
00:26:17,761 --> 00:26:19,080
looking after the patient.

514
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,880
Thanks.

515
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:24,320
I am not really tired.

516
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:26,800
Just acting

517
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:28,400
as his legal spouse.

518
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,360
How is An Yushen?

519
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,521
Although I want him out of Ju'an,

520
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,441
I don't wish him hurt.

521
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:40,241
After all, he's my brother.

522
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,840
He just fainted.

523
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,120
It's An Liminghui who is

524
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,800
making a fuss.

525
00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:54,001
Alright.

526
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,681
Get ready.

527
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,761
The meeting will start.

528
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:57,721
Okay.

529
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,328
(Lin Lu)
An Yushen lost his memory.

530
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:08,256
Seize the opportunity.

531
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:23,800
Mr. An.

532
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:28,761
Young An

533
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:31,160
has an upset stomach,
and can't attend the meeting.

534
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:35,441
Got it.

535
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,320
Go out.

536
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:37,400
Okay.

537
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,961
Let's continue.

538
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:45,800
Mr. An, as you know,

539
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:47,120
new energy

540
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,521
has always been an important part
of our strategic layout.

541
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,961
Three days from now,

542
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:53,241
Mr. Zhang of the Hope Group

543
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:54,320
will visit Jincheng.

544
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,001
The purpose of his visit

545
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:57,080
is to jointly

546
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,041
invest in building

547
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:58,961
and develop

548
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:00,800
perovskite solar cell factories
in Jincheng.

549
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:04,481
If we can be a part of it,

550
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:06,640
it will strongly boost

551
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,360
our group's future development.

552
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:13,360
(PSSC Provskite-sensitized Solar Cell Series Product)
But about this field,

553
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,001
actually, I know little.

554
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,840
My brother, however,

555
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:19,681
researched it in depth

556
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:21,001
in his last quarterly report.

557
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,241
So I believe

558
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:23,400
my elder brother

559
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,721
is the most suitable

560
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:26,041
to connect with this project.

561
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,320
You need to think carefully.

562
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,160
This is your client relationship.

563
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:35,681
You are offering it to Yushen?

564
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,201
It's for group's benefits.

565
00:28:37,521 --> 00:28:39,481
What do my personal gains matter?

566
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,241
You have such a strategic mindset,

567
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:44,521
so I am really glad.

568
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,041
Okay.

569
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:49,120
Just do as you said.

570
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:05,120
Luo Yan.

571
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,961
It's okay if you don't know much
about the new energy.

572
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:11,761
I can organize
relevant materials overnight

573
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:13,241
to ensure you run it smoothly.

574
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:14,721
Such a good project.

575
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:15,921
Why give it to An Yushen?

576
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,241
It seems that you

577
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:21,560
still can't be completely heartless
with An Yushen.

578
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:25,201
I don't understand.

579
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,640
What I mean is

580
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:29,761
I already know

581
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:31,320
there're some problems with his head.

582
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:33,761
He is now the useless one
he was like before.

583
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,001
And the reception in three days

584
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,160
will expose his true color,
and get him out of Ju'an.

585
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:42,721
Do you understand now?

586
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,681
Fang Lili.

587
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:48,441
I've said,

588
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,921
I don't want An Yushen to come to harm.

589
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,241
But he must leave Ju'an.

590
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,521
You'd better be heartless.

591
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,800
Considering Fang Lili's expression,

592
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,521
you are right.

593
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:12,961
Any plan after work today?
I'll go with you.

594
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:14,761
Glad I could help you.

595
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,041
I need to

596
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:17,961
work overtime today.

597
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:19,160
Next time.

598
00:30:30,201 --> 00:30:30,800
Mr. Luo.

599
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:32,921
Mr. Zhou wants to meet you tonight.

600
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,880
What time

601
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,800
works for you?

602
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:36,241
I'm busy.

603
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:36,840
Cancel it.

604
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:45,216
(Ju'an Group)

605
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:18,080
What shall we eat today?

606
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,080
Today,

607
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:22,080
we eat your favorite food.

608
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,120
Tired from the recent overtime?

609
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:25,560
It's okay.

610
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,840
Just sometimes...

611
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:31,160
Is this what you call overtime?

612
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,001
I...

613
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,320
Let me explain.

614
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,160
Get in the car.

615
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,761
What's up?

616
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,880
Let her go!

617
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,281
Do you believe

618
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:42,721
as long as I say it,

619
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:44,441
you must leave Jincheng right now.

620
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:47,481
A rich and powerful heir, huh?

621
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:49,481
Trying to bully my cousin in the street?

622
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,241
What?

623
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:52,921
Cousin?

624
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:09,880
I'm sorry.

625
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,681
I didn't know your identity.

626
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:13,281
Let me treat you the meal

627
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:14,521
as my apology to you.

628
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:19,600
Let's order.

629
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,241
Okay.

630
00:32:20,921 --> 00:32:22,521
A serving of seared wagyu beef,

631
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,521
and some Spanish ham.

632
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:25,001
Alright.

633
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:26,001
Green apple foie gras.

634
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:27,160
German pork knuckle.

635
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:30,120
Belon oysters available now?

636
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:30,961
Yes.

637
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:31,880
Good. A dozen please.

638
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,840
The chef here is

639
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,921
a Michelin three-star chef.

640
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,481
So the dishes are all very special.

641
00:32:39,961 --> 00:32:41,441
My cousin doesn't like foie gras.

642
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:43,481
And she's allergic to oysters.

643
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,320
Cancel those two dishes.

644
00:32:47,921 --> 00:32:48,481
Okay.

645
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,921
Let me do it.

646
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:22,681
Mr. Luo.

647
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:25,001
What I want to say is

648
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,560
even if you are the boss,

649
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,241
you shouldn't
treat your employees this way.

650
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:32,640
They have legally regulated
working hours.

651
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,160
Besides,

652
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,961
they have their personal lives

653
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:37,800
and time.

654
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,600
Yes.

655
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,320
Take this meal for example.

656
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,080
You want to have it

657
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:49,800
to apologize for yourself.

658
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,521
But have you considered

659
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:55,761
that our united time

660
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:56,961
will be disrupted

661
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:58,681
by other people?

662
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:07,521
You're right.

663
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:08,760
I'm thoughtless.

664
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,921
Lin Lu is an outstanding employee.

665
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:12,720
I'm just too concerned about her.

666
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:16,080
You just returned from abroad.

667
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,481
Finding a place here is hard.

668
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:18,401
I'll find one for you.

669
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:19,720
No need.

670
00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:21,720
I live at a hotel now.

671
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:22,760
It's convenient.

672
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,521
I was young when Lu suffered
the family loss.

673
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,441
I felt sorry for her,

674
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,720
but I could do nothing.

675
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,560
Now, I've settled down in New Zealand.

676
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:36,801
I will soon take her

677
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:38,961
to New Zealand for a reunion.

678
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,120
From this company's

679
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,200
weighted return on equity,
the company...

680
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,841
Wait a minute.

681
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:58,760
What is weighted return on equity?

682
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,961
It's the net asset return rate.

683
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:03,841
Well,

684
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:04,361
then...

685
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,160
What does "weighted" mean?

686
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,160
It means to multiply by a coefficient.

687
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,760
Wait a minute.

688
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,760
What is a coefficient?

689
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,361
If I've been unclear anywhere,

690
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,441
I'll clarify it.

691
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:32,881
Actually, no need to bother.

692
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:35,120
I can just admit defeat.

693
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:37,401
Well,

694
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,321
if it's too hard for you,

695
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:40,921
you can divorce me immediately.

696
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,160
I...

697
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,760
I got it.

698
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,481
I won't say it.

699
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:49,321
I won't.

700
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:07,120
I really can't teach him anymore.

701
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,760
Aotian.

702
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,680
I'm here.

703
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,521
Any item can directly restore memory?

704
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,640
No such item available.

705
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,200
But in the item database,

706
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,481
there's black boxes storing

707
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:16,441
memories of all players.

708
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,321
Okay.

709
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:18,200
Then I'll buy it.

710
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
It's not available now.

711
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,760
Why?

712
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,720
Don't tell me it's a plot setting

713
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,560
to let him test my humanity.

714
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,680
There is no such plot setting.

715
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:30,680
Player Fang Li's points are insufficient.

716
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,600
Cannot purchase it.

717
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,441
How much is it?

718
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,760
3,000 points.

719
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:35,200
3,000 points?

720
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
That's so expensive.

721
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:39,841
How about

722
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,120
giving me a discount?

723
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:43,760
The wind is too loud.

724
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,001
I can't hear what you're saying.

725
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:49,961
Then, I'll give you 3,000 points.

726
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,401
A flat price.
