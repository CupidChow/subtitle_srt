00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,659
=Live or Love?=

3
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:52,064
=Episode 22=

4
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:54,249
To preserve the group's reputation,

5
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:55,169
I propose

6
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:57,889
that Luo Yan be immediately removed
from the management.

7
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:00,209
That's right.

8
00:01:01,968 --> 00:01:03,129
Young An,

9
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,168
we now share the same opinion.

10
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:06,008
Are we...

11
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:06,808
That's too much.

12
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:09,008
As the senior executive, Mr. Luo

13
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:11,049
did such disgraceful things.

14
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:12,049
Indeed...

15
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:13,728
I'm saying you're overdoing it.

16
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:16,129
Before the truth is clarified,

17
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,569
you're trusting gossip.

18
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:18,609
How do you know

19
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:19,969
he wasn't framed by someone?

20
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:21,129
Also you people.

21
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:23,129
I've said

22
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:24,888
friendship and righteousness matter,

23
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,409
but you disregarded it.

24
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:29,129
For the company to thrive,

25
00:01:29,528 --> 00:01:31,288
both I and Mr. Luo are indispensable.

26
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:33,569
Reflect on yourselves.

27
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:36,769
From now on, no rumormongering
is allowed within the company.

28
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:37,569
Violators

29
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:39,129
dismissed immediately.

30
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:40,168
Session closed.

31
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:44,689
And,

32
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:46,129
call Mr. Chen.

33
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:48,849
I must provide Luo Yan with
the best defense.

34
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:50,088
With me around,

35
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:51,569
nobody can bully my brother.

36
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:03,728
How can Luo Yan be so careless?

37
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:05,528
The trial is in three days.

38
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:07,088
Once convicted of intentional injury,

39
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:07,888
no matter what I do,

40
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:09,528
the board will expel him.

41
00:02:09,648 --> 00:02:10,648
Doesn't that mean I win?

42
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:11,688
Yes, exactly.

43
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:13,449
You win, yet you're not happy?

44
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:14,688
Win the game,

45
00:02:14,688 --> 00:02:15,568
lose the wife.

46
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:17,568
Guard Luo Yan now is to guard you.

47
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:18,568
No one can hurt him!

48
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:23,449
He doesn't have the surname An,

49
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:25,889
but he is still one of us at Ju'an.

50
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:26,688
Lili.

51
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:27,609
Grandma,

52
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:28,489
rest assured.

53
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:30,009
Mr. Chen is already there.

54
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,449
He said this isn't difficult.

55
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,968
Luo Yan was defending himself.

56
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:42,808
Mr. Chen.

57
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:45,889
What?

58
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:47,889
Luo Yan refused say anything,

59
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:48,808
pleading guilty?

60
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:55,296
(Support and Care)

61
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:57,769
Mr. Luo,

62
00:02:58,128 --> 00:02:59,169
time is almost up.

63
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,128
Are you sure

64
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,648
you deliberately assaulted Chen Nuo?

65
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:09,688
Kid,

66
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:11,528
I was just looking for you.

67
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:15,648
Now things are simpler.

68
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:18,209
Intentional harm.

69
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,489
I've called the police.

70
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:22,289
Next,

71
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:24,128
it's just a matter of compensation.

72
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,408
I advise you all

73
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:29,568
to listen to me.

74
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:32,049
Otherwise,

75
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:33,769
your mother, Luo Yun's

76
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,289
dirty photos

77
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:37,929
will all be uploaded to the internet.

78
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:40,528
She wants to start her life over?

79
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:44,929
No way!

80
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:52,489
Right.

81
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:56,248
He had troubled my mom before.

82
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,128
I wanted to teach him a lesson.

83
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:00,609
Please pass a message to the Ans,

84
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:02,648
they don't need to help me.

85
00:04:03,347 --> 00:04:07,264
(The call is being recorded)

86
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:09,568
Mr. Chen!

87
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:13,329
Miss Lin?

88
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:14,769
What are you doing here?

89
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:15,729
Mr. Chen,

90
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,328
what did Luo Yan say?

91
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:20,328
Mr. Luo said

92
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:22,328
he deliberately assaulted Chen Nuo,

93
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:23,969
and refuses to accept defense.

94
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:25,529
He's not cooperating.

95
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:27,328
There's nothing I can do.

96
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:44,609
You're back.

97
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,089
You went to Luo Yan, right?

98
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:58,049
Mr. Chen said he saw you.

99
00:04:59,248 --> 00:04:59,808
I...

100
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:01,649
You and Luo Yan grew up together.

101
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:03,328
You must be close, right?

102
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:05,529
No, no...

103
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:06,448
Lu,

104
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:08,328
can you help me

105
00:05:08,328 --> 00:05:09,368
to persuade Luo Yan

106
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,849
to work with the lawyer?

107
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:12,568
If he pleaded guilty,

108
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:13,808
he'll be kicked out of Ju'an.

109
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:16,688
Lu,

110
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,409
we are family!

111
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:19,888
At this time,

112
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:20,969
aren't you worried yet?

113
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:22,489
If he is convicted,

114
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,688
his life will be over.

115
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:25,729
He is my half-brother,

116
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:27,729
and he's also like a brother to you.

117
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:32,888
(Listen to me.)

118
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,289
(This is the only thing I can do
for my mom.)

119
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:38,609
(Understand?)

120
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:45,089
Sorry, Young An.

121
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:48,649
I can't do much.

122
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:00,768
Calm down a bit.

123
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:02,128
It's nothing big.

124
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:05,289
I can't calm down.

125
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:07,529
Has the Luo Yan's system sprung a leak?

126
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:08,609
He's out of his mind.

127
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:16,489
Calm.

128
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:18,248
Everything will be fine.

129
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,609
Are you sure this is okay?

130
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:24,568
Sure.

131
00:06:24,929 --> 00:06:26,768
With the screenwriter's level,

132
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:27,888
I could do it as well.

133
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:29,568
Aotian.

134
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:30,529
I'm here.

135
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:32,248
How to use this document?

136
00:06:33,328 --> 00:06:34,888
Players can

137
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:36,128
edit a scene here,

138
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,128
but cannot directly affect
the mainline progress,

139
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,609
nor determine the actions of NPCs,

140
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:44,409
or directly rewrite the ending.

141
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,328
Good for you.

142
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:48,248
I want to edit Luo Yan's dream.

143
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:49,929
Okay.

144
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:51,849
Searching for you,

145
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,289
Luo Yan's current dream.

(Luo Yan's Dream)

148
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:03,888
Reminder,

149
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,328
start editing.

150
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:06,929
No exceed 500 characters.

151
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:08,128
Okay.

152
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,888
I'll try save words.

153
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:15,488
(Luo Yan's Dream)

154
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:16,224
(Yushen: You can't taste the flavor,
because you're dreaming.)

155
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:20,128
Welcome to

156
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:22,008
Luo Yan's dream.

157
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:24,544
Eat less sweets.

158
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,729
(The Unbusy Little Fairy)
Does your tooth not hurt anymore?

159
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:28,208
But I want to eat.

160
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:30,849
Just this once.

161
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:31,929
Alright.

162
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:33,208
You're just spoiling the child,

163
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,008
really.

164
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:35,208
Eat more.

165
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:35,849
Come here.

166
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:36,768
Thank you, Dad.

167
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:37,768
There's no next time.

168
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,089
This is quite tasty.

169
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,008
Slow down.

170
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:49,089
You can't taste the flavor,

171
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:50,849
because you're dreaming.

172
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:53,768
You don't believe it?

173
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,448
Some people actually don't exist.

174
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,089
They are all your subconscious.

175
00:08:07,808 --> 00:08:09,688
You might as well look at
your own palm lines.

176
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:11,208
Because when in dreams,

177
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,649
we can't see ourselves clearly.

178
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:19,888
You, now,

179
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:21,368
because of assaulting Nuo

180
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,568
is being detained.

181
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,368
I hope you can tell me

182
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:27,049
what exactly happened.

183
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:28,169
Well,

184
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:30,409
since I'm dreaming,

185
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:32,488
why are you in my dream?

186
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:38,649
Because I'm very worried about you.

187
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,049
Dreaming of me

188
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,208
means I'm thinking of you.

189
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:58,656
(Luo Yan, "Since I'm...)

190
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:00,160
(why are you in my dream?)

191

(An Yushen, "Because I'm worried...")

192
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:04,009
Reminder,

193
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:05,808
only 500 words.

194
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:08,088
Please reduce unnecessary lines.

195
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:09,568
Sorry.

196
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:10,448
Go on.

197
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:13,448
I want to help you.

198
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:15,328
But Mr. Chen said

199
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,208
you refused to cooperate with him.

200
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:20,448
Yes.

201
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:21,208
So what?

202
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:24,169
Is it because he is Grandma's lawyer,

203
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:25,769
that you don't trust him?

204
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:27,808
If you still mind that,

205
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:29,369
which lawyer do you want?

206
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,688
We will find them for you.

207
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:32,929
This matter

208
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:34,529
doesn't need your help.

209
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:35,728
Sit down.

210
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:37,328
No need my help?

211
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:39,208
I forbid you to speak like that.

212
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:40,808
In any case,

213
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,448
you must return to Ju'an.

214
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:44,169
As long as I'm still in this world,

215
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:45,529
our bond is permanent,

216
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:46,808
not a minute or a second less.

217
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:48,208
Luo Yan,

218
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:49,808
you are my half-brother.

219
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:51,328
You can't just abandon me like this.

220
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:53,529
Can you truly hide from me?

221
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:54,649
We're family,

222
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:55,448
live or dead.

223
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:56,448
Never think of escaping.

224
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:09,120
(We're family, live or dead.)

225
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,931
(Never think of escaping.)

226
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:12,568
500 words edited.

227
00:10:12,688 --> 00:10:13,889
Timing ended.

228
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:18,208
It's over?

229
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:20,289
Didn't I say try to save words?

230
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:21,728
Why didn't you listen?

231
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,289
I just got excited,

232
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:25,649
couldn't control it.

233
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:27,088
Can we try again?

234
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:29,409
Aotian,

235
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:30,808
can we try again?

236
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:34,009
Aotian,

237
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:37,688
let's discuss it, Aotian.

238
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:47,409
You're really something.

239
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:50,009
Wasting so many points
by changing the lines yourself.

240
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:51,848
And I have to coax Aotian.

241
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,728
Okay, dear.

242
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:54,889
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:56,568
I admit I had selfish motives.

244
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:58,688
If Luo Yan is out,

245
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:00,968
we don't know how long you'll stay here.

246
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:02,009
Then what about me?

247
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:09,448
Maybe I should be in prison too.

248
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:10,769
That would balance things out.

249
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,289
You're crazy, aren't you?

250
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,049
Wake up.

251
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,249
I've been thinking all day today,

252
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:21,688
for someone like Luo Yan,

253
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:22,688
how could he willingly

254
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:23,889
suffer this kind of loss?

255
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:26,169
And the person he hit
just happens to be Nuo.

256
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:27,769
Could it be mere coincidence?

257
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:29,968
You mean,

258
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,409
Luo Yan confessed

259
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:32,968
probably because Nuo

260
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:35,049
used some leverage over Luo Yun
to blackmail him?

261
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:38,608
Do you know where Luo Yun is?

262
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:40,409
Luo Yun has gone abroad.

263
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,169
I asked indirectly.

264
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:43,568
She has no clue about this.

265
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:45,049
I then didn't mention it further.

266
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:49,289
Yesterday, Lin Lu went to Luo Yan.

267
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:50,688
They grew up together.

268
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:51,929
I didn't think much about it.

269
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:54,448
The night when it happened to Luo Yan,

270
00:11:54,728 --> 00:11:56,448
did Lin Lu also not go home?

271
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:58,649
She always goes home
no matter how late it is.

272
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:01,649
Perhaps Lin Lu knows something.

273
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,529
But she doesn't want to say.

274
00:12:30,088 --> 00:12:31,088
Have you arrived?

275
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:33,249
You have 30 more minutes.

276
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:34,889
If I don't see the money,

277
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,369
you know what I'll do.

278
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:38,289
Wait a moment.

279
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:39,688
I'll be there soon.

280
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:00,529
Young lady,

281
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:02,169
you're punctual.

282
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:04,688
If you delay any further,

283
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,328
I'll increase the price.

284
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:08,808
Luo Yan promised silence.

285
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:11,328
Yet you still
blackmail with these photos.

286
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:14,328
How long do you plan on doing this?

287
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:16,929
Luo Yan, he dares not speak,

288
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:18,929
he deserves it.

289
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:21,249
Blame himself for having such a mother.

290
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:23,529
Those photos of Luo Yun

291
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:26,649
are my cash cow for the rest of my life.

292
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:28,968
Young lady,

293
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:31,488
if you don't give me the money,

294
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,328
Luo Yan's in jail for nothing.

295
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,448
If you really care about him,

296
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:39,688
from now on,

297
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:42,129
let's keep in touch.

298
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:45,448
Keep in touch?

299
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:47,568
No.

300
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:50,568
If Luo Yan can't get out,

301
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,808
you just wait to pay the price.

302
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:13,208
Lin Lu,

303
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:21,249
are you okay?

304
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:22,608
What exactly happened?

305
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:28,728
He used photos to blackmail you.

306
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:29,968
Why didn't you say anything?

307
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,208
Mr. Luo has his own choices.

308
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:37,529
Then if we hadn't come today,

309
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:38,608
what would you have done?

310
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:39,328
I...

311
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:42,968
I just wanted to delete the photos

312
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:44,769
to help Mr. Luo out.

313
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:49,376
Okay.

314
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,369
You don't want to talk,

315
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:52,289
then I won't ask.

316
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:54,129
Now let's go to Mr. Chen.

317
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:55,889
We must get Luo Yan to cooperate.

318
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:56,968
We'll take him home.

319
00:14:57,848 --> 00:14:59,208
As for the person in there,

320
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,649
An Yushen will handle it.

321
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:05,608
The person is a rascal.

322
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:08,488
How will An Yushen handle it?

323
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:11,009
He will have a way.

324
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:20,208
You're awake.

325
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:29,049
You again?

326
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:31,649
Where's Luo Yan's girl?

327
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,009
I'm sorry,

328
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,009
I am with Luo Yan now.

329
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,249
I'm here to talk.

330
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:41,688
I have your phone.

331
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:44,208
Luo Yun's photos will serve as evidence,

332
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:45,488
to the attorney.

333
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:47,529
Let's talk about your extortion.

334
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:50,289
So what about it?

335
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:53,328
It was Luo Yan who hurt me.

336
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:55,049
He is willing to admit it.

337
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,568
What can you do about it?

338
00:15:58,409 --> 00:15:59,289
I just want money.

339
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:00,848
Other things,

340
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:01,968
I don't know.

341
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,448
I knew you would say that.

342
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:06,808
Really shouldn't waste

343
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:07,728
so much time

344
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:09,289
talking to an NPC.

345
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:10,889
What?

346
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:12,728
Aotian.

347
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:13,728
I'm here.

348
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,249
Open the system interface,

349
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:16,929
activate NPC visibility mode.

350
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:18,488
Who are you talking to?

351
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:19,848
Let me formally tell you,

352
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:22,169
the world you exist in

353
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,889
is just a whole set of code.

354
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:25,249
And you

355
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:27,448
are nothing but an ant in this code.

356
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:29,688
Are you sick?

357
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:39,369
Let's do this.

358
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:41,169
Aotian,

359
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,328
the system image is too glaring.

360
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,088
I want to adjust the parameters.

361
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:49,760
(Live or Love?)

362
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:52,848
Lower the transparency a bit.

363
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:00,568
What?

364
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:01,808
Don't you like it?

365
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:03,488
What about

366
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:04,288
black and white?

367
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,849
Still not quite suitable for you.

368
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,409
You like to seek a sense of presence.

369
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,688
How about I help you?

370
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:29,129
Monster...

371
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:30,929
Monster!

372
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:32,609
Monster!

373
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:38,609
I have

374
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:40,688
always respected NPCs.

375
00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:43,609
But if you mess with Luo Yan,

376
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:45,849
you're messing with my wife too.

377
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:48,488
So I'll do anything to stop you.

378
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:50,169
Understand?

379
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:01,849
Mr. Luo,

380
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:03,369
Chen Nuo

381
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:04,649
withdrew the suit against you.

382
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:06,569
He came clean about the incident.

383
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:08,048
(Case Dismissed)
What you did was self-defense.

384
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:09,929
We have punished him.

385
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:10,609
And also,

386
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:12,569
he will not bother you anymore.

387
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:14,609
Where is he?

388
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:15,968
Why isn't he here?

389
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:17,649
Chen Nuo

390
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:19,248
has been detained for fraud.

391
00:18:23,448 --> 00:18:24,048
Lu.

392
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:25,968
Miss Fang.

393
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:28,048
What are you busy with?

394
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:30,369
Mid-Autumn Festival nears.

395
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:32,208
Grandma asked me to buy some ingredients

396
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,129
to make mooncakes.

397
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:34,609
Then teach me how.

398
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:35,528
How to make this?

399
00:18:36,488 --> 00:18:37,728
This is very easy.

400
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:40,329
First put the ingredients
into the pastry,

401
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:44,809
pinch them together,

402
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:46,609
then put them into the mold.

403
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:48,048
Lu,

404
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:49,768
on Mid-Autumn Festival,

405
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:51,248
invite Luo Yan over to celebrate.

406
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:53,089
If you invite him, he will come.

407
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:55,889
Miss Fang,

408
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,448
are you misunderstanding something?

409
00:18:58,688 --> 00:18:59,649
I and Luo...

410
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:00,889
I and Mr. Luo

411
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:02,849
aren't close.

412
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,288
Aren't close?

413
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:08,248
Then why did you take on Nuo's matter
for him?

414
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:10,609
And why did he hit him?

415
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:16,008
Because we've known each other
since we were kids.

416
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:18,569
Lu,

417
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:20,688
you don't have to pretend.

418
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,968
You and Luo Yan

419
00:19:24,688 --> 00:19:25,849
are together a while, right?

420
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,968
Why hide it?

421
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:31,329
Why not make it public?

422
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:33,488
I...

423
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:34,329
We...

424
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:36,768
You don't want Grandma to know?

425
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:38,649
I understand.

426
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:40,929
But seriously,

427
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,569
Grandma's attitude to Luo Yan

428
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:43,929
is indeed a bit feudal.

429
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:45,768
If she knew you adore Luo Yan,

430
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:47,008
she won't accept it.

431
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:49,048
But it's okay.

432
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:51,288
We can try to change her mind
bit by bit.

433
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:53,409
In fact, this time,

434
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,528
Grandma was quite worried about Luo Yan.

435
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:57,288
Before we leave,

436
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,329
we'll help you to change Grandma's mind.

437
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,409
Before leaving?

438
00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:03,809
Where are you going?

439
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:07,849
I mean...

440
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:10,008
Before we go on a trip.

441
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:13,208
No matter what Grandma thinks,

442
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:14,609
just go find him.

443
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:16,008
Go right now.

444
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:25,632
(Jincheng Detention Center)

445
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:41,809
Mr. Luo,

446
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,089
I've come to take you home.

447
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:56,968
Let's welcome

448
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:57,889
Mr. Luo's home.

449
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:04,688
Your previous business,

450
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:05,929
I've been managing for you.

451
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:07,248
Now that you're back,

452
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:08,528
I'll return it all.

453
00:21:09,488 --> 00:21:10,329
About the rest,

454
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:12,369
Feng will coordinate the handover
with Luo Lei.

455
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:18,048
I hope everyone will remember today.

456
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:19,329
In Ju'an,

457
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:20,369
the most important thing

458
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:21,288
is unity.

459
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:24,248
Aren't we the best at infighting?

460
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:27,409
In any case,

461
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:28,488
to welcome Mr. Luo

462
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,609
back in the company,

463
00:21:30,008 --> 00:21:31,369
we will have a

464
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:33,488
company-wide team-building gathering.

465
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:35,569
Please attend on time this evening.

466
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:44,369
Thank you.

467
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,129
After all, I caused this incident.

468
00:21:48,768 --> 00:21:49,929
The team-building celebration

469
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:50,688
is not appropriate.

470
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:51,609
Maybe just let it go.

471
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:54,329
I appreciate everyone's kindness.

472
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:59,232
(All but a Big Dream)

473
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:11,809
Is it sweet, baby?

474
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:12,929
Yes.

475
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:14,569
Drink up.

476
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:38,129
Sir,

477
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:39,889
two sesame paste with taro balls.

478
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:40,849
Okay!

479
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:47,488
Really not planning to

480
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:48,728
see Luo Yun again?

481
00:22:49,008 --> 00:22:50,248
Why are you being so stubborn?

482
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:51,288
Leave me alone.

483
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:52,448
And,

484
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:54,208
who sent you to follow me?

485
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:55,728
You think I want to?

486
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:58,728
But now it's my duty to protect you.

487
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:01,609
An Yushen, are you out of your mind?

488
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:02,288
Yeah.

489
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,369
You've plotted against me before.

490
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:05,169
Did you forget?

491
00:23:08,448 --> 00:23:09,089
Sit down.

492
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:11,488
I got you out.

493
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:13,369
Aren't you going to treat me
to something?

494
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:14,208
Not now.

495
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:17,129
I'm not discussing it with you.

496
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:26,129
Enjoy.

497
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:29,089
Later,

498
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:30,169
you'll definitely treat me.
