=Episode 24=

4
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:35,984
Why are you here?

5
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:37,152
Good morning.

00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:41,536
(Personal Share Transfer Agreement)

00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,035
(Personal Share Transfer Agreement)

8
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,224
You're giving half of your shares to me?

9
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:56,105
Like I said,

10
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:56,825
I disagree.

11
00:01:57,344 --> 00:01:58,825
I'm not here to discuss it with you.

12
00:01:59,344 --> 00:01:59,945
Luo Yan,

13
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:02,144
based on your performance recently

14
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:03,616
and the support rate in the group,

15
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:05,385
you have actually already lost.

16
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:07,944
If you don't sign this,

17
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:09,585
your company, properties,

18
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:10,305
and apartment

19
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:12,064
will all belong

20
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:13,504
to Ju'an.

21
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:14,944
I will take them all back.

22
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:17,504
Threatening me?

23
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,025
Can't hide it anymore?

24
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:20,944
That's right.

25
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:22,344
It's a threat.

26
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:24,992
This is your only chance.

27
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:25,745
(Party A's Signature: An Yushen)

28
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,104
(If Party A can't fulfill the contract,)
I'm giving you three days.

29
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:27,824
(all their shares go to Party B.)
I'm waiting for your response.

30
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:29,705
An Yushen,

31
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:33,784
what does the last clause mean?

32
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:37,265
It means

33
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:38,824
that if anything happens to me,

34
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:41,465
my shares will automatically
transfer to your name,

35
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:43,944
and you'll immediately
become Ju'an's CEO.

36
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:50,944
An Yushen,

37
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:53,504
I don't need you to do this for me.

38
00:03:04,624 --> 00:03:05,745
Where did An Hang go?

39
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:06,784
He didn't answer my call.

40
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:10,064
An Hang, where did you go?

41
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:10,944
You missed my call.

42
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:22,504
I went to buy flowers for you.

43
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:23,064
Okay?

44
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:26,145
Alright.

45
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:28,185
Come out with me in a while.

46
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:29,265
Where to?

47
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:30,344
To see Luo Yan.

48
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:31,705
Let's hurry and convince him.

49
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:32,985
No need.

50
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:33,985
I talked to him just now.

51
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:35,504
You went alone?

52
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:37,145
What did he say?

53
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:39,504
He said he would consider it.

54
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:40,504
I feel

55
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:41,504
it'll go smoothly.

56
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:42,560
Really?

57
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,585
Then we can go out together?

58
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:45,624
Of course.

59
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:47,305
What we need to do now is

60
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:48,544
to lay flat.

61
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:50,985
That's enough?

62
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:56,544
Aotian.

63
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:57,888
I'm here.

64
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:00,025
Aren't we awesome?

65
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:02,465
Not only did we think
of a win-win ending,

66
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:04,104
but we also completed all tasks.

67
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:05,664
Not really.

68
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:07,544
What do you mean?

69
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:09,064
You still

70
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:11,265
have an uncompleted hidden task.

71
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:13,145
- We do?
- We do?

72
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,065
The hidden task

73
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:20,025
couldn't be

74
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,145
about her, right?

75
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:24,825
It's okay.

76
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:25,945
Don't be nervous.

77
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:27,825
We'll go home after the checkup.

78
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:29,465
How could I not be nervous?

79
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:30,424
Feng Zhixing,

80
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:31,344
if there's any problem,

81
00:04:31,465 --> 00:04:32,344
I will kill you.

82
00:04:32,344 --> 00:04:32,984
Yin Zhiluo,

83
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:34,625
don't say that.

84
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:36,104
Before I die,

85
00:04:36,104 --> 00:04:37,505
I will take good care of you both.

86
00:04:37,664 --> 00:04:38,385
Ms. Yin,

87
00:04:38,784 --> 00:04:40,945
you're just here
for a prenatal checkup today, right?

88
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:42,184
Lower your voice.

89
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:46,705
Sorry about that.

90
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:48,104
We're new

91
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,344
and a bit nervous.

92
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:57,505
How about

93
00:04:58,104 --> 00:04:59,145
we go eat something first

94
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:00,465
and wait for the results?

95
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:07,136
(Fang Lili)

96
00:05:07,945 --> 00:05:08,512
Hello?

97
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:19,552
Honey,

98
00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:21,304
the urgent matter you said

99
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,505
is this?

100
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:23,904
Yes.

101
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:25,784
You are now new parents.

102
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,184
You need to practice.

103
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:29,344
Ms. Yin,

104
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:31,424
our institution
is very professional in the field

105
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:32,664
of maternal and infant care.

106
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:33,784
Please rest assured.

107
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:35,664
Many expectant parents now

108
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:38,304
will study the system courses
in advance.

109
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:40,385
Ms. Fang invited me here

110
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,945
to let you both
get a preliminary understanding.

111
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:45,224
Let's start with the simplest part.

112
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,272
Pretty good.

113
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:02,065
Okay.

114
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:03,465
For the parts just now,

115
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,465
you've all done very well.

116
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:07,104
Apart from these parts,

117
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:09,465
providing your child
with a healthy family environment

118
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:11,465
is also an indispensable part.

119
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:12,784
The most important of it

120
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:13,984
is to let the child

121
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:16,265
feel the love between the parents.

122
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:17,984
So let's practice

123
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:20,265
saying 'I love you' to each other.

124
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:26,184
So, the father-to-be,

125
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,184
you go first.

126
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:33,265
I know

127
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:35,664
Eastern culture is more reserved.

128
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:37,265
So it's hard to express.

129
00:06:37,544 --> 00:06:38,104
How about this?

130
00:06:38,104 --> 00:06:39,465
First, reminisce

131
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,505
about the moments
when you met each other

132
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:43,825
and the moments
that once moved your heart.

133
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:50,625
I...

134
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:54,705
love...

135
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:57,065
Let's skip this part for now.

136
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:58,465
We have things to do.

137
00:06:58,465 --> 00:06:59,344
Sorry.

138
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:07,664
Let me make it clear.

139
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:09,585
I didn't mean to blackmail you.

140
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:11,145
I can raise this child on my own.

141
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:12,664
Yes, I know.

142
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:14,224
But a child also needs a father.

143
00:07:14,385 --> 00:07:15,104
Listen.

144
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:16,505
If that's the only reason,

145
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:17,424
stop coming to me.

146
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:21,145
Why is that?

147
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:27,224
Thank you for being with me
all this time.

148
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:29,424
Don't feel obligated to me

149
00:07:29,424 --> 00:07:30,145
out of your guilt.

150
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:32,385
I also need to think

151
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:33,825
about our relationship.

152
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,224
Maybe such an ending

153
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,585
is good for both of us.

154
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:44,224
I'm leaving.

155
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:51,984
Forget it. It's just a task.

156
00:07:52,184 --> 00:07:53,145
Let's not do it.

157
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,224
When it comes to love,

158
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:56,825
the choice is theirs.

159
00:07:57,304 --> 00:07:58,104
I agree.

160
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:01,505
Abandoning the task
will result in a point deduction.

161
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:02,984
Abandon.

162
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:04,672
Okay.

163
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:05,920
Hint:

164
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:08,544
You still have
an incomplete hidden task.

165
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:10,424
More?

166
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:13,465
What exactly is it?

167
00:08:14,465 --> 00:08:15,945
The task has timed out.

168
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:17,945
The system will conclude it.

169
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:22,744
Andy.

170
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:23,825
Zhang Chao.

171
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:24,784
Shi Yu.

172
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,184
Do you remember that time with Shi Yu

173
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:32,345
when someone on a motorcycle
splashed paint on my car?

174
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:34,064
That person was a girl.

175
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:39,664
Lin Lu.

176
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:43,091
(Ju'an Group)

177
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:51,345
(Your coffee is here.)

178
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:54,112
Hello.

179
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:55,544
You must be Lin Lu.

180
00:08:56,105 --> 00:08:56,800
Yes.

181
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:58,985
May I ask who you are?

182
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:02,704
(Public)
Here is my ID.

183
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:05,385
You're suspected

184
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:06,944
of a hired murder,

185
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:08,345
threatening, and intimidating.

186
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:09,704
Please cooperate

187
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:10,784
and come with us.

188
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:16,424
I see.

189
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:21,985
Can you give me five minutes?

190
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:23,784
I promise

191
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:25,664
I will go with you after five minutes.

192
00:09:27,064 --> 00:09:28,985
Of course, you can follow me throughout.

193
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:36,064
Okay, Mr. Zheng.

194
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:47,744
Okay.

195
00:09:49,064 --> 00:09:49,664
No problem.

196
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:53,704
By the way,

197
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:54,464
well...

198
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:55,784
I'd like to confirm some details

199
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:57,304
in the contract with you in person.

200
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,544
Tomorrow?

201
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:01,152
Okay.

202
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:03,064
Let's meet tomorrow and talk.

203
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,832
Okay.

204
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:06,424
Okay, Mr. Zheng.

205
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:08,824
See you.

206
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:17,105
Why are you here?

207
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:19,544
I still have a meeting.

208
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:20,905
I need half an hour.

209
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:23,985
It's okay.

210
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:26,505
I just want to see you.

211
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:52,288
Alright.

212
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:54,184
Go ahead.

213
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:57,105
See you tonight.

214
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:01,505
See you tonight.

215
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:23,808
See you tonight.

216
00:11:33,704 --> 00:11:35,184
Regarding this project,

217
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:36,184
that's roughly it.

218
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:37,584
Also,

219
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:40,505
Young An has also sent someone
to communicate.

220
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:41,385
They said

221
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:42,944
if manpower support is needed,

222
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:43,905
we can ask them.

223
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:47,040
I see.

224
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:51,784
If you have any needs,

225
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:53,184
do as you see fit.

226
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:54,704
Okay.

227
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,192
(The police
have taken away Secretary Lin.)

228
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:02,112
Mr. Luo,

229
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:02,985
the group said

230
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:05,064
the police just took Secretary Lin away.

231
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:17,145
It's okay.

232
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:19,544
I just want to see you.

233
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:45,184
Alright.

234
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:47,064
Go ahead.

235
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:07,456

236
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:19,104

Patient's family.

238
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:21,704
Doctor,

239
00:13:21,704 --> 00:13:22,464
how is Luo Yan?

240
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:23,105
Not very well.

241
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:24,704
He's lost a lot of blood.

242
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:25,905
We don't have enough blood.

243
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:26,784
Also,

244
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:28,385
we can't find a compatible donor.

245
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:30,544
Can't find a compatible donor?

246
00:13:32,064 --> 00:13:33,745
Could it be the standard requirement?

247
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:35,145
Rare blood type?

248
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:37,145
H-How do you know that?

249
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:38,824
Take mine.

250
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:41,584
I am Rh-negative too.

251
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:43,544
We need a large amount of blood.

252
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:44,505
At your age, I fear...

253
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,225
Hurry up.

254
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:47,064
Or it'll be too late.

255
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,145
Luo Yan,

256
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:01,985
you're awake.

257
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:03,464
You had a car accident.

258
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:04,664
You've scared us all.

259
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:06,064
What are you doing?

260
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:09,225
I need to find Lin Lu.

261
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:11,025
Stay in the bed. You just had surgery.

262
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,824
You'll pull at your wound.

263
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:13,664
Don't move.

264
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:16,345
Luo Yan!

265
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:18,664
It doesn't matter what you want.

266
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:20,704
But doing so is unfair

267
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:22,025
to Grandma, who risked her life

268
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,064
to donate blood to you.

269
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,905
Your life isn't only yours.

270
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:30,464
Lie down and rest.

271
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:35,505
Don't be so hypocritical.

272
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,145
Tell me.

273
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:39,784
Did you report Lin Lu?

274
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,145
Do you have any evidence on her?

275
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:42,656
You...

276
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:44,960
Fine.

277
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,664
Think whatever you like.

278
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:50,385
But before you think about dying again,

279
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,664

Hey,

334
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:26,905
we've used up all our points,
so you stop providing service?

336
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:32,345
how about I take you to Aotian?

You recovered my memory for me earlier.

00:18:56,264 --> 00:18:56,944
I took a guess.

345
00:18:58,065 --> 00:18:58,984
Why didn't you answer?

346
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:00,064
Well,

347
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:01,704
I can't be working nonstop.

348
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:03,464
Isn't it almost over?

349
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:04,785

00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:06,944

351
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:07,585
Relax.

352
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:08,944
Just one last request.

353
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:10,224
Do it. We'll go.

354
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:11,905
There's another request?

355
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:17,664
You can copy it.

356
00:19:18,585 --> 00:19:20,105

357
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:21,704
not its best.

358

00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:30,785
we only reserve

is there any way to copy everything?

about this for now?

00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:32,024
can I save a lot of storage space

401
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,585

423
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:53,224

470

Xiaozhi,

588
00:33:01,224 --> 00:33:02,305
I promised you before

589
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:04,264
to let you play basketball
in the system.

590
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,664
But the technology
might not be mature enough right now.

591
00:33:07,664 --> 00:33:09,376
I don't want to play basketball anymore.

592
00:33:11,224 --> 00:33:11,905
Sister,

593
00:33:12,264 --> 00:33:14,504
do you remember Li Yangyang,
who was discharged earlier?

594
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:16,305
She just told me

595
00:33:16,545 --> 00:33:17,585
the novel she wrote

596
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:18,656
has been serialized.

597
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:19,944
From now on,

598
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:22,145
I, Fang Xiaozhi, also want to strive

599
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:23,905
and no longer rely on virtual things.

600
00:33:24,264 --> 00:33:25,305
I can't play basketball.

601
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,385
But I can still be a sports journalist.

602
00:33:28,224 --> 00:33:29,024
Fang Xiaozhi,

603
00:33:29,785 --> 00:33:31,345
do you know that your casual remarks

604
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:32,345
almost got me...

605
00:33:32,984 --> 00:33:33,504
Sister,

606
00:33:33,504 --> 00:33:34,184
listen to me.

607
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,585
Li Yangyang's brother is super handsome.

608
00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:38,224
Also,

609
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:40,224
he still doesn't have a girlfriend yet.

610
00:33:40,545 --> 00:33:41,216
I told her

611
00:33:41,216 --> 00:33:41,825
you're single too.

612
00:33:41,825 --> 00:33:43,184
Stop it, you brat.

613
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:45,105

00:33:47,585 --> 00:33:48,264
come in.

616
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,584

619
00:34:11,504 --> 00:34:13,745
