00:00:47,842 --> 00:00:48,672
=Live or Love?=

3
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:52,256
=Episode 9=

4
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:55,371
Young An,

5
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:56,512
Miss Fang,

6
00:00:57,011 --> 00:00:58,452
the customer causing trouble outside

7
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,572
has already been criticized
by the police.

8
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:01,852
And the onlookers

9
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,452
have also already dispersed.

10
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:09,091
I got it.

11
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,412
From tomorrow,

12
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:56,052
don't work at the supermarket
for the moment.

13
00:01:58,492 --> 00:01:59,212
Why?

14
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,612
That customer is
emotionally unstable now.

15
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:04,612
She'll probably cause
more trouble there.

16
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:06,412
You had a conflict with her today,

17
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:08,052
so it's better to avoid her now.

18
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:14,612
The purchase order is missing,

19
00:02:15,012 --> 00:02:17,012
but there is a copy at Yinxiang.

20
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:18,851
As long as we get the copy,

21
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:20,411
we can prove our innocence.

22
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:22,251
But now it's clear

23
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:23,571
that even if there is a copy,

24
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:24,651
they will not take it.

25
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,612
If they prove our goods are genuine,

26
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:28,851
it means admitting that
their own goods have problems.

27
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:34,971
Trust me,

28
00:02:35,452 --> 00:02:36,691
there will always be a way.

29
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:49,892
Hello, I'm looking for Yin Zhili.

30
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:51,772
You're Mr. An, right?

31
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:52,612
Ms. Yin

32
00:02:52,612 --> 00:02:53,892
is in the lounge downstairs.

33
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:54,932
She told me

34
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:55,691
you can come in

35
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:56,811
upon your arrival.

36
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:58,304
Please.

37
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:19,172
It's so late, yet he's still not home.

38
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:22,691
I actually want to check out

39
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:24,612
how you can manage
to deal with Yin Zhili.

40
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:26,400
Aotian.

41
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:27,492
What's up?

42
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:28,772
Is there any item

43
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:30,492
that would allow me

44
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:31,732
to see An Yushen now?

45
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:34,251
Please purchase the item

46
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:35,772
of Clairvoyance and Clairaudience.

47
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:36,971
Time limit is three minutes.

48
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:38,012
Five hundred points

49
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:39,052
will be deducted.

50
00:03:40,212 --> 00:03:41,172
That's so expensive.

51
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:44,864
I want it.

52
00:03:48,212 --> 00:03:48,772
You've come.

53
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:01,772
Yushen.

54
00:04:02,012 --> 00:04:02,932
What can I do for you?

55
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:04,531
Come and sit.

56
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:19,972
Yushen,

57
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,492
this is the women's clothing
managed by our family.

58
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:23,412
Does it look good?

59
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:25,891
No wonder it's so refined.

60
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:26,652
It turns out

61
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:30,532
that it

62
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:32,612
is managed by your family.

63
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:42,211
Yushen,

64
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,131
I want the women's clothing
managed by our family

65
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:46,451
to be featured in your store.

66
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:48,211
Are you interested?

67
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:51,211
You are keen on the idea.

68
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:52,571
Of course, I'm interested.

69
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:23,172
Wish us a pleasant cooperation,

70
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,211
and we'll be a perfect match.

71
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:34,811
Three,

72
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:35,331
two,

73
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:36,131
one.

74
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:37,811
The item fails.

75
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:42,932
He told me he was going to
handle something,

76
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,571
but he actually went to drink.

77
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:46,932
He didn't even spare a female NPC,

78
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:48,732
but he pretended to be thoughtful.

79
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:49,691
Pah!

80
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:51,520
Aotian,

81
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:52,532
extend for ten minutes.

82
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:54,571
Players

83
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,451
can only use an item once a day.

84
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:01,732
Could you please play

85
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:03,571
a light music for me?

86
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:32,691
Ms. Yin.

87
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:35,532
Ms. Yin?

88
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:39,852
A Li,

89
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,732
the purpose of my visit today

90
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:42,932
is to handle something urgent.

91
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:44,251
You should know

92
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:46,251
that a customer has complained

93
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:48,612
about buying fake
Yin products at Longxing.

94
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:50,052
But my wife said

95
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:51,932
all these goods were
sourced from Yinxiang.

96
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:55,052
You must have a record
of the purchase orders.

97
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:56,172
So, I think...

98
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:57,571
I know this matter.

99
00:06:57,932 --> 00:06:59,211
Your concerns

100
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,571
are naturally my concerns as well.

101
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:02,052
Moreover,

102
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:04,092
this incident involves
Yinxiang's products.

103
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:05,932
I will not overlook it.

104
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:08,092
However,

105
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:10,932
what you need to look at is not
any purchase order,

106
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,011
but this.

107
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:27,371
This is the footage someone captured

108
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:28,891
that day.

109
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:32,172
Fang Lili exchanged a box
of Yin products,

110
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:34,371
and then someone's face got ruined.

111
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:35,532
I think

112
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:37,251
the reason in this

113
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:38,732
doesn't need to be explained.

114
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:41,052
(The video has been fully prepared.)

115
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:42,811
(Indeed, you came prepared.)

116
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:45,331
Ms. Yin,

117
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:48,292
this doesn't seem to prove anything.

118
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:49,251
In the warehouse,

119
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:50,292
moving goods

120
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,852
is normal.

121
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:54,532
Do you think

122
00:07:54,532 --> 00:07:56,891
the girl

123
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,691
with the ruined face and netizens

124
00:07:58,691 --> 00:07:59,972
will feel the same as you

125
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:01,451
after seeing this video?

126
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:02,331
Ms. Yin,

127
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:04,972
feel free to speak your mind.

128
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:07,972
Now,

129
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:10,412
only by releasing this video

130
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:12,612
can your supermarket be vindicated.

131
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:15,331
Your supermarket

132
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:17,691
and my products are without issues.

133
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:19,172
It's Fang Lili

134
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:20,652
who's playing tricks.

135
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,532
Are you suggesting

136
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:24,571
to frame Fang Lili for this?

137
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:28,972
Trust me.

138
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:30,211
Fang Lili

139
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:32,811
is just a wrong interlude in your life,

140
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:35,132
and we are the right ones
for each other.

141
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:37,252
Don't you want the
inheritance rights of Ju'an?

142
00:08:37,252 --> 00:08:38,451
I can help you.

143
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,052
It will be much easier this way.

144
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:52,772
Could you possibly

145
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:54,491
still be reluctant
to let go of Fang Lili?

146
00:08:57,932 --> 00:08:59,091
How could I?

147
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:00,532
You're right.

148
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:03,052
We are the right ones for each other.

149
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,211
Now that you've agreed,

150
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,012
I'll post the video online today.

151
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:08,892
Don't post it.

152
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:10,691
I'm afraid once the news comes out,

153
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:12,412
Fang Lili might do
something uncontrollable.

154
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:13,172
That would be bad.

155
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:15,052
So, Yushen,

156
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:16,091
what should we do?

157
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:17,571
How about this?

158
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,652
I'll talk to her privately.

159
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:21,132
That's fine.

160
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:22,851
If she knows what's good for her,

161
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:24,971
you will give her money
to make her divorce you.

162
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:26,132
Oh,

163
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:27,971
give me a key to your house,

164
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:29,892
so it'll be convenient
for me to see you.

165
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:31,211
Sure.

166
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:31,971
Here you go.

167
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:34,451
You wouldn't

168
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:36,012
be planning to ambush me, would you?

169
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:39,292
(Fang Li,)

170
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:40,211
(to save you,)

171
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,571
(I've sacrificed so much.)

172
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:00,384
(Young An)

173
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:08,224
(Luo Yan)

174
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:14,592
Hello?

175
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:15,412
It's me,

176
00:10:15,652 --> 00:10:16,252
Luo Yan.

177
00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:19,532
About the counterfeit skincare products,

178
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:20,451
I've heard about it.

179
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,851
I don't care what methods you use,

180
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:25,652
just get through this crisis.

181
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:27,292
Do I still need to help An Yushen?

182
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:29,091
Can I stop helping him?

183
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:30,932
I'll say it again.

184
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:31,892
Pigs should be

185
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,772
fattened before slaughter.

186
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:35,132
Do as I say.

187
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:40,292
Aotian.

188
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:41,652
I am here.

189
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:42,412
Play that song

190
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:43,611
again.

191
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:08,811
(You finally know to come back.)

192
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:10,811
(Why not just sleep at the Yin's place?)

193
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:14,451
(I've been working from dawn till dusk
to save your supermarket.)

194
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:15,691
(You were dissipated,)

195
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:16,731
(and went back to sleep.)

196
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:30,731
Bad demeanor.

197
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:48,451
You didn't even tuck me in.

198
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:51,052
Yesterday, to save you,

199
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:54,652
I didn't lose out
after a battle of wits and bravery.

200
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:57,611
Where did you run off to
without making a sound?

201
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:11,008
(Yin Zhili)

202
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:13,652
Hello?

203
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:14,571
Hello?

204
00:12:15,252 --> 00:12:16,252
Yushen,

205
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,292
shall we have brunch together?

206
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:19,451
Okay,

207
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:20,491
I'll go right now.

208
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:36,851
Wang Sheng,

209
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:38,012
are you busy?

210
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:39,584
Miss Fang,

211
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,252
why come here by yourself?

212
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:43,012
Didn't you go home to rest?

213
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:45,372
There was a problem
with Yin product sourcing.

214
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:47,851
I suspect someone has
switched them here.

215
00:12:48,211 --> 00:12:50,331
I came to see if I could
find any more clues.

216
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:52,172
Miss Fang,

217
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:54,292
the warehouse can't be blamed for it.

218
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:55,372
Besides,

219
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:56,851
you always come for spot checks,

220
00:12:56,851 --> 00:12:58,012
so who would have the nerve?

221
00:12:58,331 --> 00:12:58,892
Miss Fang,

222
00:12:58,892 --> 00:12:59,652
if there's nothing,

223
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:00,772
I'll go to work.

224
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:14,932
You followed me?

225
00:13:15,372 --> 00:13:17,372
I just did a background check on you.

226
00:13:18,372 --> 00:13:18,932
This powder

227
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,372
was found in your locker.

228
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:23,012
It matches the substance
in the face cream.

229
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:25,292
Don't frame me.

230
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:27,292
I think it's you who

231
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:28,372
make ill-gotten money

232
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:29,211
and involve me in it.

233
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:30,372
You're too malicious.

234
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,372
You owed a huge gambling debt before,

235
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:34,731
but you repaid it yesterday.

236
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,052
How did you get the money?

237
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:38,851
Did Ms. Yin reward you?

238
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:41,331
Malicious framing

239
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:42,811
is punishable by law.

240
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:45,952
Miss Fang,

241
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:47,091
I admit it.

242
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:48,331
Give me a chance.

243
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:49,491
Spare me, Miss Fang.

244
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:52,451
I should have called the police

245
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:53,691
to prove our innocence.

246
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,851
But now I see your attitude is good,

247
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:57,691
so, do me a favor?

248
00:13:58,451 --> 00:13:58,971
Miss Fang,

249
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:00,652
I was forced into this.

250
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:01,971
If I testify on your behalf,

251
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:03,451
I will be unequivocal.

252
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:04,851
It's no use of your testifying.

253
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,091
What I want is

254
00:14:06,091 --> 00:14:06,971
direct proof that

255
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,691
Yin Zhili is the instigator

256
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:10,611
and make her never mess around again.

257
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:12,451
Okay, Miss Fang.

258
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,091
I'll do whatever you say.

259
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:15,091
I'll follow your lead.

260
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:16,372
Thank you,

261
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:17,211
Miss Fang.

262
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:19,292
(An Hang,)

263
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:22,172
(I'm working hard to save
your business here.)

264
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:24,372
(Yet you're out there
flirting with the NPC.)

265
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:29,132
(Fang Li.)

266
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:32,532
(I'm sacrificing my dignity
to save you.)

267
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,691
(You don't even call me all day.)

268
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:36,772
Yushen,

269
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:39,331
how are your chat with Fang Lili?

270
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:42,971
I was too busy yesterday.
I'll mention it today.

271
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:46,172
But

272
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:48,091
I can't wait any longer.

273
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:50,172
Why don't you move in today?

274
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,091
What's wrong?

275
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,611
What's that smell?

276
00:15:11,731 --> 00:15:13,611
I sprayed peach perfume today.

277
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:16,132
I'm allergic to peaches.

278
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:17,372
I'll get some fresh air.

279
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:19,811
Mrs. Liu,

280
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:21,652
give me allergy medicine.

281
00:15:32,851 --> 00:15:34,816
(Delete)

282
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:41,532
Miss Fang,

283
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:43,691
how can I help you?

284
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,491
You just need to sit inside

285
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:47,532
within a hundred meters of me.

286
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:55,412
Hello.

287
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,132
Mr. Wang,

288
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:01,491
why have you come today?

289
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,091
I'm here to see Yin Zhili.

290
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:10,932
Ms. Yin is in the backyard.

291
00:16:10,932 --> 00:16:11,971
I'll take you there.

292
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,052
You've purchased an item,

293
00:16:13,211 --> 00:16:14,412
Character Mask.

294
00:16:14,412 --> 00:16:16,132
500 points were deducted.

295
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:20,772
Please.

296
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:32,252
Wang Sheng,

297
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:33,892
I told you not to come.

298
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:34,691
What's the matter?

299
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:35,331
Ms. Yin,

300
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:37,292
they seem to suspect me.

301
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,731
Don't admit it.

302
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:40,571
What scares you?

303
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:41,971
Don't come here anymore.

304
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:42,611
Understand?

305
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,532
The money wasn't enough.

306
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:48,252
What did you say?

307
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:49,811
Add another million,

308
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:52,052
or I would expose everything.

309
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:54,331
Wang Sheng,

310
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,052
you must check out

311
00:16:56,372 --> 00:16:58,331
what you can do to me

312
00:16:58,331 --> 00:16:59,731
if I don't admit to it.

313
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:01,211
Moreover,

314
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:03,331
footage taken via private intrusion

315
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:04,771
seems not to be

316
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:06,251
legally as evidence, right?

317
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:10,251
The law may spare you,

318
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:11,892
but I can release it online.

319
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,932
Do you still want to run your business?

320
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:17,451
If you upload the video online,

321
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:18,731
it just shows

322
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:20,612
that you're trespassing
into my residence.

323
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:22,011
If you dare to release it,

324
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:23,372
I will immediately sue you,

325
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:25,372
and you will end up in jail.

326
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:26,291
Sue me?

327
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:27,691
If you sue me,

328
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:28,771
don't back out on it.

329
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,211
From today on,

330
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:31,291
I go to jail,

331
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:32,932
and you'll be discredited.

332
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:34,852
We'll both be ruined.

333
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:37,332
Wang Sheng,

334
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,451
have you gone mad today?

335
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:40,892
In dealing with a madman,

336
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:42,332
I'm just following suit.

337
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:43,251
Wang Sheng.

338
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:49,451
Yushen,

339
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:50,771
he bullied me.

340
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:51,572
Okay,

341
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:52,812
I'll discipline him.

342
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:58,852
I found on her phone

343
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:00,612
the transfer records

344
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,172
which she made to you.

345
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:03,572
Do you want to explain this?

346
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:08,132
Just now,

347
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:10,812
you deliberately stole my phone.

348
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:12,491
I picked it up accidentally,

349
00:18:12,771 --> 00:18:13,691
not stealing.

350
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:14,932
Oh,

351
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:18,332
the video you planned to frame my wife

352
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:19,771
was deleted accidentally.

353
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:23,612
(It turns out that
she'll plan to frame me.)

354
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:24,852
An Yushen,

355
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:26,332
you're fooling me.

356
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:34,812
I have also recorded a video here.

357
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:37,172
The key was given to me by you.

358
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:39,451
It wasn't filmed by
breaking into a private residence.

359
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:40,612
So, everything

360
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:41,852
has legal effect.

361
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:43,691
Considering Ms. Yin's

362
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,251
help for the supermarket,

363
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:47,491
I want you to issue a statement

364
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,251
to clarify the supermarket
is not to blame

365
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:51,731
and to compensate
the victimized customer.

366
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,211
An Yushen,

367
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,892
do you really have to go this far?

368
00:18:57,372 --> 00:18:58,172
Ms. Yin,

369
00:18:58,892 --> 00:18:59,932
thanks for your affection.

370
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:01,932
Indeed, I did deceive you yesterday.

371
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:03,852
As you can see,

372
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:05,172
I am

373
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:06,731
no gentleman.

374
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:08,932
You will definitely find someone

375
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:10,211
who is more suitable for you.

376
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:11,332
I'll leave first.

377
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:31,251
Be compliant,

378
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:31,852
Wang Sheng.

379
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:33,291
Let's have something.

380
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:43,852
You promised to have dinner,

381
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:45,332
yet we are in the supermarket.

382
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:46,852
That's really something.

383
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,372
Having a private two-person event
at our supermarket.

384
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:50,572
Isn't this sincere enough?

385
00:19:52,332 --> 00:19:54,172
Who abandoned the intercom?

386
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:55,932
Alright,

387
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:56,932
just bring it back later.

388
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,572
Have you ever watched a horror movie

389
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:04,172
where the leads have a date
in a supermarket at midnight?

390
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:04,892
As a result...

391
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:05,531
Wait a second,

392
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:07,691
let's not talk about that.

393
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:09,051
Are you scared?

394
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:10,652
Not at all.

395
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,691
You're surprisingly timid.

396
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:20,172
Who said that?

397
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:22,531
This is just a subconscious reaction.

398
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:24,491
Oh,

399
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,852
do you drink yogurt?

400
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:26,412
I'll get some.

401
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:28,612
It's for you.

402
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:55,652
System notification.

403
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:57,332
Fang Li, please come to
the cash register

404
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:58,412
upon hearing this.

405
00:20:58,412 --> 00:20:59,852
Your family is waiting for you.

406
00:20:59,852 --> 00:21:00,491
Over.

407
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:05,691
Please find Fang Li on your own.

408
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:06,731
If you can't find her,

409
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:08,172
buy items for her next time.

410
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:08,852
Over.

411
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:11,412
Let's do it this way.

412
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:12,731
To ensure fairness,

413
00:21:12,932 --> 00:21:14,531
if I find you first,

414
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:15,691
you'll buy me items.

415
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:16,652
Over.

416
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,612
I agree.

417
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:19,232
Over.

418
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:38,771
Tell me

419
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:40,812
what you did with Yin Zhili yesterday.

420
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:42,092
Answer me in three seconds.

421
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:44,812
What can I do?

422
00:21:44,812 --> 00:21:46,652
If I hadn't sprayed

423
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,612
perfume that could make her allergic,

424
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:50,731
I could have lost virginity.

425
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,412
I did it all to save you.

426
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,332
You are poking fun at me, right?

427
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:56,011
It's because you didn't tell me.

428
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:57,731
I was forced into urgency

429
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:59,251
to save the supermarket.

430
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:02,491
I didn't tell you because I was afraid

431
00:22:02,491 --> 00:22:03,612
you went to the Yin's place

432
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:04,771
without any consideration.

433
00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:08,572
Why are you so worried

434
00:22:08,852 --> 00:22:09,892
about my supermarket?

435
00:22:53,932 --> 00:22:56,332
(I hope that I can leave with An Hang.)

Next time, you'll buy items.

445
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:37,491
Let's go.

446
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:47,051
(She did it on purpose.)

447
00:23:47,612 --> 00:23:48,812
(She likes me.)

448
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:04,932
How did you drink so much?

449
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,092
For An Yushen,

450
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:06,852
is it worth it?

451
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:09,211
Don't worry about me.

452
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:11,332
Other than spending money
on keeping a man,

453
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,572
what else can you do?

454
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,000
(Dad)

455
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:18,412
Hello.

456
00:24:18,932 --> 00:24:19,771
Yin Zhili,

457
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:21,372
for a man,

458
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:22,291
you demeaned yourself

459
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:24,011
and tarnished Yin's reputation.

460
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:25,760
Are you out of your mind?

461
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,771
Tomorrow go abroad and keep away

462
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:29,172
from the An family.

463
00:24:29,731 --> 00:24:30,812
What a disgrace.

464
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:34,412
Why are you scolding her?

465
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:36,531
Have you cared for us
since we were little?

466
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:37,971
You only care about making money.

467
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:39,092
My sister has achieved this.

468
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:40,332
Have you ever praised her once?

469
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:41,572
You can't scold her.

470
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:42,932
Shut up.

471
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:44,491
You're useless.

472
00:24:45,172 --> 00:24:45,691
Right.

473
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:47,051
I am useless.

474
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:49,011
But my sister is the best in the world.

475
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:54,132
Luo.

476
00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:56,132
Let's go home.

477
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:12,932
Yin Zhili has clarified

478
00:25:13,932 --> 00:25:15,211
Longxing should not be blamed.

479
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:18,291
That's right.

480
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,211
Your plan

481
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,372
can finally be wrapped up.

482
00:25:24,372 --> 00:25:25,372
I didn't expect that

483
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:27,092
Fang Lili is so capable now.

484
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:30,612
I'm a bit curious about her.

485
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:03,971
Am I sleepwalking?

486
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:08,612
Did I sleep on the sofa last night?

487
00:26:12,652 --> 00:26:14,771
The bed is too soft,
and the sofa is comfortable.

488
00:26:14,771 --> 00:26:16,531
You should sleep in the bed from now on.

489
00:26:28,132 --> 00:26:29,092
Shy again?

490
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:30,412
Cute.

491
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:40,640
Morning.

492
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:41,600
Morning.

493
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:50,092
You...

494
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:53,812
Don't get me wrong.
I made too much.

495
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:55,712
To avoid waste, I'll share a bit.

496
00:26:57,092 --> 00:26:58,251
A bit?

497
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,251
I haven't cooked for a long time.

498
00:27:06,812 --> 00:27:07,491
An Hang.

499
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:11,011
I want to emphasize again.

500
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:12,932
According to our contract,

501
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,451
we are just fake married couple.

502
00:27:14,852 --> 00:27:16,412
We'll sever ties when exiting the game.

503
00:27:16,412 --> 00:27:17,332
Do you understand?

504
00:27:18,491 --> 00:27:19,251
(Originally,)

505
00:27:19,491 --> 00:27:22,332
(she is worried that
our relationship has no guarantee)

506
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,572
(and wants my statement.)

507
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:26,691
Lili.

508
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:27,251
Stop.

509
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:30,812
When there are no NPCs around,

510
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:32,612
please call me Miss Fang.

511
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,652
I'll go to the company.

512
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:40,691
Luo.

513
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:43,051
What's wrong?

514
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:43,971
Don't cry for now.

515
00:28:01,172 --> 00:28:02,612
I discovered it in the photo album,

516
00:28:02,612 --> 00:28:04,251
which was written by original Yushen.

517
00:28:11,572 --> 00:28:12,372
Do you give in?

518
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:14,291
Was it your idea to come?

519
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:26,109
Why are you here?

520
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,840
Your sister called me while crying
and said you would go abroad.

521
00:28:30,652 --> 00:28:33,011
So, are you here to laugh at me?

522
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:34,892
It's not that bad.

523
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:38,612
To me, except these foolish things
you've done recently,

524
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:40,372
you've always been a decent opponent.

525
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:43,011
I don't need your approval.

526
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:45,491
Of course, everything you do

527
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:47,251
should not please others,

528
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:49,451
including me.

529
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:52,332
I'm not interested in
giving advice on your life.

530
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,852
As the saying goes,

531
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,051
those who tend to

532
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:57,731
listen to others' suggestions

533
00:28:58,211 --> 00:28:59,372
aren't the most intelligent.

534
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:02,731
Entrusted by someone,

535
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:03,652
I give this to you.

536
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:12,372
(Actually, A Li is very excellent.)

537
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:14,011
(But some people don't understand.)

538
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:16,051
(We will always be friends.)

539
00:29:17,412 --> 00:29:18,652
This seems to be a photo

540
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:19,892
of you and my husband.

541
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:22,172
It's improper to keep it in my bedroom,

542
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:23,491
so, I return it to you.

543
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:27,251
Why didn't An Yushen

544
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:28,572
give it to me personally?

545
00:29:28,812 --> 00:29:30,011
You'd better not dwell on him.

546
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:31,612
Take good care of yourself instead.

547
00:29:32,572 --> 00:29:34,172
Hurry up, you'll miss the plane.

548
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:38,251
Have a safe trip.

549
00:29:41,172 --> 00:29:42,092
Fang Lili,

550
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,531
you're quite an interesting person.

551
00:30:10,652 --> 00:30:11,731
Thank you, Miss Fang.

552
00:30:12,092 --> 00:30:13,372
Do you see a movie tonight?

553
00:30:13,572 --> 00:30:14,572
Are there movies here?

554
00:30:14,652 --> 00:30:15,531
A play within a play.

555
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:17,412
What movies?

556
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:18,291
Read some out to me.

557
00:30:19,172 --> 00:30:19,731
Let me check.

559
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:32,372
