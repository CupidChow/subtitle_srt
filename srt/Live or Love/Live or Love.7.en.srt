00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:47,842
=Live or Love?=

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,755
=Live or Love?=

3
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:52,032
=Episode 7=

4
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,149
Since when do you have a sister
named Yin Zhili?

5
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:13,070
Honey,

6
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,589
did you lose your memory?

7
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:15,910
She's your childhood friend.

8
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,309
She went abroad later on.

9
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,589
Then why does she call An Yushen

10
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:21,949
"Yushen"?

11
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:24,350
She's secretly in love with him.

12
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,630
She loves him secretly?

13
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,029
Love me secretly?

14
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,070
You only told me that she would help me,

15
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:31,869
never mentioned the emotional plot.

16
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:33,630
(Plot twists)

17
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,149
(will be unlocked by players.)

18
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,312
Well...

19
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,350
Why does she like me secretly?

20
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:41,550
What's our character backstory?

21
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:44,509
No one dared to play with her
since she was young.

22
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,589
As for An Yushen,

23
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:46,910
no one wanted to play with him.

24
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,789
So they played together.

25
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,309
Later, she swore to marry no one
but An Yushen.

26
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,630
After she went abroad,

27
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,309
I guess the two of them lost contact.

28
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,309
Why didn't anyone dare

29
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:57,910
to play with her as a child?

30
00:01:58,589 --> 00:01:59,470
(Yin Zhili.)

31
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:00,669
(Hot-tempered,)

32
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:01,710
(wayward,)

33
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,350
(with mild personality disorder)

34
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,750
(and manic depression.)

35
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,990
(At age eight,)

36
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,149
(she fought fiercely)

37
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:08,070
(with her sister)

38
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,350
(Yin Zhiluo,)

39
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,750
(causing her arm breaking on the spot)

40
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,350
(and staying hospital for three months.)

41
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,949
An eight-year-old child,

42
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:17,430
broke your arm into hospital,

43
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,910
and even needed eight stitches.

44
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,030
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

45
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:23,949
Forget it. It's partially my fault.

46
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,509
At a young age, a fortune-teller said

47
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:27,470
I was destined to bring ruin

48
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,590
while my sister would be
the hope of our family.

49
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,870
Since then, my dad started pushing her.

50
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,109
However, he pushed her so hard

51
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:34,150
that she couldn't stand.

52
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:36,669
Her personality becomes
more and more stubborn.

53
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,190
My task doesn't include getting her,
right?

54
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:41,549
But An Yushen

55
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,870
doesn't like her, right?

56
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,190
A romantic storyline is troublesome.

57
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,789
Right now, I'm seeking stability.

58
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,669
A wise man does not fall in love.

59
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,829
As the saying goes,
a wise man does not fall in love.

60
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,109
You try to persuade our sister,

61
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:56,350
not to waste her future
on a married man.

62
00:02:58,509 --> 00:02:59,590
Does it matter

63
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:01,310
that much to you?

64
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:03,430
When I tipped you off this morning,

65
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,269
you say you didn't like An Yushen.

66
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,709
True.

67
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:10,310
But we've got married.

68
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:11,709
I don't want any trouble.

69
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,430
Really?

70
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,669
Mrs. Yin.

71
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:20,190
Madam.

72
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,789
Dinner is ready downstairs.

73
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:22,949
Young An invited you down.

74
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,989
How long have you been there?

75
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,109
I have to go.

76
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,669
When did you change your clothes?

77
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,070
Aren't you cold?

78
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:00,910
Today's family meal,

79
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,630
firstly,

80
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,310
to celebrate Xiaoli's

81
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,310
long-term cooperation

82
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,350
with Longxing.

83
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,669
Secondly, it's

84
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,229
to welcome her back China.

85
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,310
Feel free to visit us more often.

86
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:25,269
Actually, besides supplying goods,

87
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:27,550
I also want to discuss
a deeper collaboration.

88
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:30,469
If the cosmetics brand I manage abroad

89
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:32,269
could enter your stores,

90
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:33,509
I believe,

91
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,909
for both of our companies,

92
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,070
it would be beneficial.

93
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,509
That's great.

94
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:39,949
If Miss Yin is interested
in collaborating,

95
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,149
I will upgrade Longxing

96
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,469
to cater more

97
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:44,230
to high-end consumers.

98
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,750
Yushen,

99
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,509
why call me Miss Yin again?

100
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,509
Don't just talk.

101
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:58,310
Have some dessert.

102
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,790
I'm cutting out sugar.
Please move it away.

103
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,670
Xiaoli

104
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,149
liked following Yushen since young.

105
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,110
But now you've all grown up.

106
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,870
In the blink of an eye,
Yushen is already married.

107
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,550
This is Lili.

108
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,630
You've met, right?

109
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,750
She is now the daughter-in-law
of our An family.

110
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,389
Thank you, Miss Yin,
for your timely help.

111
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,750
I toast to you.

112
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:30,990
Miss Fang.

113
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,430
What month is it now?

114
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,230
Why do you dress like in summer?

115
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:40,949
Women doesn't dress
according to the season.

116
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,990
Miss Yin's summer dress
is also very beautiful.

117
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:51,110
Sorry.

118
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:52,589
I've just returned.

119
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:53,870
Don't notice the weather.

120
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,589
The humidity in Jincheng is so heavy.

121
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,870
Be careful of shoulder inflammation.

122
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:03,990
That's true.

123
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,509
If I fall ill,

124
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,870
I'd have to trouble Yushen
to take care of me.

125
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,630
Lili.

126
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,389
Shall I get you a coat?

127
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:21,670
Sure.

128
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,670
Miss Fang.

129
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,750
You've used this trick

130
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,630
on Luo Yan before, haven't you?

131
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:54,269
Have some dessert.

132
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:54,990
This is delicious.

133
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:58,990
I've said,

134
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,990
I'm cutting out sugar.

135
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,430
I'm full, I'll go first.

136
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,509
(What is her personality set?)

137
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,630
(Easy to invite, hard to get rid of.)

138
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,990
(That's what's happening now.)

139
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,110
To be honest,

140
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,469
is Yin Zhili prettier or am I?

141
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,670
I'm asking you, Aotian.

142
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,029
(I am just an artificial intelligence.)

143
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,790
(I haven't offended anyone.)

144
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:53,389
It must be me.

145
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,110
He must like someone like me.

146
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:40,589
Fang Li!

147
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:43,264
Fang Li!

148
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,949
(Part 3 Primary Data Analysis)
After the resent adjustments,

149
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,190
our first goal

150
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,670
of stop losing money has been achieved.

151
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,749
With Qixi Festival approaching,

152
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:00,270
we will take this opportunity

153
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,829
to host an ultra-low discount
shopping festival

154
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:03,989
to attract consumers.

155
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,910
On that day, we aim

156
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,030
to achieve a 60 percent
increase in sales.

157
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:09,989
Great.

158
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:12,589
In just over ten days, Young An

159
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,709
has resolved the mall's chronic issues.

160
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:15,869
I believe

161
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:17,109
the event will be a success.

162
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,030
Sixty percent?

163
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,869
The best-performing store
under An's brand

164
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,749
only saw a 30 percent increase

165
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:26,270
this New Year's Day.

166
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,550
You lack management experience.

167
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,869
Don't talk nonsense.

168
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:32,869
Mr. Guo,

169
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,109
young people having ideas
is a good thing.

170
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,390
The young calf is not afraid of tigers.

171
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:38,869
Just for this,

172
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,749
we should give him a thumb-up.

173
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:43,510
However, Young An,

174
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,150
your approach

175
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:46,949
has been tried before

176
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,510
with little success.

177
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,629
Nowadays,
there are so many shopping festivals.

178
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,589
There's no innovation
to excite customers.

179
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,749
Mr. An,

180
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,190
what do you think?

181
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:01,469
Lack of innovation

182
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,869
can be resolved with innovation.

183
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:07,109
From a logical
and commercial perspective,

184
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,109
this event is worth a try.

185
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,829
Approve it.

186
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:13,749
Yes.

187
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,150
Young An.

188
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,550
For the Qixi Festival event,
I will prepare a proposal first.

189
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:41,790
Hello, Miss Yin?

190
00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:43,749
Alright.

191
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:44,749
Then see you later.

192
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,390
Let's meet at the Yinxiang Mall.

193
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:51,989
No need.

194
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,109
I'll go find Yin Zhili.

195
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:53,910
Prepare the car.

196
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:54,749
Alright.

197
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:55,390
Wait.

198
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,390
I'll go by myself.

199
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,030
You go to Longxing
finalizing the audit report.

200
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,150
By the way,

201
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,829
me meeting Yin Zhili,

202
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,390
don't tell Fang Lili about it.

203
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,469
Young An.

204
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:11,869
Forgive my bluntness.

205
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:13,749
Honesty is crucial in a marriage.

206
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:14,869
Miss Yin is just...

207
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:16,989
Follow my lead.

208
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,150
Okay.

209
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,310
(She hasn't figured out her task.)

210
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:25,469
(My matters...)

211
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:26,749
(She'd better stay away.)

212
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:49,550
Hello, Feng.

213
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:50,869
How's everything going?

214
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,469
Tired, right?

215
00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:53,749
I've made desserts.

216
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:55,270
I bring them to Longxing, huh?

217
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:56,390
Madam,

218
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,629
don't bother.

219
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,910
Young An...

220
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:00,869
He

221
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:03,310
went to the company for a meeting.

222
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,589
The company?

223
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,749
Grandma said he went there this morning.

224
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:11,670
Really, I'm telling the truth.

225
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,629
Okay.

226
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:15,510
Then I'll call him to confirm.

227
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,229
Madam,

228
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,749
he went to Yinxiang Mall
to meet Mrs. Yin.

229
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,550
Yin Zhili?

230
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:25,589
It's okay.

231
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,030
It has nothing to do with me.

232
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:29,910
I don't care.

233
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,109
Yushen.

234
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:40,989
I think

235
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:43,150
our collaboration will definitely
be a great success.

236
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:46,430
Hello, miss.

237
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,510
Can I help you?

238
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,670
Using the Qixi Festival event

239
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,390
to bring our brand into Longxing

240
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,910
is a good choice.

241
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,150
This counter

242
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,629
features our in-house brand,

243
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:11,270
Yin.

244
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:13,390
It emphasizes
natural organic ingredients.

245
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:14,709
All scents

246
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,109
are crafted by French perfumers,

247
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:18,550
nourishing yet not greasy.

248
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:22,912
I squeezed out too much.

249
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,589
Yushen,

250
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,430
give it a try too.

251
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,869
I'll do it myself.

252
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,390
Why be so formal?

253
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,829
Miss?

254
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:32,510
Miss!

255
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,310
If you keep this up,

256
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,229
I'll call security.

257
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,109
When did you arrive?

258
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,709
Isn't this Miss Fang?

259
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,510
What brings you to our Yinxiang Mall?

260
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,910
I'm shopping.

261
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,070
A coincidence.

262
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,349
Hello, Mrs. Yin.

263
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:52,030
Here's the thing.

264
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,949
This lady has been

265
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:55,430
sneaking around the counter

266
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,310
for long.

267
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,749
I see.

268
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,670
Go ahead with your work.

269
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,070
It seems Miss Fang

270
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,790
didn't come here for shopping.

271
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,030
However,

272
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:09,270
I still want to recommend

273
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,349
our cosmetics to you.

274
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,709
After all,

275
00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:14,390
a woman without charm

276
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,150
cannot hold on to a man

277
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,629
just by spying.

278
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,349
You...

279
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,430
Lili.

280
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:27,589
You're late again.

281
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,550
I forgot to tell you.

282
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,829
The Qixi Festival shopping plan

283
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:36,829
is handled by Lili.

284
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,510
So, for details like product selection,

285
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,349
she wants to examine them personally.

286
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:43,910
Honey,

287
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:46,829
supporting your work
is what I should do.

288
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:49,869
The planning proposal

289
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:51,150
was made by Miss Fang?

290
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:55,270
No wonder it's so ordinary.

291
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,150
I think,

292
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,709
with Miss Fang's talent for squandering,

293
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,469
this collaboration

294
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:02,869
should be canceled now.

295
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,750
After all, a high-end brand like ours

296
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,030
never do causal discounts.

297
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,589
Please give me one day, Miss Yin.

298
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,589
I'll present

299
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,790
a plan that satisfies you.

300
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,510
Miss Yin, so capable a person,

301
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,510
you wouldn't let personal matters

302
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:20,189
affect business, right?

303
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:23,710
Alright.

304
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,629
Then, tomorrow,

305
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,070
I need your plan.

306
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,470
Why would I get upset

307
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,589
over him meeting Yin Zhili?

308
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,950
Even agreed
to plan the shopping festival.

309
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,750
It's not my task to help him.

310
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,070
But he just gave me a way out.

311
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:51,510
Does that mean...

312
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:56,470
What am I thinking?

313
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:24,629
Miss Fang, really impressive today.

314
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,470
Yin Zhili is just a code.

315
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,550
How could she compare to me
fighting in reality?

316
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:32,349
That's correct.

317
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:33,750
Eat a bit more.

318
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:43,629
(Wow.)

319
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:46,189
(So handsome.)

320
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:49,149
Not to your liking?

321
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,270
(Fang Lili,)

322
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,909
(stay calm.)

323
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:53,470
I'm not hungry.

324
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,149
You eat more.

325
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,070
Actually, I'm also full.

326
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,510
I'll be back to Longxing

327
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,550
to keep an eye on the auditing matters.

328
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:07,456
Where to?

329
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:09,349
I'm going back with you.

330
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:15,470
You can keep shopping here.

331
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,790
After all, I'm not sure if you plan

332
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,909
to take revenge on Ju'an.

333
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:20,510
Before that,

334
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,950
let's act separately.

335
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:22,990
Bye.

336
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:31,680
(Luo Yan)

337
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,592
Hello.

338
00:19:59,389 --> 00:19:59,909
Come in.

339
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:14,784
Take a seat.

340
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:18,589
Do you drink?

341
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:19,750
No need.

342
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,270
Thank you.

343
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:31,270
No need to be so on guard.

344
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:33,829
The one who should be afraid is me.

345
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,829
After all, you tried hard to

346
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:36,990
take me down before.

347
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:39,429
Mr. Luo.

348
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,710
You didn't call me here

349
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,189
for this nonsense?

350
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,710
You really have changed.

351
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,230
More interesting.

352
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,429
The little girl who passed me notes

353
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,109
was sent by you, right?

354
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,149
How did you know?

355
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:02,230
You wrote me love letters for ten years.

356
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,429
How could I not know your handwriting?

357
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:05,669
I see.

358
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:09,230
So,

359
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,030
you said you'd help me defeat An Yushen.

360
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,669
I believe it.

361
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:15,909
(Task: Approaching Luo Yan)
(You've completed the task,)

362
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:17,070
(approaching Luo Yan.)

363
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,629
(Reward: 1,000 points.)

364
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:19,149
Wow.

365
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,392
What's wrong?

366
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:27,470
Nothing.

367
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:31,030
I said that I would help you.

368
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,270
But you kept failing.

369
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,030
Given your ability,
I didn't trust you is normal.

370
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,429
But you're different now.

371
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:41,629
Let's cut to the chase.

372
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,030
In the shopping festival,

373
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:45,510
what do you want me to do?

374
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,030
I need you to keep assisting An Yushen.

375
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,030
Be a good helpmate

376
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:55,109
and help him to expand Longxing.

377
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,384
What?

378
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,510
Pigs need to be

379
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,750
fatten before slaughtering.

380
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:03,349
But we...

381
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:04,189
It's a directive.

382
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:06,149
No discussion.

383
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:35,750
Actually,

384
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,629
I don't really understand,

385
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:40,950
why you suddenly stopped
targeting An Yushen.

386
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,629
You know the situation of Longxing,
right?

387
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,790
Losing money for years,

388
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,149
can't even pay the salaries.

389
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,829
So, An Yushen mortgaged

390
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:55,869
the market land

391
00:22:56,829 --> 00:22:57,990
to get cash flow.

392
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:02,510
He didn't report such a big deal
to the group.

393
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:05,510
Dad hates stuff
overstep their authority.

394
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,389
If this ever gets out,

395
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,189
do you think dad will forgive him?

396
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,389
By then, the store

397
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:15,990
will be back to me.

398
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,070
Therefore,

399
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:21,030
on the Qixi Festival event,

400
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,829
we don't need to do anything, do we?

401
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,648
Right.

402
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,429
Let him do his job well.

403
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,829
The better he manages now,

404
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:31,389
the greater my profit will be.

405
00:23:33,189 --> 00:23:33,750
So,

406
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,149
can you take a rest on Qixi Festival?

407
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,750
I have other plans.

408
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:43,429
Moreover,

409
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,230
we'd better not meet frequently.

410
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,230
I understand.

411
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:03,990
(It's gotten dark.)

412
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,869
(She's not back.)

413
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,589
(No calls.)

414
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:07,629
(No replies to messages.)

415
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,950
(What is Fang Lili doing?)

416
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:12,109
(Could she get lost in the game?)

417
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:27,790
Young Master,

418
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,990
you've been here for long.

419
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,750
Waiting for Miss Fang?

420
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:32,990
No.

421
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,990
I'm admiring the moon.

422
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,429
Since this afternoon, Miss Fang

423
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:38,230
has locked herself in the study,

424
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,270
refusing distractions.

425
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,710
She's already back?

426
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,669
Are you writing a novel?

427
00:24:58,669 --> 00:24:59,470
So dedicated?

428
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:01,869
I'm working on the Qixi Festival plan.

429
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:07,829
I thought you just said it casually.

430
00:25:08,189 --> 00:25:09,510
Why so diligent?

431
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:11,869
(How should I put it?)

432
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,270
(It seems like
I'm helping Luo Yan help you.)

433
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,790
(It's a bit complicated.)

434
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:17,429
Don't work too hard.

435
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,669
Have some food.

436
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:26,669
Yin Zhili made it.

437
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:27,349
It's quite tasty.

438
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,230
You like her cooking?

439
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,230
Yes.

440
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,149
It's delicious.

441
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:37,510
Then you eat it all.

442
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,909
Take it away.

443
00:25:48,189 --> 00:25:48,829
Miss Fang,

444
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:50,349
you dislike Yin Zhili that much?

445
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:51,990
Is it because...

446
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,510
No.

447
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:54,109
She to me...

448
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:54,629
No.

449
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,589
She's my loyal partner.

450
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,310
You wanna revenge on Ju'an.

451
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:03,990
So,

452
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:05,829
my assistant is your enemy.

453
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:13,710
If you don't trust me, make it yourself.

454
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,589
Or, go find

455
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:17,230
your childhood assistant for help.

456
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:34,230
You wrote all these by yourself?

457
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,030
So diligent.

458
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,750
It's very likely a smoke bomb.

459
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:51,470
I...

460
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,829
I didn't say anything.

461
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:02,829
Okay, understood.

462
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:43,520
(Feng Zhixing)

463
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,030
Hello,

464
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,510
Young An.

465
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:48,990
Do I need to send your plan
to Miss Yin first?

466
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,912
No need.

467
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,510
Use Fang Lili's plan tomorrow.

468
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,310
It is better.

469
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,389
By the way, help me check

470
00:27:56,629 --> 00:27:58,310
if it will rain on Qixi.

471
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,669
Okay, one moment.

472
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,109
Yes.

473
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,109
There will be rain.

474
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,270
I see.

475
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,669
She really made great efforts.

476
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,189
Young Master.

477
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:16,829
Please,

478
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,710
prepare some snacks to Lili.

479
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,829
Besides,

480
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:20,790
it's been cold lately.

481
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:21,829
Get her a blanket.

482
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:23,149
Okay. Sir.

483
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,629
You are so kind to madam.

484
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:27,589
By the way, sir,

485
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:29,149
she made you a cake.

486
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,310
Really taking hours.

487
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,270
It's in the kitchen.

488
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,109
I see.

489
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:36,710
You can go.

490
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,270
Feng Zhixing?

491
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,510
Have a seat here.

492
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,389
Thank you.

493
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:43,869
Hey, boy.

494
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:46,510
Mrs. Yin?

495
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,990
What are you doing here?

496
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:49,909
Don't take the bus.

497
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:50,909
I'll drive you home.

498
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,510
No, it's not necessary.

499
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,429
Let's go.

500
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:57,790
Let's go.

501
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:02,750
Hurry up.

502
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,230
Where is your home?

503
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,070
I'll take you home.

504
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,829
Really don't need bothering.

505
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,070
Go ahead.

506
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,189
Not a big deal.

507
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:19,270
Afraid I'll memorize your address

508
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,270
and disturb you at night?

509
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,070
Mrs. Yin.

510
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,629
I have something to say.

511
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,070
Mrs. Yin.

512
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,869
I don't know why you

513
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:33,669
treat me like this.

514
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:36,470
Perhaps it's fun for you.

515
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:37,790
But,

516
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,349
it's caused me great trouble.

517
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:41,869
Trouble?

518
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,349
We're not the same kind of people.

519
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:48,109
I'm just an ordinary worker.

520
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:50,629
It's hard enough to make ends meet.

521
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,230
After work,

522
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:54,470
I just want to be alone.

523
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:57,470
I don't have the time to entertain you

524
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,950
for fun.

525
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,270
I'm sorry.

526
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,070
Let me explain.

527
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,550
I was just passing by.

528
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,790
I saw you helping the elderly,

529
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,990
so I offered to take you home.

530
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:10,429
If you find it offensive,

531
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:11,829
you can get off now.

532
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,070
I'll give you one second.

533
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,349
Time's up. Get out now.

534
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:46,550
(YIN Youth Edition
product stock estimate: 3,000 sets)

535
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,710
That's my proposal on sales.

536
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,629
I also prepared a little surprise.

537
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,710
Wait a minute.

538
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:53,310
That page.

539
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,270
Show me again.

540
00:31:57,629 --> 00:31:59,270
A stock quantity of 3,000 sets

541
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:00,070
is a bit low.

542
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:02,909
According to our market research,

543
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,310
within the supermarket's reach,

544
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,589
less than 20,000 young people
have purchasing power.

545
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,589
And only 2,000 are willing to
participate in the event.

546
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:12,109
Considering the 40 percent
of conversion rate,

547
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,669
3,000 sets

548
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:14,829
are certainly enough.

549
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:17,429
Miss Fang.

550
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:18,869
Isn't that too idealistic?

551
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:20,149
Does the market exactly

552
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,470
follow your mathematical mode?

553
00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:25,030
My data has never been wrong.

554
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,550
Miss Yin, you can rest assured.

555
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,750
Don't you forget

556
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:31,829
how you dragged down the Fang Group?

557
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:42,349
Yushen,

558
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,589
you've noticed

559
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:44,750
the problem, right?

560
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:45,909
Honey,

561
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,750
there's no problem, right?

562
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,710
Miss Yin's words make sense.

563
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,470
Lili lacks experience in this regard.

564
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,030
Miss Fang.

565
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,589
Learning to do business

566
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:07,310
is not that simple.

567
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,070
I lack experience?

568
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:10,829
All business proposals I've done

569
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:12,030
have never gone wrong.

570
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:13,629
