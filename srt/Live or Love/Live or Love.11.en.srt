(Longxing Supermarket Income and Expense Chart)
Below are the data

5
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:55,696
of Longxing over the past week.

6
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:56,577
Up to now,

7
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:59,137
Longxing has turned losses into profits.

8
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:00,416
Thank you, everyone.

9
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:03,577
Congratulations!

10
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:09,937
Yushen is truly displaying the demeanor

11
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,217
of Mr. An back in the business world.

12
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:14,697
I admit that Young An

13
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:16,096
has managed Longxing very well.

14
00:01:16,217 --> 00:01:17,217
But isn't there something

15
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,617
you haven't mentioned yet?

16
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,497
As far as I know,

17
00:01:25,697 --> 00:01:28,376
you privately used the supermarket
as collateral

18
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:30,096
to get cash flow.

19
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:31,176
What happened?

20
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,344
(Share Pledge)

21
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:36,617
He concealed this from the group.

22
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:38,697
It is a violation of regulations.

23
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:40,937
An Yushen.

24
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:43,137
You mortgaged company property
privately.

25
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:45,816
Do you even consider the group?

26
00:01:47,777 --> 00:01:48,417
Luo Yan.

27
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:50,217
You sit.

28
00:01:52,497 --> 00:01:53,857
The matter of mortgaging property

29
00:01:53,857 --> 00:01:55,217
for external financing

30
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:57,016
was done under my instruction.

31
00:01:57,857 --> 00:01:59,456
We want to paralyze our opponents

32
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:01,016
and make them think

33
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:03,736
Ju'an does not want to invest too much
in the supermarket

34
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:05,656
retail business.

35
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:12,656
Alright.

36
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:14,816
During this period,

37
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:17,177
Yushen has proven his capabilities.

38
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:18,656
I've always

39
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:19,777
been impartial.

40
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:22,376
The group will give Luo Yan and Yushen

41
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,536
300 million yuan in startup funds each.

42
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:26,696
Three months later,

43
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:30,217
the one who earns more profits
for the group

44
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:32,297
will be

45
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,256
the next CEO of Ju'an.

46
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,737
Today's real estate auction in Jincheng.

47
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:40,696
Yushen,

48
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:41,416
Luo Yan,

49
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:42,937
prepare for it well.

50
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:45,256
If nothing else,

51
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:46,897
meeting's over.

52
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,096
Mr. An,

53
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:51,096
I want to announce
a personnel appointment.

54
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:21,376
Let me introduce to everyone,

55
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:23,256
our newly appointed co-general manager

56
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,177
of Investment Department Two,

57
00:03:25,696 --> 00:03:26,576
Fang Lili.

58
00:03:34,387 --> 00:03:35,656
(Ju'an Group)

59
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:36,816
That needs to be confirmed.

60
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:37,497
Confirm it again.

61
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,737
This is not good.

62
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:51,217
Young An.

63
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:52,696
Blocking the general manager

64
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:54,096
of your competition department is

65
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:55,177
not appropriate, right?

66
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:56,217
Fang Lili.

67
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:58,217
I didn't expect you to be so ruthless.

68
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,816
What I do has nothing to do with you.

69
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:07,057
Fang Li.

70
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:08,536
From the day

71
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:10,177
we knew each other's identities,

72
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:12,576
you never wanted
to cooperate with me, right?

73
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:15,017
No need to dwell on the past.

74
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:16,857
Anything else?

75
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:19,057
Don't forget

76
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:20,297
that in the system,

77
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:21,537
we are still a couple now.

78
00:04:21,657 --> 00:04:22,696
Don't forget the divorce

79
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:24,456
is also allowed in the system.

80
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:26,417
You mean it?

81
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:27,256
Yes.

82
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:29,376
If you didn't hear it clearly,

83
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,016
I can say it ten more times.

84
00:04:32,657 --> 00:04:33,216
Okay.

85
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:40,896
Hello, Attorney Zhou.

86
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:43,417
Draft a divorce agreement for me
right now.

87
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,057
Right.

88
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:47,136
I want to divorce Fang Lili.

89
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:48,297
Do you understand?

90
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,657
At this afternoon's land auction,

91
00:04:59,737 --> 00:05:00,937
all the available plots

92
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:02,177
are here.

93
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:03,376
Young An.

94
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,376
At today's auction,

95
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:07,256
which plot of land
do you plan to acquire?

96
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,864
The former glass factory site.

97
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:11,696
It's the last undeveloped area
in city center. We must get it.

98
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:13,016
Favorable location.

99
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:14,097
Great transport links.

100
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:16,177
Only the former glass factory site

101
00:05:16,177 --> 00:05:17,497
can meet the standard, right?

102
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:19,216
Then I'll go prepare.

103
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:20,937
We must secure this land this afternoon.

104
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:22,816
What's the strategy of Mr. Luo?

105
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:25,016
Should we get some inside info
from madam?

106
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:27,537
Will you go easy on An Yushen?

107
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:31,016
After all, you are married now.

108
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:33,696
What madam?

109
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:35,097
There's no madam.

110
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:37,816
We're drafting a divorce agreement.

111
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:39,057
Appoint with Ms. Sun.

112
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:48,256
So annoying.

113
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:49,857
I have to redo the presentation slides.

114
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:50,937
Why?

115
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:52,456
I've redone it two or three times.

116
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:56,456
Do you know Fang Lili was
appointed to Mr. Luo's department today?

117
00:05:57,937 --> 00:05:59,497
She used to chase after Mr. Luo.

118
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:00,776
Though being married now,

119
00:06:01,256 --> 00:06:02,497
she still managed to get

120
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:03,776
herself close to Mr. Luo.

121
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:05,537
When one can take things easy,

122
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:07,256
(Execution, Competitive edge)
her career path

123
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:08,497
can be really smooth.

124
00:06:08,857 --> 00:06:10,937
But why would Mr. Luo agree?

125
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:13,297
He used to avoid seeing her.

126
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:15,537
But now he keeps her by his side.

127
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:17,537
Missing her after losing her.

128
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:48,497
What's wrong with you?

129
00:06:51,097 --> 00:06:52,016
Nothing.

130
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:55,696
I really have no relation with her.

131
00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:58,657
Hello, Mr. Luo.

132
00:06:58,977 --> 00:07:00,376
I made the pizza.

133
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:01,417
I brought it for everyone.

134
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:02,177
Here.

135
00:07:02,177 --> 00:07:02,857
Have a piece.

136
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:03,896
Thank you.

137
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:11,216
What are you angry about?

138
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:12,737
I'm not angry.

139
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:14,256
Mr. Luo.

140
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:16,016
There you are.

141
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:18,016
Do you have time this afternoon?

142
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:19,937
The legal department wants
a meeting with you.

143
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:22,497
Any time after 3 PM is fine.

144
00:07:22,657 --> 00:07:24,097
After 3 PM.

145
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:24,937
Secretary Lin,

146
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:27,417
have something to eat.

147
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:29,816
No.

148
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:30,456
Thanks.

149
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:33,057
It was made

150
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:34,097
by Chen.

151
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:35,256
It tastes good.

152
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,297
Chen made it?

153
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:38,537
Such great cooking skills!

154
00:07:45,977 --> 00:07:46,497
Well,

155
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:47,177
Mr. Luo.

156
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:48,216
Stop eating.

157
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:51,417
I'll make an appointment.

158
00:08:03,177 --> 00:08:03,816
So,

159
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:06,016
what exactly are you angry about?

160
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:10,537
I'm not angry.

161
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:12,776
I just want you to know

162
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:14,376
I care about you.

163
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:24,376
I have something to tell you.

164
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:25,816
Mr. Luo.

165
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,617
An Yushen just went to meet Ms. Sun.

166
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,097
As you know,

167
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:32,736
Ms. Sun always supports Madam An.

168
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:35,856
If she fully supports An Yushen today,

169
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:37,576
I'm worried that the auction...

170
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:38,816
Ms. Sun has been supporting

171
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:40,017
An Yushen for long.

172
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,696
It still didn't work before.

173
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:44,257
Just keep raising the price.

174
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:46,257
Even if he wins it in the end,

175
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:48,057
it will drain his funds.

176
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:49,696
But...

177
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,297
Alright.

178
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,856
You attend it this afternoon.

179
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,816
Fang Lili and An Yushen
haven't divorced yet.

180
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,177
Some things can't be entrusted to her.

181
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:10,017
Young An.

182
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,736
(The Second Basement Floor)
Ms. Sun told you to be assured.

183
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:13,496
She will back you up for funds.

184
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,057
Thanks for her support.

185
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:16,864
For Luo Yan's team, who will attend?

186
00:09:17,576 --> 00:09:18,177
Young An.

187
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:19,417
You go ahead.

188
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:20,696
See you at the auction.

189
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:39,177
No incidents, right?

190
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:41,096
Don't worry.

191
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:42,177
Nothing serious

192
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:43,137
will happen.

193
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:53,057
Young An.

194
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:54,177
It seems

195
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:56,576
Shi Yu will join in the auction.

196
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:00,512
Well, they didn't send Fang Lili.

197
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:01,976
She has worked on it for so long.

198
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,496
Luo Yan still doesn't trust her.

199
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:04,937
Young An.

200
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:07,017
I have a question.

201
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:07,937
I don't know

202
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:09,336
if I can ask.

203
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,096
What happened between you and madam?

204
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:13,216
No madam.

205
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:22,496
What's up?

206
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:23,736
Young An.

207
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:25,696
The brake...

208
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:26,377
The brake

209
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:27,537
seems to have failed!

210
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:53,696
Why sent Shi Yu?

211
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:54,616
You don't trust me?

212
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:59,096
Shi Yu has Yufeng Real Estate.

213
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,017
Isn't it proper to let him attend?

214
00:11:02,257 --> 00:11:02,816
Mr. Luo,

215
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:03,576
Young An...

216
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:06,257
It's fine.

217
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:07,232
Go ahead.

218
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:08,496
Young An

219
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:09,856
had a car accident

220
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:10,736
on the way to auction.

221
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:19,616
Shi Yu, have you gone mad?

222
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:21,657
I told you to bid for the land!

223
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,336
I told you to bid for the land,

224
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:27,657
not to splash paint on An Yushen's car!

225
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:31,897
Listen.

226
00:11:32,216 --> 00:11:33,657
If it really costs a death,

227
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:34,976
I can't protect you!

228
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:39,616
It was not your plan?

229
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:45,216
I got it.

230
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:04,537
Wait for me!

231
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:08,976
Hello.

232
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:10,057
The patient needs to rest.

233
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:10,856
Please...

234
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,017
I am his wife.

235
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:41,816
Looking for Feng?

236
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:43,257
He...

237
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:44,537
What happened to him?

238
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:45,777
He's not injured.

239
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:46,897
Just fainted.

240
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:48,937
It freaked us out.

241
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:50,377
Are you okay?

242
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:52,856
Nothing serious.

243
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,177
Are you here to confirm
or to express sympathy?

244
00:12:58,976 --> 00:12:59,777
Confirm?

245
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:01,096
Confirm for Luo Yan.

246
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:03,297
Right.

247
00:13:03,297 --> 00:13:04,216
You're right.

248
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:05,856
I'm just here to confirm.

249
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:07,257
Bedsides, I'll take pictures.

250
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:08,777
Pictures...

251
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:10,816
What's going on with you two?

252
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:12,736
Lili was just quite worried.

253
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:13,657
- We're divorced.
- We're divorced.

254
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,137
Hello, Grandma.

255
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:27,297
I'm fine. Don't worry.

256
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:28,537
I've been bandaged up.

257
00:13:29,177 --> 00:13:31,137
Then bring Lili back home!

258
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:33,576
You dare hide the divorce from me?

259
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:34,937
You are really asking for trouble!

260
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:39,257
Instead of living a good life,

261
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:41,456
what are you doing now?

262
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:45,216
You've just achieved
great results together.

263
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,017
Why suddenly wanted to divorce?

264
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:49,057
Since Yushen proposed the divorce,

265
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:50,417
I'll respect his option,

266
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:51,177
and wish him well.

267
00:13:52,856 --> 00:13:53,537
Yushen,

268
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:55,336
what is going on?

269
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:56,816
You do such things.

270
00:13:57,377 --> 00:13:59,576
Don't you even respect me?

271
00:13:59,976 --> 00:14:02,336
Don't you care about the public image
of the group?

272
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:03,297
Grandma.

273
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:06,576
Your daughter-in-law has gone to
Luo Yan's department.

274
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:09,616
I respect and wish well for her too.

275
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:13,216
A woman should pursue her career.

276
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,537
If Lili is satisfied working with you,

277
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:17,496
how would she choose others?

278
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:19,257
Lili.

279
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:21,456
Is Yushen not treating you well?

280
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,976
I will protect you.

281
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:23,736
I'll rebuke him.

282
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:28,657
Grandma.

283
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:31,456
I took out all my assets
to help Yushen before.

284
00:14:31,616 --> 00:14:33,137
Now, he let me sign an agreement

285
00:14:33,137 --> 00:14:34,937
that the 50 million investment
is a gift.

286
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:36,377
He won't return a penny to me.

287
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:37,696
Grandma.

288
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:38,616
It's not like that.

289
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:39,576
That's because...

290
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:42,777
But you didn't sign it.

291
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:44,576
Because I'm not stupid.

292
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:46,257
If you really have sincerity,

293
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:47,816
return the money to me now.

294
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:49,816
I return the money to you,

295
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:51,377
then you go to help Luo Yan.

296
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:53,576
Impressive plan.

297
00:14:53,897 --> 00:14:55,297
I've always been accommodating you.

298
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:56,816
Accommodating me?

299
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:58,897
You compete with me
for the bathroom every time!

300
00:14:59,137 --> 00:15:00,897
Because you take too long to shower!

301
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:03,096
You spend half an hour on drying hair.
Who can wait for that?

302
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:03,976
And you?

303
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,096
Every time you use the bathroom,

304
00:15:06,216 --> 00:15:07,137
you leave the razor,

305
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:09,017
and the cleanser scattered all over.

306
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:10,417
Isn't it me who cleans it for you?

307
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:11,657
When will you stop

308
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:12,657
being so careless?

309
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:14,576
Careless?

310
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:15,816
Aren't you careless?

311
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:17,576
You never check the car before leaving.

312
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:22,377
Enough.

313
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:24,976
You're married now.

314
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:26,216
Still acting like kids.

315
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:28,616
You two

316
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:31,856
are just throwing tantrums by divorce.

317
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:33,257
Actually,

318
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:36,057
you can't truly let go of each other.

319
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:36,937
- I'm not.
- I'm not.

320
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,696
Anyway.

321
00:15:39,377 --> 00:15:41,377
There's no big deal.

322
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:43,096
As for the bathroom,

323
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:46,017
you can shower together.

324
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:48,657
Anyway.

325
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:50,177
No matter

326
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:51,976
what excuses you have,

327
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,216
about divorce,

328
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:55,177
I firmly disapprove it.

329
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:56,736
Moreover,

330
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:59,216
I have an old friend

331
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:00,537
visiting tomorrow.

332
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:02,496
At 6 PM tomorrow,

333
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,257
you must be home.

334
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:07,456
Be as affectionate as possible.

335
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:10,736
If you lose my face,

336
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:15,496
I'll have both of you

337
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:17,496
leave from Ju'an.

338
00:16:22,177 --> 00:16:22,937
Madam An.

339
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,336
Your antique jewelry

340
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:26,616
is all here.

341
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:49,417
I'm going to get a haircut.

342
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:50,216
Yushen,

343
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:51,377
give Lili a lift.

344
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:52,777
Let's go.

345
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:13,016
It's not my thought.

346
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:14,256
Grandma wants us be together.

347
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:15,456
Procedures are not important.

348
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:16,216
You go your way,

349
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:17,417
and I'll go mine.

350
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,408
(Luo Yan)

351
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:15,696
Hello.

352
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:17,817
Can you

353
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,456
delete An Yushen's driving records?

354
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:21,657
Yes.

355
00:18:22,657 --> 00:18:24,016
But you have to tell me why.

356
00:18:27,177 --> 00:18:28,016
I've heard

357
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:30,417
today someone splashed paint
on their car.

358
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,696
I don't want him to be caught.

359
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:34,897
Who is this person?

360
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:37,016
No questions.

361
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:38,177
Just do as I say.

362
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:46,456
What kind of dirty tricks are these?

363
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:51,256
Aotian.

364
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:52,456
What's up?

365
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:53,577
Buying items.

366
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:58,912
(Game)

367
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:01,056
(Data Wiping Virus)

368
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,456
Do you want to buy the item,

369
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:04,337
Data Wiping Virus?

370
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:07,256
Forget it.

371
00:19:07,256 --> 00:19:07,897
Another one.

372
00:19:09,824 --> 00:19:12,337
(Healing: Medicine Box)

373
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:14,016
Medicine Box is purchased.

374
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:15,937
Please select a target for use.

375
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:18,056
An Yushen.

376
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:26,048
(Ju'an Group)

377
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,016
Mr. Shi.

378
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:00,992
Good morning.

379
00:21:04,177 --> 00:21:04,768
Well,

380
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:05,456
Young An.

381
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:07,456
Have some tea.

382
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:08,536
Thank you.

383
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:12,976
Young An.

384
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:14,536
I've heard

385
00:21:14,617 --> 00:21:16,097
you had an accident yesterday.

386
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:18,617
I was so worried about you.

387
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:20,056
Thank you for your concern.

388
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:21,137
I'm fine.

389
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:24,216
Actually, I came here today...

390
00:21:26,657 --> 00:21:28,016
I'll get straight to the point.

391
00:21:28,736 --> 00:21:29,617
I know

392
00:21:30,177 --> 00:21:32,937
you bought the land
in the city center yesterday.

393
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:35,976
You must understand

394
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,456
that this auction will

395
00:21:37,456 --> 00:21:39,137
affact Mr. An's attitude towards me.

396
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:41,177
So I'd like to ask

397
00:21:41,496 --> 00:21:43,137
whether you could sell that land to me.

398
00:21:45,657 --> 00:21:46,456
Young An.

399
00:21:47,337 --> 00:21:48,696
No walls don't leak.

400
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:50,456
I dare not transfer

401
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,137
this land to you privately.

402
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,736
I need to report to Mr. An.

403
00:21:56,536 --> 00:21:57,577
Are you

404
00:21:57,897 --> 00:21:59,817
really unwilling to help me?

405
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,696
Young An.

406
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:03,296
It's for your own good.

407
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:05,857
Real estate development
is not a simple thing.

408
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:09,256
You'd better save the funds
for other projects.

409
00:22:27,857 --> 00:22:28,417
Young An.

410
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:30,337
I have an urgent matter.

411
00:22:30,456 --> 00:22:31,817
I'll be back soon.

412
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:56,137
(Shining Because of You)

413
00:22:56,137 --> 00:22:57,137
What's going on?

414
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:58,536
This morning,

415
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:01,577
someone unearthed antiques
from that land in the city center.

416
00:23:01,776 --> 00:23:02,857
No one dared dig further.

417
00:23:02,857 --> 00:23:04,456
So they called me right away.

418
00:23:05,897 --> 00:23:06,817
Are they real antiques?

419
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,417
Got authenticated?

420
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:11,296
I didn't make it widely known.

421
00:23:11,897 --> 00:23:12,577
Think about it.

422
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:14,577
If there really are ancient ruins
underground,

423
00:23:15,097 --> 00:23:16,216
once the news gets out,

424
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:16,976
that land

425
00:23:17,536 --> 00:23:18,817
will be protected.

426
00:23:18,817 --> 00:23:19,976
And we can't develop it.

427
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:21,256
Therefore,

428
00:23:21,337 --> 00:23:22,897
I asked a professor I know

429
00:23:22,897 --> 00:23:23,857
for appraisal.

430
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:25,456
According to him,

431
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:26,417
they are all authentic.

432
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:30,937
If this land is protected,

433
00:23:31,937 --> 00:23:33,577
I'll lose a lot of money.

434
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:36,456
Unless

435
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:38,417
you sell this tricky land

436
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,857
to someone else.

437
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:43,417
Bury the antiques back.

438
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,016
Don't spread it.

439
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:46,337
Yes.

440
00:23:57,857 --> 00:23:58,496
Young An.

441
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:01,337
I just thought about it.

442
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:03,097
Actually, the land deal

443
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:04,696
is still negotiable.

444
00:24:06,897 --> 00:24:07,976
I didn't expect

445
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:10,056
you changed your mind so quickly.

446
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:14,496
An Yushen signed the contract
immediately.

447
00:24:15,097 --> 00:24:16,417
He is so innocent.

448
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:17,976
By the time he realizes it,

449
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,337
he can do nothing.

450
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:20,937
Why did you decide on your own again?

451
00:24:21,256 --> 00:24:22,496
The antiques were appraised?

452
00:24:23,617 --> 00:24:24,137
Don't worry.

453
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:25,728
I had someone check them.

454
00:24:27,377 --> 00:24:27,937
Shi Yu!

455
00:24:28,657 --> 00:24:30,016
Are these the antiques you dug up?

456
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,577
Yes.

457
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:36,256
You are good!

458
00:24:42,617 --> 00:24:43,657
Are you sure

459
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:44,617
to purchase the item,

460
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:46,097
Distance Transfer?

461
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:47,256
Yes.

462
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:51,016
Specified item has been

463
00:24:51,137 --> 00:24:51,897
transferred

464
00:24:51,897 --> 00:24:53,177
to set location,

465
00:24:53,897 --> 00:24:54,937
former glass factory site,

466
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,337
six meters underground.

467
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:17,097
Hello, Grandma.

468
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:17,857
An Yushen!

469
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:19,337
Where are

470
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:20,296
my antique jewelry?

471
00:25:20,456 --> 00:25:21,937
Those are family heirlooms!

472
00:25:22,097 --> 00:25:23,177
I need them right now.

473
00:25:23,337 --> 00:25:24,377
Bring them back to me!

474
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:24,937
Grandma.

475
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:25,857
Calm down first.

476
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,016
I am already at the door.

477
00:25:27,016 --> 00:25:27,857
In three seconds.

478
00:25:55,617 --> 00:25:56,736
An Hang, what do you mean?

479
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:58,857
Why are you so angry?

480
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,177
You used items to trick Shi Yu

481
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:01,776
with Grandma's antiques, right?

482
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:03,496
How could you do that?

483
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:05,177
It's Shi Yu who tricked me first.

484
00:26:05,177 --> 00:26:06,696
I was just fooling him.

485
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:07,536
Besides,

486
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:09,056
items are allowed.

487
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:10,337
Only you can use items?

488
00:26:10,337 --> 00:26:11,296
I can use them too.

489
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:11,897
Right.

490
00:26:11,897 --> 00:26:12,776
You can use them too.

491
00:26:12,776 --> 00:26:13,937
I never said you couldn't.

492
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:16,456
Okay. An Hang.

493
00:26:16,696 --> 00:26:17,937
You use items, and I will too.

494
00:26:17,937 --> 00:26:18,976
Just play dirty.

495
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:20,016
Let's see who will win.

496
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:21,137
By the way,

497
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:22,496
distance transfer

498
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:23,617
is really a good item.

499
00:26:23,857 --> 00:26:24,536
However,

500
00:26:24,536 --> 00:26:25,736
I've already bought it twice.

501
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:26,776
You can't buy it anymore.

502
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,337
You!

503
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,097
Stop right there!

504
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:30,817
Stop!

505
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:39,377
My loving grandchildren are coming back.

506
00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:08,577
Behave well from now on.

507
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:09,216
Otherwise,

508
00:27:09,216 --> 00:27:10,137
leave Ju'an.

509
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:12,496
You must be tired.

510
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:13,897
Let's eat.

511
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:34,417
You two,

512
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:35,377
why wait?

513
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:38,937
Let me introduce you.

514
00:27:39,256 --> 00:27:41,857
This is my best friend
from my younger years.

515
00:27:42,016 --> 00:27:43,857
You should call her Grandma Qin.

516
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:46,976
Grandma?

517
00:27:48,617 --> 00:27:50,056
I guess so.

518
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:51,137
You've already gotten used

519
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,736
to being called Grandma, right?

520
00:27:52,817 --> 00:27:53,577
After all,

521
00:27:53,577 --> 00:27:55,496
you are a few years older than me.

522
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,456
Well,

523
00:27:58,817 --> 00:28:00,577
at our age,

524
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:02,216
we must accept getting old.

525
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,056
Some people

526
00:28:05,056 --> 00:28:07,256
still think they are young girls.

527
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:09,496
I really can't quite understand it.

528
00:28:11,016 --> 00:28:11,577
Lili.

529
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,696
Open two bottles of Lafite
for Grandma Qin.

530
00:28:20,337 --> 00:28:23,016
I never open wine myself at home.

531
00:28:23,216 --> 00:28:25,056
Or, what's the use of having a husband?

532
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:27,857
Well.

533
00:28:28,857 --> 00:28:30,296
I think the two kids

534
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,776
don't seem that affectionate.

535
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:42,337
Look, they sit so far apart
from each other.

536
00:28:42,496 --> 00:28:43,657
Body language

537
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:45,296
doesn't lie.

538
00:29:00,857 --> 00:29:02,056
Enough.

539
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:02,897
Let's drink.

540
00:29:08,016 --> 00:29:09,536
They are close.

541
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:12,736
You don't understand
young people's love.

542
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:16,857
I'm not so good at it as you do.

543
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:17,976
Back then,

544
00:29:17,976 --> 00:29:19,337
An and I

545
00:29:19,337 --> 00:29:21,137
were also mutually in love.

546
00:29:21,897 --> 00:29:22,937
But,

547
00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:24,337
when you showed up...

548
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:26,857
Never mind.

549
00:29:27,937 --> 00:29:28,617
You are

550
00:29:28,857 --> 00:29:30,456
more charming indeed.

551
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,417
You'd only met twice.

552
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:35,617
Mutually in love?

553
00:29:36,496 --> 00:29:37,976
You sure know how to joke.

554
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:40,817
Some people just met twice,

555
00:29:41,256 --> 00:29:43,577
but are closer than those
spending a lifetime together.

556
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:44,736
Is that so?

557
00:29:45,177 --> 00:29:47,897
Spending a lifetime together
is the true commitment, isn't it?

558
00:29:48,657 --> 00:29:52,097
Anyone can meet twice.

559
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:05,776
Grandma.

560
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:08,097
You and Grandma Qin...

561
00:30:08,377 --> 00:30:10,417
Don't interrupt
when adults are speaking.

562
00:30:11,097 --> 00:30:12,256
Take Lili to sleep.

563
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,657
Right now.

564
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:34,097
Grandma

565
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:35,296
let you

566
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:36,976
sleep here tonight.

567
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:39,536
I...

568
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:42,177
What if I don't stay?

569
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:42,976
Stay here.

570
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:48,097
Otherwise, both of us
have to leave Ju'an.

571
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:51,496
Okay.

572
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:52,536
I'll stay.

573
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:54,577
Compared with being trapped

574
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:55,657
when game's over,

575
00:30:56,016 --> 00:30:57,536
a little mental pollution is nothing.

576
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,456
I agree.

577
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:02,216
I've been bearing it before.

578
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:03,736
One more night won't matter.

579
00:31:08,776 --> 00:31:11,056
Since we are trapped together,

580
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:12,617
why not play a game?

581
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:13,377
Dare to?

582
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:14,736
Of course.

583
00:31:15,097 --> 00:31:15,937
What game?

584
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:23,097
Explain the rules.

585
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:24,937
Each person draws a card.

586
00:31:24,937 --> 00:31:26,417
The loser answers a question.

587
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:39,016
Tell me.

588
00:31:40,216 --> 00:31:41,536
In the world you came from,

589
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:42,776
do you have a boyfriend?

590
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,657
Can't you ask something more meaningful?

591
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:48,216
I won. Answer me.

592
00:31:49,496 --> 00:31:51,016
I don't have a boyfriend.

593
00:32:02,177 --> 00:32:03,456
You won again.

594
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,056
Tell me.

595
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:07,617
You've deceived me for so long.

596
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:09,937
Have you ever thought about
telling me the truth?

597
00:32:10,456 --> 00:32:11,296
Yes.

598
00:32:11,377 --> 00:32:12,337
Why didn't you tell me?

599
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:13,417
That's another question.

600
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:14,696
Draw the card.

601
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,000
Wait.

602
00:32:20,776 --> 00:32:23,097
Your cards are always
slightly higher than mine.

603
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:25,337
You've tampered with the cards?

604
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:27,776
You don't trust me?

605
00:32:28,456 --> 00:32:29,496
Then take this one.

606
00:32:31,256 --> 00:32:31,857
No need.

607
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,256
I'll draw one myself.

608
00:32:33,776 --> 00:32:36,256
Who knows what mischief you're planning?

609
00:32:41,617 --> 00:32:42,417
I am sleepy.

610
00:32:43,097 --> 00:32:44,617
If you win this time,

611
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:45,736
you sleep in the bed.

612
00:32:46,056 --> 00:32:47,296
If you lose,

613
00:32:47,456 --> 00:32:48,496
tell me

614
00:32:48,817 --> 00:32:51,377
why you bought
healing item for me yesterday.

615
00:32:59,456 --> 00:33:00,296
Have you decided?

616
00:33:01,377 --> 00:33:02,536
Wanna change cards with me?

617
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:09,177
Yes.

618
00:33:25,657 --> 00:33:26,337
Flip the cards.

619
00:33:32,496 --> 00:33:33,536
I sleep in the bed today.

620
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:34,776
No problem.

621
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,536
Wait.

622
00:33:46,536 --> 00:33:48,536
You must have cheated.

623
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:50,776
If I hadn't changed it with you,

624
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:52,056
you would still have won me.

625
00:33:53,377 --> 00:33:55,577
You also got two answers for nothing.

626
00:33:56,097 --> 00:33:57,536
What do you mean?

627
00:33:58,817 --> 00:33:59,696
Alright.

628
00:33:59,897 --> 00:34:00,496
I am sleepy.

629
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:02,296
I'll go wash up first.

630
00:34:30,496 --> 00:34:31,257
You are back?

631
00:34:39,176 --> 00:34:39,777
Wait a moment.

632
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,440
The food will be ready soon.
