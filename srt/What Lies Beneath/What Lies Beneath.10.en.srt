Yes!

329

And even after fourteen years,
that hasn't changed!

331

Lucas Santiago over nothing?

If you don't want to believe me, fine.

We need to do some research!

Let's find out how Louisa Soria was killed

349
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,369
and how mom and her friends found her.

350
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,414
Miss Liwanag doesn't want me posting
about school, so this will have to do.

351
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,919
Why do you think your mom never told you
about what happened to her friend?

352

Don't you two tell each other everything?

354
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,469
Maybe, she doesn't want to be
reminded of her friend's death.

355
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,553
Maybe.

356
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:08,475
[unsettling music continues]

357
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,111
- [Alice huffs]
- [music fades]

358
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,279
"Thank you"?

359
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,863
Why did you say "thank you" to her?

360
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,740
She's scaring us for no reason at all!

361
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,617
[snickers] You heard her.

362
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,911
She was just concerned.

363
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,330
Concerned?
Oh, please! She was making trouble!

364
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,874
Of course she had to bring up the past!

365
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,501
Oh my god, Beth, stop!

366
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,419
Stop it!

367
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,298
This is the first time
we're seeing her after all these years!

368
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,635
We couldn't even say "Hello"?
Let alone "How are you"?

369
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,097
She was our friend once.

370
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,933
[cicadas chirping]

371
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,312
And you, Mel.
Your only concern was Lucas.

372
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,731
And you, Beth…

373
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,442
Just like the old times,

374
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,944
all you care about is being right!

375
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:01,945
That's it!

376
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,573
God!

377
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,868
If Mama won't talk,
I'll uncover it myself.

378
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,747
This is where it happened.
Someone out there still remembers.

379
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,085
Hey, bro!

380
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,004
Bro.

381
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,465
Miss Alice lives here, right?

382
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,843
Next time you go there with
Miss Beth, let me come along.

383
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,261
Why would I bring you?

384
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,305
I just want to see her again.

385
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,015
She's so beautiful.

386
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,017
I thought you said she was boring.

387
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,603
[Joshua] That's what you said before.
You're so cringe.

388
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:39,274
[foreboding music playing]

389
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,329
Uh, hello.

390
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,581
Can we help you?

391
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:59,669
[foreboding music intensifies]

392
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:09,888
[sinister music playing]

393
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,894
[whistling]

394
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,605
[Beth] <i>The kids said</i>
<i>the man who chased them</i>

395
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,524
<i>was wearing a cap and a hoodie.</i>

396
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,151
<i>The same outfit Louisa's killer wore.</i>

397
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,155
<i>Right after Erica's warning about</i>
<i>Edong and Lucas, this happened.</i>

398
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,448
<i>I think I know who did this.</i>

399
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,201
<i>Edong's been rotting</i>
<i>in prison all these years.</i>

400
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,786
<i>Erica got it wrong.</i>

401
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,455
[Edong] <i>You don't rush into a fight.</i>

402
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,665
<i>I waited.</i>

403
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,126
<i>I studied their every move.</i>

404
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,337
<i>I made them believe I had become harmless.</i>

405
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,425
<i>That was when I showed</i>
<i>them who had the power now.</i>

406
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,552
<i>Aah!</i>

407
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,513
[laughing maniacally]

408
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,142
- [glass door shatters]
- [screaming]
