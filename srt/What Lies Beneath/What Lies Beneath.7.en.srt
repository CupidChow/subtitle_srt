00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,796
<i>Why do you need a gun?</i>

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,718
<i>Scott and I are getting a divorce.</i>

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:10,719
<i>What happened?</i>

5
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,303
<i>You're talking crazy!</i>

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,472
<i>Stop treating me like I am your enemy!</i>

7
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,932
<i>You are not taking Seth with you.</i>

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,768
<i>If you insist on doing this,</i>
<i>I will sue you for full custody.</i>

9
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,562
<i>I think he is having an affair.</i>

10
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,730
<i>Then what is the gun for?</i>

11
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,190
<i>I am just afraid he will</i>
<i>take Seth away from me.</i>

12
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,359
<i>Please, do not tell Mel.</i>

13
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,069

14

<i>You are the monster!</i>

18
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,622

[pastor] Edong is right.

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,470
It is easy to get angry,

26
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,347
but it is harder to forgive others.

27
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,891
Especially yourself.

28
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,726
Look at me.

29
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,811

[woman] <i>Have you talked to Scott yet?</i>

40
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,571
I have not spoken to him yet.

41
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,910
<i>Why did you suddenly</i>
<i>fly to the Philippines taking Seth?</i>

42
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,413
You even timed it with
your husband's business trip.

43
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,625
<i>What if he thinks</i>
<i>you are running away with Seth?</i>

44
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,210

fix things so you
wouldn't end up getting a divorce.

46
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,051
But what you are doing,
that is where you are heading.

47
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,969
I want a divorce, Ma.

48
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,304
That is what I want.

49
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,306
I want nothing to do with him.

50
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,309
Dear, what is happening to you?

51
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,313
<i>I still do not understand</i>

<i>Scott is a good man.</i>

53
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,193
<i>You two were so good together.</i>

54
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,863
If he said he was not
having an affair, believe him.

55
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,032
I have to go, Ma.

56
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,951

Ma, have some cold
water so you can calm down.

It's embarrassing she even fought back!

You're truly in debt!

- [woman 1] Mm?

95
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,818
We used the money
we borrowed for Papa's cancer treatment.

Ah, you're now throwing that in my face?

97

No, Ma.

It's not like that.

All I'm saying is…

100
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,332
Your niece shouldn't have brought it up.

101
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,836
She knew what Papa really went through.

102

You know my wife's mouth
is a weapon of mass destruction.

00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,555
She could start World War III.

107

Hey. You know,

- [Chloe] Hello, Grandma.
- Sorry, she's just stressed.

134

My granddaughter's so beautiful.
Come on, say hello to him.

Come on, just greet him.

Perfect! [chuckles]

[Beth] Dear,
your Grandma Cecilia can't forgive me.

00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,553
You know why?

141
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,181
I rejected your dad
ten times in high school.

142
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,557
- [Ryan] Ten times?
- [Beth] Mm.

143
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,268
- Not five times?
- Fifteen times!

144
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,145
You're really my daughter!

145
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,065
You know what?
I rejected Love so many times!

146
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:48,653
Good thing he didn't get tired
of trying to win my heart. [gasps]

147
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,488

149
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,118
Just stay here and take a seat.

Perfect, here's <i>suman </i>(rice cake) for you.

151

Enjoy your food, okay?

152
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,958
And I'll get you fruits!

153
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,626
You can't get hungry, Love!

154
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,045
You should always be full of energy!

155
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,549
Perfect! They also have bananas and bread!

156
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,467
Hey. Don't you have jam or something?

157
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,135
- [Ryan] Chloe.
- [woman 2] Come on.

158
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,304
He should always be strong, right?!

159
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,390
Of course! Eat up, Love.

160
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,477
Ma, when will you
ever come to your senses?

161
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,105
It's obvious he's only after your money.

162
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,023
[Marie] Oh, dear.

163
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,694
You've always been judgmental, huh?

164
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,154
That's why you and Cecilia can't get along

165
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,031
because you're practically the same.

166
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,575
What's wrong?

167
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,619
Just because I'm older,

168
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,038
a young man can't fall in love with me?

169
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,666
Is that really impossible?!

170
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,710
I'm just concerned about you, Ma.

171
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,753
[woman 2] Hmph.

172
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,714
Hey, you.

173
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,174
Don't act like those from Amurao.

174
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,552
They're so narrow-minded.

175
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:59,390
Have you forgotten that's
what used to annoy you about them?

176
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,100
Ma, all I remember

177
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,312
is how many times
you fell in love and got hurt.

178
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,607
<i>We have no money.</i>

00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,363
<i>Why did you bring him to the meeting, Ma?</i>

181
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,532
<i>People might've thought he's my father!</i>

182
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,035

185
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,709
<i>I just wanted him to be involved.</i>

186
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,753

187

188

<i>It's always like this at the start, Ma.</i>

189
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,180
<i>You'd be so excited.</i>

190
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,641
<i>You two would break up after a few months.</i>

191
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,392
<i>Haven't you learned your lesson?</i>

192
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:49,231
<i>Dear, you should</i>
<i>never give up on finding love.</i>

193
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,485
<i>You'll understand when you're older.</i>

194
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,529
<i>Ma, if you haven't learned your lesson,</i>
<i>then I'm learning from you.</i>

195
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,240
<i>I'm already done with men!</i>

196
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,534
<i>Argh, I'll just get a drink.</i>

197
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,162

<i>an affair with a married man.</i>

202
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:19,178
<i>What truly ruins my day</i>
<i>is seeing a woman who looks like a squid!</i>

203
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,806
<i>- What did you say?!</i>
<i>- You look like a squid!</i>

204

209
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,446

210
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,365
<i>I only entertained Danilo</i>

211

You're right.

I really am lucky with Ryan.

Even if we didn't start off great
because I got pregnant early,

248

at least we still have
a healthy relationship.

Yes. You're lucky.

Just look at your friend Mel.

She may be famous and rich,

255
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:44,573
If she's hurting her husband,
she must be miserable, right?

[tense music playing]

282
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:18,208
And the disappearance of
Esther right after Celestino's murder?

283
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,878
That can't be a coincidence.

284
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,422
He must've done that.

He's now coming after
everyone who had him imprisoned.

And he's coming for us next.

Me,

Alice, and Beth.

292
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,943
But Santiago is in Bagumbayan now.

293

Unless someone's acting for him out here.

294
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,948
That's easy.

295
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,741
He might have an accomplice.

296
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,995
It could be his former
inmate who's already been released.

[suspenseful music playing]

298

that was impossible back then.

That he couldn't do that.

But after 14 years…

310

I saw the anger he's
been carrying for Edong.

You're right.

312
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,392

Lucas is behind all this.

[Marco] What you're saying is possible.

318
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,160
They'd work together

319
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,203
to take revenge on those who wronged them.

00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,769
[gym employee 2] Sir,
do you need ice for that?

354
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,733
[phone chimes]

355
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,361
[foreboding music playing]

356
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,535
[foreboding music continues]

357
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,287
[Lucas] <i>I'm here for Edong.</i>

358
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,123
<i>He's not finished yet.</i>

359
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,667
<i>There are things</i>
<i>he still needs to take care of.</i>

360
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,672
<i>I'm proud of my brother.</i>

361
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,175
<i>He's been through a lot,</i>
<i>but he turned out to be a good person.</i>

362
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,010
<i>Is that true? He's a good person now?</i>

363
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,304
<i>Are you accusing my</i>
<i>brother of committing a crime outside</i>

364
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,057
<i>while he's behind</i>
<i>the same bars you put him in?</i>

365
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,352
[Chloe] <i>I wonder why Mama doesn't</i>
<i>meet with Erica Melendez anymore.</i>

366
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,395
<i>I'm also curious about Louisa.</i>

367
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,688
<i>Hey, look at this!</i>

368
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,856
[Chloe] <i>Louisa was murdered</i>

369
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,525
<i>and it was Mama and</i>
<i>her friends who found her body?</i>

370
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,069
<i>You said nothing, Erica!</i>

371
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,071
<i>You're one of</i>
<i>the reasons Edong will rot in jail!</i>

372
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,322
<i>Don't play innocent!</i>
