<i>Because his targets are here… us.</i>

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,474

6
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,726

<i>Don't let anyone else be next after me.</i>

10

<i>Edong, let's not drag this out.</i>

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,405
<i>I'm the one you want.</i>

12
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,698
<i>Don't hide.</i>

13
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,575

My God! Ma'am, what happened?!

38
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,358
Why do you have blood on your face?!

39
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,442
Huh?

40
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,780
Goodness. [inhales sharply]

00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,657
Uh…

42
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,076
- Where's Seth?
- He slept at my place, right?

[sighs deeply]

44
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,622
Ma'am, what happened in this room?
What's all this mess?!

45
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,375
Did the intruder come back?

46
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,544
[Alice] I don't know.

47
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,338
But the door was locked.

48
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,676
I don't know--

That's what you want, right?

00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,114
[sighs heavily]

54
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,782
For my brother to die?

55
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,160
And then what?
Just erase everything you did to him?

56
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,871
And your conscience will be clear, right?

57
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,041
No matter how many times we tell you

58
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,877
that what you think is
wrong, you won't listen.

59
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,212
Then prove it!

60
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,882
Let's work together to find my brother.

61
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:04,595

[Steve] Mm? [slurps]

65
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,565
Dude. [claps]

66
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,900
I am so sorry I had to call you.

67
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,737
I even told Dad not to bother you

68
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,282
because you're preoccupied with
everything going on with your brother.

69
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,159
How are you holding up?

70
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,537
[sighs]

71
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,373
I need to find Edong.

72
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,464
You don't know where your brother is?

73
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,758
Aren't you two close?

74
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,094
Would he really
escape without telling you?

75
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,139
[scoffs]

76
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,770
I don't know what his plans are.

77
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,524
He wouldn't help
his brother bust out of jail, Dad.

78
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,235
Actually, he's got a really nice--

79
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,571
[Laurence scoffs]

80
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,658
Your brother didn't just escape.

81
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,410
He killed someone.

82
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,412
And that lawyer he threatened?

83
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,831
[scoffs] She won't stay silent.

84
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,836
I've got eyes and ears everywhere, Lucas.

85
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,922
You can't hide anything from me.

86
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,593
Your brother's a big problem.

87
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,266
- [sighs]
- [foot stomps]

88
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:37,522
- You know what I do with problems.
- [foreboding music playing]

89
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:45,738
For now, people haven't
connected your name to Edong.

90
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,740
But if this drags on,

91
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,201
they'll eventually find out his connection

92
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,745
to you and my business.

93
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,665
We don't need that kind of attention.

94
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,584
The police might start
snooping around our operations.

95
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,921
We can't let that happen.

96
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,882
[foreboding music continues]

97
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,300
I'll handle my brother.

98
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,553
[scoffs] See to it you do.

99
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,558
Because if he becomes
a liability to our operations… [scoffs]

100
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,980
I'll handle him myself.

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,525
[tense music sting]

102
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,695
[foreboding music continues]

103
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,699
[Laurence huffs]

104
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,040
[music fades]

105
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,794
You need to find my brother.

106
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,132
Find him before
the police and Laurence Kyo do.

107
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,133
Sir.

108
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,635
With so many looking for your brother,

109
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,762
it's not impossible
they'll find him first.

110
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,433
[sighs heavily]

111
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,768
I'll help the police.

112
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,271
[inhales sharply]

113
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,481
Sir…

114
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,318
I thought you didn't want
them to find your brother first.

115
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,654
If they find Edong first…

116
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,991
only two things will happen.

117
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,951
He'll end up dead or back in jail.

118
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,745
[sighs heavily]

119
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,498
I wanted him to live free.

120
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,500
But now…

121
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,128
that's not legally possible.

122
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,716
I'll find him and hide
him in another country.

123
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,808
Even if I have to pretend
to help Erica Melendez

124
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,477
and the police to make that happen…

125
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,230
I'll do it.

126
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,111
I don't have anything to prove to you.

127
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,199
But if you want us to work together…

128
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,701
Fine.

129
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,411
Let's work together.

130
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,416
But if you want me
to believe what you're saying,

131
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,794
prove it.

132
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:09,924
[tense music playing]

133
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,351
You don't have to
prove anything, but I do?

134
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,647
Tell me all the places
your brother could possibly be hiding.

135
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,192
The places not yet listed by the police.

136
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,069
[Lucas inhales deeply]

137
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,654
[Erica] Then maybe…

138
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,948
this partnership will work.

139
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,241
[Marco scoffs]

140
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,243
You really think he'll betray his brother?

141
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:41,455
[dramatic music playing]

142
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,175
[Lucas] Aside from Mama's grave in Amurao,

143
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,721
there are five places
Edong could go here in Manila.

144
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,015
[Marco exhales sharply]

145
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:03,144
[dramatic music continues]

146
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,520
[Ryan] Chloe!

147
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,314
Dear, come on. We're going to be late!

148
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,232
Come on, hurry up!

149
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,817
- Goodness.
- What time is it?

150
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,193
We're running late.

151
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,158
Chloe, dear!
Get down here, or we'll be late!

152
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:19,952
- [zipper closes]
- [Beth grunts softly]

153
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,998
[Chloe] Excuse me, Pa.

154
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,958
What are you going to do?

155
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,084
[Beth] Chloe!

156
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,378
What are you looking for?!
You can't stop running around!

157
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,505
Ma, where are your high school photos?

158
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,923
High school photos?

159
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,635
Those have been gone for years!
I can't remember!

160
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,720
They have been lost since we moved here!

161
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,556
- All of them?!
- Zero! Nothing!

162
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,099
Hold on, I'll grab my stuff.

163
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:47,355
[sullen music playing]

164
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,069

[pensive music continues]

167
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,227
[Beth] <i>I also tried calling her,</i>
<i>but she wasn't picking up.</i>

168
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,396
You know, I'm sure she's fine.

169
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,523
<i>I talked to her last night.</i>

170
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,524
<i>She's probably busy.</i>

171
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,610
She said she had
meetings she couldn't miss.

172
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,445
[Beth] <i>Alice.</i>

173
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,031
You know what?

174
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,867
I had a nightmare about…

175
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,329
the night Louisa died.

176
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,500
[Alice sobs] <i>It can't be!</i>

177
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,793
[breathes heavily]

178
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,129
I had a nightmare about her too.

179
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,338
Really?

180
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,841
[sighs, clicks tongue]

181
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,177
Actually, I've been trying to avoid
thinking or talking about her.

182
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,012
<i>That's probably why</i>

183
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,807
my daughter's been asking
many questions about what happened.

184
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,435
<i>Do you think</i>

185
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,562
Louisa would be mad that

186
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,898
I've spent so many
years trying to forget her?

187
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,110
[cries softly] Can you really do that?

188
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,987
I mean…

189
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,948
I don't think I'll ever get over it.

190
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:25,828
Even if I could,
Edong would never let us forget.

191
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,333
<i>Alice, maybe you should</i>
<i>send Seth back to the US.</i>

192
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,253
Not to your husband, okay?
Send him to Miss Susan.

193
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,421
[frustrated sigh]

194
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,381
If Scott finds out Seth's there,

195
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,884
he'll find a way to take him from my mom.

196
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,052
<i>I can't let that happen.</i>

197
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,054
Alice,

198
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:48,559
um, I know you're worried
about your custody battle over Seth.

199
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,853
<i>But…</i>

200
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,940
Is cheating the only reason,
or is there something else?

201
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,901
[uneasy music playing]

202
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,777
<i>It seems like,</i>

203
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,280
<i>It seems like you're</i>
<i>terrified of your husband.</i>

204
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:06,494
- [Alice sighs deeply]
- [uneasy music continues, fades]

205
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,204
[door squeaks open]

206
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,831
- [door slams]
- [Anton inhales sharply]

207
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,833
Right, I'm going for a run.

208
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,961
You even took my ATM and credit cards.

209
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,589
You don't need them. [chuckles]

210
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,716
- What would you use them for?
- [huffs]

211
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,426
For the house? [scoffs]

212
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,764
What's the plan, Anton?

213
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,767
You'll take away everything I have

214
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,394
so I can't do anything without you?

215
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,271
What are you talking about?

216
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,732
After my run, you can use your phone.

217
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,275
Oh, wow! [chuckles]

218
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,027
For how long? An hour?

219
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,237
Two hours?

220
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,489
Maybe more than two…

221
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,074
if you play nice.

222
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,536
I made breakfast for you downstairs.

223
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,788
I didn't call in the helpers today.

224
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,206
It's safer that way.

225
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,208
We're dealing with a psychopath.

226
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,585
So, I don't want any outsiders here.

227
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,753
Alright?

228
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,048
- [chuckles softly]
- [foreboding music playing]

229
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,716
[Anton huffing]

230
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,968
Remember…

231
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,929
You don't need anything else. [huffs]

232
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,097
Not money.

233
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,473
Not the outside world.

234
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,642
Just me.

235
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,561
[Mel grunting]

236
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:17,189
[foreboding music continues]

237
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,443
[door squeaks open, shuts]

238
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,530
[inhales, exhales sharply]

239
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,325
[foreboding music continues]

240
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,539
- [Alice inhales deeply]
- [music fades]

241
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,374
My friend asked me…

242
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,335
why I'm scared of my husband.

243
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,920
[breathes deeply]

244
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,884
And, I couldn't tell her the reason.

245
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,303
That is because…

246
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,474
I know,
he did something bad to me every night.

247
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,269
What did he do to you?

248
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,938
[unsettling music playing]

249
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,316
[Alice hesitates] <i>It's not clear.</i>

250
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:05,946
<i>All I remember is getting flashes,</i>
<i>in my memory where I'm in the dark.</i>

251
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,282
<i>I'm crying.</i>

252
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,826
<i>My hands are tied.</i>

253
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,539
Do you remember
where or when this happened?

254
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,709
No.

255
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,837
Do you have any flashes of memory

256
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,882
that could help piece things together?

257
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:29,345
Something you heard or smelled?

258
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,765
All I can remember are my hands.

259
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,142
Just my hands…

260
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,268
<i>They were tied.</i>

261
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,062
<i>That's all I could see.</i>

262
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,273
<i>I think I was blindfolded.</i>

263
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:45,277
Are you sure it's just a memory?

264
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,113
[unsettling music continues]

265
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,281
I'm… [chuckles softly]

266
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,659
I'm not sure. [inhales deeply]

267
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,202
I'm not sure, okay? I--

268
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,788
It has to be real! It has to be!

269
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:00,209
I can still feel the fear
whenever I remember it.

270
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:05,506
[unsettling music continues, fades]

271
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,676
[security guard] Sir, good morning.

272
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,887
Whatever happens, don't let her leave.

273
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,347
- Okay?
- Copy, sir.

274
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,765
[Anton] Alright.

275
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:18,811
[ominous music playing]

276
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,105
[Alice] <i>I think… </i>[breathes deeply]

277
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:25,150
…my husband would do
something bad to me while I was asleep.

278
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,194
What makes you think

279
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,447
that your husband was
the one doing that to you?

280
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,532
I don't know.

281
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,158
[inhales deeply]

282
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,035
But it all started that night.

283
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,662
<i>Your family never liked me!</i>

284
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,414
<i>They wanted you to marry her.</i>

285
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,416
<i>Is this you giving them what they want?!</i>

286
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,459
<i>- You're talking crazy!</i>
- [scoffs]

287
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,461
<i>I am not cheating on you!</i>

288
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,797
<i>Will you please just listen?!</i>
<i>Alice, please!</i>

289
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,173
<i>- Let's just--</i>
- [Alice grunts loudly]

290
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,467
- [shatters]
- [gasps]

291
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,971
<i>That accident triggered…</i>

292
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,474
<i>my memory of another past accident.</i>

293
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,687
A car accident with my
dad when I was younger.

294
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,772
<i>- Papa!</i>
- [horn blaring]

295
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,773
<i>Aah!</i>

296
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:09,028
- [loud thud]
- [glass shattering]

297
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:13,866
[Alice] <i>That's when I started</i>
<i>recalling my memory of being in the dark.</i>

298
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,536
I… I know it all sounds irrational.

299
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,746
You know… [sniffles]

300
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,789
Was I blindfolded? [breathes shakily]

301
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,251
Was I asleep? My hands, were they tied?

302
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,545
I don't know. I'm not sure.

303
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,840
But I can feel it deep down,

304
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,968
I'm not imagining things.

305
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,513
I feel like he was really
doing something bad to me.

306
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,141
I even tried to prove it.

307
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,103
[unsettling music playing]

308
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,403
[camera clicking]

309
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:56,450
[unsetting music continues]

310
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,207
[Scott sighs exasperatedly]

311
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,836
Are you really going to keep ignoring me?

312
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,716
[unsetting music continues]

313
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,511
[sighs]

314
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,060
[unsettling music continues]

315
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:36,615
[unsettling music continues]

316
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:58,554
[unsettling music continues]

317
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:18,365
[unsettling music continues]

318
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,129
[Alice huffs] <i>I did that for nights.</i>

319
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,132
But I didn't find anything suspicious.

320
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,634
I started to think that… [sniffles]

321
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,929
Maybe he knew I planted a hidden camera.

322
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,850
Maybe he'd replace
the tape before I woke up.

323
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,602
I don't know.

324
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,312
That's possible, right?

325
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,191
- [siren wailing]
- [music fades]

326
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,401
[tires screech]

327
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,656
- [security guard] Boss, what is it?
- Got a call from this address.

328
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,033
Someone reported an overdose.

329
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,871
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Faster!

330
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:11,293
[tense music playing]

331
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,628
- Ma'am?
- [knocks]

332
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,922
Mrs. Montenegro, please open the door!

333
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,173
Ma'am!

334
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,674
Get the key to the door!

335
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,927
Ma'am! Ma'am!

336
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:23,972
Ma'am!

337
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,349
- [knocks]
- [music ends]

338
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,184
Am I going crazy?

339
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,019
I mean-- [sniffles]

340
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,146
Even earlier, when I woke up,

341
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,817
the room was a mess,
and I felt like I did it, but…

342
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,111
…I can't remember anything.

343
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,906
I understand why you might feel that way.

344
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,160
When we go through a traumatic experience,

345
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,789
it's normal to feel lost and confused.

346
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:55,504
It's not easy to deal
with intense emotional pain.

347
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,257
What happened in your room--

348
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,967
Those could be signs that

349
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,137
your body is acting out
something while you sleep.

350
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,598
Sometimes,

351
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:11,436
when we can't face
the pain while we're awake,

352
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,065
it comes out while we're asleep.

353
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:22,030
Your mind is trying to process
something it can't fully handle yet.

354
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:28,328
I know this is, very overwhelming.

355
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:33,292
We don't need to rush the process, okay?

356
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,211
Let's go back to those flashes of memory.

357
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,382
When you get them, what do you feel?

358
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,384
I freeze up. [inhales sharply]

359
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,095
It's like I can't move, I can't breathe.

360
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,097
- [panicked breath]
- [somber music playing]

361
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,266
It's like everything disappears.

362
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,935
The only thing I feel is fear.

363
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,647
Is that a panic attack?

364
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,275
Yes.

365
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,570
Those are symptoms of a panic attack.

366
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,907
[sobs] How do I…
How do I stop getting them?

367
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,659
I want to remember.

368
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,537
- [music turns tense]
- I need to remember.

369
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,165
So I can protect my son,

370
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,584
not just from my husband,

371
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,712
even from myself.

372
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,215
- [man 1] Ma'am, open the door!
- [man 2] Hurry!

373
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,675
- [man 3] Hurry!
- [man 2] Miss!

374
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,302
Ma'am!

375
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,887
Here's the key!

376
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,181
[tense music continues]

377
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,557
- Move!
- Come on, hurry!

378
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,060
Mrs. Montenegro?

379
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,771
She's not here.

380
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:45,238
[music becomes ominous]

381
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:05,008
[ominous music continues]

382
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,531
[ominous music continues]

383
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,632
<i>There are rumors</i>
<i>that Edong is coming here to Amurao.</i>

384
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,009
<i>That explains it.</i>
<i>It's because you're all here.</i>

385
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,345
<i>The police are on high alert for Edong.</i>

386
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:54,141
<i>So if he sets foot here,</i>
<i>he won't get away.</i>

387
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,978
<i>My brother's smart.</i>
<i>He could outsmart even the devil.</i>

388
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,314
<i>You really believe Lucas would</i>
<i>give up his own brother just like that?</i>

389
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,525
- [Edong chuckles]
- [phone clatters]

390
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,318
<i>Mel is missing?</i>

391
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,571
<i>Where is my wife? She didn't call you?</i>

392
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,115
<i>Oh my god! What if the man kidnapped her?</i>
