00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,279
Why didn't he take Seth?

175
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,161
We hid in the bathroom.

176
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,454
<i>Hurry! Hurry!</i>

177
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,872
<i>Let's go inside!</i>

178
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,750
[unsettling music playing]

179
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,087
Maybe he came in while we were in there.

180
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,382
But you didn't hear anything
outside the bathroom, right?

181
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,010
He didn't even try
to force himself in there.

182
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:59,599
[pensive music continues]

183
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,855
[Christina] Hon?

184
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,273
Edward?

185
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,066
Just a minute.

186
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,241
- I thought someone was going to get shot.
- Ma'am, hold on.

187
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,492
- Me too.
- Hold on.

188
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,703
- We should always stay alert.
- Ma'am, hold on!

189
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,582
Locsin, have
you checked the CCTV at Alice's house?

190
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,334
Hold on. Dalimit.

191
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,502
Have you checked the CCTV footage?

192
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,671
Not yet. We're just about to do so.

193
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,091
What do you mean?
You had it since earlier!

194
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,801
- Why haven't you checked it?
- Beth.

195
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,554
Just so you know,
something bad happened here earlier.

196
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,098
Some of the cops were
even sent to the hospital.

197
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,059
So please be mindful of your tone.

198
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,436
Well, my friend is getting paranoid.

199
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,605
So I'm hoping you can
speed up your investigation. Okay?

200
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,440
You really are something.

201
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,359
Yes, ma'am. Sure thing, ma'am!

202
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,778
I'll tell you when
something comes up. Okay?

203
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,446
Just please be patient.

204
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,991
We'll call Mrs. Miller after
we're done checking the footage.

205
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,826
Fine.

206
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:06,165
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [engine revving]

207
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,511
[suspenseful music continues]

208
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,442
- [winces softly]
- [suspenseful music fades]

209
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,944
[Anton] Babe?

210
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,654
- How are you feeling?
- [Mel exhales deeply]

211
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,908
Leave me alone.

212
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,996
[unsettling music playing]

213
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,498
[Mel breathing shakily]

214
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,918
Babe?

215
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,795
That's okay.

216
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,463
I'm not going to touch you.

217
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,341
I didn't know you were injured earlier.

218
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,177
[Anton] I'm so sorry.

219
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,348
Uh, Mrs. Montenegro?

220
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,016
[sighs awkwardly]

221
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,271
The results of your tests are back,

222
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,316
and you have a bruised liver.

223
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,822
Fortunately, it's only a grade 1 injury.

224
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,824
It could have been much worse.

225
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:26,620
So now, you really need to rest well

226
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:33,169
and allow your body to recover.

227
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:38,424
Please avoid alcohol and
non-prescription medications.

228
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:46,056
[unsettling music continues]

229
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,356
[doctor] Next time, be more careful, okay?

230
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,651
And you also mentioned, you slipped

231
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,279
and hit the edge of the table?

232
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,784
[music becomes tense]

233
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,795

235
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,593
[Mel sobbing]

236
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,886
[coughs]

237
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,804
[breathes heavily]

238

[tense music continues]

239
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,939
Mrs. Montenegro?

240
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,942
Babe?

241
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,822
That's not true, Dr.

242
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:48,744
[tense music continues]

243
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:14,186
[music becomes foreboding]

244
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,615
[car door closes]

245
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,159
[music fades]

246
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,369
Ma'am Esther.

247
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,955
Do you remember me?

248
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,708
[crickets chirping]

249
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,252
I'm Lucas Santiago, Edong's brother.

250
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,672
[ominous music playing]

251
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:53,934
[music becomes tense]

252
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,145
- What my wife means, Dr.--
- Slipped…

253
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,648
is an understatement.

254
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,525
[Mel giggles softly]

255
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,862
I've walked a lot of runways,
but the truth is,

256
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,906
I'm really clumsy. [chuckles]

257
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,700
Sometimes,
I even trip while just standing still.

258
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,579
[Anton exhales deeply]

259
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,122
That's true, Dr.

260
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,542
This isn't the first time
my wife's been hospitalized.

261
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,586
She's uncoordinated.

262
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,464
Thank you, Dr.

263
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,509
Tonight was supposed
to be a night of celebration.

264
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,470
And it still is.

265
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,013
Because you saved Mel.

266
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:37,186
[doctor] You just have
to be extra careful, okay?

267
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,898
If the hit
to your liver had been stronger,

268
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,068
it could have been
a severe or even a fatal injury.

269
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,988
It'd be a shame to waste
your big billboard on EDSA

270
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,907
if something happened to you.

271
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,911
It's already up?

272
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,957
- [breathes softly]
- [tense music continues]

273

[chuckles softly]

274
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,173
My wife will be more
careful next time, Dr.

275
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,095
She has so much she wants to protect…

276
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,139
with everything she has now.

277
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:19,353
[tense music continues]

278
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,778
- [music ends]
- [engine revving]

279
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,201
The police are unbelievable!

280
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,996
They still haven't
checked your CCTV footage.

281
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,999
[faucet running]

282
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,836
[sighs]
When did they say they'll do it?

283
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,213
They said they're starting soon.

284
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,800
But didn't you just
share access with them?

285
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,927
<i>We can still check the footage ourselves.</i>

286
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,221
[curtain slides open]

Sorry. Did that stress you out?

303
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,417
I know you don't want

304
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,794
<i>to see whoever broke into your house,</i>

305
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,965
<i>but this way, we can identify them faster.</i>

306
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,551
You'll all be safer, and so will Chloe.

307
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,430
You're right. [exhales shakily]

308
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,724

310
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:44,063
We're checked in at
Parkland Hotel right now.

311
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,816
We'll stay here
until the house gets fixed.

312
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,402
Okay, I'll come see you.

<i>What if he's telling the truth…</i>

318
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,142

- [exhales]
<i>- Go.</i>

354
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,107
[Edward] <i>Hmm.</i>

355
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,737
[somber music continues]

356
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,821
[Edward grunts softly]

[exhales]

358
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,541
<i>You have to make sure about Scott, Alice.</i>

359
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,711
<i>Love can be painful.</i>

360
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,254
<i>No matter how happy it feels,</i>

361
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,423
<i>it always comes with pain.</i>

362
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,636
<i>But that's not enough reason to give up.</i>

363
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,225
<i>I just want you to be sure…</i>

364
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,812
<i>before you throw away</i>
<i>something beautiful in your life.</i>

[handbrake ratchets]

369
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,428
[Erica] Isn't this Lucas's car?

370
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,434
He might already be inside.

371
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,770
[Esther grunts]

372
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:16,608
[music turns suspenseful]

373
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:32,916

374
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,298
- [Lucas] <i>I just want to make things right.</i>
- [Esther] <i>Stay away from me!</i>

375

<i>- Miss Esther!</i>
- [whimpers]

376
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,634
<i>Just say you're safe and alive!</i>
<i>Admit you lied about my brother!</i>

377
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,053
<i>People like you and your brother</i>

378
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,265
<i>are the reason this</i>
<i>country is drowning in darkness!</i>

379
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,349
<i>Monster!</i>

380
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,350
[Esther grunts]

381
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,852
<i>What did you do?!</i>

382
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,271
<i>Edong, he was at my house last night!</i>

383
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,981
<i>That's impossible! He's in prison?</i>

384
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,442
<i>I'm sure we'll see each other again.</i>

385
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,902
<i>Edong Santiago has</i>
<i>been leaving the prison!</i>

386
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,738
<i>Is he escaping,</i>
<i>or are you letting him out?!</i>
