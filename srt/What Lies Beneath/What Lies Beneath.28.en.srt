After everything I did, Attorney.
You dare call me a coward?

22
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,230
Then prove that you're not a coward.

23
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,232
Face me.

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,735
Oh, I'm definitely going to face you.

Wait. I'll find Esther.

Please, I'm begging you, don't hurt her.

65
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,095
Just give her back to us.

Wait, Edong.

What do you think of me, huh?

I know things haven't been
completely okay between us,

94
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,587
but I know how close
you and your brother are.

95
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,051
I was already planning
to tell you all of Dad's plans,

96
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,761

00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,359

105
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,703
What if Edong has Mel?

106
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,248
What if something bad happens to her?

107
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,542
No, let's not think like that.

108
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,672
But you know what, this is Anton's fault.

109
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,300
I can't believe he came here to Amurao

110
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,260
instead of calling the police right away.

111
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,846
He wasted so much time.

112
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,723
They could've searched for Mel sooner.

113
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:59,228
And I can't believe that he asked me

114
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,355
if I really don't know where his wife is.

115
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,233
It felt like he was
suspecting me instead of Edong.

116
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,612
Well, whatever his reason is,

117
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,322
I just want Mel found.

118
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,449
- Tch.

Mel's missing? What do you mean?

122
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,542
Your brother called me.

123
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,088
I think he has Mel.

124
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,508
He said that?

125
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,510
He didn't say it directly.

126
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,887
But that's what he implied.

127
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,682
[tense music playing]

128
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:43,231
So, are you trying
to check if I'm just putting on an act?

129
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,858
I don't know anything!

130
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:51,072
I'd never wish Mel harm. She's
the last person I'd want to see get hurt.

[tense music continues, fades]

132

Hello? I'm here in the lobby.

[ominous music playing]

135
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,387
I know you're friends with Mel.

136
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,140
But how can we ensure
you've on good intentions?!

137
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,685
You could only be
doing this to help your brother!

138
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,728
You know what? To hell with you!

139
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,773
Think whatever you want.

140
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,193
I already told you I'd help,
but if you only see me as your enemy,

141
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,861
there's no point in doing all this!

142
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,905
This isn't helping Mel either!

Attorney, you have
a package here at the reception.

Huh?

148
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,177
Who's the sender?

<i>There's nothing written here</i>
<i>except your name.</i>

150

00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,626
Is she at your place?

200
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,377
Mel?

201
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,046
Why would she be?

202
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,346

Anton, you're starting to be creepy.

214
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,246
Like I said, I don't know where Mel is.

281
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,530
[Lucas] <i>You're going to punish them?</i>

282
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,824

<i>She can't be dead!</i>

286
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,499
<i>Give me that! I knew it!</i>

287
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,419
<i>After watching your interview,</i>
<i>I knew this would happen!</i>

288
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,171
<i>I did that to protect you!</i>

289
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,090
<i>Then tell me, Attorney,</i>
<i>were you able to protect Mel?!</i>
