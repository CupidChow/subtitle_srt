12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,071
<i>You need to leave.</i>

[Mel] Seth's got
lucky on his ice cream trip.

16
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,834
It became a full-blown mall adventure.

17
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,004
How many hours did we spend
in the playground and the ball pit?

18
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,881
[Alice] You also had fun at the ball pit.

19
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,091
[chuckles] Well, I can't deny that.

20
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,968
I did actually enjoy it.

21
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,889
But I must warn you
that your son's a charming manipulator.

22
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,933
We could've had ice cream in the mall,
but he really wanted to be here.

Oh, I must've left it at the restaurant.

- I'm sorry.
- You left it? Wait, wait. I got it.

30

What?

42
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,619
I left her right here with Seth.

43
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,998
L-Let me call her.
I'm sure she's just around.

She wouldn't leave Seth just like that.

That's not her.

52
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,980
- Where did she go?
- [unsettling music playing]

53
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,357
Why did she leave her things?
Do you think she walked home?

Scott, you were the last one with her.

Tell me! What did you do to her, Scott?

57
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,662
Was she that afraid
that she felt the need to escape this?!

58
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,456
What? N-No, I didn't do anything.

59
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,582
Oh, come on, Scott.

been hurting her, I swear--

Why did Beth have to say that…

69
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,820
you were close with the missing kid?

70
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,532
Uh…

71
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,662
[exhales sharply] That's what…

72
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,540
Bianca's sister said.

73
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,711
Maybe she saw us
talk once or twice at church.

74
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,130
Maybe that's why
she thought we were close.

75
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,715
[inhales deeply]

Beth talking to me in private about it.

78
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,933
We realized too late
that Vangie was listening.

79
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,394
- Beth went after her, but--
- But she still asked you

80
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,230
if you had anything
to do with the missing girl.

81
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,899
Would a true friend ask that?

82
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,485
[ominous music plays, fades]

83
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,238
[Beth] If I could only
staple those gossipers' mouths.

84
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,948
I was just asking.

85
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,700
That Vangie told a lot of nonsense.

86
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,868
That's the problem.

87
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,995
Nothing's even official.
People are already overreacting.

88
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,123
And the others go to church together.

89
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,375
You know,
I'm sure it'll spread over Amurao.

90
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,460
I'm sure people won't
even get the full picture.

[pensive tune playing]

92
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,425

[clicks tongue]

94
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,514
I just want answers to my questions.

95
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,225
[Liezel] Beth?

96
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,810
Yeah.

97
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,355
Yeah. You know her. She's just frank--

98
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,523
Arrogant!

99
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,276
Arrogant is what she is.

100
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,654
[scoffs] She's
always so desperate to be right.

101
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,823
She doesn't care if
her friends are in danger.

102
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:33,077
If it weren't for her,
you wouldn't be the talk of Amurao!

103
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,664
This already happened to Louisa.
Now she's doing it to you.

104
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,917
She didn't mean to put me on the spot.

105
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,087
- I know Beth--
- But she doesn't know me!

106
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,631
[tense music playing]

107
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,133
She doesn't know what I can do.

108
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,596
Let's stop this now.

109
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,849
[sighs deeply]

110
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,643
What about your suspicions of Angelo?

111
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,107
Let's just forget about that.

112
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,235
Isn't that what you've
wanted right from the start?

113
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,239
But what if they're
really are hiding something?

114
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,494
[foreboding music playing]

115
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,419
Maybe it's all just a coincidence.

116
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,174
Maybe it really has nothing
to do with Louisa and Bianca.

117
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,470
You have that much
confidence in our friends, don't you?

118
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:36,474
[foreboding music continues]

119
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,024
Let's put an end to this
before things get messier.

120
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,694
[Celestino]
<i>You didn't see the killer's face?</i>

121
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,616
[young Erica] <i>No, but he has a scar</i>
<i>on his back that looks like a burn mark.</i>

122
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,036
[foreboding music crescendos]

[suspenseful music continues]

[music fades]

126
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,211
[Erica] Friend,

127
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,839
I'm sorry for bothering
you this late for updates.

128
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,342
[woman] <i>No worries.</i>
<i>It's my turn to make it up to you</i>

129
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,928
<i>for always disturbing</i>
<i>you during our college days.</i>

130
00:09:56,345 --> 00:10:01,183
So you're asking for updates
for Bagumbayan Prison anomalies.

131
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,143
<i>Yes.</i>

132
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,062
I was looking for news
updates about their case.

133
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,567
But all I found was about the hearing
and Edong Santiago's death.

134
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,486
My gosh, when Santiago died,

135
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,947
it's like the issue also died.

136
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,533
<i>As some congressmen put it,</i>

137
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,452
<i>that case is just a waste of time now.</i>

138
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,954
The committee would
actually prefer to just shelve it off.

139
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,748
Huh? But why?

140
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:28,252
Apparently, the detained prison officer
has stayed firm with his statement.

141
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,964
<i>He said he did it alone</i>
<i>and he only had one accomplice.</i>

142
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,343
<i>That was Santiago and he's already dead.</i>

143
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,846
So the way they see it,
the case is now pointless.

144
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,972
So what happens now?

145
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,768
When Morales and Ayoc
finish their preventive suspension,

146
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,561
will they not face criminal cases anymore?

147
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,896
<i>By the looks of it,</i>

148
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,399
it seems they may not
even face administrative cases.

149
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,151
Shit!

150
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,195
Here we go again.

151
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,324
The laws made to protect us
are now protecting them instead.

152
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,076
<i>Calm down.</i>

153
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,329
You still have to make those bastards pay.

154
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:08,668
Guard, please let me in, just this once.
I need to talk to Attorney Melendez.

155
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,671
- I'll be quick.
- Just come back tomorrow.

156
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,255
I won't take long.

157
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,715
I'm sorry, sir.
It's past office hours now.

158
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,260
Attorney Melendez! Wait a minute.

159
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,929
- Thank you, I owe you one.
- Attorney Melendez!

160
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,013
[woman] <i>Anytime!</i>

161
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,975
Attorney Melendez, please.
I'm begging you.

162
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,561
We really need your help.

163
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,814
Come on, please.

[unsettling music playing]

165
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,442
[Mel] Alice?

166
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,485
Alice!

167
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,529
Alice!

168
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,823
What's going on?
Why did you suddenly leave?

169
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,868
Alice, you scared us.

170
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,996
[unsettling music continues]

171
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,625
[Scott exhales sharply]

172
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,794
What's going on?

173
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,505
- Alice?
- I think she's sleepwalking.

174
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,674
[stutters] She-- what?

175
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,261
Yeah, Beth said she was sleepwalking?

176
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,971
Hasn't this happened before?

177
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,931
No! Never.

178
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,559
[unsettling music continues]

179
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,144
- Alice--
- Hey, no!

180
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,147
Don't wake her up!
You're not supposed to wake them up.

181
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,983
I read somewhere
that it could confuse and disorient her.

182
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,776
So, so what are we supposed to do?

183
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,445
Just let her walk off into the dark?

184
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,779
Is that what you're suggesting?

185
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,074
What are you suggesting?
That we risk freaking her out, Scott?

186
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,369
I'll just try to lead her back to the car.

187
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,999
[unsettling music continues]

188
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,724
Come on, Alice. Wake up.

189
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,976
- Alice--

00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,646

in a funeral procession!

00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,692
Alice!

[music fades]

194
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,453
My child has been missing
for three months now, Attorney.

195
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,164
Her name is Francine Valmoria.

196
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,337
I've been to the police station
almost everyday begging for their help.

197
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,341
I've asked them to find her
but they don't seem to be doing anything.

198
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:24,720
[dramatic music plays]

199
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,274
I don't know if…

200
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,070
you've seen this on the news.

201
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,865
She's one of the missing beauty queens.

202
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,827
[reporter] <i>Three months have passed</i>
<i>since the family reported…</i>

203
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,538
Lost Beau-Coneras.

204
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,373
I'm familiar with the case.

205
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,501
But what makes you think

206
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,211
that the police
officers are doing nothing?

207
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,379
Because if they're taking action,

208
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,757
then they would've found some trace of

209
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,593
information about where my daughter is.

210
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,555
Those police officers
have been paid off, Attorney.

211
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,975
They're being
controlled by someone powerful.

212
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,727
Who?

213
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,772
[dramatic music continues]

214
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,274
Laurence Kyo.

215
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,364
Master will be proud,
because of his three men,

216
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,741
only you have made senators cry.

217
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,535
And made a general wet his pants!

218
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,370
- [laughing]
- Don't forget that!

219
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,747
He thought he's the only guy with a gun.

220
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,541
Well, I also do!

221
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,251
- [gunshot]
- [maid screams]

222
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,838

223
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,756
- Hey, look at this.
- Huh?

224
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,174
- Well, cheers!
- Cheers!

225
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,554

00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,348
[Laurence] Keep drinking! Go on.

00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,683
[Erica] <i>Laurence Kyo?</i>

228
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,562
I haven't heard
his name linked to that case yet.

229
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,439
Because that's what he wants.

230
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,943
Laurence Kyo is rich and powerful.

231
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,112
That's why he's not
getting pulled into it.

232
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:11,201
Do you have evidence that he's involved
in your daughter's disappearance?

233
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,954
[dramatic music playing]

234
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,750
This is my last text
conversation with my daughter

235
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,251
before her disappearance.

236
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,337
I couldn't contact her since.

237
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,465
"DAD, LAWRENCE IS WITH ME.
SO I'M 100% SAFE.

238
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,133
DAD, PLEASE TAKE YOUR MEDICINE."

239
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,718
"YOU'RE STILL WITH LAWRENCE KYO?

240
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,929
I'VE BEEN WORRIED FOR 5 MONTHS
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN TOGETHER!

241
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,513
GET AWAY FROM HIM!"

242
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,015
"I LOVE YOU, DAD! LET'S HANG OUT TOMORROW.

243
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,351
DON'T WAIT UP FOR ME ANYMORE.
YOU CAN'T STAY UP LATE"

244
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,353
My daughter's a good kid, Attorney.

245
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,022
When we lost her mom,

246
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,565
I did everything I could for her.

247
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,442
I gave her everything she needed

248
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,736
to give her a good life.

249
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,904
[music fades]

250
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:47,988
But…

251
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,117
I guess it wasn't enough,
so she went with that guy.

252
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,330
She said in her last
text to not wait for her.

253
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,667
So instead of waiting,
I'm looking for her.

254
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,044
I'm going to get her back, Attorney.

255
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,173
I saw you during the hearing in Congress.

256
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,009
Your courage in exposing the issues

257
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,637
in Bagumbayan Prison really moved me.

258
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,308
So I hope you can
help us bring our kids home.

259
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,480
I admire what you're doing.

260
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,816
You're not giving up on your daughter.

261
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,069
I will help you.

262
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,657
I'll make sure the authorities
take the investigation seriously.

263
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,327
[inhales] We have two options.

264
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:42,251
First, we submit a request
to elevate the case to the PBI,

265
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,880
because of a conflict of interest
and the local police's failure to act.

266
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:51,802
Second, we conduct our own investigation.

267
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,846
Gather evidence

268
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,766
so we can petition for
a writ of habeas corpus.

269
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,435
Habeas corpus?

270
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,272
We have reasonable grounds to suspect that

271
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,483
Laurence Kyo is keeping
your daughter against her will.

272
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,361
A writ of habeas
corpus will legally require him

273
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,781
to respond to questions
about Francine's disappearance.

274

this is private property.

Um, sorry, please, just calm down.

She's back again!

She's been here before?

Yes! She just came out of nowhere!

312

Get her out of here!

You're not okay. You're scaring him.

Don't you dare touch my son!

You stay the hell away from us!

00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,617
When?!

354
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,495
That time you fell?! That was an accident!

355
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,538
[scoffs] You know
that's not what I'm talking about!

356
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,540
Then what do you mean?!

357
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,086
Stop talking in
riddles and tell me what I did!

358
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,338
You did something
to me while I was asleep!

359
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,424
- [ominous music playing]
- [Seth] Mommy!

360
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,219
Daddy!

361
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,513
[Seth sobs, sniffles]

362
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,100
Alice, let me take Seth.

363
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,977
Okay?

364
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,312
- [Seth crying]
- Seth, come on.

365
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,190
Come with Auntie Mel.

366
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,275
Hmm?

367
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,195
[ominous music continues]

368
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,282
[sobs]

369
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,950
[breathes heavily]

370
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,785
What the hell are you saying, Alice?!

371
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,037
[breathes heavily] I don't know…

372
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,292
I don't remember
what exactly you did, okay?

373
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,168
I don't remember what exactly you did,

374
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,837
but I know something happened, Scott.

375
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,047
My memories are vague but they're there!

376
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,841
They're there.
They've been there for months!

377
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,134
They've been haunting me!

378
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,344
They've been making me…
making me sleepwalk.

379
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,138
They've been keeping me up, waking me up.

380
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,140
[breathes heavily]

381
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,766
Alice, I didn't do anything!

382
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,144
I swear on my life, even on Seth's.

383
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,812
I haven't done this to you.

384
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,647
- I trusted you!
- [music becomes dramatic]

385
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,442
Oh god, I trusted you with everything!

386
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,901
I loved you, Scott!

387
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,945
I loved you, and… you abused me.

388
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,822
- [breathes heavily]
- [Scott stutters]

389
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,991
I don't know how to convince you!

390
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,826
What the hell is going on with you?

391
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,494
Please, Alice…

392
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,079
I am not the enemy.

393
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,665
If there's something
wrong, let's try to fix it.

394
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,250
I'll help you.

395
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,793
Alice, please. Let's just--

396
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,045
Get the hell away from me!

397
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,671
Scott, just go!

398
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,216
Just go!

399
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,802
Can't you see? She's breaking apart!

400
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,221
- Go!
- [Alice's breath quivers]

401
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,228
[sobbing continues]

402
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,313
Alice…

403
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,109
Alice…

404
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,655
- [music fades]
- Alice.

405
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,199
Beth. [sighs]

406
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,618
She hasn't spoken since Scott left.

407
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,244
I don't know what else to do.

408
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,497
[brooding music playing]

409
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,748
Alice?

410
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,666
Alice.

411
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,961
Alice, you know,
you can talk to us, right?

412
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,672
What happened?

413
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,800
Tell us what Scott really did to you.

414
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,347
Alice, please. We want to help you.

415
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:12,891
Alice…

416
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,393
Alice, it's me, Beth.

417
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,479
You've told me before

418
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,147
that you and Scott
are getting a divorce, right?

419
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:23,819
And you're scared
that you might lose custody of Seth.

420
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,947
[brooding music continues]

421
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,950
Alice, I know there's
something you haven't told us.

422
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,789
Alice, Mel and I are here for you.
You're not alone in this.

423
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,258
He ties me up at night.

424
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,595
I don't know…

425
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:55,100
what else he did to me while I was asleep.

426
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,813
I tried--

427
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,022
I tried looking for videos.

428
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,400
Maybe he was taking videos of me.

429
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,360
[Anton] <i>You'll be back in two weeks.</i>

430
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,446
<i>Or else, do you want me</i>
<i>to release my videos of you, too?</i>

431
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,614
<i>What videos?</i>

432
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,825
<i>Videos of how much of a monster you are…</i>

433
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,076
<i>in bed.</i>

434
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,746
But I didn't find any.

435
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,749
I couldn't find anything.

436
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,837
I tried to set up
a camera in the room. [sniffles]

437
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,631
I tried.

438
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,675
But somehow he knew.

439
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,427
[sniffles]

440
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,221
He knew because I didn't get anything.

441
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,849
[sighs]

442
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,226
And he kept on telling me

443
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,686
over and over

444
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,605
that he didn't do anything.

445
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,191
He didn't do it.

446
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,151
He didn't do anything. But no.

447
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,944
No, no. He did.

448
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:49,905
He did!

449
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,117
He must've done it because--

450
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,911
[sobs]

451
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,704
He can't say he didn't do it

452
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,956
because I remember it!

453
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,335
I remember it! Why am I remembering it?

454
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,087
- Calm down, Alice.
- [crying] Why can't I forget about it?

455
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,339
Hush now, hush now.

456
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,259
This is crazy! I'm going crazy!

457
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,679
[crying continues]

458
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,850
[brooding music continues]

459
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,862
<i>Lucas loved his older</i>
<i>brother more than anything!</i>

460
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,032
<i>You really think he'll just</i>
<i>accept what you did to him?</i>

461
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,036
<i>I did not hurt her,</i>
<i>and I will never hurt her.</i>

462
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,413
<i>But something is wrong.</i>
<i>I'm scared for Alice and for Seth.</i>

463
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,624
<i>I think you've told us</i>
<i>about these two trees.</i>

464
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,252
[Beth]<i> Are you sure you really</i>
<i>know the man you married?</i>

465
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,171
<i>Have some conscience, ma'am!</i>
<i>Bring Bianca out!</i>

466
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:52,634
<i>I'm not leaving until</i>
<i>you tell me where she is!</i>

467
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,594
<i>Bring my child back!</i>

468
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,263
<i>Damn you!</i>
