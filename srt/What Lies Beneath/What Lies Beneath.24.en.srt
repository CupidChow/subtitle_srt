I already told Tim to cancel it.

Ma, didn't the doctor
say it's not needed anymore?

47
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,453
Not needed, yes,
but it's still better to keep it elevated

48
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,079
so it heals faster.

49

Dear, if I were you,
I'd just listen to your mother.

Do you see those cops outside?

70
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,641
They're here because of us.

71
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,894
They're on guard
because the guy who chased us

72
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,397
and the intruder at Aunt Alice's house

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,731
are the same person.

74
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,650
What?! An intruder?!

75
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,110
Is Miss Alice okay?

She's fine.

Oh, the one in the hoodie?

80
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,911
The guy in the jacket is Edong Santiago!

81
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,456

who killed Mama's friend, remember?

Aren't my mother and
her friends the ones who sent him to jail?

85
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:03,553
The police said
he escaped and wants revenge.

86
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,346
Really?

87
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,889
It's true!

88
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,684
If that's true,
everyone in Amurao would know by now.

89
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,936
People here live for gossip.

90
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,688
My mother said

91
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,025
the mayor doesn't want
people in Amurao to panic.

92
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,693
That's why the police
are keeping it lowkey,

93
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,278
even though they're on high alert.

94
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,489
Bro, why are you still here?

95
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,825
Stay away from me for now.

96
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,952
I don't want to get
dragged into this again.

97
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,620
You're so cringe!

98
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,416
Besides, didn't he already see you
when he chased us?

99
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,876
So, you're already involved!

100
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,044
Seriously?

101
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,839
- Then I need police protection, too?
- [quirky music playing]

102
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,842
- You're not included.
- Why not?!

103

Bro, come on! Protect me!

104
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,639
Are we really doing the right thing?

105
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,974
Wouldn't it be better

106
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,728
if we followed Erica's suggestion
to stay at Alice's place?

107
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,022
Love…

108
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,232
The police are right there.

109
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,400

I'm just worried about Chloe.

112
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,616
You know, if I could,
I'd pull her out of school

113

while Edong's is still on the loose.

114

when that's going to happen.

115

At least, right now, Chloe's okay.

- Wow!
- Oh!

00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,128
- That's English! Where'd you learn that?
- Of course!

you up from school daily.

Oh, Ma.

234
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,125
Sir Edward talked to me yesterday.

235
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,627
About Miss Christina.

236
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,170
Oh.

237
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,089
So, how's she doing?

238
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,715
You just came from there, right?

239
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,301
You said you interviewed
her for one of your subjects.

240
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,762
You even said she was getting weak

241
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,972
and not in the right
state of mind anymore.

242
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:27,978
Her caretaker,
the one they trusted to look after her,

243
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,939
already left Amurao.

244
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:35,569
Sir Edward remembered
how patient I was during the interview,

245
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,863
so he offered me the job.

246
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,908
But it's your last semester.

247
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,326
You'll be busy.

248
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,995
I think I can manage.

249
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,623
It's not every day anyway.

250
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,334
And it's 700 pesos per day.

251
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,547
I can use it for my graduation, my thesis,

252
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,507
and even for law school.

253
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,056
Are you really sure
you want to be a lawyer?

254
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,559
Of course, Ma.

255
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,562
You know I've been
manifesting it for a long time, right?

256
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,232
I want to be as good as Erica.

257
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,487
Ma, can I message her?

258
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,033
I just want to ask if
she can visit sometime.

259
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,536
Ma…

260
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,831
Maybe you two can make peace.

261

It's been so long,

262
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,087

265
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,551
I don't feel like cooking anymore.

[sighs]

351
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,066
Mel…

352
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,986
What if we're wrong…

353
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,573
about putting Edong in jail?

354
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,993
[pensive music playing]

355
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,411
Well…

356
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:21,832
I will not let another man gaslight me
into thinking it's my fault again.

357
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,627
<i>We're not the ones to blame when men</i>

358
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,214
lose control, get insecure,
become angry, or go insane!

359
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,719
Whatever Edong thinks we "deserve"

360
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,763
is his problem, not ours.

361
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,474
Because no woman deserves this.

362
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,935
[pensive music continues]

363
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,020
No one.

364
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:54,531
[pensive music swells]

365
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,584
[music fades]

366
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:12,174
- [dramatic music playing]
- [vehicles honking]

367
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,596
[Marco] <i>You're using yourself as bait</i>

368
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,266
<i>instead of letting</i>
<i>the police set up their operation.</i>

369
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,978
<i>Are you a lawyer or</i>
<i>that action star Coco Martin?</i>

370
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,731
[dramatic music continues]

371
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,525
If this works

372
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,401
and I manage to get him to come to me,

373
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,070
he'll be caught faster.

374
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,156
No one else will have to get involved.

375
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,077
[Marco] <i>Hmm.</i>

376
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,538
<i>Like your ex-friends?</i>

377
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,124
<i>Do they even know</i>
<i>the sacrifices you're making?</i>

378
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,377
[sighs] Nobody's
playing martyr here, Marco.

379
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,047
My priority is to stop Edong's plans.

380
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,800
[exhales sharply]

381
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,468
You said it yourself.

382
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,054
[dramatic music continues]

383
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,098
We don't know his next move.

384
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,185
This is the only way
I think we can change that.

385
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,646
- [elevator dings]
- [music fades]

386
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,698
[tense music playing]

387
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,533
[elevator dings]

388
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,577
[elevator doors open and close]

389
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,840
[Marco] <i>It's pretty</i>
<i>obvious that this is entrapment.</i>

390
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,177
<i>Let's just hope Santiago isn't that smart.</i>

391
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,182
[tense music continues]

392
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,202
If my TV appearance worked,

393
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,913
he'll be furious and come for me.

394
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,585
[music becomes suspenseful]

395
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,563
[music fades]

396
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,732
[Althea] <i>How was Erica before?</i>

397
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,902
<i>Good thing you were there.</i>
<i>I'm sure you took good care of her.</i>

398
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:40,447
<i>Once you walk out of that door,</i>
<i>you're on your own.</i>

399
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,866
<i>Attorney Erica? She's so cool!</i>

400
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,078
<i>She can challenge a killer on live TV?</i>

401
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,623
<i>But why isn't she part of</i>
<i>building your dream house, Ma?</i>

402
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,208
[phone ringing]

403
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:56,380
[dramatic music playing]
