<i>That we're not really your friends!</i>

326

[young Alice] <i>I did that for Louisa!</i>

343
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,638
<i>So she could finally rest in peace!</i>

344
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,685
[young Beth]
<i>We did the right thing, okay?!</i>

345
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,979
[young Erica] <i>If</i>
<i>that was the right thing to do,</i>

346
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,606
<i>why do I feel like this?!</i>

347
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,899
<i>It makes me sick!</i>

348
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,068
<i>What you did was wrong!</i>

349
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,153
[young Beth] <i>"You"?!</i>

350
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,822
<i>Why?! Did you even speak up?</i>

351
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,866
<i>You said nothing, Erica!</i>

352
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,076
<i>You're one of</i>
<i>the reasons Edong will rot in jai!</i>

353
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,828
<i>Stop playing innocent!</i>

354
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,248
[young Alice] <i>Erica!</i>

355
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:25,544
[poignant music playing]

356
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,215
[young Erica] <i>Lucas, I tried!</i>

357
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,720
<i>I told them the truth but</i>
<i>they wouldn't listen to me!</i>

358
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,807
[young Lucas]
<i>I thought you were on my side!</i>

359
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,434
<i>I thought you were different, Erica!</i>

360
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,770
<i>But you're just like them!</i>

361
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,647
What are you doing?

362
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:50,861
[poignant music continues]

363
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,089
[music fades]

364
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,099
Erica.

365
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,107
[Mel] What do you want with Lucas?

366
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,111
The Santiago
brothers are planning something.

367
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,531
Esther Castro is missing,
and Celestino was murdered.

368
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,284
What I heard is that Esther's been hiding
because of her fraud case.

369
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,869
And Celestino was killed

370
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,539
by a syndicate he crossed before.

371
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,124
So, after 14 years,

372
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,043
it's just a coincidence
those two incidents happened?

373
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,004
Both were involved in Edong's case.

374
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,924
Wait, so you really think
Edong and Lucas are behind this?

375
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,885
I don't believe it's just coincidence.

376
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,388
You don't even have proof.

377
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,392
And still, you came here
and ambushed Lucas with that accusation.

378
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,519
You're concerned about
the lack of evidence now, Beth?

379
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,190
[Mel] I know Lucas.

380
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,733
He would never do what you're saying.

381
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,068
You know him that well?

382
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,573
[tense music playing]

383
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,716
[tense music continues]

384
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,217
[Erica] <i>I have a strong feeling.</i>

385
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,012
<i>And my instinct is rarely wrong.</i>

386
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,558
<i>If I'm right that Esther and</i>
<i>Celestino's cases are connected.</i>

387
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,351
<i>it only means one thing.</i>

388
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,107
Edong is coming after
everyone who wronged him.

389
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,235
So that means…

390
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,320
That includes us.

391
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,448
We're next.

392
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,493
[tense music continues]

393
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,208
But he's in prison.

394
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,500
But Lucas isn't.

395
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,921
And it's entirely possible
that Lucas is acting for him.

396
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,048
That's impossible, it's not Lucas!

397
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,636
[tense music continues]

398
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,471
Mel's right, it's not Lucas.

399
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,597
You know how I know?

400
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,682
Because you love connecting things

401
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,559
that were never
connected in the first place.

402
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,769
You should know.

403
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,229
You did the same thing.

404
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,816
What's up with you?!

405
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,027
Are you still hung up
on what happened before?

406
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,403
Aren't you?

407
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,366
You expect me to believe
that you sleep peacefully at night

408
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,368
after what we did to Edong?

409
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,204
Yes, because what we did was right!

410
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,831
And even after 14 years,
that will never change.

411
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,042
Because we did nothing wrong!

412
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,338
[tense music swells]

413
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:06,723
[music turns suspenseful]

414
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:26,285
[suspenseful music continues]

415
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,391
[inmate] <i>Santiago! You're being summoned.</i>

416
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,143
- [men grunting]
- [blows landing]

417
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,895
<i>When a law is broken,</i>

418
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,188
<i>there's punishment.</i>

419
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,940
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>your mother never told you</i>

420
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,483
<i>about what happened to her friend?</i>

421
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,568
<i>Stop!</i>

422
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,111
<i>Louisa!</i>

423
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,113
<i>It's all in the past,</i>
<i>but she's still digging it up!</i>

424
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,239
<i>If you're right, good.</i>

425
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,658
<i>But if I'm right, at least I warned you.</i>

426
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,201
<i>We didn't do anything wrong!</i>

427
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,788
<i>When something's wrong,</i>
<i>it needs to be made right.</i>

428
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,206
[grunts]
