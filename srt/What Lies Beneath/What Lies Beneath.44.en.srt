<i>He escaped from prison.</i>

30

Edong is gone.

No one could be there to take care of her,

Oh, she's the shyest of them all.

She'd stay in the corner.

And she'd speak no more than a few words.

- Mm-hmm.

I'm not sure.

00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,065
We've started the search,

182
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,194
and we've alerted
the Women and Children Protection desk.

183
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,280
Even the barangay, but to no avail.

184
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,241
We've advised the family
to post about it on social media,

185
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,327
in case someone recognizes the girl.

186
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,288
Do you think she just ran away?

187
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,333
Or could it be foul play?

188
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:12,463
Her mother said there's
no reason for her to run away.

189
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,341
She said she's sure
that her daughter was kidnapped.

190
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,300
[uneasy music playing]

191
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,011
For now, we can't really say for sure.

192
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,431
But the locals are certain.

193
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,309
We've got so many reports

194
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,813
that compare this case to Louisa's.

195
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,441
But that was so long ago.

196
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,818
And Edong is dead.

197
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,361
Ask your daughter.

198
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,530
Haven't you seen her post?

199
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:42,618
She started this theory
that Edong wasn't the real killer.

200
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,746
And that the murderer is still out there.

201
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,665
It blew up,

202
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,126
and now they assume that Louisa's killer

203
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,211
and Bianca's
kidnapper were the same person.

204
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,589
[uneasy music continues]

205
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,842
[Ryan] <i>I've talked to Locsin. </i>[sighs]

206
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,345
He said they haven't gotten
a lead on your student's case.

207
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,182
<i>Do you really think</i>
<i>Angelo's involved somehow?</i>

208
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,393
It's probably just a coincidence.

209
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:12,606
The kid went missing on the same night
we saw him holding a bloody knife.

210
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,776
- Is that a coincidence?
- [Bianca's mother] Carla, hurry!

211
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,071
- Wait, I'll call you back.
- [Bianca's mother] Let's go!

212
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,115
Good day, ma'am.

213
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:24,869
I'm Beth Mora, Bianca's teacher.

214
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,538
We're just worried about her.

215
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:31,292
If you need any help, just let me know.

216
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,921
[crying] We need all
the help we can get, ma'am.

217
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,259
We'd like to spread the post
about Bianca's disappearance.

218
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,889
Just in case someone
out there recognizes her.

219
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:50,561
So her kidnappers would
know they've got nowhere to hide.

220
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,399
Well… are you sure
that she was kidnapped?

221
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,487
There's no other reason, ma'am.

222
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:06,410
It's not like her to just leave
without telling us where she's going.

223
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,330
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry about Mama.

224
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,125
Miss Beth, you're
friends with Miss Liezel, right?

225
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,251
Yes, why?

226
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,795
- I know she's close with Bianca, too.
- [unsettling music playing]

227
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,924
I've seen them together twice before.

228
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,551
Are you sure it's Liezel?

229
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,932
Can you ask her if she knows
anything about what happened?

230
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,478
[unsettling music continues]

231
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,694
Liezel?

232
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,950
Liezel, I'm coming in!

233
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:55,543
[unsettling music continues]

234
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,721
[music fades]

235
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,185
- Beth, hi!
- Liezel!

236
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,771
- I brought some snacks.
- Alright. Come on in.

237
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,360
[uneasy music plays, fades]

238
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,572
[Liezel] Why did you leave so early?

239
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:29,368
I dropped by Bianca Seropon's house.

240
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,953
Ah.

241
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,455
The mother wouldn't stop crying.

242
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,166
- Aw.
- I feel sorry for her.

243
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,673
She doesn't even know
where to start looking for her daughter.

244
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,758
- Really?
- Yeah.

245
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,179
I offered them some
help since she's my student.

246
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,599
- Mm-hmm.
- Isn't she also in your class?

247
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,102
I don't really know her that well.

248
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,937
How about you?

249
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,231
Me neither.

250
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:04,820
[unsettling music plays, fades]

251
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,323
I don't remember how I got there.

252
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,535
All I remember is falling
asleep in Uncle's house…

253
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,122
then I woke up in someone else's backyard.

254
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,750
I didn't know whose it was.

255
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,252
I don't even know what place that is.

256
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,630
- I--
- [Isla] Breathe.

257
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,008
- Remember, you're safe here.
- [exhales sharply]

258
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,218
[pensive music playing]

259
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,638
Yeah. Yeah.

260
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,264
Would you like to pause here?

261
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,517
Or are you okay to keep going?

262
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,147
- Yeah.
- Okay.

263
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,026
Did you feel anything familiar?

264
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,278
Even just a bit?

265
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,033
[pensive music continues]

266
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,242
Not really.

267
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,206
I- I just remember feeling like…

268
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,335
like I've been crying for hours.

269
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,088
I…

270
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,134
The backyard somehow felt familiar, but,

271
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,679
I don't know.

272
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,097
I've never been there before.

273
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,891
It's okay not to know right now.

274
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,060
You're doing great.

275
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:24,942
Sometimes, our body
remembers what our conscious mind rejects.

276
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:31,407
Sleepwalking can be
your mind's way of leading us somewhere,

277
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,576
physically and emotionally.

278
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,829
[exhales sharply]

279
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,791
What if I went there for a reason?

280
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,585
[pensive music continues]

281
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,921
I've never been there before.

282
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,548
I don't remember anything.

283
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,303
All I know is it felt so heavy.

284
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,224
I don't understand. I mean--

285
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,436
How could this possibly
be connected to my husband?

286
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,770
[music fades]

287
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,149
- [giggling]
- Oh, dear! Oh, my gosh. Seth!

288
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,569
Nanny Rose!

289
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,613
- Come on.
- Miss Rose? Miss Rose.

290
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,365
Ma'am Alice has a visitor.

291
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,535
- Hi, I'm Scott. I'm Alice's husband.
- [foreboding music playing]

292
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,580
- Dad!
- Buddy! Come here.

293
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,208
- Daddy, I missed you.
- I missed you too, buddy.

294
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,087
[Alice] What is
he doing to me while I'm asleep?

295
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,424
If you say that my body remembers,

296
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,218
why does it have to be in this place?

297
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,970
[music fades]

298
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,764
Why in Amurao?

299
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,474
Far away from the US,

300
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,602
where he could possibly
be doing something to me?

301
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,062
Possibly hurting me?

302
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,107
Let's not force an answer just yet.

303
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,402
- [breath quivers]
- We can explore

304
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,154
your feelings here.

305
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,200
In this room,
where you feel safe and steady.

306
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,663
Maybe through
visualization and body mapping.

307
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,167
And if the sleepwalking happens again,

308
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,879
we can consider going back to that place.

309
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,673
But only once you're ready.

310
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,218
And you can't go there alone.

311
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:20,516
[eerie music playing]

312
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,065
I want--

313
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,943
I need to know.

314
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,362
[eerie music continues]

315
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,988
But I'm scared.

316
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,158
<i>You</i> set the pace, Alice.

317
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,247
Healing doesn't come
from forcing the truth out.

318
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,166
It comes from
feeling safe enough to face it.

319
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,502
Only when you're ready.

320
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,297
[music fades]

321
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,259
Where's Angelo?

322
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,053
He's out with Joshua to buy something.

323
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,681
You know how those boys bond.

324
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,934
Ryan texted him last night,
but he didn't respond.

325
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,895
Oh, yeah, he wasn't home.

326
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,065
He went hiking and got home so late.

327
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,901
What did Ryan text him?

328
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,196
He just asked if he wanted to drink.

329
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,283
Good thing your husband wasn't home, then.

330
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,954
Uh, Beth, I'll just go
to the restroom real quick.

331
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,248
I think I just got my period.

332
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,876
Start eating without me.

333
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,794
[footsteps receding]

[music ends]

336
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,241
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Good afternoon.

337
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,285
Where's Seth?

338
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,705
He's with Sir Scott, he took Seth out.

339
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,791
[foreboding music playing]

340
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,876
Scott?

341
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,128
[Rose] Yes, Sir Scott.

342
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,380
Didn't you know he was coming?

343
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,133
[huffs] Wait…

344
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,843
How long has it been?

345
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,555
Seth said he wanted some ice cream,

346
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,182
so they went out to get some.

347
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,517
How long have they been out?

348
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,811
[music turns dramatic]

349
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,188
Tell me!

350
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,732
Uh… Maybe a few minutes.

351
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,360
Oh my god.

352
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,986
Arnel?

353
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,572
- Arnel?
- [Arnel] Yes, ma'am?

354
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,699
- Let's go to the airport.
- Yes, ma'am.

355
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:47,162
[dramatic music continues]

356
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,084
Oh, god.

00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,795
[sighs sharply]

358
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,129
Let's go, buddy.

359
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,136
Where are we going, Daddy?

360
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,429
Can Mommy come?

361
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,015
Sorry, buddy. She can't.

362
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:12,354
[suspenseful music playing]

363
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:41,174
[suspenseful music continues]

364
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:05,991
[suspenseful music continues]

365
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:38,273
[suspenseful music intensifies]

366
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,983
[object scraping]

367
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:50,494
<i>I hope Bianca gets found soon.</i>
<i>I feel bad for her family.</i>

368
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,789
<i>Erica, please come home.</i>

369
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,499
<i>She might've been a good mother to you,</i>

370
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:59,211
<i>but that doesn't mean</i>
<i>I didn't suffer because of her.</i>

371
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,464
<i>I survived on my own.</i>
<i>I succeeded on my own.</i>

372
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,092
<i>Scott! Is that really you?</i>

373
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,344
<i>Why doesn't Mel know</i>
<i>we're in the middle of a divorce?</i>

374
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,221
<i>Does this mean that we have a chance?</i>

375
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,972
<i>That you have you changed your mind?</i>

376
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,766
<i>Alice, is there a problem?</i>
