I mean, seriously.

59
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,661
Amurao's only going to be
famous because of a serial killer?

60

Imagine that.

179
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,486
<i>Erica!</i>

180
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,241
- [somber music playing]
- [sobbing]

181
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,083
[music fades]

182
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,377
[Ernesto] This Edmundo Santiago.

183
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,172
He ended up in prison
because of you and your friends.

184
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,923
Is that correct?

185
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,009
That's correct, Mr. Chair.

186
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,761
Fourteen years ago,

187
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,346
when we were still in high school,

188
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,473
he was accused of murdering our friend.

189
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,892
On account of my friends' statements,

190
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,393
he was convicted and sent to prison.

191
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,563
Are you saying
he can get in and out of prison?

192
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,566
One of my friends saw him on
the CCTV installed at her house.

193
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,527
Not only that, he harassed
the daughter of another friend.

194
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:58,240
Furthermore, he sent the four of us,
a video, that he recorded himself,

195
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,118
killing NLEA Officer Rod Celestino,

196
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,162
the lead investigator for the case.

197
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:03,954
[Ernesto scoffs]

198
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,625
A PDL who can leave
the prison whenever he wants?

199
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,836
Is it now called
the Bagumbayan Prison Condominium?

200
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,754
[laughter]

201
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,422
Do lifetime sentences

202
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,634
come with a lifetime
ownership package? [chuckles]

203
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,677
Is this true, Warden Morales?

204
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,722
- [tense music playing]
- [Ernesto laughs]

205
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,602
I understand it must be
hard to believe that he could do that

206
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,979
without the prison management knowing.

207
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,984
[Ernesto] Your opinion
is not required, Attorney.

208
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,319
We are the committee.

209
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,821
We decide

210
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,824
what is hard to believe and what is not.

211
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,117
[tense music continues]

212
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,243
So, Mr. Chair,

213
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,453
is it easier for you to believe

214
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,539
that a mere prison officer

215
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,583
let Edmundo Santiago in and out of prison

216
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,336
without the knowledge of his superiors?

217
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,130
Do not get ahead of yourself.

218
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,549
This is a fact-finding mission,

219
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,301
and there is a proper process.

220
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,138
Stop trying to stage a courtroom drama!

221
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,809
[tense music continues]

222
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:17,736
- [birds chirping]
- [unsettling music playing]

223
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,738
Psalm 23.

224
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,451
"Even though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

225
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,162
I will fear no evil."

226
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,788
- [grunts]
- [passerby] My goodness!

227
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,623
Hey, what happened?

228
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,000
[Edong grunting]

229
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,751
[woman over speakerphone]
<i>Hello? Are you still there?</i>

230
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,630
<i>I asked if you'd seen</i>
<i>the report on the escaped prisoner.</i>

231
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,549
You're asking if I watch the news?

232
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,800
What for?

233
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,427
To get depressed?

234
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,095
Stressed?

235
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,138
No thanks.

236
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,183
[unsettling music continues]

237
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,018
[Edong groaning weakly]

238
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,395
I am not afraid.

239
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,023
I fear nothing.

240
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:58,402
They should be the ones afraid of me.

241
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,113
- [groans]
- [music crescendos]

242
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,491
Do we really need to…

243
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:08,287
revisit my memories from when I was a kid?

244
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,080
[Isla] Not necessarily.

245
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,751
There are times when
things like these come up.

246
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,963
I'm sorry
that you had to relive them, Alice.

247
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,927
Trauma doesn't go
away just because we survived.

248
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,304
If we don't process it,

249
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,973
it will find ways to resurface.

250
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,684
Like sleepwalking.

251
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,520
Yeah.

252
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,563
[clears throat]

253
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,940
Yeah. [sniffles]

254
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,441
Um…[breath quivers]

255
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:42,571
But what my husband
was doing to me in my sleep…

256
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,698
Can't we focus on that?

257
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,158
I mean,

258
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,785
that's what I want to confirm.

259
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,786
[mellow music playing]

260
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,664
Now I'm scared to sleep beside my son.

261
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,541
I'm just so scared.

262
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,335
I'm scared that I might
hurt him while I'm sleeping.

263
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,504
Your fear is valid,

264
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,549
but we should handle things one at a time.

265
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,051
Right now,

266
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,096
we focus on what
your mind is trying to show us.

267
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,723
Like the memories
that resurfaced a while ago.

268
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,724
[mellow music continues]

269
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,101
They're clues.

270
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,104
Once we figure out the patterns,

271
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,525
we can start connecting them to
what's happening to you during your sleep.

272
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,571
You've lost people
who were important to you.

273
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,948
There's your father's death.

274
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,741
It affected you deeply,

275
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,201
[mellow music continues]

276
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,620
just as your friend's death did.

277
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,998
Louisa.

278
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,251
Even now,

279
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,587
you still carry that weight.

280
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,338
Am I right?

281
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:47,636
But Louisa wasn't
the only friend you lost.

282
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,597
- There was also Erica.
- [music becomes morose]

283
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,392
I noticed the way you reacted

284
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,644
to the memory of her leaving you behind.

285
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:01,817
Did it feel like
betrayal when she left Amurao?

286
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:06,363
[morose music continues]

287
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,573
Maybe.

288
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,328
I guess.

289
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,664
Have you ever talked to her about it?

290
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,793
How you felt at the time?

291
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,712
[chuckles dryly] No.

292
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,881
[morose music continues]

293
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,758
We never got the chance to talk.

294
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,219
I mean, I tried.

295
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,306
I tried reaching out several times.

296
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,893
But nothing. [sniffles]

297
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,937
She never replied.

298
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,358
Just like that.

299
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,569
As if it was
so easy for her to forget about us.

300
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,947
[Isla] Alice.

301
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:53,577
Sometimes, closure
isn't just about what happened.

302
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,745
[exhales deeply]

303
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,705
It's about being heard.

304
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,792
Maybe a conversation with Erica,

305
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,047
where you can
finally say what you need to,

306
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,093
could help with your healing.

307
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,678
[exhales sharply]

308
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:15,432
[music becomes foreboding]

309
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,525
[distant bird chirps]

310
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,913
[foreboding music continues]

311
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:59,935
[foreboding music continues]

312
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,115
[music swelling]

313
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,994
[music fades]

314
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,167
- Attorney.
- Yes, hi.

315
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,336
Um… well, I just have a question.

316
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,796
I'm asking for a friend.

317
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,840
- Mm-hmm.
- Um…

318
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,258
What would happen,

319
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,177
I'm talking about the implications here,

320
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,221
if the other half of
a couple filed for an annulment?

321
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,683
Um, it depends.

322
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:44,021
First, does your friend and
their spouse have a prenup?

323
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,567
[attorney] Um…

324
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,195
If there's no prenup, it's automatic.

325
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,450
Their property regime is
Absolute Community of Property.

326
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,412
This means that everything they acquired

327
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,040
before and during the marriage

328
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,666
is considered conjugal.

329
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,418
Even if it's
registered under only one name,

330
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,170
they share it.

331
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,963
Fifty-fifty.

332
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,633
[uneasy music playing]

333
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,428
What about inherited properties?

334
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,222
[attorney] That's exclusive.

335
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,225
Donations registered under
one person's name are included.

336
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,602
But everything else is shared.

337
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,480
If there's a prenup, it's simpler.

338
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,107
What's yours is yours,

339
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,110
what's theirs is theirs. No liquidation.

340
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,695
Unless you bought something jointly.

341
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,906
But without a prenup,

342
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,951
if the court proves that one of you

343
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,120
acted in bad faith or fraud…

344
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:42,955
For example,

345
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,084
if the woman faked
a pregnancy to force a marriage,

346
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,837
then that person can lose their share.

347
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,380
[uneasy music continues]

348
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,631
Um…

349
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,924
How about…

350
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,885
Uh, let's say… domestic abuse?

351
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:01,890
Well, we can connect
that to issues of emotional abuse,

352
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,934
physical abuse,

353
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,936
habitual cruelty,

354
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,688
or controlling behavior.

355
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:11,859
Even just one of those
can support your argument

356
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,486
that your husband was in bad faith.

357
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,489
[exhales heavily]

358
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,909
[uneasy music continues]

359
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,327
Mrs. Montenegro.

360
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,372
Are you planning to file for annulment?

361
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,374
[chuckles dryly]

362
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,667
Absolutely not.

363
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,878
Well, like I said, Attorney,

364
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,963
I'm just asking for a friend.

365
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,214
[attorney] Of course.

366
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,091
[attorney inhales deeply]

367
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,302
I know who you are.

368
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,887
I recognize you.

369
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,680
Don't you worry.

370
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,434
This conversation stays between us.

371
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,269
Strictly confidential.

372
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:52,191
[ominous music playing]

373
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,913
[birds chirping, trilling]

374
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,961
[music fades]

375
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,087
[line ringing]

376
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,590
[phone ringing]

377
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,386
[ringing continues, stops]

378
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,680
[Lucas] <i>Hello, Edong?</i>

379
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,723
[chuckles softly]

380
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,143
[pensive music playing]

381
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,770
Lucas…[chuckles]

382
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,106
You're alive, Lucas.

383
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,151
Where are you, Edong?
Why didn't you call sooner?

384
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,529
Who were those men, Lucas?

385
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,073
[music becomes uneasy]

386
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,242
<i>They don't work for Marte.</i>

387
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,744
What have you gotten into?

388
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,746
That's not important.

389
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,915
<i>Tell me the truth.</i>

390
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,380
[music fades]

391
00:20:56,463 --> 00:21:00,884
Edong, it's hard to start
a business when you're a nobody

392
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,678
<i>with no money.</i>

393
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,180
<i>So I took a shortcut.</i>

394
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,475
Somebody helped me, but…

395
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,729
by the time I knew who he really was,
it was too late.

396
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,774
Who is it?

397
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,112
[Lucas] <i>Laurence Kyo.</i>

398
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,656
[tense music playing]

399
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,865
[exhales heavily]

400
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,951
[Edong] <i>The drug lord?</i>

401
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:31,540
I know him.
He has people in Bagumbayan Prison.

402
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,960
Why?

403
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,254
<i>Why, Lucas?</i>

404
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,881
You're supposed to be the good one.

405
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,428
<i>The one who knows better.</i>

406
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,598
I'm the criminal, not you.

407
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,644
[Edong breathing heavily]

408
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,773
<i>You know what, bro,</i>
<i>despite what I went through…</i>

409
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,235
I'm still grateful.

410
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:06,116
[music becomes somber]

411
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,077
Because you weren't
the one who experienced it.

412
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,664
Edong, I only did that for you.

413
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,166
<i>For you!</i>

414
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,336
<i>So I can get money to re-appeal your case.</i>

415
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:21,089
So you can be free
to get back the life they took from you!

416
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,175
[Edong] <i>I already told you, Lucas.</i>

417
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,470
Forget about me.

418
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,847
Go live your life.

419
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,140
How, Edong?!

420
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,726
<i>You're all I have left!</i>

421
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,773
Tell me where you are.
I'll get you out of there.

422
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,233
I'll take you somewhere
they can't find you.

423
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,361
[somber music continues]

424
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,362
<i>Edong!</i>

425
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,574
[birds chirping]

426
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,249
I love you so much, little bro.

427
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,170
Edong…

428
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:01,797
Edong!

429
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,801
Edong!

430
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,552
Edong!

431
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,224
Aah!

432
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:16,436
[somber music continues]

433
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:40,127
[somber music continues]

434
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,933
<i>You had me followed?</i>

435
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:55,934
<i>I am so nice to you.</i>

436
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,936
<i>I even let you</i>
<i>stay there with your friends.</i>

437
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,938
<i>Unless you're</i>
<i>planning something against me.</i>

438
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,898
<i>"My Bana." What does that mean?</i>

439
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:05,986
<i>I remember her writing</i>
<i>"My Bana, I love you."</i>

440
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,404
<i>The case has been closed, Attorney.</i>

441
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,030
<i>We've found what's rotten in the system.</i>

442
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,700
<i>It's only a matter of time</i>
<i>before Santiago's arrested.</i>

443
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,868
<i>They've found Edong!</i>

444
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,077
<i>If he won't surrender,</i>

445
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,079
<i>we'll catch him dead or alive as ordered.</i>

446
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,789
<i>- Are we clear? Let's go.</i>
<i>- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

447
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,916
<i>Freeze! Hands up!</i>

448
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,085
<i>They want Edong dead.</i>

449
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,170
[gunshot]
