<i>Mel, you have to see this.</i>

2
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:08,800
<i>You should post</i>

00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,844

<i>You don't know the whole story.</i>

8
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,059
<i>Your brother called me.</i>

9
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,311
<i>He said he saw Alice, Beth, and Mel on TV,</i>

10

11

40
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,757
<i>Yeah, to clarify,</i>
<i>I only punched his arm jokingly.</i>

41
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,134
<i>It was an affectionate gesture,</i>

42

Uh, so h-how exactly do I get a gun?

61
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,305
The first step is getting a license.

62
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,267
There are several requirements,
including a DNP clearance,

63
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,560
a drug test,
and a neuro-psychiatric evaluation.

64
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,271
You'll also need to attend a seminar

65
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,398
on gun safety and responsible ownership.

66
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,441
The rest of the requirements
are easy to complete.

Don't worry, we'll assist
you throughout the whole process.

68
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,614
So, how long will it take?

69
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,783
[store clerk] Two weeks at most.

70
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,827
Two weeks?

71
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,161
Yes.

72
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,082

00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,264
[man] Well…

78
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,726
I saw you on TV.

79
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,688
And I always see you here too, so…

80
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,898
I asked around about you.

81
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,572
You know…

82
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,492
a smart woman like you turns me on.

00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,244

00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,080
Good for you.

They say you're
a defender of the poor and the innocent.

87
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,423
And who told you that?

88
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,593
Pretty much everyone I asked.

89
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,390
[sighs heavily]
Well, I can assure you I'm not a saint.

90
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:50,892
In fact,

91
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,353
I can think of two
people who absolutely hate me.

92
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,982
- [pensive music plays]
- [man] Good.

93
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,192
Good.

94
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,402
Because,

95
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,029
in all honesty,

96
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,950
I'm not looking for any saint.

97
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:09,952

[pensive music continues]

99
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,876
Well, we expect that there
will still be negative reactions.

100
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,838
What's important is
that many support and defend you.

101
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,216
Good thing you both
have a strong following.

102
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:27,512
As long as you stay lovey-dovey in public,

103
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,598
I'm sure this issue
will die down eventually.

104
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,226
But please, no more black eyes.

105
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,061
It's really stressful.

106
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,396
Please, let's not go through this again.

107
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,689
Oh… [chuckles]

108
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:42,026
You should tell my wife
to stop being so moody with me.

109
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,987
You guys know I'm such a simp for her.

110

[Tom] I love Mel.

113
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,163
But gosh,
that girl's just so problematic.

114
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,374
Did you see how bitchy she was to Anton?

115
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,252
Imagine, pulling that kind of attitude

116
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,587
when her husband's
been nothing but patient with her.

117
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,006
And she's the one refusing to have a baby.

118
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,427
And did you hear the way
she talked to her mother-in-law?

119
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,971
I wouldn't be surprised

120
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:14,350
if it turned out
that Mel really punched Anton.

121
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,603
Babe, we cannot judge them.

122
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,397
You know that.

123
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,902
And it's so obvious
that they're lying to us.

- [tense music playing]
- [heavy footsteps]

125

[Beth] So, what's up?

126
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,957
You know I'm not going
to stop bugging you, Alice.

127
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,127
You really think I wouldn't notice, huh?

128
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,840
First, you freaked
out over some random car

129
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,177
and ran like something
bad would happen to Seth.

130
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,512
And now you're buying a gun?

131
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,474
Hey, tell me. What's really going on?

132
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,315
Hey, Alice, you better tell me the truth.

133
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,108
You're a terrible liar.

What?

140
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,913
Why? What happened?

141
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,873
We thought you were doing great.

<i>Yes, we were,</i>

147

<i>You know that I love you, right?</i>

150
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,517
<i>And I would never cheat on you, okay?</i>

151
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,977
[huffs] <i>I knew this would happen.</i>

152
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,230
<i>Your family never liked me.</i>

153

<i>They've always wanted you to marry her!</i>

154
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,650
<i>Is this it?</i>

155
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,610
<i>Is this you giving them what they want?</i>

156
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,154
<i>What? You're talking crazy!</i>

157
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,615
<i>Alice, will you please just listen?</i>

158
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,950
<i>I'm not cheating on you!</i>

159
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,243
<i>I want a divorce.</i>

<i>What do you want?</i>

162
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,041
<i>How many times do I have to apologize?!</i>

163

181
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,720
I think he's having an affair.

182
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,054
Seriously?

183
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,142

- [Alice sighs]

184
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,602
Are you scared?

- Is your husband hurting you?
- [exhales deeply]

Look, I'm just scared that

187
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,318
he'll take Seth away from me.

188
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,904
You know his family's really powerful.

189
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,031
He can,

190
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,491
sue for full custody and win.

191
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:22,121
I'm just scared that once
he gets his hands on Seth,

192
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,374
I won't see my son ever again.

193
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,796
But I won't let that happen.

194
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,758
Over my dead body, okay?

don't tell Mel.

198
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,850
She has problems of her own and…

199
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,269
I don't want this getting around.

200
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,940
Even Uncle Edward doesn't know.

201
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,906
Is that why you're
still wearing your wedding ring?

[solemn music playing]

203

[Anton] Do you need anything?

The helpers have gone home.

209
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,023

[breathes deeply]

214
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,925
Are you still mad
because I went out with a black eye?

215
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,889
If I can forgive you for giving it to me,

216
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,809
why can't you forgive me for that?

You know what?

219
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,160
Tim's right.

220
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,412
I have a strong following.

221
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,581
I have brands and clients who trust me

222
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,458
even before I met you.

223
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,711
I'll do fine without you, Anton.

[breathing shakily]

225
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,549
Let's end this.

226
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,304
I want out.

227
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,848
Out?

228
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,100
Out of this marriage!

229
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,394
Out of this whole thing!

230
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,438
Anton, I'm done.

231
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,107
I'm done.

00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,530
Mel, please?

234
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,033
You know I love you.

235
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,453
And no one will love you like I do.

236
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:08,996
[Mel scoffs]

237
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,873
Why can't you appreciate that?

238
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,669
Why is it always me
willing to work on this relationship?

239
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,047
Shut up!

240
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,882

241
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,426

245
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,943
You'll lose Grace & Glam.

246
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,074
What?

247
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,742
You heard me.

248
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,747
You don't control Grace & Glam!

249
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,958
I have a solid deal with Reema,

250
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,709
and we have a good relationship.

251
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,753
[Anton] Reema is
just the Creative Director.

252
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:01,757
You seem to forget that my family
is friends with the owners. [scoffs]

253
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,594
And they're actually
really mad and hurt, Mel.

254
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,014
They can't believe
you would do this to me.

255
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,060
In fact, Aunt Millette is just waiting.

256
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,729
One text from me

257
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,233
and she'll call Reema to drop you.

258
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,193
And find a new face for their brand.

259
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,863
You can't do that!

00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,197
[breathing heavily]

261
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,782
I don't want to, Mel.

262
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,785
But you leave me no choice.

263
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,621
You always do this.

264
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,667
You go crazy and try
to sabotage our marriage.

265
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,712
You don't even know what's good for you.

You need help, Mel.

You have issues.

276
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,641
You punched me a few days ago.

277
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,809
- You gave me a black eye.
- Fine!

278

Yes, I punched you.

00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,361
<i>I told you not to take any drugs!</i>

353
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,029
<i>Especially not with alcohol!</i>

354
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,615
<i>I did not take drugs!</i>

355
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,158
<i>How dare you!</i>

356
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,869
[Mel] <i>I was protecting</i>
<i>myself from you, Anton!</i>

357
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,541
<i>And you told all the staff</i>
<i>I was out of my mind because of drugs!</i>

358
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,084
[screaming hysterically]

359
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,045
[Mel] <i>And weren't you the one</i>

360
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,797
<i>who spread those rumors about me and John?</i>

361
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,091
<i>Because you were petty and jealous?</i>

362
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,802
It's not my fault, Anton.

363
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,764
I'm not the problem here.

364
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,890
You are!

365
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,684
You're the monster!

366
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,938
And the best thing for me to do
is get the hell away from you!

367
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,065
Go ahead. Leave!

368
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,153
Let's see if anyone
still supports you after that.

369
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,905
Once I go to town telling everyone

370
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,575
how you've been cheating
on me and abusing me for years!

371
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,617
[sobs]

372
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,869
This last incident?

373
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,496
It's the perfect setup, don't you think?

374
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,332
Let's see how many people believe me.

375
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:33,046
I'll tell all our friends,
all my family's friends.

376
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,424
And when I'm done…

377
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,510
no one will ever
want to work with you again.

378
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,512
Not Grace & Glam.

379
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,514
- Not anyone else!
- No!

380
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,059
- You'll be ruined!
- [sobbing] No!

381
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,270
You can't do that to me!

382
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,856
I can.

383
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,817
You know I can.

384
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,237
I'm Anton Montenegro.

385
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,699
I can do anything I fucking want.

386
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,619
[sobbing]

387
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,496
[dark music playing]

388
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,707
You're always so hardheaded, Mel.

389
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,084
You think you can leave me.

390
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,795
That you can survive without me.

391
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,843
But you need me.

392
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,470
[sniffles]

393
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,058
You'll be nothing without me.

394
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:29,311
[dark music continues]

395
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,104
I hate you!

396
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,649
I fucking hate you!

397
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,693
[screaming hysterically]

398
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,571
I hate you! Get away from me!

399
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,823
[bawling]

400
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,244
- You keep making me hurt you!
- [crying]

401
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,620
If you were a good wife,

402
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,497
we wouldn't have ended up like this!

403
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,916
- [blow lands]
- [Mel groans]

404
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,378
[sobbing loudly]

405
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,296
- [blow lands]
- [Mel groans]

406
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,385
[dark music continues]

407
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,140
[Edong] <i>Did you see what I saw too?</i>

408
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,688
Aah!

409
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,524
<i>Edong was right.</i>

410
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,735
<i>It's easy to be better,</i>
<i>but it's harder to forgive others.</i>

411
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,114
<i>Ester's disappearance and</i>
<i>Celestino's death were not coincidences.</i>

412
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,992
<i>Don't worry, Attorney. We'll meet again.</i>

413
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,243
<i>He's the one behind it.</i>

414
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,787
<i>He's going after</i>
<i>everyone who sent him to prison.</i>

415
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,830
<i>And we're next.</i>

416
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,624
<i>Me, Mel, Alice, and Beth.</i>

417
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,459
<i>Santiago is in Bagumbayan</i>.

418
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,795
<i>Unless someone's acting for him out here.</i>

419
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,921
<i>Maybe he has an accomplice.</i>
