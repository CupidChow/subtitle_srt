She shouldn't have kept it on her own.

We could have helped her.

So what if you lose something?

So…

111
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,257
He probably threw away the SIM.

Even if we file a cyber crime complaint,

113
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:12,390
he likely used a fake ID
to register the SIM.

181
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:34,712
[Erica sniffles, cries]

182
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,632
[somber music continues]

183
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,722
[music fades]

184
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,140
- [Frank] I'm fine.
- [Annette] Althea?

185
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,018
- Ma! What happened to Papa?
- Althea, help me.

186
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,561
- [Frank] Althea.
- Pa, what happened?

187
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,481
He got drunk on two bottles of beer.

188
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,858
- [Frank retches]
- Oh my gosh, Pa.

189
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,903
Why did you even drink?
You know you're a lightweight.

190
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,240
He let his friends sweet-talk him.

191
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,450
Now, look.

192
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,745
He'll regret this tomorrow.

193
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,335
- [Frank retches]
- Althea, thank you very much.

194
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,757
Um, I'm going to sleep.

195
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,802
[Annette] Althea?

196
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,723
[sighs] Althea…

197
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,273
I know your view--

198
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,317
Your view of me has changed.

199
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,530
You thought…

200
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,824
I was a good mother.

201
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,828
That you could never imagine

202
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,331
I could do what I did to your sister.

203
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,255
No matter what I say to you now,

204
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,174
it won't lessen my faults to your sister.

205
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,137
But… [breathes deeply]

206
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,639
back then…

207
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,310
I was so, so mad at…

208
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,062
at her father.

209
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,772
[melancholic music playing]

210
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,233
- [Althea sniffles]
- That's why I,

211
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,403
I took out all of that anger on her.

212
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,156
[Althea breathes shakily, sniffles]

213
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,077
But you…

214
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,877
You… Me being a mother to you,

215
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,796
your love,

216
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,048
your trust in me.

217
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,093
[melancholic music continues]

218
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,804
Those are what made my anger subside.

219
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,850
That's when I realized

220
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,020
all of the mistakes I have made.

221
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,398
[melancholic music continues]

222
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,777
I know that it's too late
for me to make it up to Erica.

223
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,948
But I hope that to you…

224
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,492
[melancholic music continues]

225
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,536
I hope I'm not too late.

226
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,625
[melancholic music continues]

227
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,587
Because I love you so much.

228
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,089
[sniffles]

229
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,137
- [breath quivering, crying]
- [crying]

230
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:39,980
[crying] Althea,
I'll accept all of your anger.

231
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,651
All of your disappointment in me.

232
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,781
Just please forgive me.

233
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,368
[sniffles]

234
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,120
I hope you find it in
your heart to forgive me.

235
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,582
[melancholic music continues]

236
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,210
I hope things between us remain the same.

237
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,547
[sniffling, crying]

238
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,677
[melancholic music continues]

239
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,932
[Althea] Ma…

240
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,865
[melancholic music continues]

241
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,339
[music fades]

242
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,049
[cicadas chirping]

243
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:53,095
I have faced
the most terrifying criminals,

244
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,348
police, and politicians.

245
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,440
All sorts of monsters.

246
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,656
But only my mother made me cry.

247
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,908
[scoffs]

248
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,499
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,961
For what?

250
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,469
I made such a big deal
about us having personal boundaries.

251
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,223
Only to have a breakdown in front of you.

252
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,645
- [sighs]
- It shouldn't have happened.

253
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,232
First of all,

254
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,860
you're only human.

255
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,863
You're not a superhero.

256
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,034
In front of me,

257
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,746
you can be human.

258
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,630
You were there at my lowest.

259
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,883
[tender music playing]

260
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,094
It's only right
that I be here for you now.

261
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,808
[Marco inhales deeply]

262
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:26,105
[tender music continues]

263
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,030
Why do you treat me like this?

264
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,618
Even when…

265
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,746
my mind's all over the place,

266
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,375
you still stick around.

267
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,087
[tender music continues]

268
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:59,847
[tender music intensifies]

269
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,938
[Marco sighs heavily]

270
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,690
You already know why.

271
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:17,531
[tender music continues]

272
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:47,102
[tender music continues]

273
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:12,461
[tender music swells]

274
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,987
[tender music continues]

275
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,702
- <i>You're not gonna leave, Daddy?</i>
<i>- No, bud.</i>

276
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,830
<i>We're going to be together.</i>
<i>You, me, and your mommy.</i>

277
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,374
<i>- Yay!</i>
<i>- Alright!</i>

278
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,209
[Beth] <i>Are you 100 percent sure?</i>

279
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:56,088
<i>You haven't resolved</i>
<i>your trauma and nightmares in therapy yet.</i>

280
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,590
<i>Scott didn't do anything wrong.</i>
<i>He would never hurt me.</i>

281
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,510
<i>I know the look of</i>
<i>a man who truly loves his wife.</i>

282
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,805
<i>Did you lend your place</i>
<i>to Mel while you were away?</i>

283
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,306
<i>She said she was in this building.</i>

284
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,475
[Tin] <i>She may have visited someone else.</i>

285
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,185
<i>Lucas Santiago lives here too.</i>
