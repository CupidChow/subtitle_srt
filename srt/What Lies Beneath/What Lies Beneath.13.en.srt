Good thing it was just a sprain.

61
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,365
Just monitor to see
if she's feels any pain,

62
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,868
and within one to three weeks,
it should be back to normal.

We've got nothing against him.

183
00:12:55,858 --> 00:13:00,112
He got traumatized too, but
he still covered the hospital expenses.

184
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,198
What about
that bastard who was chasing them?!

185
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,575
Shouldn't we have
reported him to the police?

186
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,577
What if he does that to someone else?!

187
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,622
What if he does it to Chloe again?!

188
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,624
What if he does something even worse?!

189
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:16,670
Hmm, I'll talk to Chloe if you're
serious about filing a report.

190
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,713
- [breathes sharply]
- [clicks tongue]

191
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,508
What if the car hadn't stopped in time?!

192
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,760
What if it had been a truck?!

193
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:23,677
Love.

194
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,679
Love, relax. Calm down.

195
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,014
[inhales deeply]

196
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,600
Love. Chloe's safe.

197
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,685
That's the important thing.

198
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,772
[clicks tongue, sighs sharply]

199
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,442
I can be brave about many things,
but when it comes to Chloe…

200
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,527
[inhales deeply]

201
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,780
[clicks tongue] Love.

202
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,657
That's just how it is.

203
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,201
[clicks tongue]
You're the best mom, you know.

204
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,244
Mm?

205
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,537
[smooches, grunts softly]

206
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,498
- You know what?
- Mm?

207
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:58,504
Alice and Mel said
they never imagined I'd become a mother.

208
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,631
Honestly, me neither.

209
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:05,010
Back then, I only cared
about my studies and career.

210
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,095
[Ryan sighs]

211
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:11,517
I never thought I could feel
something like this for my future child.

212
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,019
[Ryan clicks tongue, inhales deeply]

213
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,272
Love. [exhales deeply]

214
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,400
Chloe just came into
our lives earlier than planned.

215
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,736
Many of our plans took a sudden turn.

216
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,700
But every time I look
at you and our daughter…

217
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,912
I don't think I'd change a single thing.

218
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:36,709
[tender music playing]

219
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,960
[sniffles]

220
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,713
I'll just go check on Chloe. [sniffles]

221
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:46,510
[tender music continues]

222
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,889
[music becomes tense]

223
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,932
[breathing shakily]

224
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,976
[door creaking]

225
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,812
[breathing shakily]

226
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:02,067
- [tense music continues]
- [breathing shakily]

227
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:16,665
[tense music continues]

228
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,553
- [door creaks open]
- [breathes shakily]

229
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:34,433
[tense music continues]

230
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:55,204
- [seashell curtains clinking]
- [music turns sinister]

231
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,250
[door creaks open]

232
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,301
[sinister music continues]

233
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,530
[sinister music continues]

234
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:48,132
[sinister music continues]

235
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:10,362
[sinister music continues]

236
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,830
- [glass shatters]
- [screaming]

237
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,707
- [Rose] <i>This way, come on!</i>
- [screaming, breathing heavily]

238
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,293
<i>- Come, in here!</i>
- [panicked breathing]

239
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,336
- [Alice screams]
- [Seth sobs]

240
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,964
[sinister music continues]

241
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:37,514
[sinister music intensifies]

242
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,313
[music becomes suspenseful]

243
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,743
[clattering]

244
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:01,205
[suspenseful music continues]

245
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,930
[suspenseful music continues]

246
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:31,318
[cackling]

247
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,530
- [laughs maniacally]
- [music fades]

248
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:39,368
[ominous music playing]

249
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,538
[faint maniacal laughter]

250
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,921
[ominous music continues]

251
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,062
[ominous music intensifies]

252
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:20,033
- [phone ringing]
- [music turns foreboding]

253
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,327
Hello?

254
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,874
Alice? What happened to her?

255
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,294
[overlapping police radio chatter]

256
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,587
[cop 1] Mrs. Miller?

257
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,463
Mrs. Miller, it's the police!

258
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,757
Mrs. Miller?

259
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,010
We're here to help you, Mrs. Miller!

260
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,679
[Rose] Help! Please help us!

261
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,473
[cop 1] Search the area.

262
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,436
[dark version of
"Sabay Sabay Tayo" playing]

263
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,645
[breathes nervously]

264
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,274
[distant siren wailing]

265
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:57,070
[indistinct radio chatter]

266
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:01,783
[dark version of
"Sabay Sabay Tayo" continues]

267
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,704
Where's Alice?

268
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,040
[Rose] Here. This way, ma'am.

269
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,209
[music fades]

270
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,376
Alice?

271
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,087
- [murmuring] You can't take my son.
- [glass shattering noise]

272
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,716
- [unsettling music playing]
- I won't let it happen. I won't allow it.

273
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,259
You can't take my son.

274
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,136
Get away from me.

275
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,097
- You can't hurt my son.
- [glass shattering noise]

276
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,265
Get away from me.

277
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,142
Alice, are you okay?

278
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,145
- Hey.
- I just… I can't.

279
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,149
[unsettling music continues]

280
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,194
- You'll never have him.
- [Edong's laugh echoes]

281
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,446
Never in a million years.

282
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,572
No…

283
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,532
You can't take away my son.

284
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,910
- [breathing heavily, sniffles]
- [laughing continues]

285
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,662
Over my dead body.

286
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,999
<i>Alice, what exactly happened?</i>

287
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,376
<i>Did you see his face?</i>

288
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,336
<i>Any distinguishing features?</i>
<i>Anything you remember?</i>

289
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,965
<i>He was laughing,</i>
<i>like he was toying with us.</i>

290
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,716
<i>He gave off creepy vibes right away.</i>

291
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,302
<i>He had a cap on,</i>
<i>so we couldn't see his face.</i>

292
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,428
<i>I think it's all connected.</i>

293
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,472
<i>If there are two suspects,</i>
<i>they must be working together.</i>

294
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,475
<i>We made that promise</i>
<i>to each other, didn't we?</i>

295
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,811
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

296
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,938
<i>I'll make sure to see it through.</i>

297
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,982
<i>Our plan stays.</i>
