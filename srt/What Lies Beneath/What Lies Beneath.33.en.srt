Uh, I'm just finishing
a draft for Attorney Maravilla.

I see.

24
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,752
Finish it quickly so you can go home.

25
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,712

Yes. [chuckles]

Did you hear that, Seth?

Yeah, Auntie Mel is
going to be here tonight.

And Mommy and Auntie Mel
are going to be talking all night.

That's why you have to sleep

Okay, meet with them there.
Bring Mando and Bogs.

Tell me, was he in
your car the day he escaped?

138
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,058
Sit up.

139
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,436
Where is he?

140
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,771
Where?!

141
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,398
[stammers] I'll tell you.

142
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,817
I'll tell you, sir…

[dramatic music continues]

144
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,489
Where?

[Steve] <i>You have to go and drive to</i>

We're at the right house.

153
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,400
We asked around about
the initial 'L' in Louisa's watch,

154
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,027
but we didn't get any leads.

155
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,366
Maybe this old memory
that came to me, this "bana…"

156
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,119
It might lead to something.

157
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,580
<i>Bana?</i>

158
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,667
Isn't that a Bisaya word?
It means "spouse," right?

159
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,003
- Male spouse.
- Hmm.

161
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,591
Whoever Louisa's boyfriend was,

162
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,011
I think they were
planning to leave Amurao together.

163
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,972
That's why she didn't
tell us she was leaving.

164
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,686
- [Marco sighs]
- What if she changed her mind?

165
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,857
What if she backed out of their plan?

166
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,775
[water continues lapping]

167
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,652
So, he killed her?

169
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,573
Do you think he knows something?

170
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,205
I hope so.

Oh, okay. Call me when
you and Jing-Jing get there.

What are you doing here?

188
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,307
Leave.

189
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,101
You told me
that Louisa was leaving Amurao.

190
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,480
- Was she leaving with someone?
- [pensive music playing]

191
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,689
Did you know who it was?

192

<i>Erica.</i>

193

196

<i>Yes. Didn't she tell you?</i>

197

<i>She's leaving Amurao.</i>

198
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,668
No. She was leaving on her own.

199
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,673
I think Louisa had a boyfriend.

200
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,552
Did she ever mention
the word "bana" to you?

201
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,097
I think it might be their pet name--

202
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,891
Why are you asking these questions?!

203
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,146
[Ayoc] We'll find
him faster if we split up.

Lemuel,

227
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,494
I'm looking for Louisa's real killer.

228
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,540
They already caught my sister's killer.

229
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,877
They sent him to prison.

230
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,004
He would've died in there

231
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,757
if that rotten prison hadn't let him out!

232
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,676
Lemuel, Edong didn't kill her.

233
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,303
What's your problem?!

234
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,766
Why are you and your friends
trying to acquit that bastard?!

235
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,852
If the police hadn't pressured you,

236
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,271
if the people of
Amurao hadn't turned on you,

237
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,024
you wouldn't have
testified against him, right?

239
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:47,655

That.

That's Louisa's, isn't it?

244
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,091
<i>Lemuel!</i>

245
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,096
<i>Aren't those Louisa's things?</i>

246
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,432
<i>We didn't ask for them,</i>
<i>but the police returned them to us</i>

247

249
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,313

250
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,733

252

I have left of Louisa's.

But all I want is
to seek true justice for her death.

You and the rest of Amurao were appeased
