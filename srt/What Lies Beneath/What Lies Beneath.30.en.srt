Did something happen?

Was Aunt Mel there too?

31

What about Attorney Erica,
was she invited?

32
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,047
You ask too many questions.

33
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,342
How about you finish
your homework first, huh?

34
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,261
It's hard to bond with you, Papa.

35
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,472
Come on, finish that, okay?

[scoffs] Why do you ask that, dear?

39
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,617
<i>But mama, why isn't</i>

40
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:06,371
<i>She doesn't visit like</i>
<i>Aunt Mel and Aunt Alice do.</i>

41
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,832
<i>Because we lost</i>

I'm just curious, Pa.

52

They're kind of like our Wi-Fi.

53

When you stop paying,
you get disconnected.

54
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,661
I have the right to remain silent!

55
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,497
Dear, ask your mom about that stuff, okay?

56
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,707
Talking about Wi-Fi…

57
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,917
you just want
to find out if they really fought.

58
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,752
