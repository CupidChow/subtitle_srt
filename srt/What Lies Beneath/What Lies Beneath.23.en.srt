[dramatic music resumes, swells]

177
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,099
[Erica] I'll just record this.

178
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,892
[music fades]

179
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,186
Alright, please tell me
everything that happened.

180
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,147
Everything you can remember.
Every detail is important.

181
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,819
At first, when we met his ex,

182
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,988
she seemed fine.

183
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,323
She was nice and sweet,

184
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:36,328
but we also noticed
she had a quick temper.

185
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,247
And she was extremely jealous.

186
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,958
That's why they were always fighting.

187
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,835
Then…

188
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,463
he started feeling suffocated
because of how possessive she was,

189
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,718
so he decided to end things.

190
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,053
But the woman refused to accept it.

191
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,888
She was so obsessed with my son.

192
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,349
Wherever he went, she followed him.

193
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,020
To the grocery, to work, even to church.

194
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,523
One time, around one in the morning,
she came to our house

195
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,652
and left funeral
flowers on top of his car.

196
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,863
But no matter what she did,

197
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,240
Robbie refused
to get back together with her.

198
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,325
So, maybe

199
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,953
that's the reason she went to the police

200
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,665
and filed a complaint
saying my son was stalking her.

201
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,710
But she was the one who actually did

202
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,378
everything she said in that report.

203
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,006
- She just twisted the story.
- [pensive music playing]

204
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,258
And the police believed her right away.

205
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,470
Who would even believe that,

206
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,224
men can also be
victims of stalking these days, right?

207
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,810
But, Attorney--

208
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,646
Attorney, my child is a man.

209
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,733
Who would believe that he's the one…

210
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,736
that he's the one
who can't eat and can't sleep

211
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,489
because of all the stress and anxiety?

212
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,659
Who?! Who would believe
that he can't even leave the house

213
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,245
because he's afraid
that woman might be out there?!

214
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,748
That she might do
something to him anytime?

215
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,793
[pensive music continues]

216
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,753
<i>You're next.</i>

217
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,633
<i>Is he going to mess with our heads</i>
<i>before he kills us all?</i>

218
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,053
[Beth] <i>So,</i>
<i>how long can the NLEA protect us?!</i>

219
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,763
<i>Can they handle it for a few weeks?!</i>

220
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,389
<i>What if this drags on for months?!</i>

221
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,016
<i>What about our lives?!</i>

222
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,060
[Louisa] <i>Don't let anyone else</i>
<i>be next after me.</i>

223
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:28,649
[pensive music crescendos]

224
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,736
- Oh, here she comes.
- Atty. Melendez is here.

225
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,530
Attorney, is there
a new lead on the whereabouts

226
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,031
- of the escaped inmate?
- [camera shutters clicking]

227
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,825
In Warden Morales's latest interview,

228
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,870
he said your allegation of
an anomaly inside the prison has no basis.

229
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,916
Uh, thank you all for coming
on such short notice.

230
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:50,379
I just want to clarify my connection
with the escaped inmate, Edmundo Santiago.

231
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,340
[tense music sting]

232
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,385
14 years ago…

233
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,514
<i>Edong Santiago brutally murdered</i>
<i>my friend Louisa Soria.</i>

234
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,518
<i>My witness testimony</i>
<i>was what sent him to prison.</i>

235
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,020
That's why he wants revenge.

236
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,105
[sinister music playing]

237
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,315
[Erica] <i>He is a very disturbed individual.</i>

238
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,819
<i>So, everyone needs to be wary of him.</i>

239
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,282
<i>If you spot him,</i>
<i>report it to the police immediately.</i>

240
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,285
<i>Edong, let's not drag this out.</i>

241
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,787
<i>I'm the one you want.</i>

242
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,040
<i>Don't involve anyone else.</i>

243
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,459
<i>Don't hide.</i>

244
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,254
<i>Don't be a coward.</i>

245
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,589
[camera shutters clicking]

246
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,591
I'm not afraid of you.

247
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,512
[Erica] <i>If it's me</i>
<i>you want, I'm right here!</i>

248
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,933
Face me instead!

249
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:50,147
[music becomes dramatic]

250
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,966
<i>That guy in the jacket is Edong Santiago!</i>

251
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,136
<i>The police said</i>
<i>he escaped and wants revenge.</i>

252
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,972
<i>Aren't my mother and</i>
<i>her friends the ones who sent him to jail?</i>

253
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,515
<i>I'm not afraid of you.</i>

254
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,892
<i>Face me instead!</i>

255
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,977
<i>With what she's doing,</i>
<i>she's only making Edong angrier!</i>

256
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,521
<i>My priority is to stop Edong's plans.</i>

257
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,815
<i>What if we were</i>
<i>wrong to have him imprisoned?</i>

258
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,069
<i>We're not the ones to blame</i>
<i>when men lose control,</i>

259
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,279
<i>get insecure, become angry, or go insane!</i>

260
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,949
<i>So, whatever's going on in Edong's head,</i>
<i>that's his problem!</i>

261
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,075
[screams] <i>Help me!</i>
