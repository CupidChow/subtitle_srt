00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,503
<i>Your brother's a huge problem.</i>

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:05,005
<i>You need to find my brother</i>

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:08,383
<i>before the police or Laurence Kyo do.</i>

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,595
<i>My daughter keeps on</i>
<i>asking me about what happened.</i>

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,806
<i>That night Louisa died…</i>

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,892
<i>Do you think Louisa would be mad that</i>

7
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,103
<i>I've spent so many</i>
<i>years trying to forget her?</i>

8
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,312
<i>Can you really do that?</i>

9
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:25,233
<i>Even if I could,</i>
<i>Edong would never let us forget.</i>

10
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:29,863
<i>It's not easy to deal</i>
<i>with intense emotional pain.</i>

11
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,281
<i>How do I stop getting them?</i>

12
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,324
<i>You even took my ATM and credit cards.</i>

13
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,201
<i>You'll take away everything I have</i>

14
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,912
<i>so I can't do anything without you?</i>

15
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,707
<i>Remember, you don't need anything else.</i>

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,167
<i>Just me.</i>

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,713
[unsettling music playing]

18
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,341
[door closes]

00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,218
[music fades]

20
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,520
[door opens]

21
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,526
[shoes squeaking]

22
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:29,464
[unsettling music playing]

23
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,634
[security] Sir, good morning.

24
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:36,596
No matter what happens,
don't ever let her leave, okay?

25
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,556
- [security] Copy, sir.
- Alright.

26
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,772
[music becomes suspenseful]

27
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:01,079
[suspenseful music continues]

28
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,601
Hi! I need an ambulance!
Someone overdosed!

29
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,521
We're at 23 Belle Residences in Alabang.

30
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,815
[panicked breaths]
Yes, yes, she's still breathing.

31
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,860
I don't know! She took a pill!
Just send someone over, quick!

32
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,111
[receiver clatters]

33
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:44,122
[theme music playing]

34
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,447
That's the list Lucas Santiago provided.

35
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,243
It doesn't matter. Let's have it checked.

36
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,287
He'll cooperate in
exchange for his brother's life.

37
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,414
Isn't that what we agreed on?

38
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,417
We need to capture Edong Santiago alive.

39
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,963
He's our lead to what's really
happening inside Bagumbayan.

40
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,508
Thanks.

41
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,055
[exhales, sighs deeply]

42
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,225
Do you think Lucas will
hand his brother over just like that?

43
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,269
We might just be a distraction

44
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,688
while he executes his own plan for Edong.

45
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,482
I know he has his own plan.

46
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,193
But if he's working with us,

47
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,947
it'll be easier for us to find it out
and keep an eye on him.

48
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,325
[man] <i>Sir, what do you think?</i>

49
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,244
<i>Did they fall for it?</i>

50
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,373
Do you think they believe you?

51
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,791
I doubt it.

52
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,837
The important thing is we've
gained access to their investigation.

53
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,924
If I learn anything new,
I'll send it to you right away.

54
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,592
<i>Alright, sir.</i>

55
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,137
<i>But that list you provided,</i>

56
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,598
do you really think your brother
hasn't gone to any of those places?

57
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:13,563
He won't go anywhere that has to do
with the two of us and Mama.

58
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,024
[uneasy music playing]

59
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,567
My brother's smart.

60
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,032
He could outsmart even the devil.

61
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,368
[uneasy music continues]

62
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,997
Sir, the door was
locked when the medics arrived.

63
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,957
She was gone when we got here.

64
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,835
I think she's the one
who called for an ambulance.

65
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,714
[music becomes tense]

66
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,007
You think?!

67
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,886
I hired you because you're
supposed to be good at your freaking jobs!

68
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,221
But she was able to get away,
just like that?!

69
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,850
- Find her now!
- They're patrolling the area.

70
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,019
Mrs. Montenegro can't have got far.

71
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,897
Damn it!

72
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:02,236
[tense music continues]

73
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:25,760
[music intensifies]

74
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,556
[Mel] "<i>You can't control me.</i>"

75
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,359
[tense music fades]

76
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,654
People are saying
Edong is coming here in Amurao!

77
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,030
They say he's going to take revenge!

78
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,198
Only on Erica?

79
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,618
Beth, weren't all four of your friends
involved in locking him up?

80
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,247
And his timing is spot-on!
Just as Alice returned to the Philippines!

81
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,875
He's definitely coming, you're all here.

82
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,918
[inhales in frustration]

83
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,838
The police are
already on high alert for Edong.

84
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,550
So when he sets foot here,
there's no way he'll get away.

85
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,552
But he already got away, didn't he?!

86
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,011
He's just roaming around freely.

87
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,264
Didn't they even have a video

88
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,100
of Edong standing outside Alice's place?

89
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:18,187
My cousin got it from
her friend whose husband's a cop.

90
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,523
You couldn't even warn us, Beth?

91
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,442
Your family's got protection,

92
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,236
while the rest of us
who might get dragged in have nothing!

93
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,696
At least show some concern!

94
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,322
Hang on!

95
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,867
Why am I suddenly being attacked here?

96
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,203
Nobody told me
there'd be a scolding session

97
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,247
right after the morning flag ceremony.

98
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,666
By the way, why involve my family in this?

99
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,752
And where is
the mayor in all this blame game?

100
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,380
After all,
it was his idea to keep things quiet

101
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,758
so it wouldn't escalate and scare people.

102
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,926
Huh?

103
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,845
Did we keep the issue a secret?

104
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,180
Of course not.

105
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,725
And just because
I didn't warn you personally,

106
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,102
it suddenly looks like
I don't care about any of you?

107
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,729
Is that how it goes now?

108
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,647
It's all over the news!

109
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,774
The internet and talked about on TV.

110
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,068
Just stop trying to be
the center of attraction, Beth.

111
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,447
Amurao has never known peace
because of you and your friends' nonsense.

112
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,740
[scoffs]

113
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,452
Nonsense?

114
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:19,415
You think my friend's death meant nothing,

115
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,126
and that locking up
her killer didn't matter?

116
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,337
If we hadn't done that,

117
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,881
someone else could've been next!

118
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,883
Mind you, we were just kids,

119
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,219
and yet we protected this entire town.

120
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,387
Tell me, Vivian.

121
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:37,016
What have you done for this town,
besides spreading gossip?

122
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:46,734
[uneasy music playing]

123
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,626
[uneasy music fades]

124
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:10,508
[foreboding music playing]

125
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,801
Good morning, sir.

126
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,514
[Anton] Is Mel here?

127
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,932
Where is my wife?

128
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,309
Huh?

129
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,311
Wasn't she supposed to be at your house?

130
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,772
Why, Anton? What happened?

131
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,651
[music turns dramatic]

132
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,570
I went out for a run earlier.

133
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,530
When I got back, she was gone.

134
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,116
Didn't she call you guys?

135
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,039
Oh my god!

136
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,958
What if…

137
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,460
that man kidnapped her?

138
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,838
[dramatic music continues]

139
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,591
[panicked breathing]

140
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,842
[dramatic music fades]

141
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,220
[school bell ringing]

142
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,265
[sighs]

143
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,226
Liezel!

144
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,561
[door closes]

145
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,313
Sorry we didn't get
a chance to talk earlier.

146
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,897
They totally ganged up on me.

147
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,733
Uh… [chuckles awkwardly]

148
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,318
Yeah, I saw it.

149
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,278
[huffs] So annoying, right?

150
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,072
I mean, Vivian and
the way she manipulates people?

151
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,032
The nerve of that woman.

152
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,575
- Uh, Beth?
- Oh?

153
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,660
I forgot to mention,

154
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,412
Angelo's coming home soon.

155
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,956
Really? I thought he'd be back next month.

156
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,374
Just change of plans.

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,129
It's alright. We really miss him a lot.

158
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,882
So, I was hoping…

159
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,801
to focus on his return.

160
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,056
Can we avoid all the talk about Edong?

161
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,682
Ah.

162
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,227
It's not that I don't care about
what you've been going through.

163
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,687
- [breathes deeply]
- [pensive music playing]

164
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,231
It's just that whenever his name comes up,

165
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,275
it triggers something in me.

166
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,613
I get frantic,
just like everyone else around me.

167
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,990
I don't want to end up like Vivian.

168
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,076
Especially now
that my husband's coming back.

169
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,370
This should be a happy time.

170
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,747
Of course.

171
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,208
I get it. You have nothing to worry about.

172
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,376
Okay.

173
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,543
[pensive music continues]

174
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,213
Anyway, I left
something at the faculty office.

175
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,632
- Alright then.
- See you around.

176
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:19,845
[music becomes uneasy]

177
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,766
[music fades]

178
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,811
Oh no, bro!

179
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,063
That's so super scary!

180
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,481
It is scary!

181
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,234
You know what else is scary?

182
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,361
That creep who chased us,

183
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,071
was none other than Edong Santiago!

184
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,447
- [Joshua stamps foot]
- [all gasping]

185
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,658
A killer born right here in Amurao!

186
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,243
[boy] OMG!

187
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,328
Mommy and Daddy
were just talking about him!

188
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:48,082
Apparently,
he's mad at Miss Beth and her friends

189
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,501
for sending him to prison!

190
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:54,630
That's because he killed
my mom's best friend, Louisa!

191
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,383
[ominous music playing]

192
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,176
What if he comes back to Amurao

193
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,095
and takes revenge on your mom?

194
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,138
Don't worry!

195
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,140
Mama can handle that lame guy.

196
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,142
She already had him locked up once.

197
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,476
[teacher] Good afternoon, class.

198
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,187
- [boy] Sir.
- [music fades]

199
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,567
[all in unison] Good afternoon, sir!

200
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,651
Please be seated.

201
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,904
Please get a half sheet of paper.

202
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,824
Bro.

203
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,285
Why did you say it was Edong?

204
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,246
Miss Beth told us not
to tell anyone else, remember?

205
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,291
Everyone already knows he escaped.

206
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,460
What's the point of keeping it a secret?

207
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,050
[pensive music playing]

208
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,263
Arnel, stop here for now.

216

- Any minute now!

- Hi, ma'am!
- Morning, Ma'am Beth!

Good morning.

- Someone please wake me up!

- Ma'am, you called for me?

Oh, Mrs. Mora!

250
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:46,427
Your friend has come to visit you.

- [man] I'm innocent!
- [cop] Keep walking!

254

The police looked into
the two people Lucas listed.

255
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,905
Nothing came up,
but they said they'll still keep watch.

[melancholic music playing]

259
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,828
So far, there's no sign of Edong.

260
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,829
<i>Okay.</i>

261
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,581
Wait for me. We can go home together.

262
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,665
No need.

263
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,542
Security personnel
are all over the building.

264
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,085
Not to mention, the cops guarding outside.

265

266
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,673

Where are you, Edong?

271
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,274
First, I went to Alice's place,
but she wasn't there.

272
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,736
- Her security wouldn't let me wait inside,
- [music fades]

273
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,113
so I figured I'd drop by here.

[inhales deeply]

275
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,954
I'm sorry this was short notice, Beth,

276
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,206
and I know we haven't met formally yet.

277
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,793
My wife's told me a lot about you.

278
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:06,173
There has been so many times,
I've wanted to visit with Mel,

279
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,467
but my schedule never worked out.

280
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,222
But Mel's not here, and you are.

281
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,098
Why?

282
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,101
Did Mel call you?

283
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,352
[unsettling music playing]

284
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,812
Would you know if…

285
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,356
she was hanging out with Alice right now?

286
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,652
I was trying to call her,
but she wasn't picking up.

287
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,489
And I doubt she's currently with Alice.

288
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,533
What's wrong?

289
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:34,535
[sighing]

290
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,662
She headed out early…

[unsettling music continues]

292
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,415
to go for a meeting.

293
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,209
But she never arrived.

294
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,796
And with the situation
that's going on right now,

295
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,297
I'm worried.

296
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,425
That…

297
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,510
something happened to her.

298
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,721
Why didn't you inform us earlier?

299
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,222
Did you file a police report already?

300
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,183
I haven't told the police yet.

301
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,893
Maybe it's just false alarm.

302
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,937
You're aware of
our situation with Edong, right?

303
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,648
A false alarm is
better than the alternative!

304
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,733
Hang on.

305
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,069
You really don't know where she is?

[music fades]

310
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,591
Thanks for your time.

311
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,344
Wait a minute!

312
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,680
What about Mel?
What are you planning to do?

313
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,516
Don't worry. I'll keep looking for Mel.

- Hmm?
- When can we go back to Daddy?

317
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,077
Why, baby?
Are you not happy with Mommy anymore?

318
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,538
No, but I miss Daddy.

Mel is missing?

331
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:54,424
Yes. Anton went to see Beth earlier.

332
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,385
He said Mel left home this morning,

333
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,429
but she didn't arrive at the meeting
she was supposed to arrive at

Her husband just let her leave alone?
