00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,403
Did you hear what
those people inside said?

14
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,949
If you stay here, they'll target you.

15
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,954
I'm not leaving until I get
good news about my brother.

16
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,587
Just call me if you run
into any problems with them.

17
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,924
I'll continue pressuring them for updates.

18
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,470
Marco will also stay here
to monitor their movements.

19
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,181
[Erica] Lucas, don't worry.

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,183
His network is wide.

21

If anything happens…

22
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,730
here or in another precinct,
we'll know right away.

23
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,195
You always used to be like this.

00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,574
Even if it was the whole day,

25
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,118
or even if you had
to search all of Amurao,

26
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,537

What my brother went
through hurt even more.

He was raped in prison.

33
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,567
He was only 19 years old
when they put him inside.

34
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,945
He didn't stand a chance.

35
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,075
What happened to him
was done over and over again.

36
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,370
And you're saying he's mentally unstable?

37
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,334
Who wouldn't lose
their mind if that happened to them?

38
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,337
Celestino, Esther,
and all of you friends…

39
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,674
You're the reason
that happened to my brother.

40

What you're doing…

41
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,604

I've been letting him talk

What more does he want?

51
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,231
[sighs] And I already told you,

I'm fixing the house here.

Are you sure there are sex videos?

76

He might have made
that up just to scare you.

00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,388
I wouldn't be surprised.

78
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,557
Making things up is just what he does.

79

But if they actually exist…

80
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,148
I won't even bother looking for them

81
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,817
because I'm sure
he already made other copies.

82
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,195
You can use that evidence against him

Ma'am, someone might hear you.

He cheated twice,

he was forgiven twice,
and he still managed to cheat again.

135
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,142
His wife even caught him.

136
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,810
Some nerve, right?

00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,405
<i>Ma, is what you said earlier true?</i>

174
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:19,035
<i>That Louisa and Angelo</i>
<i>worked at that coffee shop</i>

175
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,911
<i>that only served instant coffee?</i>

176
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,079
[scoffs]

177
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,873
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

178
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,374
<i>You didn't know?</i>

179
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,461
<i>I think they worked</i>
<i>there for about two months.</i>

180
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,670
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

181
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,340
<i>The year before you graduated.</i>

182
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,092
<i>I always saw them there.</i>

183
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,261
<i>And your other friend, that…</i>

184
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,554
<i>…was it Liezel?</i>

185
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,474
<i>She always waited</i>
<i>for Angelo to get off work.</i>

186
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,602
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

187
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,687
<i>Why don't I remember that?</i>

188
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,773
[chuckles] <i>Because, you know…</i>

189
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,442
<i>that place is memorable to me.</i>

190
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,736
<i>My ex and I always had our dates there.</i>

191
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,946
<i>Tall, dark, and handsome.</i>

192
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,657
[giggles]

193
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,325
<i>We were always at that coffee shop.</i>

[pensive music playing]

195
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,745
Nothing.

196
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,747
I just got lucky with my husband.

197
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,459
Right, Ma'am Beth?

198
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,631
[exclaim, giggling]

199
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,554
[pensive music fades]

200
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,349
Ah Beth, you're going to be late.

201
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,685
Oh, I just finished
checking the kids' essays.

202
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,812
Mm.

203
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,486
Did Louisa and Angelo
work together at Coral and Coffee?

204
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,196
[clatters]

205
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,367
[unsettling music playing]

206
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,077
And didn't you go there a lot too?

207
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,662
Uh.

208
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,955
Yeah, I remember.

209
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,958
But I think she only
stayed there for a short while.

210
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,460
Maybe that's why
I didn't really talk to her much.

211
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,420
Why?

212
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,131
No reason.

213
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,341
Mama and I were just talking about Louisa

214
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,510
because of this situation with Edong.

215
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,388
Oh, okay.

216
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,057
W-Wait, I…

217
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,642
I just forgot something.

218
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,728
[Liezel sighs nervously] Ma'am Jane?

219
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,983
They were saying all kinds
of things about Louisa.

220
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,819
One even called her an addict.

221
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,988
Mama and Papa were furious.

222
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,115
I honestly thought
Mama was going to transform.

223
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,659
She was so angry she kicked them out.

224
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,119
Even I got scared.

225
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,414
It's like I saw her
angry for the first time today.

226
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,627
That's why I want
to post Louisa's story on TikTok.

227
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,005
So people will know she's real.

228
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,257
And she won't just become a ghost story.

229
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,926
She doesn't deserve that.

230
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,761
You think you're close?

231
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,017
She's a real person.

232
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,311
Not just some random story.

233
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,938
She was one of Mama's best friend and

234
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,483
they're all still affected by losing her.

235
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,693
That's how special she was to them.

236
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,573
But Mama told me not
to post anything about her.

237
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,535
Even asking questions
about Louisa is off-limits.

238
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,663
[sullen music playing]

239
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,831
Ah.

240
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,082
Is that why you were
acting weird yesterday?

241
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,710
You got told off by Miss Beth?

242
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,796
[music turns dramatic]

243
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,258

[Yuri] <i>Sir?</i>

245
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,514
<i>I just heard back from my contacts.</i>

246
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,307
They said that based on the stream flow,

247
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,768
your brother might've been
washed into one of three places.

248
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,605
<i>Santa Dolores River,</i>
<i>Amorsolo Dam, or Tayabas Bay.</i>

249
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,814
<i>But don't worry,</i>

250
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,900
I've already sent people to search.

251
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,402
Let's do everything we can.

252
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,198
We can't rely on the police for this.

253
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,576
We won't stop until we find my brother.

254
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,083
[music fades]

255
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,918
Are you still okay staying there?

256
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,963
Even just for tonight.

257
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,715
<i>The first few days are</i>
<i>the most active for the search.</i>

258
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,551
We need eyes in that area.

259
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,428
You're doing too much for Edong already.

260
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,431
If Lucas still can't find him,
that's his problem.

261
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,143
<i>I know Lucas said something to you.</i>

262
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,145
Whatever it is,

263
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,774
don't let it get to you.

[tense music playing]

265
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,363

271
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,517
<i>You're the reason</i>

- [young Alice] <i>Yes.</i>

[Marie] Oh my god!

286
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:48,864
Wow, Beth! This coffee shop got huge!

287
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,950
And look at this! Here! Over here!

288
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,952
You know, this wasn't here before.

289
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,290
Wow, they really expanded. So fancy now!

290
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:03,295
It's huge! I'm sure their coffee
isn't instant anymore, right?!

291
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,217
Ma, do you think
the owner will still remember Louisa?

292
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,514
You know dear, Vangie, she is so sharp.

293
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:17,643
When it comes to gossip,
she knows everything happening here!

294
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,312
And she doesn't forget a thing!

295
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,523
- Really?
- Mm-hmm! She's different!

296
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,275
So, speaking of Vangie.

297
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,653
Stay there, just wait. Wait.

298
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,571
Hi, Vangie!

299
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,035
- Marie!
- Yeah!

300
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,746
I knew it was you!

301
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,416
Of course! You know this
beauty here is one of a kind, right?

302
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,419
- [Marie] Come on! Mm-hmm…
- Ah!

303
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,505
Ah! He looks younger and more handsome

304
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,632
than the one you had before.

305
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,800
- Shh!
- [chuckles]

306
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,427
You know, we got to level up.

307
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,015
You're the reason
the gossipers here are obsessed with you.

308
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,185
You know, I even
moved to another place, right?

309
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,312
They still talk about me.

310
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,232
[Marie] Maybe it's just jealousy?

311
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,317
- That's part of it, I'm sure.
- [Vangie chuckles]

312
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,570
No wonder you're all single.

- Oh!

316
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,576
- By the way, Vangie,
- Mm.

317
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,578
this is my daughter Beth.
Do you remember her?

318
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,623
- Of course! Hi, Ma'am Beth!
- Hello.

319
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,083
She's my grandchild's teacher.

320
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,753
Ah, right. [chuckles]

321
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,715
She wants to ask
you something. Is that okay?

322
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,341
- What?
- Yeah.

323
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,470
Alright… Okay,
go ahead, talk to her first.

324
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,013
We'll wait there.

325
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,057
Yay! Let's go. [giggles]

326
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,641
Thank you.

327
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,978
[sighs heavily] Mm-hmm.

328
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,689
Your mom's something else.

329
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,566
I'm used to it.
She's always been like that.

330
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,903
- Miss Vangie.
- Mm?

331
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:55,491
Do you remember if
Louisa Soria worked here?

332
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,909
The one who passed away?

333
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,912
Yes, for a few months.

[uneasy music playing]

335
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,129
[woman] Attorney, you have a visitor.

336

Visitor?

[uneasy music continues]

338
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,567
[Erica] Alice.

339
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,820
What are you doing here?
Did something happen?

340
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,907
I'm sorry, I know this is sudden, but…

341
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,244
I need to talk to you.

342
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:46,625
<i>Sometimes, closure</i>
<i>isn't just about what happened.</i>

343
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,794
[Isla] <i>It's about being heard.</i>

344
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,338
<i>Maybe having that conversation with Erica,</i>

345

<i>where you can</i>
<i>finally say what you need to,</i>

346

[uneasy music fades]

348

at the same time as Angelo Martinez?

00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:16,530
Yes. Angelo started a few
months earlier and stayed longer.

350
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:20,659
[unsettling music playing]

351
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,330
Did they… Ss…

352
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,457
Were they close?

353
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,173
[unsettling music continues]

354
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,385
Yes! They were clearly too close!

355
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,098
[unsettling music fades]

356
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:49,104
[chairs clacking]

357
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,775
- [young Angelo] <i>Louisa. Look.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

358
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,152
[laughs]

359
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,279
<i>Your hand is shaking!</i>

360
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,573
<i>Hold your hand still, I can't see.</i>

361
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,366
[laughing]

362
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,703
<i>- What's so funny?</i>
- [young Angelo] <i>It's funny!</i>

363
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,872
- [Louisa] <i>I guess it's funny.</i>
- [laughing]

364
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,918
<i>You're laughing so hard,</i>
<i>your hand is shaking!</i>

365
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:11,919
[young Liezel] <i>Partner!</i>

366
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,423
[young Angelo] <i>Partner!</i>

367
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,844
[young Angelo] <i>What are you doing here?</i>

368
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,096
<i>I'm picking you up. Can you leave now?</i>

369
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,266
<i>Yes, of course. Right, Louisa?</i>

370
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,852
<i>Sure. How are you?</i>

371
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,479
<i>I'm okay.</i>

372
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,650
[young Liezel] <i>Come on, partner.</i>

373
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,819
[unsettling music resumes]

374
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,755
[young Angelo] <i>Partner, let's go.</i>

375
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:01,468
[music becomes somber]

376
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,893
[Beth] So you're saying…

377
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,436
Yes.

378
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,067
Louisa was the other woman, side chick,
side piece, mistress of Angelo.

379
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,445
[unsettling music continues]

380
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,948
[Beth] <i>"My Bana, I love you!"?</i>

381
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,700
[Mel] <i>And you think that's her boyfriend?</i>

382
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,036
<i>If she had a boyfriend,</i>
<i>then why'd she keep it a secret from us?</i>

383
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,664
[Marco] <i>Maybe he was older or married.</i>

384
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,250
<i>- You have a boyfriend?!</i>
<i>- It's a secret!</i>

385
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:37,713
[unsettling music intensifies]

386
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,765
<i>- We believe Edmundo Santiago is dead.</i>
<i>- Why don't you tell the truth?!</i>

387
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,560
<i>That shot my brother</i>
<i>even though he was unarmed!</i>

388
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,187
<i>Edong!</i>

389
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,023
<i>Sir, Ma'am just left.</i>
<i>She came out of a condo in Manila.</i>

390
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,025
<i>Find out who she visited there.</i>

391
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,486
<i>I thought I could finally</i>
<i>give you and Edong justice,</i>

392
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,656
<i>but I shouldn't stop, right?</i>
<i>I need to know the truth.</i>

393
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,200
<i>You chose to support Beth's lies.</i>

394
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,620
<i>You chose to turn a blind eye</i>
<i>instead of facing your problems.</i>

395
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,040
<i>- Can mommy come?</i>
<i>- Sorry, buddy. She can't.</i>

396
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,709
<i>Louisa and Angelo</i>
<i>could've been in a relationship.</i>

397
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,462
<i>I think Liezel knows,</i>
<i>and she's covering for Angelo</i>.

398
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,423
<i>Help me prove</i>
<i>Angelo and Liezel are innocent!</i>

399
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,841
<i>- What?!</i>
<i>- I need to prove</i>

400
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,302
<i>I didn't imprison</i>
<i>an innocent person, okay?</i>
