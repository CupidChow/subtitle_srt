00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,843
<i>I'll disown you!</i>

00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,183

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,936
<i>Don't speak to Althea anymore.</i>

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,604
<i>Tell that to your daughter.</i>

12
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,575
<i>She just wants to make</i>

[theme music playing]

17
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,290
Oh, dear. So Bianca's actually alive.

18
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,127
Poor Liezel, she got
accused of being a human trafficker.

19
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,796
But Bianca's actually a lesbian, huh?

20
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,089
Oh my.

21
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:19,055
I called my friend,
Attorney. Abby Picassos.

22
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,059
She lives near Amurao.
She'll help with your case, Bianca.

23
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,520
Thank you very much, Attorney.

24
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,400
But, why are you helping me?

25
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,111
We don't know each other, but…

26
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,904
You are here for me.

27
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,117
Let's just say that…

28
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,202
I know how it feels.

29
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,957
To be abandoned by the person
who should be the first to protect you.

[crying softly]

32
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,466
It's not your fault.

33
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,513
Your mother's decision is not your fault.

34
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,057
Always remember that.

35
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:07,061
[crying, breathing heavily]

36
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,773
I'll get going.

37

[melancholic music continues]

38
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,821
Um, Erica.

39
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,871
I just want to thank you.

40
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,709
Because after everything that happened,

41
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,295
I didn't expect that…

42
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,256
you would call me to help.

43
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,012
Almost everyone in Amurao
was tarnishing your reputation.

44
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,514
Still, you chose to protect Bianca.

45
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,476
You still kept her secret.

46
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,603
You're brave.

47
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,230
[melancholic music continues]

48
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,315
[breathes heavily]

49
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,236
Because I used to be like her.

50
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,781
To this day,

51
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,951
it's still so difficult for
people to understand that…

52
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,789
The heart does not
choose who it will love.

53
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:11,292
[melancholic music continues]

54
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,044
Just like Louisa and I.

55
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,507
My father made me feel that,

56
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,510
what I felt,

57
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,595
was something I needed to hide.

58
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,431
That it was something
I have to be ashamed of.

59
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,767
[cries]

60
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,728
And I don't want
Bianca to experience that.

61
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,816
Thank you.

62
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,027
[sniffles] What for?

63
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,323
I'm glad that…

64
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,202
Though Louisa's life was short-lived,

65
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,664
I'm glad that she fell in love.

66
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,294
And that someone loved her.

67
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,964
[melancholic music continues]

68
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,675
- [sniffles]
- Like what I told Bianca,

69
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,510
it wasn't your fault.

70
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,057
You had nothing to do with
what happened to Louisa that night.

71
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,562
I hope now that you know the truth,
you'll be at peace.

72
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,859
I still don't think I can.

73

- [somber music playing]
- [Liezel sniffles]

74
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,488
I don't know if…

[exhales heavily]

76
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,618
If Angelo and I could
ever recover from this.

77
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,539
I don't know what to do.
[sighs] How to go about it.

78
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,459
You know…

79
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:40,256
In my life, when hard times come,
do you know who I think of?

80
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,675
It's Louisa.

81
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,802
[laughs softly, sniffles]

82
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,637
I always ask myself,

83
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,684
"What would Louisa do
if she were in my shoes?"

84
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:58,274
'Cause I'm sure
that though it's hard, she'll still fight.

85

[music becomes light-hearted]

86
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,070
She won't give up.

87
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,866
I always hold on
to what she'd always tell me.

88
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,453
If she can do it, so can I.

89
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,414
[light-hearted music continues]

[Liezel sniffles]

91
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:21,380
I thought that after all these years,

92
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,136
her faced would be
erased from my memories.

93
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,307
[light-hearted music continues]

94
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,892
[cries] But no.

95
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,356
I can still remember her vividly.

96
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,859
And she remains alive inside of me.

97
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,279
[light-hearted music continues]

98
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,989
[Bianca] Miss Liezel.

[Tin] Anton? Wow!
Long time no see. How are you?

106
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,651
- Come in!
- Thank you.

107
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,404
Oh, I'm sorry.

108
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,782
It's messy. I came from a party yesterday.

109
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,577
I couldn't clean up. Do you want coffee?

110
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,996
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

111
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,000
Uh… By the way, where's Mel?

112
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,336
Um, Mel is still
with her friends in Amurao.

[music fades]

118

Someday, I'll come
back here and I can finally say

119
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,322
that your true
killer is rotting in prison.

120
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,868
You'll be at peace soon, Louisa.

[foreboding music playing]

122
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,039
I swear to you.

123
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,501
I'm not going to stop until I do that.

124
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,171
[breathes heavily]

125
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,381
Even if…

126
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,510
It seems that I'm just
making everything worse.

127
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,890
I made a mistake last night.

128
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,977

Actually,

00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,326
I dropped by the other day,
but no one answered the door.

00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,163
Ah, I was with my parents the other day.

138
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,456
Why?

139
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,876
Mirriane said
you came back from the States.

140
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,798
She invited me to have coffee
with you guys, but I couldn't.

141
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,968
So, I decided to come here and visit you.

142
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,221
[Tin chuckles] Oh, that's so sweet!

143
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,101
By the way, did you, by any chance,

144
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,353
lend your place
to Mel while you were away?

145
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,230
Huh? No.

146
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,566
Why would I do that?

147
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,986
She said she was in this building,

148
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,448
like, a week or a couple of weeks ago.

149
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,534
But you weren't back
from the States then, right?

150
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,078
Maybe she visited
someone else in the building.

151

[tense music playing]

152
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,542
Do you have other
friends living in this building?

153
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,836
I don't think so.

154
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,464
Ah, yeah!

155
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,758
Lucas Santiago lives here, too.

156
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,967
Do you know him?

157
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,927
The one who owns the gyms.

158
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,222
- But, he's not close to Mel,
- [tense music intensifies]

159
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,391
so I don't think it's him.

Though there's a spa downstairs.

161
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,523
Mel and I go there often.
She probably went there.

Which reminds me,

163
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,860
I need to book a session.

[tense music continues]

Tsk. You know what?

166
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,748
Not that it would change anything, but…

167
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,959
I would've preferred it if
Louisa had kept it a secret

168
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,213
and left Amurao with Liezel.

169

[Alice] Do you think,

173
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,189
she didn't tell us because…

174
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,318
she felt like we wouldn't understand?

175
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,115
But I know, I just know that…

176
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,450
we would understand.

177
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,744
We would accept her,

178
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,995
no matter what.

179
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,873
I'm sure she knows that.

180
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,795
It's the rest of Amurao
who wouldn't understand her.

181
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,089
That's probably what she thought.

182
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,595
[Alice sighs]

183
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,597
She went through a lot.

184
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,809
I wish we knew.

185
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,228
I wish she were still alive.

["Sabay Sabay Tayo"

187
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,694
You have no idea
how many times I've wished that

188
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,529
she never left us.

189
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,700
If only we knew about
her relationship with Liezel,

190
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,620
we would have helped her leave.

191
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:32,751
We would just visit
them wherever they were.

192
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,589
Louisa could've gone to college and,

193
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,257
she could have become a…

194
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,969
a lawyer.

195
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,934
I imagine her as a policewoman.

196
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,271
True! Louisa did look like a policewoman!

197

198
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,442

[Mel] If she didn't die…

201

If… if that night never happened,

202
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,377
would our lives be the same?

203
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,507
[Alice] I think…

204
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,302
- If that night hadn't happened,
- [uneasy music playing]

205
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,765
we would still be close.

206

- Come on! You're too slow!
- Come here!

215
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,147
- Oh. Agh! [laughs]
- [Seth] No!

216

You're too slow!

Oh yeah, you got me, buddy!

220
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,367
You got me.

221
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,870
Whew! Good job.

222
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,664
You're not gonna leave, Daddy?

223
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,000

00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,089
I love you, bud.

228
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,135
I am.

229
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,929
[Erica] When I saw you at the restaurant,

230
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,764
it felt like…

231
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,351
<i>Babe! Babe, Mommy's here!</i>
<i>Mommy's here!</i> [exhales]

232

<i>Alice?</i>

233
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,522
[pensive music playing]

234
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,065
Like something was wrong.

235
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,944
It was a different kind of fear.

236
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,533
I just thought… I thought Scott
was going to take Seth away.

237
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,912
I thought I was gonna lose my son forever.

238
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,331
You know, but… [sighs]

239
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,707
[Alice] Now I know…

240
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,376
Scott wouldn't do that to me.

241
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,671
[pensive music continues]

242
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,591
But…

243
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,760
Are you 100 percent sure?

244
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:32,723
You haven't resolved your trauma
and nightmares in therapy.

245
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,017
Maybe you could get back together

246
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,810
once you're sure you're okay.

247
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,856
[sighs] My therapist told me,

248
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,691
[sniffles]

249
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,860
my body remembers what my mind can't.

250
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,281
So now that some of my
confusion has been cleared up

251
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,284
thanks to all my
sessions with my therapist,

252
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,578
now I know.

253
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,288
I can feel it in my gut that

254
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,374
Scott's not doing anything wrong.

255
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,043
He would never hurt me.

256
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:05,172
That's why I married him
in the first place 'cause I know that.

257
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,800
[Alice sighs]

258
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,888
[pensive music continues]

259
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,890
I was just confused for a while…

260
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,851
but I realized that…

261
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,146
when I learned about what happened

262
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,898
with Liezel and Angelo…

263
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,026
I don't want Scott
and I to get to that point.

264
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,445
I don't want us to reach a point

265
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,532
where the damage
to our marriage has become irreparable.

266
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,456
I'm even lucky because,

267
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,876
no matter what I think of him,

268
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,879
he's still willing to forgive me.

269
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,342
And I think your gut feeling is right.

270
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,594
[Mel] I saw the look on Scott's face when…

271
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,806
you accused him of abusing you.

272
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,182
Really?

273
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,728
You'll make a
big decision based on a look?

274
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,984
[Mel scoffs] I know the look
of a man who truly loves his wife.

[pensive music continues]

276
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,244
Anyway, I'm still staying with Alice.

277
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,539
So, if she ever does
make the wrong decision,

278
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,418
which I highly doubt that,
I'll be there by her side.

279
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,589
[Erica] You're not going back to Manila?

280
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,844
[hesitates] Alice needs me. And…

281
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,306
It's okay to stay longer. For her.

If you need help with Scott or anything,

320
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,216
just give me a call, okay?

[Alice] Thanks, Erica. I will.

Be careful, okay?

Especially since we still

You know, that kind of mindset

325

caused the rift between Liezel and Angelo.

326
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,277
Someone sent a text to you and Angelo.

327
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,948
And that person
wants you to hurt each other.

328
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,908
And I'm sure it's
the same person who attacked you.

But why did he only
resurface now after all these years?

332
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,879
Is it because Erica
remembered <i>Bana</i> (husband),

333
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,967
and now we're all thinking
about Louisa's death again?

How did he even know that Beth,
Liezel, and Angelo were fighting?

335

I'm sure he's just around, watching us.

00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,050
<i>But you know what I'm sure of?</i>

354
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:09,888

00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,015
<i>I kill those who need to be killed.</i>

356
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,476
<i>There are people who need to be killed?</i>

357
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,437
<i>Four more. Just four left.</i>
