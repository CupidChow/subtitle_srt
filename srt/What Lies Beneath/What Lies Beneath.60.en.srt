00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,655

So, it was just a misunderstanding?

You didn't attack Miss Beth, Papa?

00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,186
No, son.

34
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,108
I didn't hurt anyone.

What about Bianca?

Uh…

40
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,349
It's true that I knew
about Bianca's disappearance.

41
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,853
But I kept it a secret to protect her.

42
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,939
I was just helping her.

43
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,567
And Bianca texted me, saying that

44
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,570
she's at the police
station to give a statement.

But… It's okay now.

- [music fades]

71
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,383
And then I threw it away.

72
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,016
To protect you.

73
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,185
[Angelo breathes deeply]

74
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,316
So, you thought I killed Louisa, but…

75
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,319
you still chose to protect me?

76
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,866
[sniffles] I thought that if--

77
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,203
if you did that, then it was my fault.

78
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,540
Because I deceived you.

79
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,209
Because I hurt you.

80
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,961
And I thought that when,

81
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,631
when you found out about me and Louisa,

82
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,175
your anger…

83
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,512
made you kill her.

[morose music playing]

85
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,518
I couldn't do anything to protect Louisa.

86
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,939
But now, I can protect you.

87
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,817
Ah. So you felt guilty?

88
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,778
- That's why you married me?
- No!

89
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,531
[stammers] Yes.

90
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,827
Yes, I feel guilty but…

91
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,247
It's not just because of what happened.

92
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,585
I love you, Angelo.

93
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,089
[sniffles] And that never changed.

94
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:32,261
It's not the same as
the love I had for Louisa, but…

95
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,348
But I love you.

96

[Angelo sighs heavily]

97
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,437
It's what I held on to.

98
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,941
And it's still what I'm holding on to now.

Sorry.

00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,955
Sorry for the lies.

I'm sorry I was scared of you.

106
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,925
You kept all of that from me.

107
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,180
I kept what I knew about you and Louisa.

108
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,475
Why didn't you tell me?

109
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,687
Because I'm scared, Liezel.

I'm scared to hear directly
from you what I already know.

No matter what I do,

113
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,036
you will never love me
as much as you loved Louisa.

[sniffles]

115
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,833
I don't know what I'll do
if I hear it directly from you.

00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,335
I might just lose my mind.

117
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,338
I don't know what I'll do.

118
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,550

[somber music continues]

122
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,820

Hey. What's wrong?

127
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,144
I was worried after your call.
Are you okay?

128
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,146
Is Seth…

129
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,357
He's fine.

130
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,692
Okay… Um, then…

131
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,529
Wait, what's going on?
Why did you ask to meet?

132
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,285
I just…

133
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,122
I just watched
a couple fall apart… [sniffles]

134
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,918
because of things
they couldn't tell each other for years.

135
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,796
I couldn't help but think,

136
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,590
had they chosen to trust each other,

137
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,968
to talk about it,

138
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,556
maybe it wouldn't have destroyed them.

139
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:30,189
They wouldn't be
hurting for so much, for so long.

140
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,568
And I…

141
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,198
I realized, Scott…

142
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,035
That's what I've been doing to you.

143
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,708
And I… I don't wanna do that anymore.

144
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,419
Alice--

145
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,839
I said… I said I'd figure things out.

146
00:11:55,965 --> 00:12:00,136
And, no, no,
I have not. Not completely but…

147
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,096
I realized…

148
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,977
[sighs] I don't wanna do
this alone anymore, Scott.

[hopeful music playing]

150
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,647
I am choosing to trust you.

Because after everything,
I still love you and…

152
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,865
And I still do. I still love you.

153

Please tell me I haven't lost you.

157

Please tell me you can still forgive me.

158
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,593
Please. I'm so sorry.

[breathing heavily]

160
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,390
I know I don't even
have the right to ask you.

I-- What I did is
just so horrible, it's…

162
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,104
I don't have the right to ask you

163
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,899
after everything I did.

164

Alice…

165
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,946
I still love you.

I'm sorry, I… [sobbing]

170
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,791
I hope you can still forgive me.

171
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,170
I, I hurt you. I called you a monster.

172
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,298
- No. Hey, hey, hey.
- I took Seth away.

173
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:23,093
- It's okay. Shh, it's okay.
- [crying, breathing heavily]

174
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,556
We're gonna figure
things out together, okay?

[Alice sighs heavily]

176
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,643
You're choosing to trust me.

177
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,354
So trust me.

178
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,025
Trust me when I say
that this leap of faith, it's enough.

179
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,986
It's more than enough for me.

180
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,615
Okay?

00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,744
Yeah.

183
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,384
[music fades]

184
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,344
[woman] Where are you taking my husband?

185
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,598
Sir, have mercy, please.
He didn't do anything wrong.

186
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,142
Where are you taking him,
sir? [whimpering]

187
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,437
Mrs. Seropon,
you know what your husband did.

188
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,065
What did my daughter tell you?

189
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,110
Don't believe in Bianca. She's a liar.

190
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,863
What she's accusing him of isn't true.

191
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,240
Joey didn't do anything to her!

192
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,785
Your husband is a rapist, Ma!

193
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:36,667
[crying] He defiled me!
Why won't you believe me?!

194
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,752
Because you're a liar!

195
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,423
You want to ruin my
life and make me miserable!

196
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,718
Then why did you still look for me? [sobs]

197
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,888
You even made a story
out of my disappearance.

198
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:55,144
It wasn't because
you were worried for me, right?

199
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,566
You just didn't want
everyone to know the truth.

200
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,693
[sullen music playing]

201
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,778
You even blamed Miss Liezel.

202
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,072
You don't care if someone's life

203
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,825
gets ruined as long
as it isn't your husband's!

204
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,327
You take that back!

205
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,581
Drop your complaint if
you want to come back to this house!

206
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,207
Do you understand?

207
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,710
I'll forget I even had a daughter!

208
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,883
<i>Do whatever you want, it's your life.</i>

209
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,844
<i>As long as we understand each other.</i>

210
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,096
<i>Once you walk out that door,</i>

211
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,474
<i>don't expect anything from me anymore.</i>

214
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,869
[Beth] Chloe.

215
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,789
Did you hear us in the hospital?

216
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,668
[refrigerator closes]

217
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,466
[sighs]

218
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,678
You don't want to tell the police.

219
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,846
That's why Papa said

220
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,224
to tell Attorney Erica instead.

221
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,768
- [morose music playing]
- But…

222
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,020
You don't want to either.

223
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,735
What's going to happen now?

224
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,947
[Ryan] Chloe.

225
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,701
Don't worry about it. It's fine now.

226
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,162
Your Uncle Angelo didn't hurt your mother.

227
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,206
And he had nothing
to do with Louisa either.

228
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,710
Yes! I was worried about Joshua.

229
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,878
- I'll text him right now.
- [Beth] Mm-hmm.

230

Chloe.

233
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,890
Why did you have to call…

234
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,560
your Aunt Erica?

235
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,606
We could have handled it on our own.

236
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,900
I didn't want
to make a big deal out of this.

237
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,902
Ma.

238
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,321
I was scared for you.

239
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,323
You could get hurt again.

240
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,576
I tried calling Aunt Mel,

241
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,828
but I couldn't get in touch with her.

242
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,289
I know you don't get along,

243
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,041
but I was desperate, Ma.

244
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,959
[somber music playing]

245
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,836
Are you mad at me, Ma?

246
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,672
Don't get mad, please!

247
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,926
[somber music continues]

248
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,679
- [smooches]
- I'm not angry, Chloe.

249
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,307
And I understand why you did it.

250
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:43,020
[somber music continues]

Enjoy your food.

255
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,003
[Marco] I spoke to Loquere.

256
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,381
He confirmed Angelo's statements.

257
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,509
On Louisa's time of death,

258
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,220
Angelo was involved in
a fight in a different neighborhood.

259
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,390
The police arrived
to arrest everyone fighting,

260
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,434
but Angelo had already escaped.

261
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,228
The next day,

262
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,314
Angelo arrived at the station with his dad

263
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,233
to file an incident report.

264
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,777
I've made a request.

265
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,737
And if his statements match,

266
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,365
he will no longer be
a suspect in Louisa's case.

267
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,744
Now that Bianca's back,
her case has been dismissed, too.

268
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,831
[upbeat music continues]

269
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:47,209
He'll also be cleared of sending
the text messages Beth received.

270
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,879
"THIS IS BETH. MEET ME AT
OUR OLD HANGOUT SPOT IN THE FOREST."

271
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,757
Whoever the killer is,

272
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:59,012
he knew Liezel and Beth
were at odds because of Bianca.

273
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,307
He texted Beth and Angelo

274
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,725
because he wanted them to fight.

275
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,145
He wanted them to hurt each other.

276
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,524
Are you sure
Louisa's killer was behind it?

277
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,234
[sinister music playing]

278
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,694
[Erica] Whoever he is,

279
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,489
we know how twisted his mind is.

280
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,200
What he's capable of.

281
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:24,830

00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,341
Do you have…

285
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,469
other persons of
interest in Louisa's case?

286
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,221
[Erica sighs]

287
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,475
We always end up back
to square one in this case.

[music fades]

289
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,896
But this just shows there's a lot

290
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,191
we still don't know
about what happened to Louisa.
