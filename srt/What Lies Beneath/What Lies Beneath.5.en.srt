That's them!

00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,215
Sheesh! Mel Montenegro
really went to our school?

40
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,509
And she was best friends with Auntie Beth!

41
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,596
But, hey, I'm still upset.

42
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,973
You didn't tell me you were meeting her.

00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,600
But it's embarrassing.

44
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,019
I don't want us to ruin their reunion.

Aside from the birthday
and Christmas gifts she sends,

46
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,360
I think I've only met
her five times in total.

00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:59,656
Oh, I'm sure you have
some pics! Come on, show us!

I wanted to take a video for my vlog,
but Mama stopped me. [chuckles]

You're really that excited to see her?

50
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,999
I heard she's a husband beater.

51
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,543
Why are you proud
that she's friends with your mom?

52
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,505
She's the reason why
the Me Too Movement won't take off

53
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,676
and why women are always taking
two steps forward, one step back.

54
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,012
Stop being cringe.
Auntie Mel isn't a bad person.

55
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,100
You said it yourself.
She rarely sees your mom.

56
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,102
You don't even know her that well.

57
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,563
So, how can you say
that she's not a bad person?

58
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,483
Would Mama be friends with her if she is?

59
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,443
I don't think so.

60
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,280
Mama doesn't make
friends with just whoever.

61
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,656
No cap!

62
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,328
Look, it suits you well.

63
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,747
Just buy one. It'll make you look sexy.

64
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,499
I want a different color.

65
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,252
It's so expensive!

66
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:58,756
Come on. We should look
fancy even if we aren't well-off.

67
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,677
What do you mean "we"?
You're the real fancy one here.

68
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,639
You're building a mansion
with celebrities! I'm so jealous!

69
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,224
- Oh, it's nothing.
- Hey.

70
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,643
Can we have some blessings?

Well, then,

- Just buy one from me.
- [Vivian] What a brag!

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,778
All you're doing is selling freebies.

75
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,238
Might as well pay your debts, too.

Vivian, I'm not denying
that I'm not as rich as my friends.

00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,500
But I work hard for what I have.

00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,920
Besides, doesn't Ryan
owe your brother money?

00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,631
Why are you taking it out on me?

00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,051
Why don't you look in the mirror?

00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:47,138
Liezel, when did
Vivian last pay off her debt?

Three years ago? [gasps]

Hey, you didn't have to drag me into that.

Why not? I was just being honest.

89
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,956
At least, the rest of us
can pay our monthly dues.

90
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,834
But her? It seems
she has no plans of paying up

91
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,252
because you're too nice to her.

92
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,672
Your mouth is really something, huh.

93
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,549
It just runs nonstop.

94
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,553
Look, it's not impossible
to overcome financial problems,

95
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,097
that's why I'm not ashamed of mine.

96
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,974
What's important is
I'm not hiding anything.

97
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,476
Unlike other people.

There! Perfect!
Alright, let's take this angle.

Anton is my baby!

I took good care of him.

I didn't even let a fly touch him.

But please, let's not forget

139
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,153
that I was already
successful when your son met me.

00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,113
[Barbara] He made you more famous.

141

You cannot deny that.

142
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,909
Now, you're a household name.

143
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,620
And this is how you pay him back?

[scoffs]

145
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,417
You react to one video,

but you don't know the whole story.

147
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,171
[Barbara] How clearer can it get?

148
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,966
You're clearly abusing my son!

149
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,426
And that petulant behavior earlier!

150
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,305
You hurt him,
and he's the one apologizing?

151
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,101
And you even dared
destroy the flowers that he gave you.

152
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:21,978
It's no wonder

153
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,106
Margie and Cedric want
to wash their hands off you!

Can we please leave

I'd appreciate it if
you leave my brother alone.

If you don't,
I'll file a complaint against you

159
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,297
Your brother called me.

160
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,718
He saw Alice, Beth, and Mel on TV,

161
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,595
so he felt the need to call me.

After 14 years.

163
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,684
That's why I needed to go and talk to him.

We needed
you to talk 14 years ago, Attorney,

but you didn't.

You're of no use to him now.

I am.

[tense music plays]

172
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:30,129
Your dad called
earlier to apologize for you.

They're in Europe right now,
but he felt the need to.

I'm glad your dad can feel shame.

175
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,181
Because his daughter definitely can't.

Well, that does really sound like my dad.

177
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,357
He'd rather believe in
rumors than his own daughter.

178

a retirement home with my friends"

If you can't take care of him,
just give him back to us.
