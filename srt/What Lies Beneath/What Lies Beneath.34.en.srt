00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:03,962
<i>Dad found your brother's location.</i>

00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:05,922

00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,175

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,011

00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,346
<i>What did I say?</i>

7
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,682
<i>He's coming. He's already outside.</i>

8
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:19,394

<i>Angelo is on his way home.</i>

9
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,354
<i>Can we not talk about Edong for now?</i>

10
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,772
<i>Lemuel.</i>

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,191
<i>You told me</i>
<i>that Louisa was leaving Amurao.</i>

12
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,485
<i>Did she ever mention</i>

13
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,446

Save yourself!

00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,339
If you let your brother escape,

43
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,216
Boss will not be happy!

Santiago!

00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,222
Run, Edong!

63
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,030
<i>There were four of you</i>

64
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,657
and Santiago was alone.

65
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,991
He slipped past you?

66
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,284
Sir, there was a commotion.

67
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,787
Another group arrived,
and they were also after Edong.

68
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,207
Then that's even more
reason to find and kill Santiago.

<i>I don't know who those bastards are,</i>

70

You're so morbid.

You are the GOAT!

You're my idol! I'm Chloe.

I could easily tell my men to finish you.

But you're here…

118
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,294
and still breathing!

119
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,590
They even drove your car to get here.

120
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,970
You should be in
a church having your last rites.

00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,514
I said I would handle my brother!

122
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,559
You think I have time
for your sibling problems?

123
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,604
My business is at stake here!

124
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,064
I've contributed a lot to your syndicate!

00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,107
Hey!

126
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,567
Without me,

127
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,530
you would still be
begging people to support

128
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,491
whatever businesses you wanted.

129
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,744
So don't act so arrogant.

130
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,788
Every business you run

131
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,625
is just a front for my group's money!

132
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,212
Then take all
your money out of my business.

133
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:28,799
[foreboding music continues]

134
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,055
You think you can live without me?

00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,682
I can.

You are tied to this

138
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,321
Try to break free.

139
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,657
You'll see…

140
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,787
you and your brother
will end up in the same grave!

- [music fades]

143
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,511
I remembered she once wrote,

"My <i>Bana,</i> I love you."

145
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,225
I never heard that term from Louisa.

146
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,270
And you think that was her boyfriend?

147
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,232
I mean, it was obviously a love note.

148
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,236
Remember when we were asking her

149
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,572
about that "L" initial at
the back of her watch?

150
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,992
She didn't want
to tell us who gave it to her.

151
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,537
And we were all
thinking it was from her boyfriend.

152
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,999
Do you think it's the same person?

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,588
[pensive music playing]

154
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,678
Dude! Dude, why did you say that?

155
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,054
Why?

156
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,056
You know Dad will get mad!

157
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,892
[sighs]

158
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,353
Okay, okay, okay.
I will do my best to pacify him.

159
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,105
But Lucas, you have to hear me out.

160
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,108
- You need to lay low--
- Lay low?

161
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,445
You know your father will
do everything to kill my brother!

162
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,531
I'll find my brother and I don't care

163
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,825
what Laurence Kyo does to me!

164
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,619
Dude…

165
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:21,996
What the…

166
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:23,831
Lucas--

167
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:28,419
[suspenseful music playing]

168
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,884
- Nanny Rose, I need to pee-pee.
- [music fades]

169
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,968
Alright, come on.

170
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,180
- Stay here, Chloe.
- Okay.

171
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,315
But didn't we think that
the "L" stands for Louisa?

172
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,903
She probably just
bought the watch for herself.

173
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,156
And maybe she was only
messing with us that she had a boyfriend

174
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,908
because she loved teasing us, right?

175
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,493
I am convinced she had a boyfriend--

176
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,911
But if she really had a boyfriend

177
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,579
why did she keep it a secret from us?

178
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,288
Yeah.

179
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,958
[Marco] Maybe he was older.

180
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,669
Or maybe he was married.

181
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:15,299
[pensive music playing]

182
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:19,136
All I know is Louisa wanted
to leave Amurao because of him.

183
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,223
So we need to find out his identity.

184
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,810
Why? Do you think he has something to do
with what happened to Louisa?

185
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,606
[pensive music continues]

186
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,818
Why are we looking for
people who might not even be real?

187
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,779
We all know what happened, right?

188
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,615
Edong killed Louisa.

189
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,326
Because if he didn't,
why would he break out of jail

190
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,869
to find us and take revenge?

191
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,581
Because he is furious at us
for locking him up when he was innocent.

192
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,709
But you would never admit that!

193
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:55,005
[tense music playing]

194
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,856
[music fades]

195
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,663
[exhales sharply]

196
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,624
[coughs]

197
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:38,215
[gentle music playing]

198
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,347
[chuckles]

199
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,558
She better thank me tomorrow.

200
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,561
[imitates Chloe]
"What? You couldn't do it, bro?"

201
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,314
"You're so cringe, bro."

202
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,234
Mama and Papa have
been end game since high school!

203
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,946
You're really something, aren't you?!

204
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,075
You're really taking the side of
the serial killer who wants to kill us?!

205
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:09,121
Ah Beth, I think that's unfair. I mean…

206
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,334
Erica's been helping us
ever since Edong became a threat to us.

207
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,170
No! I'm sorry. I have to agree with Beth.

208
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,006
The situation is complicated enough.

209
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,384
Why do we have to dig up
the past for questions and theories?

210
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,220
As far as we and
the authorities are concerned,

211
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,096
all the questions have been answered.

212
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,682
Why don't we ask your friend Lucas?

213
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,102
Ask him about Esther.

214
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,648
He knows Esther lied

215
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,526
that she saw Edong
the night Louisa was killed!

216
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,320
Esther thought Edong would report her

217
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,697
for stealing the alumni funds

218
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,994
But she had Edong
imprisoned so she could escape her debt!

219
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,162
[Beth] And what?!

220
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,706
We're going to believe
what Edong and Lucas said?

221
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,458
Of course, they'll say that!

222
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,584
Oh?

223
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,920
A few weeks ago,
you were defending Lucas, weren't you?

224
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,507
You said he wouldn't get involved
in his brother's revenge.

225
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,634
Now we're not going
to believe him anymore?

226
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,262
And you, Beth!

227
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,181
You said it was impossible
for Edong to have killed Celestino.

228
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,392
That it was impossible
for him to take revenge on us.

229
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,894
Well now, it's clear
to us that you were wrong.

230
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,648
Why is it so hard for you to accept
that you might be wrong again?

231
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:25,406
[unsettling music playing]

232
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,036
[Rose] Chloe!

233
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,999
What would you like to drink?

234
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,834
Juice or soft drink?

235
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,004
[Chloe] Anything is fine, Miss Rose.

236
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,051
[Alice sighs heavily]

237
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,762
[Rose] Ma'am,
will she be having dinner here?

238
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,390
- I'll start serving--
- No, please don't bother.

239
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:55,060
[unsettling music playing]

240
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,479
[Seth] Car.

241
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,190
[Alice] Oh--

242
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,654
Um, baby, we're going to have
dinner in a bit. Start packing away.

243
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,739
- Okay?
- Okay.

244
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:15,164
[unsettling music continues]

245
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,677
[Joshua] Chloe will love this.

246
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,234
[Liezel] Joshua, come here! Hurry!

247
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,071
- [ominous music sting]
- [music ends]

248
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,408
[door bangs]

249
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,453
- [Liezel] He's coming! [chuckles]
- [Angelo] He's excited!

250
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,496
Papa!

251
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,248
Joshua! My son!

252
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,042
[hearty laughter] Let me see you!

253
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,963
Wow! You're so grown up! [smooches]

254
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,048
You look exactly like your daddy!

255
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,508
[hearty laughter]

256
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:13,305
[light-hearted music playing]

257
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,148
[music fades]

258
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:29,238
[ominous music playing]

259
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,869
"MY BANA, I LOVE YOU."

260
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,372
[Erica] Take care.

261
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,333
For now,
don't accept any suspicious packages.

262
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,418
If there's something else written,

263
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,336
or you feel
something strange about the rider,

264
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,088
even if you just have a gut feeling,

265
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,589
don't ignore it.

266
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,844
And if possible,
don't leave the house alone for now.

267
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,888
Also, no solo trips.

268
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:02,229
Uh, are you sure
you don't want to stay for dinner?

269
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,064
[huffs]

270
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,693
[morose music playing]

271
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,739
No, thank you.

272
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,454
[phone buzzing]

273
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,293
[music fades]

274
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,711
- [Angelo] Did you like it?
- [Liezel] Wow!

275
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,880
- [Joshua] Yes!
- That's for you.

276
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,717
And of course, this one's for my partner.

277
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,886
- Really?
- Yeah.

278
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,388
Let me see it.

279
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,060
- It smells so good!
- [Angelo] Yeah?

280
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:41,935
Mm-hmm!

281
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,396
Does it really smell good? Let's see.

282
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,025
- I can't smell it.
- Oh, partner! Wait--Partner!

283
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,359
Go ahead, Pa and Ma.

284
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,528
- Your son's not even here.
- [Liezel giggles]

285
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,739
- Joshua!
- Hang on.

286
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,157
I have something else for you.

287
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,034
This one.

288
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,620
This came from America!

289
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,789
- [chuckles] Wow!
- [Angelo] Look at that.

290
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,332
- What's up, bro?
- [both laugh]

291
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,001
- [Angelo] "What's up, bro?"
- Which place was the most fire

292
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,544
on your last trip, Pa?

293
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,463
"Fire"?

294
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,173
Uh…

295
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,425
Cyprus? It really hot there.

296
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,053
Pa, when I say "fire,"

297
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,389
I mean the most
beautiful place you've been to!

298
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,850
Ah! [chuckles]

299
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,686
If that's what you mean,
then no question about it.

300
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,188
Of course it's right here!

301
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,899
- With you two.
- [chuckling]

302
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,443
Okay, that's enough.

303
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,570
Your son has school tomorrow, partner.

304
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,656
Have you finished your assignment, Joshua?

305
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,617
- Uh, I'll finish it now. Bye.
- Hm, that's what I thought.

306
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,328
- [chuckles] Study hard, son.
- Go to bed once you're done.

307
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:42,996
Okay, Ma.

308
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,123
[chuckles softly]

309
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,626
- [sighs]
- Seriously, partner?

310
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,711
I was just away for
six months and suddenly

311
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,172
"fire" has a whole new definition?

312
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,715
[chuckles] If you think that's crazy,

313
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,426
wait until you hear him and Chloe talk.

314
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,970
You wouldn't understand a thing.

315
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:10,149
[intriguing music playing]

316
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:28,000
[intriguing music continues]

317
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,673
[music fades]

318
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,383
Uh…

319
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:41,138
How are Ryan and Beth doing, by the way?

320
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,764
Is Edong still bothering them?

321
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:48,187
[uneasy music playing]

322
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,856
Uh…

323
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,734
You heard about that?

324
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,528
Yes, my colleague mentioned it.

325
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:01,366
His wife, who's also
from Amurao, told him about it.

326
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,910
Hmm…

327
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:07,623
Well, the couple's
stressed out lately, especially Beth.

328
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,667
I guess anyone would be, right?

329
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,671
[uneasy music continues]

330
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,673
I thought that had
been over a long time ago.

331
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,889
[music fades]

332
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,976
Uh… Partner,
where do you want to go this weekend?

333
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,230
Joshua's asking
to go to the swimming pool.

334
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,856
I think he's had enough of the beach.

335
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,858
What about you?

336
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,277
Sure, let's look for a resort.

337
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,155
- Alright.
- [Angelo chuckles]

338
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,573
Let's go swimming.

339
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,160
Attorney Erica!

340
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,329
Can I send you a message?

341
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,666
- [tense music playing]
- [Erica] Uh…

342
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,754
I was hoping to interview you for my vlog.

343
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,425
Wow, so you do vlogs?

344
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,885
[Chloe] Yes.

345
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,512
I want to be a journalist,

346
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,347
but being a lawyer is my second choice.

347
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,308
You can message me anytime.

348
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,936
Just reach me on social media, okay?

349
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,187
Really?

350
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,565
- Thank you, Attorney! [giggles]
- You're welcome.

351
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,319
[tense music continues]

352
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,330
- [sighs] Okay.
- [music fades]

353
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,748
Thanks, man.

354
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,918
Um…

355
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,880
Alice, could you turn on
the TV and check Prime News PH?

356
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,926
There's news about Edong.

357
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,354
<i>A fugitive inmate from Bagumbayan Prison</i>

358
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,357
<i>was spotted earlier</i>
<i>this morning in San Dimas.</i>

359
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,443
<i>Jet Santos reports.</i>

360
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,154
[Jet] <i>This video was</i>

372
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,435

375
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:43,195

<i>the operation a collateral success</i>

378
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:54,206
