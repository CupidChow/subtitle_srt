We can't find your brother
if he doesn't want to be found.

21
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,716
If he really broke into your condo
without your knowledge,

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,927
that means he's also hiding from you.

23
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,054
How will you find him?

24
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,474
It's still possible
that he might contact me.

25
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,935
And what else can we do…

26
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,895
aside from looking for him?

27
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,773
We can revisit Louisa's case.

28
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,402
Maybe you know
something that we don't know.

29
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,279
If we find the real killer,

30
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,072
maybe you can talk to Edong

31
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,741
and convince him not to continue with this

32
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,034

you shouldn't be worrying about this

00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,999

have so much on your mind.

00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,314

Uncle, how do you think
Beth and the others are doing?

52
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,881
Everyone in Amurao is
talking about what happened.

53
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,050
Is it true that…

54
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,054
they got physical incident
with Anton Montenegro?

55
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,889
Uh…

56
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,600
They sustained minor injuries, but…

57
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,560
they're fine now.

58
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,104
Why, Althea?

59
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,983
Are you worried about your sister Erica?

[somber music playing]

61
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,282
Maybe you can try to talk to her again.

She already made herself clear.

63
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,501
She said she didn't want
to have any connection with me.

64
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,503
The same goes for Mama.

65
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,547
She doesn't even want
me to see my sister again.

66
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,342
It's so hard. [sighs]

67
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,263
I hope I can mend the rift between them…

68
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,140
so we can be whole again.

69
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,102
I bet it would be nice…

70
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,312
to have a complete family.

71
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,981
[sighs] Althea.

72
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,608
Don't ever give up on that.

[somber music continues]

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,823
Actually, I thought she'd
never set foot on Amurao again.

75
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,574

What if they were the ones
who encountered someone like that?

106

[Chloe] They should be
thankful they're not facing Mama.

Or else, they won't be able to do that.

108

Why won't she just admit the truth?

that the truth will pacify Edong,

140

why don't we do just that?

141
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:12,992
We both have families
we want to protect from Edong.

142

she's not in the wrong?

144

I convinced myself…

148
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,387
that's what needed to be done.

149
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,642
That we had to put Edong behind bars.

150
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,520
So, that's what we did.

151
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,939
He was guilty.

152
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,150
It didn't really matter if
the incriminating evidence

153
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,610
against him was fake,

154
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,946
as long as we put him behind bars, right?

155
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,741
But years later,

156
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,912

00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,510
that we had an excuse.

163
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,137
The police pressured us.

164
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,472
We were still young back then.

165

They're the ones to blame, not us.

166
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,105
But there's always this voice in my head

167
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,690
asking…

168
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,653
What about all those
years I could've spoken up…

169
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:37,243
and corrected a possible mistake?

As always.

173
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,835
And I'm tired of it.

174
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,379
I don't want to be
scared anymore, you know.

175
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,756
That's why I want to tell the truth.

176
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,970
I want to know what really happened to me.

177
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,680
I want to understand it.
