<i>They immediately</i>

Yes, sir. NLEA is
taking credit for the operation.

31

How did the police and

33

40
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,554
Yes, sir.

00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,433
Damn it all!

44
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,147
[Jet] <i>According to NLEA,</i>

45
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,566
<i>Santiago was prepared for the possibility</i>

47
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,363

<i>in order to get away.</i>

49
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,201
<i>Nevertheless, NLEA considers the operation</i>

50
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,704
<i>a collateral success</i>

Mmm.

You know them.

63
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,960
They're desperate for
recognition and media exposure.

64
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:17,548
You know, I bet those
men were promised a promotion

65
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,552
if they arrest Lucas's brother. [chuckles]

66

What is this, a circus?

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,892
This won't help Lucas.

69
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,481
I'm under no obligation to help him.

70
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,025
You, on the other hand,

71
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,488
have an obligation
to help me protect my business.

72
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,409
That is, if you want
to keep living recklessly.

Alright? [chuckles]

74
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,165
Since I know I can't
rely on you for anything,

75
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,458
I did it myself.

76
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,713
Now, all eyes are on Edong.

77
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,965
Before this week ends,

I loved having you around

One of us was always there

because she loved your balcony so much.

166

I remember
that she loved standing on the balcony

167
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,111
because she felt like
she was on top of the world.

168

[Mel laughs] Yeah,
I remember Louisa always saying that.

to show you my pretty face."

180
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,330
"Auntie, you're getting thin."

181
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,792
"Auntie, what are you eating?"

182
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,380
I told my husband

183
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,424
that even though we never had kids,

184
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:20,262
we were blessed with five lovely girls.

185
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,349
[soft music continues]

186
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,686
They made me happy.

187
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,314
But…

188
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,528
Louisa suddenly stopped visiting.

189
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,029
[somber music playing]

190
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,490
I wonder how she's doing.

191
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,161
From then on,

192
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,123
they were never complete again.

193
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,418
Only one would visit us at a time.

194
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,839
Until they all disappeared.

195
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,052
If you know

196
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,055
where they are,

197
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,436
tell them I miss them so much.

198
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,815
[somber music swells]

199
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,080
[somber music continues]

200
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,968
[music fades]

201
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,928
Stop it.

202
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,805
Stop what?

203
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,765
You've been staring at me.

204
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,393
I'm just checking if you're okay.

205
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,520
Why wouldn't I be okay?

206
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:56,108
Plenty of times
I've watched you face criminals

207
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,486
and confront politicians.

208
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,322
Not once have I seen you fazed.

209
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,532
But earlier, with your sister--

210
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,700
I'm okay.

211
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,621
[sighs]

212
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,290
[inhales deeply]

213
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,000
You know, it's okay to admit--

214
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,128
I should track down all
the Bisaya in Amurao High then.

215
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,924
"Bana" is a Bisaya term of endearment.

216
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,177
Maybe that's what they called each other.

217
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,015
You should also check outside Amurao High.

218
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,142
Like I said,

219
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:34,271
Louisa's lover could've been
someone older or even married.

220
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,065
That could be why she kept it from you.

221
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,779
If only we had found
Esther before she died,

222
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:46,534
we could've confirmed whether someone
paid or ordered her to frame Edong.

223
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,244
How are you so sure she's dead?

224
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,913
We only have her hand.

225
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,165
You think Edong will let her live?

226
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,626
You saw what he did to Celestino.

227
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,795
[sighs deeply]

228
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,589
Edong might get
killed before we get answers.

229
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,467
Is that what you're really afraid of?

230
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:08,180
[tense music playing]

231
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,230
[Erica] <i>And you, Beth,</i>

232
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,941
<i>You said it was impossible</i>
<i>for Edong to have killed Celestino.</i>

233
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,860
<i>That it was impossible</i>
<i>for him to take revenge on us.</i>

234
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,362
<i>Now, it's clear that you're wrong.</i>

235
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:27,283
<i>Why can't you accept</i>
<i>the fact that you might be wrong?</i>

236
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,246
[door opens, beads rattling]

237
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,291
[tense music continues]

238
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,592
Did you fight with Attorney…

239
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,347
because she doesn't
believe Edong is the killer?

240
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,974
[music fades]

241
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,977
[Erica] I understand why
Beth and the others are furious.

242
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,105
They just want to protect themselves

243
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,316
and their families.

244
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,068
[sighs heavily]

245
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,113
But I can't just
forget what we did to Edong.

246
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,533
It will never give me peace.

247
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,578
That's why even if it's hard…

248
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,039
Even if I have to do it alone…

249
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,418
I need to correct the mistake we made.

250
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:23,339
[tense music resumes]

251
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,386
You heard us?

252
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,512
[music fades]

253
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,724
You were eavesdropping
on other people's conversation?!

254
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,267
Chloe, that's wrong!

255
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,685
I only heard some of it.

256
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,853
Even so!

257
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:42,942
[sighs sharply]

258
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,820
[pensive music playing]

259
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,989
I'm sorry, Ma.

260
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,992
[exhales sharply]

261
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:52,952
But Ma,

262
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,037
what about Aunt Alice and Aunt Mel?

263
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,997
What are their stands?

264
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,375
Their stand, my stand,

265
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,460
and everybody's stand are the same.

266
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,754
Erica's the only stubborn one,

267
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,215
even when
the entire Amurao is against her.

268
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,424
[Chloe] But Ma,

269
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,843
the truth is the truth,

270
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,096
even if you're a minority of one.

271
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,389
That's what Gandhi said.

272
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,268
So, are you saying that we're liars, dear?

273
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,647
Ma, that's not what I'm trying to say.

274
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:26,819
But Attorney's
conviction is really impressive

275
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,904
even if she's alone. It's giving,

276
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,323
main character energy.

277
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,158
[Beth scoffs]

278
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,871
The only reason she doesn't
want to believe that Edong killed Louisa

279
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,875
is because Edong's brother,
Lucas, is her ex-boyfriend.

280
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,004
Ma, maybe she has strong evidence.

281
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,797
Attorney is good at what she does.

282
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,591
Besides, she wouldn't
fight for it if she had no proof.

283
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,719
And Attorney's boyfriend theory

284
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,262
highkey makes sense.

285
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,181
Edong killed Louisa!

286
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,268
The case was closed long ago,
they shouldn't have brought it up again!

287
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,813
[music becomes tense]

288

[cicadas chirping]

290
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,574
Edong got shot in the thigh.
I'm sure he hasn't gone far.

[Yuri] <i>I already went</i>
<i>to the two neighboring communities.</i>

292
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,202
<i>I've asked around,</i>

293
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,829
<i>but no one has seen him yet.</i>

294
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,373
<i>It's not good</i>
<i>that people were alerted to him.</i>

295
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,917
They can't find him before we do.

296
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,502
They'll kill my brother.

297
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,922
[dramatic music playing]

298
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,302
Shit.

[music fades]

301
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,830
This will be the last time.

302
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,711
I don't want to hear anything

303
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,005
about Louisa's death from you.

304
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,715
[somber music playing]

305
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,716
But Ma,

306
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,636
I just want to know about it.

307
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,641
Many people from
Amurao don't know who Louisa is.

308
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,143
Besides, you told me

309
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,563
that a lot of fake
news about her was spread.

310
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,233
They need to know her real story.

311
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,901
Who she really was.

312
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,278
It's better for people not to know.

313
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,364
Didn't you hear earlier?

314
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,991
We're still hurting even now.

315
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,329
We can't reunite because of that!

316
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,457
Chloe, this isn't a story you do

317
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,794
just to gain likes and hearts.

318
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,963
It's not just some content
to gossip about.

319
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,215
Not to mention how
your classmates try to modify it.

320
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,843
Do you think I didn't know?

321
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,719
I know that you're telling people

322
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,472
that Edong was the one
who chased you and Joshua.

323
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,974
How many times do I have to remind you

324
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:07,020
and explain to you what
you can or can't do or say, huh?

325
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,231
You think this is a game?

326
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,066
Well, play time is over!

327
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,736
From now on, stay out of Louisa's case!

00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,467

Nothing.

331
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,642
The police just left.

332
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,855
Apparently, the higher-ups
said we don't need guards anymore

333
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,026
since Edong's in another province
and they're close to catching him.

334
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,779
But they haven't caught him yet.

335
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,406
So why did they leave?

<i>and take back</i>
<i>the life they stole from you.</i>

00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,559
<i>Aah!</i>
