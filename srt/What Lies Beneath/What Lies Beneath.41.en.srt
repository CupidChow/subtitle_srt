[Isla] <i>Trauma doesn't go away.</i>
<i>When not processed properly,</i>

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,716

00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:14,931
<i>Louisa isn't the only</i>
<i>one you lost, but Erica too.</i>

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,599
<i>Have you ever talked to her about it?</i>

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,893
[Edong] <i>Forgot about me, Lucas.</i>

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,814
<i>- You should live for yourself.</i>
<i>- How, Edong?!</i>

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,233
<i>- I love you, Lucas.</i>
<i>- No!</i>

8
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,401

00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,365
<i>Is it true what you said earlier?</i>
<i>That Louisa and Angelo</i>

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,492
<i>worked together at the coffee shop</i>

12
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,369
<i>that only served instant coffee?</i>

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,663
<i>- Are you saying that--</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

14
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,790
<i>Louisa was the other woman, side chick,</i>

15
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,626

[uneasy music playing]

18
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,754
Crazy, isn't it?

19
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,592
It's such a shame because
Louisa even became friends

20
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,719
with Angelo's girlfriend.

21
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,389
Pastor Samuel's daughter, uh… Tsk.

22
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,349
- What was her name? Tsk.
- Liezel?

23
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,184
Yes! Liezel.

24
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,645
[young Liezel] <i>You really did it?</i>

25
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,148
- [young Liezel laughs]
- [Louisa] <i>Yeah. When I told him,</i>

26
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,776
<i>he blushed so hard, his ears got red!</i>

27
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,112
- [Liezel laughing]
<i>- For real!</i>

28
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,196
- [snorts]
<i>- Oh.</i>

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,157
<i>So you have this side to you, huh?</i>

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,867
<i>- Keep it hidden!</i>
<i>- Should I?</i>

31
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,870
<i>- I don't want to hear it again.</i>
- [laughing]

32
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,956
[Vangie] Even on Angelo's off days,

33
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,418
Liezel would come here
just to hang out with Louisa.

34
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,711
[uneasy music continues]

35
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,505
[Beth]<i> Did Louisa and</i>
<i>Angelo used to work together</i>

36

<i>- at Coral and Coff--</i>
- [pens clattering]

37
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,301
<i>They said you were there all the time.</i>

38
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,012
<i>Yes, I remember.</i>
<i>But she was only there for a short time.</i>

39
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,639
<i>Maybe that's why</i>
<i>I didn't really talk to her much. Why?</i>

40
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,684
Are you sure?

41
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,437
Louisa and Liezel used to be friends?

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,982
Yes. Those three became friends.

43
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,319
Until Louisa fell in love with Angelo.

44
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,989
Ugh! I even
reprimanded that girl back then.

45
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,657
[glasses clinking]

46
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,703

- [young Angelo]<i> What?</i>

47
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,079
[Louisa] <i>You're silly. </i>[chuckles]

48
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,250
[woman] <i>Sir! One carbonara</i>
<i>and one brewed coffee, please.</i>

49
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,378
<i>Oh, ma'am, we don't serve brewed coffee,</i>

50
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,630
<i>- only instant coffee.</i>
<i>- Louisa, come here.</i>

51
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,298
[woman]<i> Isn't this a coffee shop?</i>

52
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,510
<i>Goodness, Louisa,</i>

53
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,971

<i>- What?</i>

54
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,641
<i>His girlfriend's father is a pastor.</i>

55
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,394
<i>Do you want a whole congregation</i>

[morose music playing]

57

<i>I'm not doing anything wrong.</i>

<i>Oh, don't get me started.</i>

59
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,443
<i>Your face tells me you're guilty!</i>

60
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,238
<i>If I were you, I'd stay away from him</i>

61
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,782
<i>and look for someone who's single.</i>

62
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,033
<i>Okay?</i>

63
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,246
[Vangie] Louisa
practically admitted it to me.

64
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:10,500
I actually pity her,
but I can't blame her either.

65
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,043
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

66
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,420
Her mother was exactly like that.

67
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:19,842
[morose music crescendos]

68
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,679
Why did you never respond?

69
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,474
After you left…

70
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,520
Even when we were in college,
I tried reaching out…

71
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,313
[breathes deeply]

72
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,898
…many, many times.

73
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,235
You never answered.

74
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,949
Why?

75
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,453
[sighs sharply]

76
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,455
Why are you asking this now?

77
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,292
Because I need to know how you managed

78
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,419
to forget about us like it was nothing.

79
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,507
[melancholic music playing]

80
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,721
My father died,
then Louisa followed after.

81
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,349
Then, you left.

82
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,935
You left us.

83
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:15,982
You abandoned us as if
it's the easiest thing to do.

84
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,528
[cries]

85
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,405
You-- You were all I had.

86
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,365
[breathes sharply]

87
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,369
[melancholic music continues]

88
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,497
It was so easy for you, wasn't it?

89
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,710
Well, it wasn't for me, Erica.

90
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,632
I was hurt.
And I felt betrayed by what you did.

91
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,761
- Betrayed?
- [music fades]

92
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,388
You felt betrayed?

93
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,225
Well, which one of us ran away first?

94
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:56,064
[sullen music playing]

95
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,315
[laughs in disbelief]

96
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,858
You know, Alice…

97
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,654
Out of everyone, I was expecting for you
to be the one to support and listen to me.

98
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,867
But you chose them instead.

99
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,913
What are you talking about?

100
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,041
You chose to support Beth's lies.

101
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:20,129
[sullen music continues]

102
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,596
I begged all of you to believe me

103
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:32,266
because I know what I saw,
but none of you listened.

104
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,313
You even accused me of choosing Lucas

105
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,857
as if I wasn't also
mourning Louisa's loss.

106
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:44,779
You treated me like a criminal
just because I wanted to tell the truth.

107
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,201
I needed an ally back then the most.

108
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,373
But you abandoned me, Alice.

109
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,460
[scoffs] I did it for Louisa's sake!

110
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,421
I didn't want her killer to get away.

111
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,881
[scoffs]

112
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,969
To this day,
you still can't admit it to yourself?

113
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,595
[huffs]

114
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,973
You followed what Beth wanted

115
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,683
because you didn't want trouble.

116
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,935
That's what you always do, Alice.

117
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,274
You'd rather turn a blind
eye than face your own problems.

118
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,276
Huh?

119
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,903
Okay.

120
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,031
Okay. Call me a coward.

121
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,743
Sure, whatever. But isn't that a bit much?

122
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,748
Is was what we did so bad
that you'd turn your back on us?

123
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,504
How can you forgive Edong,
who is a murderer,

124
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,800
but us, me, you can't?

125
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,012
He wasn't a monster
when we threw him in prison.

126
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:55,224
He was tortured
and raped in prison, Alice.

127
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,352
He went through that
even though he was innocent

128
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,688
all because
you lied and I didn't speak up.

129
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,482
[sighs sharply]

130
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,736
We ruined his life.

131
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,738
[breath quivering]

132
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,281
Does that even matter to you?

133
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:14,785
[panicked breaths, sniffles]

134
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,122
How could I forget about my friends

135
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,416
who I thought was
different from my mother,

136
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,253
but also made me feel
that I didn't deserve

137
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,380
to be heard and believed in?

138
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,717
- Like I'm just a speck of dust,
- [Alice sniffles]

139
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,719
that you can easily trample.

140
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,932
You knew how hard it was for me

141
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,518
to speak up and fight for what's right.

142
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,063
The first time I spoke up,

143
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,814
I thought you were all on my side,

144
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,984
but it was you who silenced me in the end.

145
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,531
[sullen music continues]

146
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,991
How could I ever forget?

147
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,038
[sniffles]

148
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,460
- [breathes sharply]
- [sniffles]

149
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,675
[both sniffling]

150
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,803
[sighs]

- [crickets chirping]
- [music fades]

152
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,267
- [cutlery clinking]
- Oh, you made it just in time.

153
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,143
Ma, Pa, let's eat!

154
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,523
What would you like to drink?
We have soda, juice…

155
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,857
So where's the beer?

156
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:33,197
[Samuel] What?
Did you think you were slick?

157
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,200
You both know drinking
is not permitted in our family.

158
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,411
Just what would the congregation think?

159
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,081
I'm a pastor. And yet my family…

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,334
Are full of drunkards!

161
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,879
[sullen music playing]

162
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,257
But… it's just every once in a while, Pa.

163
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,802
And we only invited our close friends.

164
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:59,181
Still, you should have
thought about our family's reputation.

165
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,142
Especially your father's.

166
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,020
You could have just
had a simple gathering.

167
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,730
Did there have to be drinking?

168
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,648
[Chloe] You're so cringe!

169
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,483
Stop acting like you've got rizz!

170
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,402
We'll just drop by Miss Alice's!

171
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,196
Desperate behavior, bruh! Desp--

172
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,908
Grandma, Grandpa.

173
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,081
[Sarah] God bless you.

174
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,044
Are you Beth's daughter?

175
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:29,879
Yes!

176
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,132
But it seems you always forget.

177
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,762
Because you always ask me when we meet.

178
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:42,099
And I always forget how blunt you can be.

179
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,352
Oh! I take after my mother. [chuckles]

180
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,730
Pastor Samuel, Miss Sarah.

181
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,107
Good evening.

182
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:55,488
[tense music playing, ends]

183
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,791
- [Alice]<i> After you left,</i>
- [pensive music playing]

184
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,252

<i>college I tried reaching out…</i>

185
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,879
[breathes sharply]

186
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,339
<i>…many, many times.</i>

187
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,051
<i>You never answered.</i>

188
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,721
[pensive music continues]

189
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:40,199
"HI, ALICE. ABOUT EARLIER…"

190
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,458
[sobbing]

191
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,307
[pensive music continues]

192
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,319
"Althea: YOU'RE AMAZING, ERICA!"

193
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,198
"ERICA, WHAT REALLY
HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND MAMA?"

194
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,461
[pensive music fades]

195
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,712
It's really late.

196
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,757
Why did your car leave?

197
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,095
I sent my driver home, Uncle.

198
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,015
I'll call him
when I need him to come back.

199
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,100
Alice?

200
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,478
Alice, are you okay?

201
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,813
Did something happen?

202
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,066
[somber music playing]

203
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,694
Alice, is there a problem?

204
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,365
[sobbing]

205
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,162
Alice. Come, let's sit down.

206
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,710
[Alice inhales sharply]

207
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,340
[somber music continues]

208
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:23,385
I- I feel like I've done everything wrong.

209
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,387
[Alice breathes shakily]

210
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,059
The things
that happened after Louisa died…

211
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,812
My friendship with Erica falling apart…

212
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,148
My marriage…

213
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,152
I feel like I'm such a failure, Uncle.

214
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,532
All of it's a mess.
I just ruin everything.

215
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,699
[Edward] Alice.

216
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,827
Alice, that's not true.

217
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,080
That's not true.

218
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,253
I just keep thinking that I wish--

219
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,630
I wish I wasn't the one who was saved.

220
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,508
I wish Papa's alive right now.

221
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,638
Because if I hadn't
asked him to drive me there,

222
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,809
then he would still be alive.
I wish he were still alive.

223
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,103
[sobs] This is all my fault.

224
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,522
Alice, it's not your fault.

225
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,818
It's not your fault,
so don't ever think that way, okay?

226
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,531
Your Papa loves you very, very much, okay?

227
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,076
How would he feel if he heard you today?

228
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,954
He would be hurt.

229
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,084
I'm sure your Papa's very happy

230
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,004
that you were the one
God saved from that accident.

231
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,631
Because even though he's not here,

232
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,885
you still made a life of your own.

233
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:52,016
It may not be perfect,
but he knows that despite everything,

234
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,686
you never give up, Alice.

235
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,689
So, don't ever give up.

236
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,109
Okay? Don't ever give up.

237
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,447
[somber music continues]

238
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,407
Come here. [grunts]

239
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,872
[music fades]

240
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,458
[Beth] Why didn't you tell
me you were going to Joshua's?

241
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,753
I asked permission from Papa.

242
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,714
[Ryan] I just went to pay our bills,
then I picked her up.

243
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,509
Starting today,
you can't go to Joshua's house, okay?

244
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,555
But why, Mama? You always let me go there!

245
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,849
And I thought we were
no long in danger from Edong!

246
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,810
Just listen to me!
From now on, you're not to go there!

247
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,939
Just listen to you?!
You're breaking the rules, Ma!

248
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,442
I thought we aren't allowed
to make rules without an explanation?!

249
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,489
Is this still punishment for what I did?

250
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,449
Aren't you being petty, Ma?!

251
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,952
Excuse me?! I'm no petty?!

252
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,704
Can't you just listen to me, Chloe?!

253
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,956
Just this once!

254
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,626
[uneasy music playing]

255
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,174
[footsteps receding]

256
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,551
Love, our daughter's right.

257
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,971
You're not following the rules.

258
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,974
Besides, why are you forbidding
Chloe from going to Joshua's?

259
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,558
Did you two fight?

260
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,270
- Come here.
- Huh? Why?

261
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,313
Just come.

262
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,982
- Don't make any noise.
- Why?

263
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,191
Just come here.

264
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,360
[uneasy music continues]

265
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,738
Liezel and Angelo are lying.

266
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,533
They said they were
never friends with Louisa,

267
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,076
but that's not true.

268
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,828
[music fades]

269
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,416
[Edward] Alice? Go sleep in the room.

270
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,418
Alice?

271
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,294
Alice?

272
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,089
Alice?

273
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:51,343
[somber music playing]

274
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,535
[somber music continues]

275
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:20,372
- [thunder rumbling]
- [music ends]

276
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,124
- W-What--
- Keep it down.

277
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,876
What do you mean?

278
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,544
[crickets chirping]

279
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,212
I talked to Miss Vangie.

280
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,547
- Oh?
- The owner of the coffee shop.

281
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,258
I forgot Louisa worked there.

282
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,802
Angelo worked there, too.

283
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,305
Miss Vangie even said

284
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,100
Louisa became close
friends with Liezel and Angelo.

285
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,479
- Huh?
- Tch.

286
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,980
- What's with you?
- What?

287
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,023
Don't you get it?

288
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,359
Louisa and Angelo
could've been in a relationship.

289
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,361
So you're saying that,

290
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,823
Erica's theory
that Louisa had a secret boyfriend,

291
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,700
that they planned to leave Amurao,

292
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,328
but because Louisa
changed her mind, he killed her,

293
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,913
that guy's Angelo?

294
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,750
[scoffs] No, no, no.

295
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,376
That's impossible.

296
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,047
But why did they lie?
Why did they have to hide it?

297
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,173
[scoffs]

298
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,551
And Liezel,
how does figure into all of this?

299
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,888
I think Liezel knows,
and she's covering for Angelo.

300
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,599
Love… Love, do you hear yourself?

301
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,520
We know them. They're our friends.

302
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,730
They wouldn't do that.

303
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,901
You know, I can't understand you anymore.

304
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,112
The other day you were convinced

305
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,030
that Edong did kill Louisa.

306
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,616
You didn't believe anything Erica said.

307
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,786
But now you're acting like this,
and telling me all that.

308
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:46,250
Tch. It's because
I saw this in Liezel's things.

309
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,253
- [paper rustling]
- Here, look at it.

310
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,673
- Erica saw Louisa writing that.
- "MY BANA, I LOVE YOU"

311
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,134
But it's suddenly in Liezel's belongings?

312
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,220
Then it means Louisa gave that to Angelo!

313
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,806
Love.

314
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,558
Love, this could've just gotten lost.

315
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,643
This could've gotten lost in their things.

316
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,355
We accidentally swapped P.E.
uniforms all the time, remember?

317
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,940
I'm sure this isn't Angelo's.

318
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,650
Then let's prove it.

319
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,610
What?!

320
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,239
Help me prove
that Angelo and Liezel are innocent!

321
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,283
Don't we want the same thing?

322
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,244
We don't want them to be guilty of this,
so you have to help me.

323
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,787
- [uneasy music playing]
- Why?

324
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,455
What do you mean, "why"?!

325
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,834
Because I need to know that Erica's wrong!

326
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,629
I need to prove that I didn't
put an innocent man in prison, okay?

327
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,342
[Ryan breathing deeply, clicks tongue]

328
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,054
Love,

329
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,099
you know I'd give
you the stars and the moon.

330
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:50,522
But for me to lie, and spy on our friends?

331
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,443
I can't do that.

332
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:59,865

00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,270
<i>You left the house barefoot, Alice.</i>

353
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:38,982
<i>Was it because the light was</i>
<i>turned off that you ran outside?</i>

354
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,151
<i>We believe that Edmundo Santiago is dead.</i>

355
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,237
<i>Why don't you tell the truth?</i>
<i>That you shot my brother,</i>

356
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,781
<i>even though he was unarmed!</i>

357
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,407
[Ryan] <i>Why don't we just ask them?</i>

358
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,117
[Beth] <i>What if Angelo is a murderer?</i>

359
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,453
<i>Will you let him know your suspicions?</i>
