You still haven't gotten a proper report!

There's no trace of Edong on the CCTV,

I've also spoken with the NLEA.

00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,785
Find out which idiot
helped Santiago get out!

131
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,620
He's the one who can point us

132
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,081
to whatever hole
that bastard is hiding in!

133
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,333
You want the NLEA to get to him first?

134
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,584
Then we're both screwed!

135

Gosh, love,
you were so intense with that couple!

00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,348
I mean, you grilled Mel and Anton
better than the NLEA.

140
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,601
Well, wouldn't
you question Anton's decision, too?

141
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,188
His wife goes missing
while a criminal's on the run,

142
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:28,693
and instead of looking for Mel,
he comes to interrogate me.

143
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,737
There's something
wrong with that guy, I promise.

144

His smiles and charm won't work on me.

Of course, they won't work

146
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,661

Love, remember you said
something felt off about Alice?

149
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,546
And now, it's Mel and her husband, too?

150
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,256
Why don't you just tell them straight up?

151
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,552
[student 1] Maybe it's just a lookalike.

152
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,595
[student 2] No.

153
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,388
That's the guy in the news.

154
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,099
- It was Psycho Edong I saw.

- [student 3 chuckles]
- It's true.

- He's funny.
- What are you saying?

157
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,188
Why would he be at karaoke
instead of going after Miss Beth?

158
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,524
Isn't he supposed to be getting revenge?

159
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,360
[student 2] Chloe and Joshua are lucky
that psycho didn't kill them.

160

[student 3] OMG, so true!

161
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:20,077
She mentioned TikTok
that Edong was the one stalking them.

162
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,120
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,123
That daughter of yours better watch out.

Is Miss Alice just lacking sleep,
or did she lose weight?

167
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,469
Tell her to eat, okay?

168
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,805
You should've shown me
earlier so I could've told her myself.

169
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,142
I told you Edong cut off someone's hand,

170
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,352
and that's all you have to say?

171
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,021
You shouldn't have even told me that.

172
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,523
Now, I won't be able to sleep!

173
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,319
What if he had caught us that time?

174
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,196
Then it would be our severed hands

175
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,239
getting delivered to our parents.

176
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,532
Aren't you shocked?!

177
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,870
Do you really think
you're just watching true crime?

178
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,538
This is actually happening to us!

179
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,667
You seriously have no rizz and no guts!

180
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,837
Anyway, just lend me
your parents' old high school pictures.

181
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,048
Everything you can find
from their high school days.

182
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,383
No rizz?

183
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,510
I can accept no guts, but no rizz?

184
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,637
Use Miss Beth's photos instead!

185
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,515
She said everything's gone!

186
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,642
My dad's coming home.

187
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,561
I'm in full family mode.
Don't even try to boss me around.

188
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,357
Why is the whole school talking
about what Edong did to you?

190

Are you seriously bragging about it?

191
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,406
Do you really want to give him a reason

192
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,699
to come back and finish what he started?

193
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,244
Sorry, Ma.

194
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,456
Just stop talking about it, okay?

195
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,626

Sir, Cruz just reported something new.

199
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,812
He was at Gate 4 the day Edong got away.

200
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,398
Apparently, he didn't
inspect one police officer's vehicle

201
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,275
when the graveyard shift was leaving.

Why are you just saying this now?

205
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,323
[stammers] Sorry, sir.

206
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:25,870
He claimed that his vehicle had already
been inspected twice during the red alert.

207
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,329
Which officer?

208
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,707
Who?!

Okay, I'll wait for that arrow. [chuckles]

213
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,175
So cute!

214
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,551
He's so adorable, babe.

215
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,679
When will we have our own Seth?

216
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,309
Oh, your kids will be so beautiful.

217

Hmm.

That's why I love my wife.

225

She's not like other women.

226
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,169
Motherhood? No.

227
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,421
Career? Yes.

[scoffs] Don't worry, babe.

231
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,807
I'll be able to practice with Seth

232

Yeah! I told you the first week, didn't I?

I just didn't expect
the situation to be like this.

But still, my ever-so-sweet husband

238
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,077
said that it's okay, that I can stay here.

But you already agreed. Right, babe?

254
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,452
It even made Alice very happy.

255
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,746
You're coming home.
You don't have a choice.

256

And then, what? You'll leave me for good?

than getting locked up in
our house under your "protection."
