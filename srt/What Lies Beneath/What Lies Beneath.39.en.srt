00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,506
<i>"Akong bana, I love you"?</i>

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,053
<i>Men, if he doesn't surrender,</i>

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,014
<i>our orders are to take him dead or alive.</i>

6
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,181
<i>Are we clear?!</i>

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,474

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,772

[gunshots]

11
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,115
You can't be here.

12
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,784
Edong!

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,121
- Sir, stop!
- He's Santiago's brother!

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,041
Please cut him some slack, sir.

15
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:45,962
He was injured!

16
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,923
He didn't have a gun,
and you still fired at him?!

17
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,050
You sons of bitches!

18
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,635
You bastard!
Who do you think you're swearing at?!

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,763
- You!
- Do you want to get arrested?

20
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,140
How can you help
your brother if you're in jail?

21
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,394
[Lucas] Edong…

[suspenseful music playing]

29
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,835
[Chloe] Ma?

00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,557
[suspenseful music continues]

31
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,813
[music becomes unsettling]

32
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,565
I've deployed more of my men

33
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,985
and also called the Coast Guard for help

34
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,112
so we can find
the body as soon as possible.

35
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,114
- Okay, sir. Thank you.
- Thank you.

36
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,198
Sanches!

37
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,742
- [music fades]
- [water rushing]

38
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,161
What did he say? Where's my brother?!

39
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,705
They haven't found his body yet.

40
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,045
My brother's not dead yet.

41
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,338
I'll help.

42
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,632
I'll hire a private
search-and-rescue team.

43
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,011
All the search-and-rescue
units have been deployed,

44
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,013
as well as the Bureau of Fire Protection.

45
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,764
Even the Coast Guard is now keeping an eye

46
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,434
on all the areas
where Edong might surface.

47
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,937
All the experts
are working on finding him.

48
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,481
So just like Erica said earlier,

49
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,027
if you cause trouble,
the police might not give you information.

50
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,821
Why would I believe you, huh?!

51
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,698
You want my brother to die

52
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,867
so he won't be a problem!

53
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,079
Accuse me all you want.

54
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,456
But don't drag Erica into it.

55
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,293
How many times does she have to tell you

56
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,171
she wants Edong
alive and prove he's innocent

57
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,257
even if he's lost
his mind and wants to kill her?

58
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,802
- [pensive music playing]
- [sirens wailing distantly]

59
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,680
If Erica says she'll do something,

60
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,891
she'll do it.

61
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,021
I know because
she did the same thing for me.

62
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,908
- [music fades]
- [indistinct chattering]

63
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,915
[Marco breathes deeply]

64
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,211
<i>Uh…</i>

65
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,757
<i>Thank you for coming, Attorney.</i>

66
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,301
<i>Um…</i>

67
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,640
<i>I got your name from a friend.</i>

68
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,893
<i>He said you helped his brother.</i>

69
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,692
<i>So even though I wasn't</i>
<i>sure if you'd look at my case,</i>

70
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,863
<i>I still took a chance and called you.</i>

71
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,366
<i>Don't thank me yet</i>

72
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,911
<i>because I'm still not</i>
<i>sure if I'll take your case.</i>

73
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,584
<i>You coming here already means a lot to me.</i>

74
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,922
<i>I've heard you help</i>
<i>people who have nothing,</i>

75
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,175
<i>the ones no one believes.</i>

76
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,430
<i>I just want you to hear my story.</i>

77
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,684
<i>Your ex accused you of raping her.</i>

78
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,812
<i>Stacey only did</i>
<i>that because her father forced her to.</i>

79
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,399
<i>He's a former vice mayor of our city.</i>

80
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,318
<i>He's rich and has many connections.</i>

81
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,071
<i>He didn't approve of his daughter and me.</i>

82
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,451
<i>I don't know how</i>
<i>we reached this situation, Attorney.</i>

83
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,579
<i>But I didn't rape Stacey.</i>

84
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,664
[Marco breathes deeply]

85
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,751
<i>I changed my ways for her.</i>

86
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,547
<i>I left the gang and dropped everything</i>

87
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,884
<i>to prove to her and her father</i>

88
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,136
<i>that I love her and I'm the one for her.</i>

89
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,388
<i>That I deserve to be with her.</i>

90
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,764
[Marco sighs loudly]

91
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,600
<i>She's pregnant.</i>

92
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:02,148
[somber music playing]

93
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,072
<i>You didn't know.</i>

94
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,620
[Marco] <i>Attorney…</i>

95
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,499
<i>You have to help me.</i>

96
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,628
<i>My child can't grow up without a father.</i>

97
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,756
<i>Help me prove that I'm innocent.</i>

98
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,341
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

99
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:35,556
[music becomes stirring]

100
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,724
<i>Okay.</i>

101
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,476
<i>Okay?</i>

102
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,355
<i>I believe that you aren't a rapist.</i>

103
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,191
<i>So… okay.</i>

104
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,235
<i>I'll help you.</i>

105
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,111
<i>You really believe me?</i>

106
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,532
<i>I trust my instinct</i>
<i>when it comes to these things.</i>

107
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,617
<i>And my instinct is rarely wrong.</i>

108
00:08:55,701 --> 00:09:01,624
<i>But if it turns out I'm</i>
<i>wrong and I prove you're lying,</i>

109
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,377
<i>I'll make sure you rot in here.</i>

110
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,588
<i>Is that clear?</i>

111
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,549
[Marco sighing deeply]

112
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,888
[Marco] She did what
I thought was impossible.

113
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,100
My case was dismissed and I was set free.

114
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,810
But I didn't get
to see my ex and my child.

115
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,229
They told me Stacey left for America

116
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,522
- to give birth there.
<i>- Come out!</i>

117
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,856
But that was a lie.

118
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,650
<i>Come out and face me, fucker!</i>

119
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,069
<i>You killed Stacey and my child!</i>

129
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,088
<i>Enough! Break it up!</i>

130
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,007
<i>I said stop it! Enough!</i>

131
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,175

[guard 2] <i>If he shows up here again,</i>

133

<i>Is that so?</i>

135
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,142

I'm where I am now because of Erica.

If you still aren't
convinced that she can be your ally,

If it gets approved,

218

how you shot my helpless brother.

227
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,875
We were justified in shooting him.

228
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,711
We gave him clear
orders to stay put and surrender.

229

happened to you on TV.

Was it too much of
a bother to call me? I'm your mother!

Ma, if I had told you,
you'd probably rush back here.

273
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,409
It's better that you're somewhere far away

274
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,411
so you wouldn't get involved
if something bad happens here.

dares to show up while I'm here,

a louder voice than Mama's.

raped her first before killing her.

[teen 4] That's not what I heard.

300

People say it was because of drugs.

301
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,994
Apparently, they were both drug addicts.
