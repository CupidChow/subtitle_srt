00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,261
at one point in my life… [sniffles]

179
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,061
I was in Bianca's shoes.

[Liezel] <i>Son, I know…</i>

184
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,164
<i>you heard about Bianca.</i>

185
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,167
<i>I just want to explain it to you</i>

186
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:36,839
<i>why I helped and protected her.</i>

187
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,135
<i>You must've heard the rumors.</i>

<i>She's a lesbian.</i>

190
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,934
<i>Meaning, she loves--</i>

191
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,019
<i>Girls.</i>

192
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,604
<i>I know.</i>

193
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,316
<i>My classmate, Ava, is also a lesbian.</i>

194
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,944
<i>She's a girl, but she also likes girls.</i>

195
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,530
<i>Wait, lesbian isn't the right term.</i>

196
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,909
<i>She said she's bisexual.</i>

197
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,369
<i>And you're okay with that?</i>

198
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,830
<i>Of course, Ma.</i>

199
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,124
<i>Why wouldn't I be?</i>

200
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,838
<i>It's fine if</i>
<i>she likes boys or girls, right?</i>

201
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,051
<i>It's up to her who she falls in love with.</i>

<i>But do know that…</i>

205
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:41,153
<i>it won't change my love for your father.</i>

206
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,533
<i>Once…</i>

207
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,664

[music fades]

210
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,969
I loved Louisa Soria

211
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,930
and I hid it because of shame.

212
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,600
[somber music playing]

213
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,937
I told you.

00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,522
[music fades]

215
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,899
I would make
a reason for you to come home.

216
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,569
So…

217
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,653
<i>Are you on your way?</i>

218
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,781
[clicks tongue]
I had Tim do some social media listening.

219
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,533
And you know what?

220
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,701
[scoffs]

221
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,327
You have supporters.

222
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,330
<i>But I have mine too.</i>

223
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,623
<i>And there are many of them.</i>

224
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,125
<i>Because there are women</i>

225
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,627
who are not fooled by you.

226
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,005
<i>And these women believe that women,</i>

227
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,048
should have
the last say about their bodies.

228
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,093
These are also my clients and supporters.

229
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,721
<i>So, nice try, asshole.</i>

230
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,930
But this time,

231
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,682
I win.

232
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,643
But we both really know…

233
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,521
that's not true.

234
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,565
Right?

00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,192
[unsettling music playing]

236
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,029

[mic feedback]

242
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,479
But there's no wrong kind of love.

243
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,399
That's what Bianca and my son taught me.

244
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,571
If my son can accept me,

245
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:52,660
and if someone
younger than me can be brave

246
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,536
to love honestly,

247
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,831
why can't I? [sobs]

248
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,626
- [somber music playing]
- Because I hid the truth,

249
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,754
it festered.

250
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,635
Until it became poison.

251
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,553
[sobs] And now…

252
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,556
it exploded in the open.

253
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,519
I know this may change everything.

254
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:22,815
[sniffles] I could lose
everything because of it.

255
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:29,613
You asked me if there's still
any reason for us to stay together.

256
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,158
We wouldn't have lasted
this long if there was none.

[music becomes tender]

258
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,328
I love you, Angelo.

259
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,167
And I can't imagine a life without you,

260
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,754
even if I loved someone else.

261
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,842
[sniffles]

262
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,386
Yes, something changed.

263
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,015
My love changed. [sobs]

264
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,308
But it didn't disappear.

265
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,187
You have been my rock.

266
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,274
You made me stronger, Angelo.

267
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:10,612
And if you'd still have me,

268
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,824
[sniffles] we can start anew.

No more secrets.

No more baggage weighing us down.

[Samuel] Stop it! You're an embarrassment!

That's enough!

275
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,264
You're just like
that flirt and demon Louisa!

276
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,435
That demon you're talking about

277
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,480
deserved more respect and love than you!

[Beth] <i>Liezel is really something, Louisa.</i>

00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,517
She told everyone
that you two were together.

00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,269
That she loved you.

285
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,606
I think if you were here,

286
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,651
you'd be proud of her.

And it has been a complicated journey.

When I saw you and Louisa here,

316

I thought it was the end of the world.

317
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,363
When she was gone,
I thought I was lucky…

318

because you won't leave me.

319
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,620
But I know
that you loved her more than me.

even though you're with me.

324

I feel that.

I feel that you've changed.

326
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,816
You used to be always happy.

It seemed you have no problems at all.

328
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,656
But you suddenly became quiet.

329
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,908
You would go hiking alone…

330
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,204
as if you wanted to escape everything.

331
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,833
I feel like I'm dying every day.

I'll accept it.

can accept everything
we kept from each other…

then why can't I?

348
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:38,857
I'll stop comparing
your feelings for Louisa,

349
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,777

00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:26,029
[music becomes stirring]

360
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,494
[music fades]

361
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,745
[Lucas] Why am I here?

362
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,998
- [blow lands]
- [grunts]

363
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,960
- [Lucas groans]
- [sinister music playing]

364
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:43,380
I heard that you're
working with Attorney. Melendez.

365
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,590
No. Why would I do that?

366
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,925
- [kick lands]
- [groans]

367
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:54,558
[tense music continues]

368
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,226
[Laurence] "Lost beauty queens."

369
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,186
[spits]

370
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,730
Like they give a fuck about those women.

371
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,358
They just want to destroy me.

372
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,611
When that news came out,
I had you followed.

373
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,575
You were seen
talking to that Attorney. Melendez.

374
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:15,954
[tense music continues]

375
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,749
She followed me, so I confronted her.

376
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,835
[Steve grunts]

377
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,795
- [Lucas] Steve!
- [Steve] What the hell?!

378
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,131
[Laurence] That's enough.

379
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,592
Erica knows about our connection.

380
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,053
She's keeping tabs
on me to get information.

381
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,555
She wants me to slip up.

382
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,850
But I'd never do that
because I'm not stupid! Damn it!

383
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,311
If I rat you out, I'll also go down!

384
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,439
Don't you dare betray me,
or I'll finish you!

385
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,817
Damn it! I swear I will finish you!

386
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,570
See? This is exactly
what she wants to happen.

387
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,614
To make all of you panic like crazy!

388
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,116
Why?

389
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,911
Because, her accusations
against you true, huh?

390
00:24:55,994 --> 00:25:00,665
[tense music continues]

391
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,086
[Laurence] Steve!

392
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,550
Lucas is right, Dad.

393
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,220
Don't lose your shit!

394
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,181
It's not a good look on you.

395
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,688
[tense music fades]

396
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:28,360
<i>Before I was presumed dead…</i>

397
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,740
<i>I found out that a drug</i>
<i>lord is brainwashing my brother.</i>

398
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,035
<i>And that bastard…</i>

399
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,998
<i>was also the supplier of</i>
<i>drugs in the prison I came from.</i>

400
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,460
<i>The world of drugs…</i>

401
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,462
<i>is like a quicksand.</i>

402
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,967
<i>I won't let my brother be trapped in that.</i>

403
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,844
<i>I will save him.</i>

404
00:25:55,929 --> 00:26:00,016
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>I will save my brother.</i>

405
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,063
[foreboding music playing]

406
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,404
[Ayoc] Damn it, Gio!

407
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,447
Can't you see that I'm talking to someone.

408
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,158
Alright?! Sorry about that, man.

409
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,329
It's a good thing I got
assigned to the province.

410
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,624
I'm not getting
enough rest in this damn house.

411
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,878
Okay. I'll update you when I get there.

412
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,172
Okay. Alright.

413
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,341
Phew.

414
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,428
[bottle cap clinks]

415
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,596
[sighs sharply]

416
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,059
[ominous music playing]

417
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,690
<i>I can be nice, but don't mess with me.</i>

418
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:53,987
[music becomes suspenseful]

419
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,705
[Ayoc] <i>If you cause any trouble…</i>

420
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,916
<i>it'll be your end.</i>

421
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,963
[suspenseful music continues]

422
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,137
[suspenseful music crescendos]

423
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:25,268
[Delores] <i>Your list of people</i>
<i>you want to kill is long.</i>

424
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,605
<i>I'm just making everyone</i>
<i>who wronged me pay for what they did.</i>

425
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:32,817
<i>Maybe you were given another chance</i>

426
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:37,655
<i>so you can change</i>
<i>your life and forget the past.</i>

427
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,407
<i>You don't understand!</i>

428
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,203
<i>If we don't prove that Edong is alive,</i>
<i>the police won't do anything.</i>

429
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,872
<i>We can't protect</i>
<i>the people we need to protect from him.</i>

430
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,582
<i>Maybe there's</i>
<i>a reason he's killing people.</i>

431
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,126
<i>- Edong?</i>
<i>- I was saved to save you, bro.</i>

432
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,670
<i>You shouldn't be with those people.</i>

433
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,464
<i>I'll take you away from her.</i>

434
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,049
[man] <i>Someone left this for you.</i>

435
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:59,386
[Edong] <i>Do not</i>
<i>enter the path of the wrong.</i>

436
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,554
<i>What's happening, Edong?! Edong!</i>

437
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,306
[Mel] <i>Help! Aah!</i>

438
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,265
[Lucas] <i>Edong!</i>
