00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:03,169
[Alice] <i>I'm really,</i>
<i>really glad that you're here.</i>

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,171
<i>- We all thought…</i>
- [Mel] <i>That I ended up like Louisa?</i>

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:09,426
<i>Who among you will be first?</i>

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,388
- [Steve] <i>Hello, dude.</i>
- [explosion]

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,640
<i>Dad knows where your brother is.</i>

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,725
<i>They're going to kill your brother.</i>

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,393
<i>Edong, run!</i>

8
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,145
<i>- Get out of here!</i>
- [gunshots]

9
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,521
<i>Aah!</i>

10
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,273
<i>I remember her writing on a note,</i>

11
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,983
<i>"My Bana, I love you."</i>

12
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,609
<i>And you think that was her boyfriend?</i>

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,611
<i>Obviously, it was a love note.</i>

14
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,113
<i>I was sleepwalking?</i>

15
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,782
<i>You went down</i>
<i>the stairs and sat in the corner.</i>

16
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,743
<i>What the hell is happening to me?</i>

17
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,744
<i>Erica!</i>

18
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,747
<i>Could you visit Mama before you leave?</i>

19
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,207
<i>Sorry, but I'm in a hurry.</i>

20
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,294
[Lucas]<i> Edong got shot in the thigh.</i>
<i>I'm sure he hasn't gone far.</i>

21
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:54,220
- [unsettling music playing]
- [electricity crackling]

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,364
- [unsettling music continues]
- [crackling continues]

23
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,178
- [thud]
- [glass shatters]

24
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:39,265

[unsettling music swells]

[unsettling music continues]

27
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:38,158
[unsettling music intensifies, fades]

28
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:44,622
[ominous music playing]

29
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,262
[ominous music continues]

30
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,517
- [fabric rips]
- [grunts]

31
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,690
[inaudible scream]

32
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,079
[music becomes tense]

33
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:41,054
[theme music playing]

34
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,791
[crickets chirping]

35
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,712
Mommy, I want to sleep beside you.

36
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,088
[exhales sharply]

37
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,758
You know what, babe? It's okay.

38
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,635
When you wake up tomorrow,

39
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,721
I'll be the first person you see.

40
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:11,352
And you can have
pancakes for breakfast with <i>latik</i> syrup.

41
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,939
And hmm… fish cracklings. [gasps]

42
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,066
Your favorite!

43
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,527
- Okay?
- Okay.

44
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,112
I love you. Good night.

45
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,947
- Good night.
- Let's go.

46
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,365
Let's go, Seth.

47
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,076
You'll have a yummy breakfast tomorrow.

48
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,161
Are you excited?

49
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,121
[Seth] Mm-hmm.

50
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,833
- Good night, Seth, Nanny Rose.
- Good night. [chuckles]

51
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,085
[pensive music playing]

52
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,128
[Alice] <i>Uncle…</i>

53
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,297
[exhales sharply] <i>Would you know if…</i>

54
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,717
<i>there's someone in</i>
<i>our family who sleepwalks?</i>

55
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,763
<i>In our family?</i>

56
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,264
[exhales sharply]

57
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,807
<i>Not that I know of.</i>

58
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,476
<i>Why?</i>

59
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,770
<i>Did Seth sleepwalk?</i>

60
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,440
<i>No, no, no, no. No, not Seth.</i>

61
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,441
[breathes deeply]

62
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,651
<i>It happened to me.</i>

63
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,656
<i>So, I was wondering if sleepwalking</i>

64
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,617
<i>runs in our family because…</i>

65
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,329
<i>I already asked my mom,</i>

66
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,873
<i>and she said no one</i>
<i>on their side sleepwalks.</i>

67
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:18,002
[pensive music continues]

68
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,087
<i>Uh…</i>

69
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,674
[chuckles] <i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>it was just a one-time thing.</i>

70
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,511
<i>Nothing to be worried about.</i>

71
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,931
[Alice] <i>Maybe I've</i>
<i>just been stressed lately</i>

72
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,474
<i>because of everything that's happening.</i>

73
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,142
[music fades]

74
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,852
You're not sleeping beside Seth?

75
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,021
Uh…

76
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,151
Uh, well…

77
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,905
Ever since Edong broke in here…

78
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,989
[breathes deeply]

79
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,492
I feel like Seth won't
be safe sleeping beside me.

80
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,328
Like, what if he suddenly attacks me?

81
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,623
I don't want Seth to get dragged into this

82
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,041
if Edong only wants to get back at me.

83
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,336
Well, you don't
have to be afraid for long.

84
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,547
Even the Amurao Police thinks so

85
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,675
since they already
pulled our security detail.

86
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,051
[soft music playing]

87
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,094
I hope so.

88
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,345
- [Mel chuckles]
- I really do.

89
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,388
[Alice breathes deeply]

90
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,974
So we can all finally get
back to why we're really here

91
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,100
- in the first place.
- Mm-hmm.

92
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:18,187
I mean, we only wanted
to honor Louisa's memory.

93
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,983
And now, suddenly,
everything's about Edong.

94
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,027
- [phone chimes]
- [music fades]

95
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,074
[uneasy music playing]

96
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,617
"MISS YOU LIKE CRAZY, BABE.

97
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,287
ENJOY YOUR TIME WITH
YOUR FRIENDS! LOVE YOU."

98
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,167
"OH, DEAR LORD!
IF HE'S NOT LIKE THIS. NO, THANKS!"

99
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,752
"I HOPE WE CAN CLONE ANTON 1000 TIMES
SO WE CAN ALL HAVE A PERFECT HUSBAND."

100
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,129
[scoffs] My goodness.

101
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,797
Men really are something else.

102
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,717
If they're not
hurting us or trying to kill us,

103
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,052
they're ruining everything in our lives.

104
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,222
[clicks mouth] That's true.

105
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,016
[breathes deeply]

106
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,435
Um, by the way…

107
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,022
- about what Erika said--
- You know what?

108
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,816
She doesn't have hard
evidence to support her theory.

109
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,693
And that's all it is.

110
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,069
A theory.

111
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,906
I'm with Beth on this one.

112
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,199
I think…

113
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,451
Let's not make things more complicated.

114
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,286
[Mel exhales sharply]

115
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,831
[pensive music plays, fades]

116
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,466
Hey.

117
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,383
Hmm?

118
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,469
Men are not allowed here.

119
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,056
You shouldn't be here. Why are you here?

120
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,766
Don't worry,

121
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,311
I'll be gone before
you even get your pepper spray, okay?

122
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,688
You keep saying that you're okay,

123
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,898
but you still drank a lot.

124
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,109
[Erica exhales sharply]

125
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,236
Fine.

126
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,196
I'll admit it.

127
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,326
I'm quite affected by seeing my sister.

128
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,579
- [somber music playing]
- [Erica sighs deeply]

129
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,707
After all, it had been 14
years since I last saw her.

130
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,794
[Exhales sharply] Hey.

131
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,380
Don't judge me.

132
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,762
Why is she forcing me…

133
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,390
to visit our mom?

134
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,395
- Doesn't she know…
- [zipper unzips]

135
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,981
what our mom did to me?

136
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,983
[scoffs]

137
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,196
So, you can't blame me

138
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,616
if I prefer talking about Edong.

139
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,536
[breathes deeply]

140
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,871
I don't want to talk about my mom.

141
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,252
I also don't want
to talk about my sister…

142
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,463
or what happened to us back then.

143
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,008
[somber music continues]

144
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,092
Jeez.

145
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,511
Oh, I know.

146
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,392
Let's just talk…

147
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,938
about my congressional hearing tomorrow.

148
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,608
[exhales sharply]

149
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,155
Let's see if you'll be
happy to have a hangover

150
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,449
during your hearing
tomorrow, okay? [chuckles]

151
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:21,162
And I hope Edong's not yet dead.

152
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:27,710
[music becomes tender]

153
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,905
[somber music resumes]

154
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,951
[exhales sharply]

155
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:06,332
[music intensifies]

156
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,376
[groans]

157
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,296
[dramatic music playing]

158
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,728
[music fades]

159
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:36,237
[phone ringing]

160
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,031
[groans]

161
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,620
[exhales sharply]

162
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,500
What is it?

163
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,584
Hangover?

164
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,628
[huffs]

165
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,964
Did you call early on purpose?

166
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,174
[Marco] <i>Sorry, but this can't wait.</i>

167
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:02,263
My contact said the warden has called
a press conference at Bagumbayan.

168
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,516
[uneasy music playing]

169
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,978
This is Prison Officer 3 Joselito Usman.

170
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:09,895
[camera shutters clicking]

171
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,398
He has admitted that he was the one

172
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,109
who helped Edmundo Santiago,
alias "Edong,"

173
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,236
sneak in and out of prison multiple times

174
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,530
and ultimately escape.

175
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,157
[camera shutters clicking]

176
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,325
Warden, how did Edong escape

177
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,786
without being noticed
by the prison management?

178
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,207
There were clear lapses in our operations.

179
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,502
And I take full responsibility for that.

180
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,589
We're currently

Sir, sir. How much money
did he receive from Edong?

Despite repeated questioning,

183
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,223
he refused to give the full details.

184
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,977
Up to now, he still insists
that he doesn't know where Edong is.

[reporter] Sir.

186

As I said, he refuses to talk.
