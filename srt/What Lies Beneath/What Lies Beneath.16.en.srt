You stayed longer than what we agreed.

I heard Esther will
be staying there for now.

I'll send you money now.
Just keep an eye on Esther.

We'll get there before she leaves.

Dad's always like that.

Whenever I make a mistake,

I kneel…

80
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,960

A man who was mad because he lost his
business and that's what your father did!

92
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,129
You know very well how
my father does his business--

93
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,465
That's not how I like to do my business!

Don't act like a saint.

I don't touch people
who did nothing bad to me.

Fine!

You had the chance to walk away.

[dramatic music playing]

104
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,290
When you found out that he's Laurence Kyo

105
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,253
and what kind of person he is…

106
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:04,423
[dramatic music continues]

107
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,092
You could've left then.

108

But you didn't.

109
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,183
Because you knew…

110
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,103
I was right.

111
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,106
That you need him.

113
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,447
You think you'd get to where you are now

114
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,365
if it weren't for our money?

He'll watch you as you finish work.

She just dropped us off here

Right now…

00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,189
Anton, is it possible to clone you?

182
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,150
Girl, just raise your standards.

183
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,611
It's cheaper than science.

184
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,820
[laughing softly]

185
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,906
[Reema] Well, how's my models?

186
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,824
Oh! They look pretty!

187
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,660
- Keep it up! Keep it up!
- Reema's here!

188
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,745
- Oh!
- Surprise!

189
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,456
- Look who decided to show up!
- [chuckling]

190
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,499
You're giving… [smooches]

191
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,918
husband of the year energy, huh?

192
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,336
- Of course.
- [chuckles]

193
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,962
- Hi, dear. Mwah!
- Mwah!

194
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,256
My superstar.
I'm glad you decided to come.

195
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,342
- It's so nice to see you, Reema.
- Mm-hmm.

196
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,094
I'm just here to support my wife.

197
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,304
Maybe add a little buzz for her tonight.

198
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,307
I even asked some of
my fans to come support her.

199
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,935
Oh! Really? Cute.

200
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:30,898
But please, this event is all about Mel.

201
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,025
- [Mel chuckles]
- You know, it's her moment.

202
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,444
She doesn't need a man to shine.

203
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,654
Not even you.

204
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,780
Right, Mel?

205
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,156
[chuckles] True.

206
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,283
I don't need him.

207
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,036
[tense music playing]

208
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,955
- But I want him.
- [Reema laughs softly]

209
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,415
Come here, babe.

210
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,417
Okay, fine! I'll see you later…

211
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,669
- …on the runway, superstar.
- See you!

212
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,381
[chuckles]

213
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,507
- Uh, miss?
- Miss Mel?

214
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,550
- Yeah.
- We're ready now.

215
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,511
Um, do I still have
time for a bathroom break?

216
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,055
Uh, yes, ma'am. You've got five.

217
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,181
- Five minutes? Okay.
- Yes.

218
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,435
- You heard that? Four minutes.
- [chuckles softly]

219
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,812
You really couldn't
spare her that one minute, huh?

220
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,314
- She might pee on the runway.
- [chuckles softly]

221
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,192
Alright, alright.
I'll be quick, I promise.

222
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,444
[Tom] Okay, go.

223
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,529
Excuse me.

224
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,661
[Tim] Anton, let's go?

225
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,288
Let's go.

226
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,542
[Tom] Oh, he wants
a private moment with the wifey.

227
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,545
Hmm! I think I want to clone you too.

228
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,630
[exhales] Let's just go.

229
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:41,135
[tense music resumes]

230
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,980
[range officer] Don't grip it too tightly.

231
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,649
But don't hold it too loosely either.

232
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,361
What's important is
that you're in control of it,

233
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,405
not the other way around.

234
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,949
Take your time.

235
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,201
Take a deep breath.

236
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,079
Your first shots don't need to be perfect.

237
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:13,584
[tense music continues]

238
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,463
Are you ready?

239
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,548
[Scott] <i>You're not taking Seth with you.</i>

240
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,800
<i>I'll sue you for full custody.</i>

241
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,302
[breathing heavily]

242
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,722
[glass shatters]

243
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,893
[tense music continues]

244
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,228
<i>- I'll sue you for full custody.</i>
- [glass shatters]

245
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,687
[Edong laughing]

246
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,980
[gunshot]

247
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,359
[grunts, pants]

248
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,777
- [magazine thuds]
- [gun cocks]

249
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,115
- [tense music continues]
- [breathing shakily]

250
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,328
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- [breathing heavily]

251
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:53,499
[breathing heavily]

252
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,583
[exhales sharply]

253
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,212
- [door opens]
- [tense music fades]

254
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,965
[sighs]

255
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,677
[door opens]

256
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,890
What are you doing here?
The show's about to start.

257
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,315
You don't need me?

258
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,401
[sighs]

259
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,485
It's all you?

260
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,654
Is that it?

261
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,948
Anton, I didn't even say that.

262
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,159
It was Reema. And plus, it was a joke.

263
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,619
A joke?!

264
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,163
- At my expense?!
- [Mel breathes deeply]

265
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,540
Why are you even here?!

266
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,334
Didn't I tell you I don't want you here?!

267
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,295
And the show's about to start!

268
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,629
Please! Come on!

269
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,715
[huffs, sighs deeply]

270
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,050
Do you want
the staff to see us like this?!

271
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,178
Do you want them
to know you're sabotaging me?!

272
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,638
Is that what you want?!

273
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,017
[tense music playing]

274
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:03,569
[music becomes unsettling]

275
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,070
- [blow lands]
- [screams in pain]

276
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,740
[groans]

277
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,784
[whimpers]

278
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,747
[breathing heavily]

279
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,293
[unsettling music continues]

280
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,087
[Mel gasping]

281
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,053
[gasping, groans]

282
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:34,808
- [breathing heavily]
- [unsettling music continues]

283
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,231

[morose music continues]

295
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,720
[Edward] Alice?

296
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,471
Alice, are you okay?

297
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,806
[Alice sobbing]

298
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,309
Uncle! Uncle, it's Seth!

299
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,353
Seth was in danger. He was--

300
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,981
I couldn't… I couldn't do anything!

301
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,107
I…

302
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,152
I just froze. I…

303
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:12,406
What if something happens
to him and I can't protect him?

304
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,949
Alice, relax okay?

305
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,076
- [panicked breaths]
- Relax.

306
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,290

[audience applauding, cheering]

312
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,419
Where's Miss Mel?

313
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,838
Where's Miss Mel? She's next!

314
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,341
- I thought she's already here.
- No, I thought you called her!

315
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,717
- Find her!
- Where is she?

316
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,721

- There she is!

319
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,024
- She's here.
- I'm here, I'm here.

She's honor and power personified!

323
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,667
Celebrity stylist and style icon…

324
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,461
Mel Montenegro!

325
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,463
[audience applauding]

326
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,928
[music becomes ominous]

327
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:11,775
[ominous music continues]

328
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,085
[camera shutters clicking]

329
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,173
[host] The face of
Grace & Glam's whole new era!

330
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,843
[audience applauding]

331
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,431

[ominous music continues]

335
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,838
- Guys… [chuckles]
- So, how does it feel

336
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,798
to be the new face of Grace & Glam?

337
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,342
Oh my god.

338
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:22,262
Well, Grace & Glam has been
my favorite since I was a teenager.

339
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,931
I've been using this brand for years,

340
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,391
and even when
I thought I was going to be a doctor,

341
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,394
I used to style myself using their pieces.

342
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:34,900
And that's actually what kick-started
and inspired me to pursue styling.

343
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:39,780
So, this brand has really been part of
my fashion journey for the longest time.

344
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:43,242
Oh, what a surprise, Mr. Montenegro!
You must be so proud

345
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,869
because your wife is no
longer just a celebrity stylist.

346
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,956
She's now a model,
an endorser, and a fashion icon.

347
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,959
How does it feel being
married to such a powerhouse?

348
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,045
- Wasn't she briefed about this?
- [Anton] I always knew she would shine.

349
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:59,091
- Why is Anton suddenly the subject now?
- I feel so lucky to be her husband.

350
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,801
I'll support her however I can.

351
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,136
She really is amazing.

352
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,638
[tense music playing]

353
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,057
But how's life at home?

354
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,851
- Do you ever feel like…
- Excuse me, wait a second.

355
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,062
Do we not know what we're here for?

356
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,272
Uh…

357
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,024
You come here,
to cover an event honoring a woman,

358
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,610
and yet here you are
simpering with questions for her husband.

359
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,404
That's not really pro-women?

360
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,155
Are you mad at women or something?

361
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,826
- Aah! [groans]
- Babe!

362
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,077
- Babe!
- [Tim] Mel!

363
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,203
- Babe.
- Clear the space!

364
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,539
Stop rolling! Turn that off!

365
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,832
- Babe!
- [Tim] Mel!

366
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,750
- Babe!
- [Tom] Give her some room!

367
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,876
Turn that off!

368
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,712
- What's wrong with you?!
- [camera shutters clicking]

369
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,088
Babe? Babe!

370
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,174
[inaudible]

371
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:47,681
<i>Mrs. Montenegro,</i>
<i>you slipped and hit the edge of the table?</i>

372
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,434
<i>That's not true, Dr.</i>

373
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,561
[tense music playing]

374
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,604
<i>Have you checked</i>
<i>the CCTV at Alice's house?</i>

375
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,441
<i>My friend's already paranoid, okay?</i>
<i>So, please hurry up.</i>

376
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,735
<i>Ma'am Esther, do you remember me?</i>

377
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,486
<i>Maybe you saw something else.</i>

378
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,323
<i>The police will</i>
<i>understand if you made a mistake.</i>

379
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,866
<i>No, no, that's not true!</i>
