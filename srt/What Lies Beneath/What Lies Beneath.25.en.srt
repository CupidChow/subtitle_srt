I don't know if I should

I mean, why would
she endanger her life like that?

She's a lawyer. She has many connections.

I'm sure there are people protecting her.
That's why she acted so boldly.

Tsk. Ma, what was it like for Erica?

Did she have a difficult time?

52

Instead of grieving and
mourning her friend's loss,

57
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,952
she was dragged into
the investigation and court hearings.

58

They all ganged up on her because,

173
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,493
she refused to let anyone step on her.

174
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,995
Wow! Slay!

175
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,165
She's just like you, Ma. [chuckles]

176
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,209
- Me?
- That's right, Ma!

177
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,587
You don't let any
wrongdoing slide no matter what.

178
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,967
Makes sense why you were
friends with Louisa and Attorney Erica.

179
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,428
You're all GOATs. [chuckles]

180
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,222
["Sabay Sabay Tayo" instrumental playing]

181
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,266
[chuckles] You know what?

182
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:09,437
If only you could see Erica 1.0 back then.

183
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,939
She's nothing like the woman from live TV.

184
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,359
She used to be so quiet and timid.

185
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,988
That's fire, Ma!
It's character development.

186
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,115
She became braver just like you.

187
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,033
[chuckles]

188
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:27,997
And when will
your style of flattery develop?

189
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,042
I bet you're just
distracting me to get more Wi-Fi time.

190
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,753
Go ahead and disconnect
from the Wi-Fi, my obedient child.

191
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,547
Fax, Ma.

192
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,383
Facts? Yes, I'm spitting facts.

193
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:44,221
F-A-X, meaning "That's true."

194
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,266
[sighs] Stop inventing new words.

195
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,684
Sweet dreams.

196
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,811
Yes, Ma, I'm going to bed.

197
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,189
Good night. I'll drink some water first.

198
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,524
Okay. I'll put away your things.

199
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,401
- Okay, Ma.

[drawer slams]

203
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,637
Hot shower didn't work?

204
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,355
What are you mad about now?

205
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,151
You shouldn't have told
Tim and Tom about Edong.

206
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,695
- Why not?
- Because it's my story to tell.

207
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,948
It's a story you should
be proudly telling everyone,

208
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,574
but you've kept it to yourself.

209
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,660
Why?

210
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,873
Because I know you'll
use it against me, to control me.

211
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,458
[sighs] Here we go again.

212
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,002
I'm not trying to control you, Mel.

213
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,088
I'm trying to protect you.

214
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:03,884
[morose music playing]

215
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,721

[scoffs]

217
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,939
[Anton] Looking for your phone?

218
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,483
I have it.

219
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,027
Where's my phone?

220
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,863
I know you, babe.

221
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,781
You won't listen to me.

222
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,700
Even when I just want to protect you,

223
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,952
you think I'm trying
to sabotage you again.

224
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,872
You might get ideas, like leave the house

225
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,248
even when I said no.

226
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,418
Give me back my fucking phone!

227
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,087
Tomorrow.

228
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,672
[Mel breathes sharply]

229
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,258
Where is it?! Give it back to me!

230
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,217
Where's my phone?!

231
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,052
- Where is it, Anton?!
- Mel.

232
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,387
Get some rest.

233
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,014
[Mel breathing sharply]

234
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,098
Ugh!

235
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:57,563
[music becomes sinister]

236

[Mel breathing heavily]

238
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,575
Aah! Argh!

239
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,826
Really?!

240
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,120
You also took my ATM and cards?!

241
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,414
Fuck you!

242
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:20,878
[sinister music continues]

243
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:28,469
[music becomes dramatic]

244
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:46,236
[dramatic music continues]

245
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,410
[music fades]

246
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,081
Well? Still no sign of him?

247
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,832
[Erica] None at all.

248
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,460
I guess Edong isn't stupid.

249
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,421
[sighs sharply] At the most,

250
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,217
the police can
do a stakeout for two days but,

251
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,970
more than that, they'll call it off.

252
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,514
It's not like
they have unlimited resources.

253
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,643
[Marco] Well,
we can continue even if the cops pull out.

254
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,397
You have a comfortable sofa anyway.

255
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,732
You know that guys are not allowed here.

256
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,068
You're only here because it's necessary.

257
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,447
Why? You don't believe me?

258
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,074
[snickers] I didn't say that.

259
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,868
Oh, really? You didn't?

260
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,830
I can sense your judgment from here.

261
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,248
[Marco] Oh, come on!

262
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,875
I've been to prison, so who am I to judge?

263
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,460
[chuckles]

264
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,754
Do you want some coffee?

265
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,798
[coffee pot gurgling]

266
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,801
Here.

269
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,190
Hello?

[unsettling music continues]

271
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,741
It's okay.

272
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,242
Send him here upstairs.

273
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,370
[phone receiver clicks]

00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:25,210

[tense music fades]

280
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:24,978
[Erica] Marco.

281
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:29,942
It's okay.

282
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,362
[sighs sharply]

283
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,866
What do you want?

284
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,786
Aren't you even going to let me in?

285
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:51,046
[uneasy music playing]

286
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,148
I saw your press conference.

287

[uneasy music continues]

288
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,988
- If you're here to complain--
- I'll help you find my brother.

289
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,162
Do you think we believe you?

290
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:27,332
[uneasy music continues]

291
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,127
I know my brother's
going to end up in a body bag

292
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,753
once the police catch him.

293
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,257
[music becomes tense]

294
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,969
But if you can promise
that won't happen, I'll help you.

295
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,388
[smirks] We don't need your help.

296
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:45,392
[tense music continues]

[Lucas sighs]

298
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,738
That's what you want, right?

299
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,657
For my brother to die?

300
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,326
And then, what?

301
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,120
It'll erase everything you did to him.

302
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,499
And your conscience will be clear, right?

303
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:15,047
No matter how many times we tell you
you're mistaken, you never listen.

304
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,381
Then prove it.

305
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,468
[tense music continues]

306
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,970
Let's work together to find my brother.

312

[tense music continues]

314
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,971
I don't have anything to prove to you.

315
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,811
But if you want us
to work together, then fine.

316
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,562
Let's work together.

<i>Who will go first?</i>

321
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,338

<i>You'll finally get a taste of my justice.</i>

329
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:01,194

330
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,822
