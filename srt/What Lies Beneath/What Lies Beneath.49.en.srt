I don't get why Alice
failed to mention this to us.

We should've been
ready for that jerk coming back.

We could've protected our friend.

Honestly, I feel stupid.

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,350
I already had a bad feeling
when she denied being scared of him.

I should've pressed her more.

Well, then
he deserves an Oscar for his acting.

Mel, Alice is our priority.

47
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,090
Scott can never, ever go near her again.

48

I'll talk to her bodyguards.

It's not going to be easy, Mel.

We need to convince
Alice to report Scott to the police.

Until she does that,

You're still hurting now,

Damn, my training
really worked on that dog.

I led his spotted brother away
and tossed him into the river,

00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,299
Come on.
Just wait for me here, I'll go change.

181
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,801
I'll go with you.
Don't leave without me, okay?

182
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,470
[Mel] Don't leave without me.

183
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,433
Love, you get it, right?

184
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,018
It's just for another night.

185
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,313
After this one,
we're back to regular programming.

186
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:56,192
We just don't want Alice
to feel alone, especially now.

187
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,027
Here we go again.

188
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,820
We just got over Edong.

189
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:04,658
Is this a subscription
to StressFlix or iWantProblems?

190
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,993
I'm serious, love.

191
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,412
I know I can't stop you from doing that.

192
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,373
I'm just worried
you might get in trouble again.

193
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,294
Besides, is Scott really that dangerous?

194
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,587
Oh, don't worry.

195
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,423
We won't let even
his shadow into Alice's home.

196
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,885
Mel and I have talked
to the bodyguards last night.

197
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,638
He just got through us the last time

198
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,890
because we didn't
know how evil he was then.

199
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,351
Then, why didn't Alice tell you sooner?

200
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,355
I don't know.

201
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,315
But at least, she's opened up now.

202
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,361
Come on, go home now.
I'll be fine here, I promise.

203
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,321
Alright, I'll be on my way.

204
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,740
- Bye. Take care.
- I will.

205
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,700
[teacher 1] Have you heard?

206
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,496
Liezel had something
to do with Bianca's disappearance.

207
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,831
What?! How so?

208
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,042
[teacher 1]
I heard she kidnapped the girl.

209
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,419
And why would she do that?

210
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,172
Human trafficking.
They said she sold the kid.

211
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,134
Are we all talking about the Ma'am Liezel?

212
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,428
Yeah. The pastor's daughter.

213
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,180
[teacher 2] Goodness.

214
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:13,185
It's more believable
that we'd have laptops not textbooks

215
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,813
- than that fake news.
- Is it?

216
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,566
[teacher 1] Anything is possible now.

217
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,151
Some people just pretend to be holy.

218
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:25,322
Turns out, they're
the most vile people on the planet.

219
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,616
[tense music playing]

220
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,166
- Liezel! Liezel, wait!
- [music fades]

221
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,842
Bro, what's up?

222
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,557
Hey, Cringe Master!

223
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,475
Are you lagging again?

224
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,603
Are you on the Cloud with Miss Alice?

225
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,480
How many times do I have to tell you?

226
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,608
Stop calling me "Cringe Master"!

227
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:05,029
[uneasy music playing]

228
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,781
Whoa, bro. Chill.

229
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,159
What's gotten into you today?

230
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,160
Spill it.

231
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,996
Joshua, I heard your mom's a kidnapper.

232
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,706
Where is she hiding Bianca?

233
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,083
Hey, shut up! That's not funny.

234
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,462
Why do you care? Your mom said it herself.

235
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,677
- Liezel! Wait!
- What, Beth?

236
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,430
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

237
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,849
Liezel, I didn't mean to.

238
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,352
I didn't want this to happen.

239
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,772
You know how fast
news spread here in Amurao.

240
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,315
I know!

241
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,484
It's so fast, I can't keep up.

242
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,819
But what you told me last night,

243
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,697
what you asked me
about Bianca, that was serious.

244
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,743
You told me to tell
the police everything I know.

245
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,536
What did you mean?

246
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,789
Who did you mean?

247
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,625
Was it my son?

248
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,087
I know it wasn't, because he's a kid.

249
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,588
So, who else?

250
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,924
Angelo?

251
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,467
[uneasy music continues]

252
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,594
Why are you quiet now?

253
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,471
You were so brave last night.

254
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,223
Say it to my face.

255
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,810
Yes! I was talking
about Angelo, your husband!

256
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,939
Liezel, I'm just
telling you this as a friend.

257
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,857
I'm worried about you.

258
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,694
Do you really know the man you married?

259
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,321
Yes, I know my husband.

260
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,657
And you know him too, Beth.

261
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,870
That's why I don't get where
all these accusations are coming from!

262
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,456
[Candelaria] Mrs. Basa!

263
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,459
I need to talk to you in my office. Now.

264
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:48,799
[uneasy music continues, fades]

265
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:55,055
[engine rumbling softly]

266
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,351
So?

267
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,313
What treatments did
your therapist suggest?

268
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,524
Has it been helping you?

269
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,236
[Isla] <i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>we can meet today, Alice.</i>

270
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,947
<i>But that was the second time, Doc.</i>

271
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,867
<i>I don't understand why</i>
<i>I keep going back to that place.</i>

272
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,077
<i>Why is it important to me?</i>

273
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:21,040
<i>Alice, we can go back to that place,</i>
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

274
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,751
<i>It can help us figure out</i>
<i>why your trauma response</i>

275
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,961
<i>is leading you back to that place.</i>

276
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,629
<i>Then let's meet there today.</i>

277
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,634
<i>Alice, I understand</i>
<i>that you want answers right away.</i>

278
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,428
<i>But we cannot rush this.</i>

279
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:39,767
<i>You need to be</i>
<i>emotionally prepared before you go back.</i>

280
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:45,022
<i>That's why I need</i>
<i>to see you later in my office.</i>

281
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,190
<i>Okay, Alice?</i>

282
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,192
<i>So I can assess you properly.</i>

283
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:52,237
<i>But my husband's here.</i>
<i>I need to figure this out now!</i>

284
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:56,283
<i>And I promise I'll help you, Alice.</i>

285
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,951
[breathes deeply]

286
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,996
<i>Now breathe with me, Alice.</i>

287
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,915
<i>Breathe in…</i>

288
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,876
<i>breathe out.</i>

289
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,506
[pensive music playing]

290
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,673
Alice?

291
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,221
You know the directions
to that house, right?

292
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,807
House?

293
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,308
What…

294
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,227
The house I went to.

295
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,773
Yeah. But… But Alice…

296
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,316
We need to go there.

297
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,068
Right now.

298
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:37,324
[pensive music continues, fades]

299
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,326
I'm here in Amurao.

300
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,496
I'll update you as soon
as I hear from the police.

301
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,500
I hope this is a new
lead on Louisa's case.

302
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,168
Alright, just update me.

303
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,755
I'll go with
Francine Valmoria's father to PBI.

304
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,133
Are you sure they'll even take the case?

305
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,552
What if they just say
it's a crime of passion?

306
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,888
If they ignore the fact
that this might be drug related

307
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,349
and not just about a missing beauty queen,

308
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,476
<i>I'll appeal it to the DOJ.</i>

309
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,603
I'll bring it out
to the media and social media.

310
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,774
When I get back, I'll check Kyo's
connection to the other missing women.

311
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,026
If Laurence Kyo's connected to them,

312
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,946
it'll make our habeas
corpus petition stronger in court.

313
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,823
Lucas is connected to Kyo.

314
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,450
Maybe he can help us?

315
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,452
We don't need him here.

316
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,705
Have some conscience, Ma'am!

317
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,665
You're a teacher, for God's sake!

318
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,917
Bring Bianca out!

319
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:33,922
I'm not leaving until
you tell me where she is!

320
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,549
- Ma'am--
- Give me back my daughter!

321
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,886
Mrs. Seropon! Mrs.
Basa already said she doesn't know

322
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,345
where Bianca is!

323
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,222
And you just believed her?!

324
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,515
Because she's a teacher?

325
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,767
Because she's a pastor's daughter?!

326
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,102
[tense music playing]

327
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,979
What did you do to my daughter, Ma'am?

328
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,439
Did you sell her?

329
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,066
- Did you sell her?!
- Stop it, Mrs. Seropon!

330
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,818
Did you kill her?!

331
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,278
Where's the guard? Call him now!

332
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,447
Bring out my daughter, you witch!

333
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,533
- [Bianca's mother] Monster!
- [Liezel] Ah! Stop it, Ma'am!

334
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,452
[Bianca's mother] Bring out my daughter!

335
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,163
- Stop! Stop! I said stop!
- [music ends]

336
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:14,254
[unsettling music playing]

337
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,632
Did your therapist tell
you to come back here?

338
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,265
You know what I realized,

339
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,267
[music fades]

340
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,645
I've never been here in daylight.

341
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,772
The first time I found myself here,

342
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,775
I was too shocked
to take note of anything.

343
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:40,447
But is this place,
like somehow, familiar to you?

344
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,200
[sighs] No.

345
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,620
Not really. [scoffs]

346
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,913
I don't know.

347
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,748
Maybe there's no…

348
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,210
no meaning at all to why I'm here.

349
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,297
Isn't that weird?

350
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,216
You sleepwalked here.

351
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,676
Twice.

352
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,261
And it has no connection to you?

353
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:06,556
[pensive music playing, fades]

354
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,725
I know you're worried about your daughter!

355
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,936
But hurting people is wrong!

356
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,813
Especially when you don't have proof

357
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,731
Liezel's involved
in Bianca's disappearance!

358
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,110
Really? Yesterday
you were questioning her character!

359
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,445
And now you're defending her?!

360
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,990
What, you're working together now?
Are you in on it?

361
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,491
You're friends again?

362
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:29,579
Did you split the money
from selling my daughter?!

363
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,331
Where is my daughter?!

364
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,958
What are you even saying?!

365
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,334
You monster, you too!

366
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,128
- [Beth] Ahh! Ah!
- [Liezel] Beth!

367
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,546
Mrs. Seropon, stop!

368
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,423
- Where's security?!
- [Beth] Ahh!

369
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,216
- [Candelaria] Guard!
- You've crossed the line!

370
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,051
- Ahh!
- [Beth] Ahh! You went too far!

371
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,678
[whistle blowing]

372
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,722
- [security] Hey, stop it! That's enough!
- [women clamoring]

373
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,307
[Alice exhales deeply]

374
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,349
[Mel] Tsk.

375
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,436
You know what, I thought coming here

376
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,855
in broad daylight, clear head,

377
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,316
it would give me something.

378
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,777
But nothing.

379
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,863
Nothing.

380
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,408
Let's just go.

381
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,993
I need to see my therapist.

382
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,119
Okay.

383
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:31,808
[uneasy music playing]

384
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,857
It feels like… you've told us
about these two trees before.

385
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,320
[music becomes eerie]

386
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,782
What do you mean?

387
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,035
When you were five, when you went missing,

388
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:54,539
you mentioned something about,
two trees facing each other.

389
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,417
I think this is it.

390
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:02,464
[eerie music continues]

391
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,775
[young Alice crying] <i>Mama…</i>

392
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,028
[sobs loudly]

393
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,406
[young Alice sobbing] <i>Mama! Mama!</i>

394
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,035
Oh my god, Alice.

395
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,788
I think this was a vacant lot.

396
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,666
This is where they found
you when you went missing!

397
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:41,711
[music becomes sinister]

398
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,844
[music crescendos]

399
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,681
[Isla] <i>You said you didn't</i>
<i>remember anything from that day?</i>

400
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,808
<i>Sometimes the body keeps the memories,</i>

401
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,184
<i>even when the story is missing.</i>

402
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,602
[Beth] <i>Why didn't you tell us?</i>

403
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,855
<i>How are we supposed</i>
<i>to protect you when you hide everything?</i>

404
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,857
<i>You heard your friend got hurt,</i>

405
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,692
<i>and what's the first thing you did?</i>
<i>You judged her.</i>

406
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,487
<i>So tell me, Beth, why in the world</i>
<i>would I tell you anything?</i>

407
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,031
<i>I've seen how easy</i>
<i>it is for you to judge people.</i>

408
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,242
<i>You'd do the same to me and Angelo.</i>

409
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,327
[Beth]<i> We saw him come</i>
<i>home with blood on his hand.</i>

410
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,746
<i>That was the night Bianca went missing.</i>
