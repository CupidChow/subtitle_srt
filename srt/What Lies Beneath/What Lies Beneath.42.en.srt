Jeez.

Why don't we just ask them?

You really think they'll the truth?

[rain continues pattering]

32
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:37,258
Why would they do that if
they have something to hide?

00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,807
What if they're not hiding anything?

34
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,357
You're too loyal to our friends.

35
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,734
That's not how investigations work.

36
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,195
Why? Who's investigating?

37
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,155
Not me.

38
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,909
Didn't I tell you that I wouldn't do it?

[Yuri] Boss, we searched this area,
but we found nothing.

Negative.

56
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,846
We'll search this area next.

I didn't hear her come home last night.

Hi! [chuckles]

- [Margie] I missed you so much!
- [Mel chuckles]

72

[Margie] Oh my!

73
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:27,095
We heard so many things happened to you
while we were in Europe. Are you okay?

74
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,056
Uh, yeah! Yeah, Mom, I'm perfectly fine.

75
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,891
Alright, that's good. [chuckles]

76
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,144
When I found out
you were home, I knew right away

77
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,271
- I had to take you both here.
- [Margie] Mm-hmm.

78
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,482
- You know us very well, Anton.
- [uneasy music playing]

79
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,317
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

80
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,529
[Cedric] Mel, why are you still here?

81
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,698
Go back home to your husband.

82
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,951
- [uneasy music continues]
- [chuckles] But, Dad,

83
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,411
Alice hasn't been back in
the Philippines for so long.

84
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,747
I'm just making up for lost girl time.

[Cedric scoffs]

86
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,417
Ever since you were a little girl,

87
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,837
you've never had any sense.

88
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,591
Go back to Manila with Anton.

89
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,801
Today.

90
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,303
We're not here to visit you.

91
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,389
We came to fetch you.

00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,724
- [uneasy music continues]
- [Margie] Darling…

93
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:18,104
Mel has a husband now.
She's not a little girl anymore.

94
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,982
And if Anton is fine
with her staying here then,

95
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,900
it's none of our business.

96
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,694
It is our business!

97
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,071
Just a month ago,

98
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,407
there were rumors
going around that our daughter

99
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,783
is a husband beater.

100
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,744
She can't be making rash decisions.

101
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,371
Aren't you a celebrity?

102
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,960
Don't you check online
to see what people are saying, huh?

103
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,005
People are speculating

104
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,048
that you and Anton are fighting,

105
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,843
that you don't live in
the same house anymore.

106

[Alice] Oh!

109
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,404
Oh my! Is that
Uncle Cedric and Aunt Margie?

110
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,156
- Hi!
- Hello, Alice.

111
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,158
- Hi, Uncle!
- [Margie] Hi!

112
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,368
Your stay in the US treated you well.

113
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,786
You keep getting prettier!

114
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,789
Oh, Auntie,
I will never be as beautiful as you.

115
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,375
[all chuckle]

116
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,294
Oh, and Anton,

117
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,756
thank you so much
for letting Mel stay here.

118
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,799
I've missed her so much.

119
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:38,142
You know, Uncle, Auntie,
after this whole Edong escaping thing,

120
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,686
Mel and I haven't found time to hang out.

121
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,855
- [Mel] Mm-hmm.
- Actually, in two days,

122
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,483
we're going to be visiting
the house we're renovating.

123
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,195
- [Margie] Ooh.
- We've only been there twice.

124
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,531
[Alice] We've been
so focused on being safe

125
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,576
and secure from Edong,
so we haven't gone out much.

126
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,411
[chuckles] Oh.

127
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,289
Why wait two days?

128
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,625
Can't you go there today?

129
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,837
[Alice] Um…

130
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,009
Actually, Uncle, Auntie, we're planning
to make a whole thing out of this.

131
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,513
Mel, Beth, and I, we want to reminisce

132
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,058
and celebrate our friend Louisa.

133
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,227
[Cedric] Oh.

134
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,855
[chuckles] Of course, of course.

135
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,111

[music ends]

138
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,555
Chloe!

139
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,395
Chloe, I'm sorry.

140
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,732
It's not right to forbid
you without an explanation.

141
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,402
But can't you trust Mama for now?

142
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:15,740
[melancholic music playing]

143
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,452
[door closes]

144
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,831
- Hey, you!
- Hmm?

145
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,374
Don't ask Angelo anything.

146
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,961
But you said
you wanted to know what they know.

147
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,130
How would we do that without asking?

148
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,550
- But, love…
- Tsk. Oh, you.

149
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,969
Have we learned
nothing from those shows on TV?

150
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,556
Trouble starts when
the main character keeps secrets.

151
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,350
- Hmm.
- The solution is easy.

152
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,393
They just need to talk.

153
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,270
And what if Angelo is the killer?

154
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,564
Are you going to let him
know that you're onto him?

155
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,025
Do you want me and Chloe to get hurt?

156
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,028
Tsk. Is that why you're
stopping her from going?

157
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,324
Do you really think
Angelo is going to hurt Chloe?

158
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,076
Didn't I tell you?

159
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,495
Angelo is not a killer, okay?

160
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,666
You defend Angelo like he's your endgame.

161
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,962
Aww, you're so cute! Let's go. Come on.

162
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,008
[foreboding music playing]

163
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,635
[Margie] Where's our driver?

164
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,724
What have you told
your friends about me, huh?

165
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,685
Did you say bad things about me?

166
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:33,275
You really think I would tell them
that I married a monster, Anton?

167
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,862
I would rather die than
humiliate myself like that.

168
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,073
But you…

169
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,243
You don't seem to feel any shame.

170
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:47,123
Are you not embarrassed that you had to
call my dad just to bring me home?

171
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,667
Gloat all you want.

172
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,794
We both know

173
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,712
that you'll come back to me.

174
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,339
[Mel grunts]

[tense music playing]

176
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,718
Do you remember that time…

177
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,263
when I asked you to wear a costume?

178
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,557
And you kept saying no,

179
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,602
because you said it was degrading.

180
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,481
But no matter how many times you refused,

181
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,150
you still wore it.

182
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,902
For me.

183
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,491
I have tons of those videos, babe.

184
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:30,416
Videos that show
what a liar and what a tease you can be.

185
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,422
Your 'no' always ends up being a 'yes.'

186
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:40,676
[tense music continues]

187
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,393

[music fades]

190
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,089
Alice, I was worried about you earlier.

191
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,675
<i>When I woke up, you weren't there.</i>

192
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,094
I'm okay. I'm okay, Uncle.

193
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,015
<i>You left the house barefoot, Alice.</i>

194
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,225
[Edward sighs]

195
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,726
Is it because…

196
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,313
the lights were out, that's why…

197
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,232
<i>you went outside?</i>

198
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,736
<i>I- I'm sorry, I forgot.</i>

199
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,780
You don't like the dark.

200
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,743
It's okay. It's okay, Uncle.

201
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,537
It's not your fault. [chuckles]

202
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,788
I'm okay.

203
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,624
Umm, don't worry about it.

204
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,377
Alright, I'm just making sure

205
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,503
<i>you're okay.</i>

206
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,046
Yeah.

207
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,173
I have to go.

208
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,592
Talk to you soon, Uncle. Bye.

209
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,138
[unsettling music playing]

210
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:22,945
[woman screaming]

211
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,491
- [water gushing]
- [unsettling music continues]

212
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,750
- [inaudible chatter]
- [unsettling music fades]

213
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,130
The police are issuing a statement.

214
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,724
[inaudible chatter]

215
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,938
- It's starting. I'll call you back.
- [reporter] Let's go.

216
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,402
[police] It's been two
days since our encounter

217
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,237
- with Edmundo Santiago,
- [morose music playing]

218
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,616
the convicted murderer
who escaped Bagumbayan Prison.

219
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,326
He was armed and dangerous,

220
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,245
so our officers were forced to shoot him.

221
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,289
He fell into the San Dimas River.

222
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,459
Based on witness accounts
and consultations with our experts,

223
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,670
we believe that Edmundo Santiago is dead.

224
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:27,551
The search and retrieval operations
for his body, are still ongoing.

225
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,678
[reporter] Sir, a question?

226
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,221
Is that your explanation?

227
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,641
Why don't you tell the truth?

228
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,185
That you shot my brother,

229
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,895
even though he was unarmed!

230
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,064
- Get away from me!
- [inaudible chatter]

231
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,150
<i>I was there! "Armed and dangerous," huh?!</i>

232
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,361
<i>He didn't have a weapon on him!</i>

233
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,655
<i>- Nothing! He had nothing!</i>
- "POLICE: ESCAPED PDL DEAD"

234
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,658
<i>Now you're saying my brother's dead?</i>

235
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,160
<i>You don't even have his body!</i>

236
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,703
<i>Nothing!</i>

237
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,706
<i>Now you're giving up, huh?!</i>

238
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,087
- [dramatic music playing]
- [reporters chattering indistinctly]

239
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,939
[dramatic music continues]

240
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,908
[music fades]

241
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,786
<i>- Now you're giving up, huh?!</i>
- [woman] Poor guy.

242
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,288
Why do you feel sorry for him?
That's how it should be.

243
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,250
His brother Edong is
a criminal. People like Edong

244
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,836
- deserve to die.
<i>- You're the murderers! You!</i>

245
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,880
[man] I agree.
If they bring in Edong alive,

246
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:51,135
he might escape again
and come back here to kill more people.

247
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,178
The police did the right thing.

248
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,598
[Lucas] <i>You're the murderers! Murderers!</i>

[pensive music continues]

251
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,016
They said the search is still ongoing.

252
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,478
But…

253
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,937
[music fades]

254
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,939
they're reducing
the size of the search party.

255
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:51,528
Expect that by day five or day seven,

256
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,239
they'll issue a statement

257
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,158
that they're halting
their search for Edong

258
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,535
until they receive new information.

259
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,498
[distant traffic noise]

260
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,754
If you need anything,

261
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,007
you have our number.

<i>And who owns</i>
<i>the bloody clothes that were in his bag?!</i>

285
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,542
<i>- Ah!</i>
<i>- I couldn't save Louisa then,</i>

286
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,419
<i>and I couldn't save Edong now.</i>

287
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,837

288
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,213
