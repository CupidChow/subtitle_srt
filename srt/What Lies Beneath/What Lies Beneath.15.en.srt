But now I understand, Pastor.

161
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,146
You have to be the one to start it.

00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,860
You have to make it happen.

00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,781
[pastor] Edong is right.

179
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,849
- [woman continues screaming]
- It captured everything.

180
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,101
You can clearly make
out the suspect's face here.

181
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,771
Didn't that scum think
a house like that would have CCTVs?

182
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,317
[suspenseful music playing]

183
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,153
[woman] I hope you rot in jail!

184
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,779
[woman squeals, pants]

185
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,030
- [man grunts]
- [woman] Bastard!

186
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,699
[suspenseful music continues]

187
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,409
Go on! I dare you!

188
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,996
[man] I can't rot in jail!

189
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,497
Every one goes down with me!

190
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,708
Hey! What do you think you're doing, huh?

191
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:38,466
[upbeat music playing]

192
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,677
[phone ringing]

193
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,055
[Mel] Give me a sec.
I'll just take this call.

194
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,849
- Hello, Beth?
- [Beth] <i>Mel.</i>

195
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,976
I saw your message.

196
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,186
Is it true?

197
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,104
Someone broke into Alice's house?

198
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,398
How is she?

199
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,484
She's really scared.

200
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,738
They've checked into a hotel
until the house is ready.

201
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,115
Don't you find it strange?

202
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,953
After Erica warned us about
Edong and Lucas, this suddenly happened.

203
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:08,996
Oh, come on!

204
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,708
Don't tell me Erica got into your head.

205
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,960
<i>Edong has been locked away for years.</i>

206
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,296
<i>And didn't you say yourself</i>

207
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,424
that Lucas couldn't possibly
do the things Erica is claiming?

208
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,009
It's just a coincidence.

209
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,055
- Miss Mel? Just an update.
- Excuse me.

210
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,723
- We'll start in a while.
- Okay.

211
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,266
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

212
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,310
Beth, I have to go.

213
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,522
I'll call Alice right
after the show, okay?

214
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,649
Hey, good luck on your show.

215
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,901
Thank you. Take care.

216
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,405
You spoke to Erica?

217
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,033
Erica Melendez?

218
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,871
She suddenly showed up at
Lucas Santiago's gym opening.

219
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,831
She kept talking nonsense.

220
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,710
[exhales sharply]
She said that Celestino died

221
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,587
and Miss Esther went missing

222
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,965
because of Lucas and Edong.

223
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,092
- [Beth] Goodness!
- [pensive music playing]

224
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,301
Such nonsense!

225
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,928
What if she's right?

226
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,724
The kids said that the man who chased them

227
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,518
was wearing a cap and a hoodie.

228
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,229
Wasn't the guy…

229
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:22,403
who killed Louisa, [exhales deeply]
wearing the same thing?

230
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,823
[pensive music continues]

231
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,324
You still remember that?

232
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,288
I didn't know you followed
Louisa's case back then.

233
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,082
Did you two know each other?

234
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,085
Weren't you a year ahead of us?

235
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:43,716
I think everyone in
Amurao followed Louisa's case.

236
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,052
It shocked everyone in town.

237
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,472
[pensive music continues]

238
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,558
It's just a cap and hoodie.

239
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,643
A lot of people dress like that, right?

240
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,397
People would wear them
to look cool even if the weather is hot.

241
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,858
- You know…
- [chair scrapes]

242
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,694
Edong has been rotting in jail for years.

243
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,446
So Erica's wrong.

244
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,240
And it's completely wrong
that she's bringing up the past

245
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,160
as if we all weren't
traumatized by what happened.

246
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,370
[pensive music continues]

247
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,876
[music fades]

248
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,128
You told them earlier
that the guy was wearing a jacket.

249
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,796
I told you, it was a hoodie!

250
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,506
A hoodie is the same as a jacket.

251
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,967
- You're so cringe!
- I'm cringe?

252
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,762
A hoodie has a hood, a jacket doesn't.

253
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,513
Fine! You want proof?

254
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,268
[Joshua] What?

255
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,102
Look!

256
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:46,070
[suspenseful music playing]

257
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:49,073
<i>Hey! Stop that already, let's hurry!</i>

258
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,450
<i>Chloe!</i>

259
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,411
"WARNING: AMURAO CREEP."

260
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,873
The guy was about to kill us,
and you still took a video?!

261
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,833
Are you the GOAT or just cringe?!

262
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,168
Instinct, bro!

263
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,587
It's journalistic instinct.
You wouldn't know.

264
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,507
But you didn't show
it to the cops because it was too blurry.

265
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,466
Where's the proof in that?

266
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,718
You can't even tell if
he was wearing a hoodie or not.

267
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,179
At least I've got
something to post on my vlog!

268
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,182
Exclusive! Warning video!

269
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,350
Public service!

270
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,518
Civic duty!

271
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,395
[quirky music playing]

272
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,354
You know what?

273
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,273
You're starting to scare me.

274
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,276
[quirky music fades]

275
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,445
The man who's with Lucas in his posts

276
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,863
is Laurence Kyo's son.

277
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,240
Laurence Kyo?

278
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,867
Isn't he one of the top
meth suppliers in the Philippines?

279
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,162
[inhales deeply]
He's Lucas's business investor.

280
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,124
I once had a client.

281
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,626
Her husband who worked for Laurence Kyo…

282
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,046
was killed after a fight over money.

283
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,341
His wife had evidence,

284
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,635
but she dropped the case.

285
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:56,056
I think Kyo found out,
and after that, she went into hiding.

286
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,435
I've heard how that group operates.

287
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,771
If Santiago is connected to him…

288
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,984
then it makes sense
he could help his brother kill someone.

289
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,863
[foreboding music playing]

290
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:31,341
[foreboding music continues]

291
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,602
[exhales sharply]

292
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,987
- [music fades]
- [birds chirping]

293
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,992
Steve is back.

294
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,204
That's why I came here.

295
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,372
Sit down.

296
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,208
[cutlery clinking]

297
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,459
I ate already.

298
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,463
[birds chirping]

299
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,427
[phone thuds softly]

300
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,513
Don't worry.

301
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,432
No one's going to bother you anymore.

302
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,851
I took care of the problem.

303
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,436
[phone chimes]

304
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,566

<i>Monsters!</i>

307
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,867
[music turns suspenseful]

308
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,789
[Erica] Or at the very least,

309
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,542
they could've paid
someone to kill for them.

310
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,878
Or maybe Kyo's men

311
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,381
were responsible for what
happened to Celestino and Esther.

312
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,466
- [phone ringing]
- [huffs]

313
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,803
Hello?

00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,431
[woman] <i>Boss, Esther been spotted</i>

[sighs, mouth clicks]

316
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,647
My contact called.

317
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,276
Esther was spotted in
Meycauayan, visiting her sibling.

318
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,611
- [unsettling music playing]
- Huh?

319
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,446
- Are they sure?
- [Marco sighs]

320
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,532
We were wrong.

321
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,367
Esther Castro is still alive.

322
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:28,250
[unsettling music continues]

323
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,387

324
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,431
<i>Help!</i>

[unsettling music intensifies]

326
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,277
<i>Miss Esther, do you still remember me?</i>

327
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,696
<i>It was someone else. It was night time.</i>

328
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,865
<i>The police will</i>
<i>understand if you made a mistake.</i>

329
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,866
<i>No, no, I didn't.</i>

330
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,243
<i>Instead of calling me a liar,</i>

331
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,914
<i>you should repent for</i>
<i>covering up your brother's crime.</i>

332
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,791
<i>- Stay away from me!</i>
<i>- That's not how I like to do my business!</i>

333
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,294
<i>- Aah!</i>
<i>- What did you do?!</i>

334
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,630

<i>So please act fast!</i>

336

<i>Edong was at my house last night!</i>

337
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,470
<i>That's impossible! He's in jail, right?!</i>

338
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,847
<i>Edong Santiago has</i>
<i>been leaving the prison!</i>

339
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,933
<i>Is he escaping or</i>

341
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,603
<i>- I thought she was here.</i>
<i>- No. Didn't you look for her?</i>
