<i>I've never been here during the day.</i>

00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,055
<i>When you were five, when you went missing,</i>

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,976
<i>you mentioned something</i>

7
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,228

<i>- No. What about you?</i>

Are you okay?

[theme music playing]

66
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,917
Liezel, you're bleeding.

67
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,127
Don't pretend you're on my side.

68
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,632
Is that how you see me after
I literally pulled someone's hair for you?

69
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,179
You accused my husband
of my student's disappearance.

70
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,807
You're unbelievable, Beth.

71
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,268
Ever since we became friends,

72
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,980
I've seen how easy it is
for you to judge people.

73
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,859
I just didn't think Angelo
and I would be your targets, too!

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,445
Is that really how you see me?

75
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:45,326
You think I accused Angelo for no reason?

76
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,539
You want to know why?

77
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,711
Erica saw Louisa writing a letter

78
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,754
for her secret boyfriend.

79
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,591
Then I found
that letter stuck in your scrapbook.

80
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,136
How'd it get there?

81
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,222
- [uneasy music playing]
- Of course, I thought

82
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,850
Angelo was Louisa's secret boyfriend.

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,563
Then I realized you both lied to me.

84
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,816
You said you were never close to Louisa.

85
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,527
But the truth is both
of you were close to her

86
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,321
when she worked at Coral and Coffee.

87
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,489
What?

88
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,241
Are you still denying it?

89
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,703
[uneasy music continues]

90
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,540
So, does this mean
I've been trauma responding

91
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,043
to what happened to me
when I was five years old?

92
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,753
- [breathes deeply]
- [music fades]

93
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,504
[gasps]

94
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,466
But why that event?

95
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,886
Yes, I got lost.

96
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,139
But only for a few hours.

97
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,310
They found me right away.
It wasn't even the whole day.

98
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,189
Even the police said I just wandered off.

99
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,066
It was nothing.

100
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,486
- So, why?
- [pensive music playing]

101
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,654
What connection does this have to Scott?

102
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,032
You said…

103
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,868
you can't remember anything from that day.

104
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,164
Your mind might not remember,

105
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,333
but your body could.

106
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,168
Like I told you before,

107
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,963
sometimes, the body holds the memory,

108
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,007
even when the story's missing.

109
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,386
We can explore that, Alice.

110
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:33,684
[pensive music continues, fades]

111
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,145
What am I supposed to think, Liezel?

112
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,941
It didn't help that when
Ryan was about to talk to Angelo,

113
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,111
we saw him come home with bloodied hands,

114
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,615
pull a bloody shirt
and a knife out of his bag,

115
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:52,662
and wash himself,
like he'd done something wrong.

116
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,997
That was the night Bianca disappeared.

117
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,083
[tense music playing]

118
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:01,671
So, maybe you should
ask your husband before judging me.

119
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,633
He went hiking that day.

120
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,260
Maybe…

121
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,137
Maybe he just got injured.

122
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:14,350
So, now, you're blaming him
for what happened to Louisa, too?

123
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,102
Are you insane, Beth?

124
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,855
[tense music continues]

125
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,238
I was worried about you, Liezel.

126
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,574
And about Joshua.

127
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,827
I just don't want you to get
dragged into this and get hurt.

128
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,789
So, Liezel, if you know something…

129
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,793
[tense music continues]

130
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,675
[music fades]

131
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,269
Bruh, I'm sure that was
just a misunderstanding.

132
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,189
Mama would never do that to Miss Liezel.

133
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,024
I was there.

134
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,817
I saw it.

135
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,652
She did it.

136
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,490
Why'd she humiliate my mom like that?

137
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,242
If she was angry,
they could've just talked!

138
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,831
So, if our moms fight,
we should fight, too?

139
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,542
[morose music playing]

140
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,170
Are we only friends
because they're friends?

141
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,506
Or because we want to be friends?

142
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,636
Because for me, it's the second one.

143
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,973
Even if our moms
become enemies, you're still my bro.

144
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,935
[morose music continues]

145
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,481
But, maybe, for you… I'm not.

[morose music continues]

00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,452
Let's go back to what
you saw during your nightmare.

149
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:01,707
[breathes deeply] What did you see
and how did it make you feel?

150

[Alice inhales deeply]

151
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,049
Same thing.

152
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,553
I was in the dark…

My hands were tied.

That was all I could see.

157
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,231
[Isla] Let's explore that space.

158
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,234
The darkness you were in…

159
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,447
was the air hot or cold?

160
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,909
It was hot…

161
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:38,995
and cramped.

162
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,414
Where was your head?

163
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,709
Were you lying down? Kneeling?

164
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,336
Bowed down?

165
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,588
[Alice] <i>Before,</i>

166
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,592
<i>I used to think I was</i>

167
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,803
<i>- But now…</i>
- [eerie music continues]

168
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,555
I think I was…

169
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,223
I was crouched.

170
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,020
My knees were pressed against my chest.

171
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,271
That's how cramped it was.

Can you still fold your body that way?

Uh…

I can.

180
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,794
[breath quivers] I mean…

181
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,381
Not like that, but…

182
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,261
I mean, it's not
that cramped anymore, but…

183
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,929
I guess if--

184
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,224
If I was a kid, I can do that.

185
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,353
- [breathing heavily]
- [pensive music fades]

186
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,856
Did you say anything?

187
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,400
[eerie music playing]

188
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,943
Did you hear anything?

189
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,864
Was there another voice?

190
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:02,453
- [pensive music continues]
- [shuddering]

191
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,871
Before I woke up,

192
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,290
I could…

193
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,877
I could no longer hear my own crying.

194
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,296
Instead,

195
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,383
what I heard was a child's cry.

196
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,220
- [breathing heavily]
- [young Alice crying] <i>Mama! Mama!</i>

197
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,846
[exhales sharply]

198
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,225
What does-- What does this mean?

199
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,645
The child crying, was that me?

200
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,980
[eerie music continues]

201
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,607
Nothing's matching. [sniffles]

202
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,692
Nothing's making sense.

203
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,861
We're closer than you think, Alice.

204
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,782
Be kind to yourself. We're getting there.

205
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,325
I promise.

206
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,954
[music fades]

207
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,969
[sullen music playing]

208
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,642
I'm not here to cause any trouble.

209
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,603
I just want to get my things and…

210
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,398
explain to Seth why
I won't be staying here anymore.

211
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:14,900
You're leaving?

212
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,569
I'll be at a hotel.

213
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,529
But I'm going to wait.

214
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,906
[Beth] Wait for what?

215
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,867
Alice is not going with you.

216
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,493
And we're not letting you near her.

217
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,912
I would've already
reported you to the police.

218
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,248
You should have
a restraining order by now!

219
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,709
[inhales deeply]
Remember when we first met?

220
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,627
[music becomes somber]

221
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,920
I was panicking.

222
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,131
But you calmed me down.

223
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,757
- [breathes deeply]
- [Scott sniffles]

224
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,635
I tried to hide it,
but you saw through me.

225
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,680
You saved me.

226
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,101
You said that one day,
it'll be my turn to save you.

227
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,561
[somber music continues]

228
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,230
So, if saving you now means stepping back

229
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,524
and letting you figure things out,

230
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,651
then I'll wait, Alice.

231
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,196
And I'll keep waiting…

232
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,450
until you realize that I'm still me.

233
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,160
And we're still us.

234
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:10,080
[somber music continues]

235
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,000
Alice…

236
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,398
[music fades]

237
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,109
Why did the school
let that woman hurt you?!

238
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,486
That shouldn't have happened.

239
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,821
I should've been there, Ma.

240
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,241
I could've protected you.

241
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,660
I'm okay now.

242
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,119
Stop worrying.

243
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,871

244
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,878
[Beth] <i>It didn't help that</i>

245
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,797

246
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,716

Uh…

253
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:29,577
Remind me, what were
we doing on the night Bianca disappeared?

254
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,372
Why? Did someone ask you?

255
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:38,294
Do you need proof that you weren't near
that girl when she disappeared?

256
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,422
- [uneasy music playing]
- I just want to be prepared

257
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,008
in case someone asks me.

258
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,427
[Joshua] We were at home that night, Mama.

259
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,848
We were watching
the ML Championships on TV, remember?

260
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,267
[nervous chuckle] Oh, yeah!

261
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:58,480
And you Partner, you were out hiking.

262
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,190
You didn't get home until late.

263
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,363
I lost track of time.

264
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,784
The hike went so smoothly that day.

265
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,204
You didn't even want me to go

266
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,749
because you were afraid
I'd have an accident.

267
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,168
Well, look.

268
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,503
I didn't even get a single scratch.

- [Mel] Alice, Scott left already.
- [music fades]

272
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:47,112
He wanted me to tell you,
he's staying at La Casa de Ella.

273
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,407
He also asked if
you could let Seth visit him there

274
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,077
since you don't want him around.

275
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,705
He said you could have
Rose and a bodyguard go with him.

276
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,499
[Beth scoffs] Is he for real?

277
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,376
Alice can't do that. Right, Alice?

278
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,295
I don't know.

279
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,464
What do you mean I don't know?

280
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,675
Do you still trust that guy?

281
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,093
[tongue clicks]

282
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,304
[sighs deeply] I don't
know anything anymore, Beth.

283
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,392
You know,
when I got lost when I was a kid,

284
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,268
I thought it was just a simple event.

285
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,729
But maybe it wasn't.

286
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,317
What I was sure
that Scott had something to do with,

287
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,819
maybe doesn't after all.

288
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,488
[sighs] I don't… I don't know.

289
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:33,242
Those "maybes" and
assumptions might be right,

290
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,494
but that doesn't mean
you're wrong about Scott!

291
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,664
Your husband could really be a bad person!

292
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,623
Beth.

00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,375
[huffs]

294
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,377
I'm just really getting tired of this.

295
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,424
Why is it that us women keep making
excuses for men who abuse us, huh?!

296
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,342
They hurt and disrespect us,

297
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,846
yet we still forgive
them and let them near us!

298
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,180
[exhales sharply]

299
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,142
[Beth] And you,
Alice, why didn't you tell us?

300
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:02,104
How can we protect you if
you hide everything from us, huh?

301
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,982
You cared more about
your husband's reputation

302
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,318
than protecting yourself
and the people around you!

303

[brooding music playing]

305
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,615
And why would I tell you anything?

306
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,242
Hmm?

307
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,702
Listen to yourself.

308
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:21,040
You found out your friend was hurt,
and the first thing you did was judge her.

309
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,917
So, tell me, Beth, why in the world

310
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,045
would I tell you anything?

311
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:33,427

That time I got lost.

00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,232
<i>She's always having these outbursts!</i>

356
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,402
<i>She might not be ready</i>
<i>to face her memories just yet.</i>

357
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,280
<i>Let's give her more time.</i>

358
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,658
- [wailing continues]
<i>- Hush now, dear.</i>

359
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,787
[Susan] <i>We tried</i>
<i>taking you back to the clinic,</i>

360
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,748
<i>but every time, you'd have an outburst.</i>

361
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:13,295
<i>Your Papa and I couldn't</i>
<i>handle seeing you suffer like that,</i>

362
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:18,467
<i>so we eventually decided</i>
<i>not to go back to the doctor.</i>

363
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,304
<i>Especially since</i>
<i>it seemed like you were doing okay.</i>

364
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,765
<i>You could sleep alone in your room again,</i>

365
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,977
<i>and you didn't have</i>
<i>outbursts when we're not around.</i>

366
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,355
Just like how you used to be.

367
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,691
[pensive music continues]

368
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,361
Why are you bringing it up now?

369
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,280
Is there a problem, Alice?

370
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,075
[sighs deeply]

371
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,827
Nothing. There's no problem, Ma.

372
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,956
<i>I just remembered.</i>

373
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,583
- [sighs deeply]
- [music fades]

374
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,920
That's so good.

375
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,839
Don't worry about it, okay?

376
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,008
[Susan] <i>Just focus on your family.</i>

377
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,887
<i>I saw Scott post your family photos.</i>

378
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,014
<i>You all look so good together.</i>

379
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:10,727
Does that mean
you're fixing your relationship?

380
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:15,440
[tense music playing]

381
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,113
I've talked to the local police in Amurao.

382
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,157
I asked them about the missing child.

383
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,951
[music fades]

384
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,288
They said it's just a runaway case.

385
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,501
I talked to their neighbors, too.

386
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,086
They said Bianca didn't have

387
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,672
a good relationship with her mother,

388
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,258
ever since she remarried.

389
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,513
So, it doesn't have
any similarities with Louisa's case?

390
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,894
[ominous music playing]

391
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,748
You don't think I'm
that kind of person, do you?

392
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,000
Like what Alice said?

393
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,169
It wasn't you, right?

394
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,630
The Louisa in my dream.

395
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,674
[unsettling music playing]

396
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,762
[leaves rustling]

397
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:40,609
[unsettling music continues]

398
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:05,801
[music becomes sinister]

399
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,947
[sinister music continues]

400
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:53,056
[ominous music plays, fades]

401
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,933
<i>Angelo, come out of there!</i>

402
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,518
<i>Did you hurt my wife?</i>

403
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,855
<i>Why are you accusing him</i>
<i>of attacking you without any proof?</i>

404
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,523
[Beth] <i>You have your own doubts</i>
<i>about your husband, don't you?</i>

405
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,192
<i>It's possible that Angelo</i>
<i>was Louisa's secret boyfriend.</i>

406
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,569
<i>Attorney Erica, please help.</i>

407
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,906
<i>Mama and Papa suspect that the</i>
<i>person who hurt her was Louisa's killer!</i>

408
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,617
<i>Do you know anyone</i>
<i>who might've killed Louisa?</i>

409
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,161
<i>Yes! He's already hurt her.</i>

410
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,872
<i>I'm so worried about Mama, Attorney!</i>

411
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,791
<i>Please, Angelo. Stop hurting people.</i>

412
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,168
<i>Please, that's enough.</i>

413
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,003
<i>She won't stop until she ruins our name.</i>

414
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,296
<i>I need to teach her a lesson!</i>

415
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,757
<i>We've been calling Beth,</i>
<i>but we can't reach her.</i>

416
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,343
<i>If something bad happens to my wife,</i>
<i>I'm going to kill Angelo.</i>

417
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,846
<i>Beth! Show yourself!</i>
<i>Let's end this once and for all!</i>

418
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:37,267
[suspenseful music playing]
