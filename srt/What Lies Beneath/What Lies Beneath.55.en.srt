00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,186
How can I be calm, Beth?!

180
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,896
You want to ruin my family!

181
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,731
No! That's not true!

182
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,733
What did Liezel and
I ever do to you, huh?!

183
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,193
Why are you doing this to us?!

184
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,402
Let go of me!

185
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,112
- Let go of me!
- [Angelo] Aah!

186
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,282
- [groans] Ugh!
- [panting]

187
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,409
[Angelo groans]

188
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,163
[exhales sharply]

189
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:08,584
[suspenseful music playing]

190
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,296
[Mel exhales deeply]
Ryan, why didn't you tell us

191
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,341
that there's something
happening between you and Angelo?

192
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,592
Beth didn't want me to.

193
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,053
She didn't want to put Liezel in danger.

194
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,305
I shouldn't have listened to her.

195
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,058
I should've reported
Angelo to the police from the start.

196
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,479
Wait. We're not
even sure what's happening.

197
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,815
We could be wrong!

198
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,317
[sniffs] If something
bad happens to my wife,

199
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,819
I'll kill Angelo.

200
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,573
[music turns tense]

201
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,596
- They're already here.
- [music fades]

202
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:10,688

203

[dramatic music playing]

207
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,019
Oh!

208
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,522
I can handle myself.

209
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:02,823
[dramatic music continues]

210
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,249
We're here. [inhales sharply]

211
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,960
[Alice] Where are they?

212
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,879
You said they'll be here.

213
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,839
[Ryan exhales deeply]

214
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,175
[huffs]

215
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,259
[trunk creaks]

216
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,015
[suspenseful music sting]

217
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,099
Beth!

218
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,810
[Angelo] Beth!

219
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,607
[Liezel] Ah.

220
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,400
[Angelo] Beth!

221
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,404
Face me! Let's get this over with!

222
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,281
Beth!

223
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:56,126
[suspenseful music continues]

224
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,388
[Liezel] Partner!

225
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,514
[Ryan] Beth!

226
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,475
- [Mel huffs]
- [music fades]

227
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,394
How the hell are
we going to look for her here?

228
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,562
This area is massive.

229
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,522
And everything looks the same.

230
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,984
It's better if we go separately.

231
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,408
[suspenseful music resumes]

232
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:32,121

[Beth whimpers, pants]

235
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:39,962
[Angelo] Ah!

236
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,965
[Angelo grunting]

237
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,552
[grunts]

238
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,263
Hey! Come back here!

239
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,518
- Beth!
- [music ends]

240
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,271
Ma'am Beth!

241

[young Alice crying] <i>Ma! Ma!</i>

245
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,502
Hey. Alice.

246
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,713
<i>Mama!</i>

[eerie music continues]

249
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,968
Are you okay?

250
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,304
If you want, you can take a break.

251
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,181
The two of us can look for Beth.

252
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,892
No, no. No.

253
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,729
No. I- I'm fine.

254
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,649
I'll be fine.

255
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,700
[eerie music fades]

256
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,204
[suspenseful music resumes]

257
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,748
[Angelo] Beth!

258
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,798
Beth!

259
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,967
[Angelo] Beth, what are you doing?

260
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,802
Let's stop this!

261
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:14,515
[suspenseful music continues]

262

[Liezel] Angelo!

[Ryan] Beth! Where are you?

267
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,160
Beth!

268
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,163
Angelo!

[suspenseful music continues]

271
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,861
Aside from here…

272
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,492
Screw this.

273
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,584
[suspenseful music continues]

274

282
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,953
[Angelo] Partner. Are you okay?

283
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,871
- You okay?
- [Liezel whispers] Partner.

284
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,915
[Ryan] You bastard!

285
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,291
- [Beth] Ryan!
- [Angelo] Ah!

286
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,168
No!

287
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,170
[Beth] Ah! Stop!

[Ryan grunts]

289
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,800
That's enough!

290
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,718
- Stop!
- [Liezel] Angelo!

291
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,221
- [Beth] Enough!
- [Liezel] Partner!

292
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,598
[Angelo, Ryan grunting]

293
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,183
[Angelo] Ah!

294
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,811
- [blow lands]
- Help!

295
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,479
Angelo, that's enough!

296

[distant gunshot]

297
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:09,940
Shit.

298
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,608
Hands up! Get away from him!

299
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,444
One wrong move and I'll shoot!

300
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,571
[Angelo huffs]

301
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,698
Why are you going to shoot me?

302
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,742
Point it at Beth. She started all of it.

303
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,119
What? You want to kill my wife?!

304
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,871
What are you talking about?

305
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,373
No! I'm begging you.

306
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,791
Please don't hurt him.

307
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,252
I'll bring him to the police myself.

308
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,837
Put your gun down.

309
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,921
What do you mean?

310
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,882
Why would I turn myself in?

311
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,050
Angelo, it's okay.

312
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,386
It's okay. I'm here.
I promise, I won't leave you.

313
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,055
I'm innocent!

314
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,807
Why would I kill Beth?

315
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,517
[Ryan] Innocent?

316
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,603
You pretended to be
Liezel in your text message.

317
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,397
You asked her to come
here and chased her with a knife.

318
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,107
And you want me
to believe you're innocent?!

319
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,277
I'm here because
Beth told me to come here!

320
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,320
What?

321
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,114
What?

322
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,991
Are you going to deny
that you sent those messages?

323
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,659
You told me all about this!

324
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,494
Time, place, everything!

325
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,790

337
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,142
I came here because
she threatened to hurt my family.

338
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,687
T- That's not true!

339
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,563
[Angelo] It's
a different number, but it's you!

340
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,274
[Beth] I said it's not me!

341
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,484
Can I see your messages?

342
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,736
I want to see
the messages you both received.

"SURE. WHERE?"

346
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,412
I didn't send those.

347
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,415
My phone's been
missing since this morning.

348
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,251
Ryan, I told you about it earlier, right?

349
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:39,464
[unsettling music continues]

350
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,718

352
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,696
You're both telling the truth.

[music fades]

354
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,699
Then why did you chase me?

355
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,284
Because you ran!

356
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,952
You pointed a knife at Beth!

357
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,662
Because she pushed Liezel!

358
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,956
And I thought
she was going to stab my wife

359
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,916
because she picked up the knife.

360
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,210
I was just protecting Liezel.

361
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,172
What about Bianca?!

362
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,923
I have nothing to do with that!

363
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,550
Ryan and I saw you.

364
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,011
Your knife, hands,
and clothes were full of blood.

365
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,472
It was the same night
when Bianca went missing.

366
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,932
You even washed off all the evidence.

367
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,059
How are you going to explain that?

368
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,435
I came from a hike!

369
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,229
Someone got into an accident,
and I helped them.

370
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,647
But I got injured, too.

371
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,232
It was Judge Tecson's child.

372
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,652
They offered to take me
to the hospital, but I went home.

373
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,446
I cleaned my stuff

374
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,866
because I know that Liezel
will get worried if she sees it.

375
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,285
She keeps stopping me from hiking.

376
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,246
Why do you have Louisa's letters?

377
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:54,956
Letters?

378
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,416
What are you talking about?

379
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,794
Just admit it, man!

380
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,463
What do you want me to say?
I didn't do anything!

381
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,924
I can tell when
a person is telling the truth or not.

382
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,509
You're lying!

383
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,968
Tell us.

384
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,180
Were you and Louisa
in a relationship before?

385
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,516
[uneasy music playing]

386
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,226
Were you the recipient of her letters?

387
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,357
Are you Bana?

388
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,945
[uneasy music continues]

389
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,492
He's telling the truth.

390
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,621
[uneasy music continues]

391
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,003
He had no connections with Louisa.

392
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,383
The letters weren't for him.

393
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,428
They were for me.

394
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,520
I'm Bana.

395
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:04,234
[stirring music playing]

396
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,584
[music crescendos]

397
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,961
<i>Louisa and I were</i>
<i>in a relationship before.</i>

398
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,379
<i>I loved Louisa.</i>

399
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,131
<i>We loved each other.</i>

400
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,341
<i>Maybe you're just</i>
<i>saying that to cover for Angelo.</i>

401
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,010
<i>What do you find hard about this?</i>

402
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,388
<i>Understanding what I've said?</i>
<i>Or accepting the truth?</i>

403
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:37,309
[Mel] <i>I can't believe Louisa</i>
<i>had a secret life we knew nothing about.</i>

404
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,935
<i>Why didn't she tell us?</i>

405
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,313
<i>- We could've helped her.</i>
- [Beth] <i>She chose to protect Liezel.</i>

406
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,939
<i>What about you, Beth?</i>
<i>Who were you protecting</i>

407
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,066
<i>when you didn't tell us</i>
<i>that you were suspecting Angelo?</i>

408
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,694
<i>I can fix this myself!</i>
<i>You're trying to show off!</i>

409
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,070
<i>Is it me or you?</i>

410
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:53,116
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>that Louisa's murderer did this?</i>

411
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,787
<i>Whoever they are, we know how</i>
<i>evil they are and what they're capable of.</i>
