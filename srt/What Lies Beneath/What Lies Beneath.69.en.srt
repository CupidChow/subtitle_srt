<i>He attacked Laurence Kyo last night.</i>

<i>Steve is dead.</i>

while your mom and
dad are in the hospital?

29
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,610
Yes, Aunt Mel!

- I like spending time with you.
- [Mel chuckles]

00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,573
That's nice to hear.

What are you drawing? Who's that?

33
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,911
That's Dad, Mom, and me.

00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,122
So nice! You're so sweet.

35
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,290
And who's this?

36
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,000
A monster.

37
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,377
A monster?

38
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,422
It's the monster
that gives Mommy bad dreams.

39
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,091
Oh, I see.

40
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,802
[sighs] Are you afraid of it?

41
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,554
Yes.

42
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,724
But it's less scary when Daddy's here.

Oh… [chuckles softly]

47
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,735
Well, I don't have
bad dreams like your mom.

48
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,487
Not that kind of monster.

49
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,365
The other one, the one that scares you.

Who else have you been talking to, huh?!

58

Who else have you been
spreading your lies about me to?

59
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,391
What are you talking about?

60

[Anton] <i>You want to play dumb now?</i>
<i>Sure, fine.</i>

61

Continue telling your lies
about me, and you'll find out.

<i>Just like what happened to your friend Jo.</i>

[Mel] <i>What did you do to her, Anton?</i>

64
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,657
I just gave her what she deserved.

65
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,118
She was poisoning you against me.

66
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,788

what did you do to Jo?!

After we give our statement to the police,

73
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,862
I'll hand over the evidence.

74
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,322
- Okay?
- Okay.

75
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,366
Thank you.

76
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,037

This is nothing.

79
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,844
It's probably from when I fell earlier.

80
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,846
Do you know you almost got shot earlier?!

81
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,849
First it was Steve, then--

82
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,768
Then what? You next?

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,903
I should be happy right now,

87
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,072
because Edong is alive, but…

88
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,949
[sniffles]

89
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,160

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,460
[sobs] Steve was my friend,
he was like a brother to me.

92
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,171
He killed him.

93
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,339
My brother killed him.

94
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,676
I don't know why
his bastard father didn't die instead!

Damn it, I begged him.

100
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,324
I told him not to.

Oswaldo Rubio, we're from the PBI.

We're here to serve

Are you sure you're at the right place?

117
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,353
My boss was attacked,
and his son was killed.

118
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,649
You should look for and
summon Lucas and Edong Santiago.

119

[sighs]

120
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,903
This isn't about the Kyo case.

121
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,781
We just have some questions
about the missing beauty queens.

122
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,325
[breathes deeply]

123
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,996
[reporter] <i>Earlier today,</i>
<i>Atty. Erica Melendez faced the media</i>

124

<i>to the lost beauty queens.</i>

127
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,424
The PBI is now in
possession of the video evidence

128
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,634
that could possibly
lead to the whereabouts

129
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,219
of the missing beauty queens,

130
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,264
and expose Laurence Kyo's
involvement in all of this.

131
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,892
Attorney, is this
the video showing the murder

132
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,310
of the missing beauty queens?

133
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,562
And are you confirming
that they are already dead?

134
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,147
Well, what I'm confirming is this.

135
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,357
The evidence is authentic.

136
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,859
It speaks for itself.

137
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,654
But beyond that,
I can't disclose any more details.

138
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,531
Out of respect for due process

139
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,366
and the safety of
others who may be affected.

140
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,036
Attorney, how did
you obtain the video evidence?

141
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,165
<i>You'll stay at our safe house for now.</i>

142

00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,255
<i>I don't need a guard.</i>

146
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,965
<i>You've seen what could happen, right?</i>

147
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,384
<i>Kyo's people are dangerous and armed.</i>

148
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,011
<i>Marco has a licensed firearm.</i>

149
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,513
<i>He can protect you.</i>

150
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,476
<i>Steve provided the evidence.</i>

151
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,187
[tense music playing]

152
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,897
<i>He wanted to do the right thing.</i>

153
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,858
<i>Please tell everyone that.</i>

154
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,864
The evidence came from
someone close to Laurence Kyo.

155
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:57,036
Someone who,
before he died, chose to do what's right.

156
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,288
Are you referring to Steve Kyo, Attorney?

157
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,290
Did he turn in his own father?

158
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,125
Steve Kyo knew…

159
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,504
that if he stayed silent,
more people would get hurt.

160
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,757
So even if it meant
turning against his own blood,

161
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,676
he did what was right.

162
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,719
That was his choice.

163
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,555
His act of courage.

164
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,349
But aren't you afraid for your own life?

165
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,185
Steve Kyo is dead. You could be next.

166
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,229
Safety is never a guarantee.

167
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,982
Especially when you're
up against powerful people.

168
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,984
But the truth is more powerful.

169
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,945
It will stand, no matter who it faces.

170
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,780
[Erica] <i>And I will fight.</i>

171
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:37,243
<i>To protect it, and the people</i>
<i>who helped us get to this point.</i>

172
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,870
<i>That is my duty.</i>

173
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,373
<i>As a lawyer and as a citizen.</i>

174
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,500
Chloe, let's go. We can't be late.

175
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,003
Aunt Erica is really the GOAT.

176
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,505
All the biggest cases always go to her.

178
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,719
[chuckles] It's fine.

179

She's not Voldemort,
whose name must not be mentioned.

180
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,932
Come on, I have a lot
to take care of at school

181
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,642
- for career day. Let's go.
- Alright, Ma.

182
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,768
[utensils clinking]

183
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,520
- [line ringing]
- [Mel] Jo, pick up…

184
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,690
- [breathes deeply]
- [ringing continues]

185
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,691
[Jo] <i>Mel?</i>

186
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,944
Jo?! Jo-- Oh my god! Thank God.

187
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,280
[stammers] Uh-- How are you?
What happened?

188
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,990
What did Anton do to you?

189
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,783
I've been trying
to call you for a while now.

190
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,535
I was worried
that he might have hurt you too.

191
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,455
That's exactly what he did to me.

192
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,998
- [grunts] <i>Let go--</i>
- [Anton groans]

193
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,833
[labored breathing] <i>Let go of me…</i>

194
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,003

- [grunts]
<i>- Sir?!</i>

197
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,257
<i>- Sir, what are you doing?!</i>
- [breathes heavily]

198
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,052
[Mel] Jo, I'm so sorry.

199
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,262
I've already filed a police report.

200
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,680
[Jo] <i>Mel, listen.</i>

201
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,516
<i>Never, ever go back to that house.</i>

202
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,101
<i>Your husband is dangerous!</i>

203
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,020
He could kill you.

204
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,605
<i>Leave him already!</i>

205
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,773
[Alice] Hey.

206
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,149
- [exhales]
- Oh--

207
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,442
You're not ready yet?

208
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,903
I'm just taking a call. [chuckles]

209
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,657
[uneasy music playing]

210
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,949
[whispering] Are you okay?

211
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,993
Yeah. Yeah, it's just--

212
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,745
A work problem. Don't worry.

213
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,330
Um, yeah!

214
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,623
<i>Thank you for the concern, but…</i>

215
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,124
I'll get back to you, okay?

216
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,963
[chuckles softly]

217
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,132
- [phone thuds]
- [sighs sharply]

218
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,676
You sure you're okay?

219
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,221
Yeah! [chuckles]

220
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,181
Why wouldn't I be? I'm fine!

221
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,224
Don't worry, uh…

222
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,268
I'll just take 10 minutes
to fix up, and then let's go?

223
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,313
- Okay.
- Okay.

224
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,691
[Anton] Ma?

225
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,070
- I think we have a problem.
- [Barbara] <i>What's wrong?</i>

226
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,781
- [breathes deeply]
- [unsettling music playing]

227
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,950
I caught one of the housekeepers.

228
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,368
Stealing.

229
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,328
[Anton] <i>But when I confronted her…</i>

230
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,122
she started screaming.

231
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,457
She was hurting herself.

232
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,710
And then she threatened me, saying
she'd go to the police and report me.

233
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,671
And she'd even turn
it around and make you the bad guy?!

234
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,713
The nerve!

235
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,340
It's really hard to find household help

236
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,509
<i>that you can trust these days!</i>

237
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,136
<i>Don't worry.</i>

238
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,054
<i>I'll let our lawyers deal with this.</i>

239
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,681
<i>You're the victim here!</i>

240
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,015
What's her name?

241
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,267
It's Jo.

242
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,601
Jo… something.

243
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,061
[Anton] <i>I can't remember.</i>

244
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,313
Mel was the one who hired her.

245
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,274
It's always your wife!

246
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,359
She's always causing trouble for us!

247
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,946
<i>She can't even hire a decent helper!</i>

248
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,698
Ma…

249
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,201
can you tell
our lawyers to find that woman

250
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,162
<i>and offer her money?</i>

251
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,289
<i>I don't want this getting out.</i>

252
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,000
But of course she is going to lie,

253
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,836
but you know how people are.

254
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,547
They easily believe fake news.

255
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,590
[Barbara] <i>Of course.</i>

256
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,592
I'll call Atty. Artillero.

257
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,634
Don't worry.

258
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,637
<i>People like that are easy to settle with.</i>

259
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,681
They act like they hate us,

260
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,726
but all they really want is our money.

261
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,437
[uneasy music continues, fades]

262
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,273
[student] Hello!

263
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,441
- Hi.
- Hello.

264
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,695
Oh my gosh,
I am so having flashbacks right now.

265
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,739
Right? It's been so long.

266
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,785
Hey, you're here already!

267
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,162
[sighs]

268
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,872
Why don't you go wait in the waiting area?

269
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,582
There are pastries and coffee there.

270
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,167
I'll just get you when it's time to start.

271
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,418
- Okay.
- Come on.

272
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,506
Oh, okay, so we're just going to…

273
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,008
talk about our careers, right?

274
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:24,345
Yes. And of course, hype up Amurao High

275
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,971
as part of your journey to success

276
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,641
because, the principal really loves that.

277
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,851
And of course, that's a plus for me

278
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,646
since I invited you and
you said yes because of me, right?

279
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,897
[chuckles]

280
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,357
- Okay.
- Hmm?

281
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:43,239
[unsettling music playing]

282
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,323
Mel, are you okay?

283
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,618
Yeah, I'm okay.

284
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,996
Hey, no zoning out here.

285
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,207
We agreed this would be
all about our careers, right?

286
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,126
I'm hyping you up so
don't embarrass me later.

287
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,878
Just kidding.

288
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,422
Oh my god, Beth, are you serious?

289
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,300
I do interviews for TV all the time.

290
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,344
How hard can it be
to address to a bunch of kids?

291
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,012
You do this every day.

[unsettling music continues]

293
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,979
I'm sorry, I didn't mean…

294
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,230
I didn't mean to.

295
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,941
I'll just go to the restroom.

296
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,327

[music fades]

299
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,422
[Erica] We've already
turned over the evidence to the PBI.

300
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,550
After they review and validate the videos,

301
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,094
they said they'll
mobilize search operation.

302
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,680
They'll just update me once it starts.

303
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,391
Search operation?

304
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,602
What's in the videos?

305
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,353
Can we watch them?

306
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,230
[woman sobbing]

307
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:02,526
[exhales heavily]
It wasn't in the PBI's custody before,

308
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,154
so I was able to check it myself.

309
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,324
But now that the evidence is with the PBI,

310
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,952
no one can access
it anymore, not even family.

311
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,331
They need to protect the case.

312
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,916
But what did you see?

00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,961
[tense music playing]

314
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,964
There's footage there,

315
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,799
of Kyo's men…

316
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,803
throwing bodies into a lake.

[sobbing, sniffling]

318
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,433
But until the PBI recovers them

319
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,561
and the bodies are formally identified,

320
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,314
let's not jump to conclusions.

321
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:46,278
It's better to wait
for the official results.

322
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,949

- [Alice] At first,
- [music fades]

335
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,178
it was really hard
being an accountant in the US.

336
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:57,016
There are people who look down on you

337
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,767
because you're a woman,

338
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,813
and especially
because you're Filipino. [scoffs]

339
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,860
But that's the reality
of being an immigrant.

340
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,320
You have to work twice,

341
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,365
even thrice as hard to prove yourself.

00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,838
I guess that's how it is, right?

You just have to be brave and hardworking.
Right, Alice?

348
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,718
- How about you, Mel?
- Mm.

349
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,056
What were your challenges
starting out as a celebrity stylist?

350
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,933
And spill it,
which celebrity has an attitude

00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,408
Oh, now you know, guys.

358
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,743
Come on, Beth.

359
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,996
Hmm, the most challenging?

360
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,959
Out of all my clients, I'd say…

361
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,672
do you know Miss Anne Curtis?

362
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,842
Oh yeah. Yes, she's my client,

363
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,054
and I probably would say
she's the most challenging,

364
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,307
not because she has
an attitude or she's a diva,

365
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,935
but because with all the clothes I bring,

366
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,978
everything looks good on her.

367
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,481
It's really hard to choose.

368
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,858
And another thing, I'll admit it,

369
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,985
I'm a huge fan of Miss Anne.

370
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:36,073
So I really trying to contain
my excitement, my fangirling,

371
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,242
just to look professional.

372
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,203
[Erica whispers] Shit.

373
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,163
Oh.

374
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,416
- [Candelaria] Attorney. Melendez!
- Hey!

375
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,252
[students] Attorney's here!
She's really here!

376
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,295
I'm so glad you could make it.

377
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,173
Did Erica say yes to the invite?

378
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,135
She messaged me earlier,

379
00:18:56,218 --> 00:19:00,806
telling me that she needs to talk to us,
and I told her we'd be here.

380
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,809
[Candelaria] I'm so glad
you accepted my invitation.

381
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,104
Ah, I'm sorry. I'm not here to--

382
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,647
But look.

383
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,650
The students are so
excited to learn from you.

384
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,154
Everyone, let's welcome

385
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,783
one of our esteemed guests,

386
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,743
Attorney Erica Melendez.

387
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:26,498
[applause, cheering]

388
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,542
You all know her, right?

389
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:33,172
The fearless lawyer we always see on TV.

390
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,217
And she's one of
Amurao National High School's pride.

391
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,594
[students exclaim]

392
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,388
Come on, Attorney, join your friends.

393
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:46,143
- [uneasy music playing]
- [applause]

394
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,695
[Candelaria] There, everyone's complete.

395
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,699
[applause]

396
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,744
[Marco] The woman
your brother killed in San Dimas

397
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,537
- was a healer.
- [music fades]

398
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,333
She lost her child.

399
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,834
She lived alone.

400
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,171
Stayed away from people.

401
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:18,467
But even then,
she never stopped helping others.

402
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,057
[Lucas] You're still not sure,

403
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,559
if it was my brother who killed her.

404
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,852
[sighs]

405
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,565
The time,
the place where she was found dead,

406
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,818
we already know what
your brother is capable of.

407
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,697
If you arrest Oslo,

408
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,243
I won't need protection, tell Erica that.

409
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,496
[exhales sharply]

410
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,792
[tense music playing]

411
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,920
If anything bad happens to Erica,

412
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,089
I'll blame you.

413
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,926
You could've worked with us from the start

414
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,512
to stop Edong but,

415
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,847
did you?

416
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,059
[tense music continues]

417
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:13,105
You kept telling Erica
back then that it was their fault

418
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,982
Edong turned out that way.

419
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,277
That they were
responsible for everything he did.

420
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,155
But isn't this your fault now too?

421
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,744
[tense music swells]

422
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,504
[Erica] When you're a criminal lawyer,

423
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,924
- you need to be used to constant tension.
- [music fades]

424
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,138
It's normal in our field to have,
aggressive clients,

425
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,683
aggressive lawyers, even the police.

426
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,769
You have to stay
calm in situations like that.

427
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:57,941
You shouldn't show
that you're intimidated or affected,

428
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,319
because that's the reaction they want.

429
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,072
They want you to be angry or scared

430
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,618
so you'll lose your train of thought
while defending your client.

431
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,912
But you know what's funny?

432
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,625
We really didn't expect
Erica to become a lawyer.

433
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,626
[Mel] Right?

434
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,463
She was so shy and
quiet back in high school,

435
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,131
so we were really surprised.

436
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,092
- [giggling]
- That's true.

437
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,971
So if there are introverts here,

438
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,307
if you're shy or quiet,

439
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,894
it's not impossible for
you to become a lawyer in the future.

440
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,939
Okay, let's go back to Alice.

441
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,358
Alice, can you share how you--

442
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,485
Ma'am!

443
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,195
Later, the Q&A is later--

444
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,113
No, Beth. It's okay…

445
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,200
if it's okay with Erica and Alice.

446
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,869
Yeah.

447
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,916
[student] Attorney Erica,

448
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,711
how did you overcome being shy?

449
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,216
Uh, let's just say…

450
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,886
I've been through
a lot of injustices in my life.

451
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,142
The first time I saw injustice,

452
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,269
I stayed quiet.

453
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,771
[tense music playing]

454
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:22,275
I let the louder voice win
even though I knew it was wrong.

455
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,320
I wasn't just a victim,

456
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,447
I was also part of what was wrong.

457
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,661
That's when I realized
I couldn't stay silent forever.

458
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,289
["Sabay Sabay Tayo"
somber instrumental playing]

459
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:46,174
Who's the most dangerous
criminal you've faced, Attorney?

460
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,636
Was it Edong Santiago?

461
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,221
[student 1] Is it true that he's dead?

462
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,057
["Sabay Sabay Tayo"
somber instrumental continues]

463
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,017
[student 2] is it true?

464
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,603
- [student 1] She didn't get scared?
- [student 3] What's his name again?

465
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,148
[student 4] Was she really shy before?

466
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,275
Okay, thank you for that question.

467
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,235
Let's give others a chance.

468
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,279
Does anyone want to ask Mel something?

469
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,572
- Ma'am!
- Yeah?

470
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,490
[student] Miss Mel,

471
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,701
is it true that you get hypnotized

472
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,078
when you lock eyes with Donny Pangilinan?

473
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,498
Are you also accepting interns?

474
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,418
Because I'm ready to be hypnotized! ASAP!

475
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,421
- [laughter]
- Well, I can say that's true.

476
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,965
So many people really
do get hypnotized by Donny.

477
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,050
[laughs]

478
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:33,263
[eerie music playing]

479
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,517
[Joshua] Chloe, where are you going?

480
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,644
Let's get back
to homeroom, there's still class.

481
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,314
Let's check the auditorium
real quick, we still have time.

482
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,232
I'll blame you if we get in trouble!

483
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,151
You're so boring. Let's go!

484
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,736
[clicks tongue]

485
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,991
[Candelaria] On behalf of
Amurao National High School,

486
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:56,369
thank you, ladies,
for sharing your stories and wisdom.

487
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,206
You've truly inspired our students

488
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,292
to persevere and chase their dreams.

489
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,212
[applause]

490
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,008
You probably always hear your parents say,

491
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,344
"Stop hanging out with friends."

492
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,638
But this group of friends,

493
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,140
they prove otherwise.

494
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,310
Look at them, they're all very successful

495
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,812
because of their friendship and hard work.

496
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,691
These three women all
came from our humble school.

497
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,778
Proof that you can also be like them,

498
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,905
or at the very least,

499
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,325
make friends like them,

500
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,578
- like our Mrs. Mora…
- [somber music playing]

501
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:42,999
…who must be so happy
to have such accomplished friends.

00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,962

504
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:14,197
- Sir, someone left this for you.
- [music becomes foreboding]

505
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,578
- Who's this from?
- We don't know.

506
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,580
We just saw it by the gate.

507
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,165
I have to go, sir.
