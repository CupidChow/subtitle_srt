You've been watching us for a while!

What are you talking about?!

19
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,213
I was just sweeping here
when you suddenly pushed me!

20
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,008
[Erica] I'm sorry.

21
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,387
It's just, there was
someone here earlier. Have you--

22
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,930
Have you seen anyone else?

23
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,391
Yeah. There was a man here.

24
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,227
He was wearing a hat.
I think it was an old man.

[Erica] An old man?
But how do you know he was old?

00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,484
Did you see his face?

28
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,903
No, but he was walking with a limp,

29
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,573
like my grandfather who has arthritis.

30
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,078

[chuckles] I'm showing
your husband your retirement home.

44

But I haven't shown him around yet.

45
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,756
Your Auntie Christina
doesn't want to let go of him.

46
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,216
So handsome…

47
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,051
It's a good thing you're
not the jealous type, Uncle.

[laughter]

49
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,262
- [Edward] It's okay.
- [Christina] Handsome…

50
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,474
Scott and I look
kind of similar, after all.

[laughter]

52
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,936
He just looks a bit more presentable.

- [Alice] Uncle, you're silly.

54

Handsome?

55
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,195
You know, Auntie, he's really handsome.

56
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,405
That's why I married him.

57
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,116
I know you're worried about Alice.

58
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,578
But I promise you, I'll never hurt her.

59
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,330
And I will take care of her.

60
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,667
We even agreed that I'll
join her in her therapy sessions.

61
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,002
That I'll be by her side

62
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,255
while she's searching
for the answer she needs.

63
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,173
[Edward] Therapy?

64
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,801
Alice, what's going on?

65
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,762
I haven't told you everything, Uncle.

66
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,766
I've been so confused
these past few weeks, but…

67
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,685
Do you remember when

68
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,687
I went missing when I was five years old?

69
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,190
I think something else
happened to me that day.

70
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,441
What do you mean?

71
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,069
I remember, the police said you got lost

72
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,196
and that's how
you ended up in the vacant lot.

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,116
[Alice sighs]
That's what I also thought, Uncle.

74
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,705
- But…
- [pensive music playing]

75
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,915
I've been having nightmares.

76
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,545
I was locked in a dark place, and…

77
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,880
I was a child.

78
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,634
[Alice sighs] It's all still foggy but,

79
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,554
I've been trying to unearth my memories

80
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,264
and address my trauma.

81
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,309
Alice. I remember when

82
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,520
your parents and
I went crazy looking for you.

83
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,521
[Alice] Mm.

84
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,232
But when you were
discovered and we were told

85
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,651
you just got lost,
we thought that was all there was to it.

86
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,486
But now, this.

87
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,073
Maybe we shouldn't
have listened to the police.

88
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,910
[Alice sighs] It's not your fault, Uncle.

89
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,288
You and Mama and Papa.

90
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,751
You just did what
you thought was best for me at that time.

91
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,919
[Edward sighs]

92
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,546
Seems like a lot has happened recently.

93
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,132
I also heard about

94
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,593
your friend and co-teacher.

95
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,055
I hope people come
to their senses and apologize to her.

96
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,141
After all, nothing
happened to her student, right?

97

Dude, my dad's spiraling.

105
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,839
Ever since he received the court petition

106
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,966
and that article came out,

107
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,595
[Steve]<i> he's been losing it.</i>
<i>I'll keep observing him.</i>

108
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,555
I might hear something we can use.

109
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,432
Alright. Update me right away, okay?

110
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,434
Have you talked to your investigator?

111
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,312
Not yet. I'll call him after this.
I have to go.

112
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,272
Okay.

[line trilling]

114
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,987
[Yuri] Boss,
I already got inside Oslo's house.

115
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,198
I went through everything, the room,

116
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,283
the space below the bed,
and even the closet.

117
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,410
But there was nothing there. Negative.

118
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,412
Are you sure there's nothing left?

119
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,832
Boss, it looks like Kyo trained him well.

120
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,959
His house was clean.

121
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,295
But can you tell your friend

122
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,341
to still spy on Oslo and his father?

123
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:09,595
He might find out
where else they hide their dirt.

124
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,558
Alright, but are you sure you didn't
leave any trace in Oslo's house?

125
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:18,229
Boss, you know I'm
meticulous with my work.

126
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,400
That's why he won't
find any trace of me in there.

Hey! Get out!

Who sent you?!

131
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,999
Get out of there!

Erica, what the hell?

135
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,842
Why are you following me?

136
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,887
I went to your gym to talk to you.

137
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,806
But I saw that you were leaving,
so I followed you.

138
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,600
I signaled so you could see me.

139
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,018
You didn't do that.

140
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,105
What game are you playing?
What do you want from me?

141
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,775
I just realized
I haven't checked in on you

142
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,862
ever since the police
stopped searching for Edong.

143
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,363
You haven't checked in on me?

144
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,200
Why? Are we friends?

145
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,702
Erica, I'm not stupid.

146
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,371
You need something.

147
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,165
And just like before,

148
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,169
you cheat and lie to get what you want.

[sullen music playing]

00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,422

00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,842
What do you really want from me?

<i>You made Beth come here,</i>
<i>chased her with a knife,</i>

156

[Beth]<i> That's-- That's not true!</i>

163

<i>Liezel, and Angelo were fighting?</i>

166

179
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,168
I know you think of me as an enemy.

180
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,088
No matter how many
times I tell you that's not true.

181
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,924
But I just really want
to see how you're doing

182
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,260
as an attorney to her client.

183
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,847
If you're here to rub it in my face

184
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,266
that you're glad that my brother's dead,

185

don't bother!

186
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,103
Because I won't stop until I find him.

187

What are you standing there for?
Go on your way!

207
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,842

he's limping away like this?

[both men laughing]

209
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,515
I think this guy wants
me to break both his legs!

- Are you gonna cripple him?
- I'll make him crawl back home!

What did she do to you?

222

Nothing! She was just passing by!

- She didn't do anything.
- [man 2] Argh. Agh…

She couldn't do anything.

Fear not.

245
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,679
This was destined.

246
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,391
I was destined to save you.

Uh, I made this.

270
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,304
I squeezed some
calamondin in it and put some ginger too

271
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,433
to reduce the bitterness of
the chaste tree and oregano leaves.

272

Drink it to get your strength back.

- [music fades]

300
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,455
are good for fevers and headaches, okay?

301
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:24,418
Crush them carefully and
place them on a clean cloth

302
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:28,672
then apply it on
the forehead and temples. Okay?

303

Don't worry.

Why?

309

To save myself.

310
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,618
Because…

311
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,995
I wanted to follow my son.

312
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,414

Healing people is what's
keeping me from ending it all.

320
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,150
You couldn't save your son?

I couldn't save him.

322

00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,238
or pure chance, I don't know.

356
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,240
But, all I know…

357
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,078
is that every action

358
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,747
has its consequence.

359
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,875
Whether it's good or bad,

360
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,336
it will come back.

I'll go to the river.

368

I'll catch us some catfish

369
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,910

What if I told you…

372

that meeting you

373
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,217
was a blessing…

374
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,430
Would you believe it?

375
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,392
I'll be back soon.

376
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,395
I'll cook for you.

Hey, what are you doing?

380
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,245
Shouldn't you be resting?

381
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,831
- Oh dear!
- I'm fine.

382
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,458
[Dolores] Oh dear.

383
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,627
I told you I'd do the cooking.

384

Mm-hmm.

Hmm…

Uh…

So you know how to cook!

402

My mom taught me.

403

You love her so much, don't you?

404
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,949
You know,

405
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,118
she's watching over you.

[pensive music playing]

407
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,332
How did you know that she's gone?

408
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,585
I can see it in your eyes.

409
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:46,216
I look like that, too,
when I talk about my son.

410

You're just like her.

Hmm.

Dolores.

415
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,528
Santiago.

416
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,740
Santiago's not my last name.

[pensive music continues]

418
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,791
When I needed my mom the most,

419

Oh.

- [vendor] How about you, sir?
- [man] I'll get it.

- [Dolores] Hey.
- You're late on the news!

You always miss the latest gossip!

What's new?

437
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,185
Who's pregnant?
Who stole someone's spouse?

438
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,728
This is different!

439
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,313
There's a fugitive on the loose.

440
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:27,359
He caused trouble last week,
right here in San Dimas!

441
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,403
- Hmm?
- He even ransacked a pharmacy!

442
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,239
That's why the police shot him!

443
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,493
- Shot?
- By the river.

444
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,578
And his body fell in the water.

445
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,665
They still haven't found his body.

00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,294

[foreboding music continues]

449
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,472
That's what they said.

450
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,227
You killed a lot of people?

451
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,275
I kill those who need to be killed.

452
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,696
There are people who need to be killed?

453
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,240
Four more.

Because I still have things to do.

You were the angel who saved me.

You have a mission, too.
