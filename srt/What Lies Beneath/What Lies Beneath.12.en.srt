[Erica] <i>I followed through</i>

[Seth] Mommy?

Baby, come on! We have to go.

00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,664
We have to go.

83
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,382
Careful.

84
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,925
Let's go, baby.

[Ryan] Don't move it yet.

90
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,276
What happened?!

91
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,447
Chloe, what happened?

92
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,575
We're just waiting for her X-ray results.

93
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,076
I hope there are no fractures.

94
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,830
Where's the driver who hit our daughter?

95
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,791
Ma, it was not the driver's fault.

96
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,919
Joshua and I were running

97
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,337
and I didn't look where I was going.

98
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,423
[Ryan] Good thing
the driver was able to hit the brakes.

99
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,341
The impact was not that strong.

100
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,596
Didn't I teach you to always be careful?

101
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,931
To look both ways
before you cross the road?

102
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,642
They said a man was chasing them.

103
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,520
What man?

104
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,147
We don't know him.

105
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,276
He was just standing in
front of Miss Alice's house.

106
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,445
- He was very sus.
- [unsettling music playing]

107
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,657
That's why Chloe and I ran,
and she didn't see the truck.

108
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,243
[unsettling music continues]

109

Mommy!

- Aah!
- Mommy!

113
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,586
I'm calling the police!

114
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,463
- Rose!
- Ma'am, who was that?

115
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,215
[Seth] Mommy, I'm scared!

116
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,467
[unsettling music continues]

117
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,386
Everything's going to be okay, baby. Okay?

118
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,263
[breathing heavily]

119
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,640
Come here.

120
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,808
[exhales sharply] Seth…

121
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:43,314
[unsettling music continues]

122
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,904
[whispering] Stay close to me.

123
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,574
[glass shatters]

124
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,493
- Aah!
- [Seth] Mommy!

125
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,829
[Erica] <i>They looked at me</i>
<i>like I've lost my mind.</i>

126
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,875
Like I said something as ridiculous
as China owning the West Philippine Sea.

127
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:07,838
[mellow music playing over speakers]

128
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,175
I mean, I expected them to
at least be worried, even just a little.

129
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,677
You can't really blame them.

130
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,012
What you said earlier is hard to take in.

131
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,305
[sighs deeply]

132
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,474
And what is your plan exactly?

133
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,978
First, you confronted Edong. Now Lucas.

134
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,565
You are usually careful,
but this time it feels like…

135
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,985
Facing Lucas was a calculated risk.

136
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,445
I knew it was dangerous.

137
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,574
But Lucas can get
close to Mel, Alice, and Beth.

138
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,577
He needs to know that
someone is watching his every move.

139
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,957
Do you know how
he managed to get close to them?

140
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,214
They all move in
the same circle here in Manila.

141
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,216
That's why they're all friends.

142
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,344
[Mel] <i>I know Lucas.</i>

143
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,013
<i>He would never do</i>
<i>what you're accusing him of.</i>

144
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,390
Mel Montenegro was one of the people

145
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,350
who sent his brother to prison.

146
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,186
And yet, they're still friends.

178
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,107
[woman 2] <i>Poor kid.</i>

179
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,817
<i>- If I were him…</i>
- [woman 1]<i> Mm?</i>

180
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,237
[woman 2] <i>I'd just</i>
<i>let Edong rot in prison.</i>

181
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,947
<i>- He's a murderer.</i>
- [woman 1] <i>Goodness.</i>

182
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,033
<i>Edong is just like his father, isn't he?</i>

183
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,411
<i>Didn't his father kill his mother?</i>

184
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,829
[woman 2] <i>Exactly.</i>

185
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,748
<i>- Lucas might turn out just like him.</i>
- [woman 1] <i>Keep your voice down.</i>

186
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,627
[uneasy music continues]

187
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,634
[music becomes tense]

188
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,636
[blows land]

189
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:04,056
[morose music playing]

190
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,475
- [blow lands]
- [Lucas grunts]

191
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,811
[morose music continues]

192
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,521
- [blow lands]
- [Lucas grunts]

193
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,149
- [blows land]
- [Lucas grunting]

194
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:19,238
[morose music continues, fades]

195
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,282
[Marco] <i>What's our next move?</i>
[exhales deeply]

196
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:25,619
If Beth and the other girls don't
believe me, there's nothing I can do.

197
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:30,040
But Lucas will be our focus now.

198
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,877
We need to track his every move.

199
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,673
[mellow music playing over speaker]

200
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,717
[man] Look what I've got.

201
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,303
[chuckling]

202
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,473
When I woke up, you weren't beside me.

203
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,433
Is that your style, Attorney?

204
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,728
Love them and leave them?

205
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,857
Are you trying to play hard to get?

206
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,901
Because, if you are,

207
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,861
it's working.

208
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,488
[chuckles]

209
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,949
So, when are we repeating that?

210
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,159
Mm?

211
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,204
[man chuckles]

212
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,247
[inhales deeply]

213
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,415
- Sorry.
- [man] Yeah.

214
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,501
But I'm busy.

215
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,753
Thank you for the drink, though.

216
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,422
Hey, I'm still talking to you.

217
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:23,010
[tense music playing]

218
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,638
You just touched me without my consent.

219
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,098
Do you know I can file
a complaint against you?

220
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,101
But you liked it, didn't you?

221
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,269
[scoffs]

222
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,939
See, you got all excited.

223
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,024
- [man chuckles softly]
- You think so?

224
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,068
I think so.

225
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,362
Let's see.

226
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,658
If I touch you here…

227
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,327
[tense music continues]

228
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,037
- Then--
- [grunting]

229
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,413
Ow!

230
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,498
[yelps]

231
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,501
That's enough, please! Ow!

232
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,586
Take him straight to jail, Attorney!

233
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,339
- [breathing sharply]
- [tense music continues]

234
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,467
- [chair thuds]
- [man breathes sharply]

235
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,885
[man] Get out of my way.

236
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,136
[breathes sharply]

237
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,641
Did you really think
I forgot everything you taught me?

238
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,852
[tense music continues]

239
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,523
How many more men
are you going to publicly humiliate?

240
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,693
[clicks tongue]
I should start keeping count.

241
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,403
[Marco exhales]

242
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,612
Why?

243
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,949
Not all men get hurt anyway.

244
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,034
They're all the same.

245
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,328
All they want is a free pass.

246
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,831
One night, then goodbye.

247
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,542
That sounds unfair.
Not all men are like that. [chuckles]

248
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:41,088
[gentle music playing]

249
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,636
- Anyway…
- [music fades]

250
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,391
We need to find out where
Lucas was the night Celestino was killed.

251
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:57,438
[unsettling music playing]

252
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,027
- [keys rattling, clinking]
- [metal clanking]

253
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,239
[unsettling music continues]

254
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,491
- [Mel sighs, grunts softly]
- [music fades

255
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,370
- [sighs sharply]
- [door clicks shut]

256
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,873
[sighs heavily]

257
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,381
[tense music playing]

258
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,883
Where have you been?

259
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,719
[huffs]

260
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,014
[tense music continues]

261
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:36,518
Didn't I tell you, not to leave the house?

262
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,024
I had a surprise for you.

263
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,653
But since you're late,
everything's gone cold.

264
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,407
[tense music continues]

265
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,575
Are you drunk?

266
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,994
[Mel chuckles, scoffs]

267
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,165
[exhales sharply]

268
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,458
Leave me alone!

269
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,168
- [Anton] You're doing it again.
- [breathes sharply]

270
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,712
You were caught on
video drunk and making a scene.

271
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,215
- You want that to happen again?
- [Mel scoffs]

272
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,092
Why do you keep doing this, Mel?

273
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,178
I didn't go out drinking
and get myself embarrassed?!

274
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,264
You're the one who does
that to me, Anton! [chuckles]

275
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,933
Have you forgotten?

276
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,267
Really? [scoffs]

277
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,896
- I don't remember it that way.
- [chuckles softly]

278
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,482
[Anton] Why do
you always twist the story, Mel?

279
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,820
How many times do
I have to tell you that you're crazy?

280
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,240
You need help.

281
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,867
[inhales sharply] No!

282
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,996
[breathes sharply]
That's what you always tell me.

283
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,872
That's what you want me to think!

284
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,459
That I'm crazy and out of my mind!

285
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,503
Anton, that's what you want me to think.

286
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,840
You want me to think it's always my fault!

287
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,966
[Anton] See?!

288
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,426
You're hysterical again!

289
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,512
I can't do this tonight, Mel.

290
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,682
- You want to get hurt again?
- [Mel breathes shakily]

291
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,976
I don't want to hurt you, Mel.

292
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,644
But you never give me a choice.

293
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,312
[Mel] So what are you going to do? Huh?

294
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,315
Just play the victim again, Anton?!

295
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,567
Wow!

296
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,193
Impressive!

297
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,903
[breathing sharply]

298
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,572
What's new, right?

299
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:15,242
To your mother,
you never do anything wrong!

300
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,036
You're never wrong, Anton!

301
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,873
She never taught
you to be accountable for anything!

302
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,375
- Don't talk about my mother like that!
- Why? What will you do?!

303
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,294
You going to hurt me, Anton?

304
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,755
Come on, hurt me!

305
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,799
Leave more bruises on my body, Anton!

306
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,469
Come on. [breathing sharply]

307
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,554
I have a fashion event coming up.

308
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,931
And one of these days,

309
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,893
I'll run out of creative ideas

310
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,479
to explain why my
body is covered in bruises!

311
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,855
And one of these days,

312
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:48,776
people will figure out what
you've really been doing to me!

313
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:53,739
- [breathing heavily]
- [tense music continues]

314
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:08,378
[tense music continues]

315
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:23,977
[music becomes sinister]

316
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,995
[sinister music continues]

317
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:52,548
[sinister music intensifies]

318
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:05,435
- [whistling tune of "Sabay Sabay Tayo"]
- [crickets chirping]

319
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:27,124
- [whistling continues]
- [chirping continues]

320
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,673
- [phone ringing]
- [unsettling music playing]

321
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,384
<i>Hello? Alice? What happened?</i>

322
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,969
<i>Mrs. Miller, we're the police!</i>

323
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:39,887
<i>Please help us!</i>

324
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,638
- [glass shatters]
- [screaming]

325
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,893
- [Mel gasps
- [Edong laughing maniacally]

326
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,686
[Beth] <i>What if he does it</i>
<i>to someone else?!</i>

327
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,564
<i>What if he does something even worse?!</i>

328
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:55,652
[ominous music playing]
