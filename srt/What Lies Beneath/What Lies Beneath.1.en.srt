<i>Wow! She still had time to joke around.</i>

7
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,058

[theme music playing]

29
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,230
[Erica] There is no
cure for an illegal arrest.

30
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,899
The waiver of Article 125

31
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,611
only cures the period that you are
detained without a valid warrant.

32
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,780
When you waive Article 125,

33
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:39,409
you're basically
saying that if you're arrested,

34
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,244
you waive your right

35
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,329
to be released from jail within 36 hours

36
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,456
while the prosecutor is still deciding.

37
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,710
But nothing cures an illegal arrest.

38
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:53,172
[man] Attorney, we don't need
you to lecture us about law.

39
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,508
We are all lawmakers here.

40
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,178
It was clearly stated in the resolution

41
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,264
of the investigating prosecutor

42
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,726
that it's impossible for
your client not to understand

43
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,978
what they signed.

44
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,189
They were guided
by their previous lawyers.

45
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,900
But why should we place the burden

46
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,320
of the interpretation of Article 125
on the accused

47
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,156
when even those who went to law school,

48
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,242
our lawyers, and law enforcers,

49
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,995
still have trouble understanding it?

50
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,706
Since this is
an inquiry in aid of legislation,

51
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,251
I think the Congress should make
our laws more understandable.

52
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,671

- Jenny, wait.
- Yes, ma'am?

58
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,684
Come here.

59
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,771
So, has your mother
allowed you to go to Baguio?

60
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,357
Um, no, ma'am.

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,942
She won't allow me.

62
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,903
Oh no, you're
supposed to represent our school.

63
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,780
Do you want me to talk to your mother?

64
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,408
Maybe she just doesn't understand
what a great this opportunity is for you.

65
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,244
Especially after college.

66
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,288
Didn't you say
you wanted to be a journalist?

67
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,500
No need, ma'am.
She might say something to you.

68
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,168
Uh, why?

69
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,711
What did she say?

70
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,588
She said that before,

71
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,508
you wanted to be a reporter too,

72
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,552
but you just ended up becoming a teacher.

73
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,347
Ma! Ma!

74
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,266
Uh, okay. Let's talk again tomorrow.

75
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,685
Oh, okay, ma'am. Thank you.

What is it now?

78
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:37,694
If this is about picking up your
Aunt Alice tomorrow, fine, you can come.

79
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,820
No, Ma!

80
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,989
- What?
- Aunt Mel has a scandal!

81
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,532

Okay, okay! Gorgeous! Gorgeous!

85
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,631
- Make it fierce.
- Just a minute.

86
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,758
[Mel] This doesn't look right.

87
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,219
Good! Nice one.

88
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,554
Okay, let's go!

Hey!

You find this funny?

98
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,218
Will it still be funny
when you all lose your jobs tomorrow?

I don't think so.

Do you see her, Ma?

108

Not yet.

Is she close, Ma?

110
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,846
They said she's already landed.

Mom…

I'm sleepy.

Okay, Mom.

Love you.

Oh no, I'm fine. I promise.

185
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,379
Yes, Auntie.

186
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,216
But these days,
everyone knows it as a haunted house.

187
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,343
And a MO spot. Right here.

188
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,137
"MO"?

189
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,222
Make out. That's what she meant.

190
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,224
You! How do you even know that?

191
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,517
Exactly, sweetheart.

192
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,477
We didn't raise you that way.

193
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,814
How could I not know?
I always catch you two making out.

194
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,316
Hey! Psst! Look at this kid--

195
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,776
Watch your mouth.
Aunt Alice is right there.

196
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,111
- [giggles]

197

198
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,698
[Ryan] It's finally happened.

201
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,747
[Beth] Your dad can be so embarrassing.

202
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,498
- Oh my!
- It's not true.

203
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,167
[all chuckling]

204
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,668

[pensive music playing]

206
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,095
Thanks, Beth.

207
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,058
For taking care of everything,
from the sale to the renovation.

208
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,809
I wish I could've done more to help.

209
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,685
[Beth] Don't be silly.

210
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,270
I'm the one who's here.

211
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,980
It makes sense
that I take care of everything.

212
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,233
Mel's always busy in Manila anyway.

213
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,528
And since
your Uncle Edward owns the house,

214
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,907
the buying process
wasn't complicated at all.

215
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,659
[sighs softly]

216
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,743
Ryan.

217
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,120
Thank you for all your help, too.

218
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,289
You bet I'm helping.

219
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,624
My wife would kill me.

220
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,876
[Chloe chuckles]

221
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,546
I still can't believe
you two ended up together.

222
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,923
[Beth giggles] Right?

223
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,718
Did you know? Your mom
turned your dad down over and over.

224
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,844
- I told you.
- Whatever.

225
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,055
Oh, she always brings that up.

226
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,390
[Beth, Chloe chuckling]

227
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,559
Oh my god, the MABELs are back!

228
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,769
- [giggles]
- [Beth] Mel!

229
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,479
- [Mel] Hi!
- Oh my gosh!

230
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,481
Hi, girls!

231
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,400
- Hello!
- Hi!

232
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,277
Oh my gosh,
I can't believe we're really doing this!

233
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,946
- Finally!
- [Alice] Well…

234
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,990
This is what we were
talking about fourteen years ago.

235
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,369
That's right.
And honestly, to tell you the truth,

236
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,079
we didn't take you seriously back then.

237
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,205
[gasps]

238
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,915
- [laughs] True.
- Well…

239
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,250
I mean, see?

240
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,918
My persuasion powers worked in the end.

241
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,420
- That's right.
- [Beth giggles]

242
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,964
I'm so happy! Finally! [giggling]

243
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,924
So how are you--

244
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,635
- [light music playing]
- [Mel breathing nervously]

245
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,679
Please don't kill me.

246
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,640
My PR team advised me to do this.

247
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,434
You know, because of the scandal.

248
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,061
So… what scandal?

249
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,901
[Mel] So, I really need
the positive spin right now.

250
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,822
So.

251
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,407
What do we need to do?

252
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,450
Um.

253
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,826
Hi, I'm Tim.

254
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,744

- This is Tom.

00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,788
Beth.

257
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,958
[Tim] They'll be
filming you and the house.

258
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,462
We just need you to talk about the house
and explain why it's being renovated.

259
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,715
I'm not comfortable with any of this.

260
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,758
What? No! No, Beth!

261
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,927
Beth, please! Please.

262
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,304
I really need this.

263
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,639
I've become a laughingstock online.

264
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,099
I just need a win.

265
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,226
[light music continues]

266
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,769
Do it, Mama.

267
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,941
[chuckles awkwardly]

268
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,651
- Sure.
- Yeah?

269
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,528
Oh my! Okay, okay! Thank you!

270
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,655
Perfect! Thank you, thank you!

271
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,782
[Tim] Alright,
I think we should all head inside.

272
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,284
- Okay, let's go!
- Sure thing.

273
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,911
Thank you. Seriously, thank you.

274
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,996
- I'll make it up to you.
- My goodness.

275
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,164
The life of a celebrity.

276

[relaxing music playing over speakers]

277
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,838
[Bartender] Good evening, Attorney.

278
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,925
Uh, one bottle of beer, please.

279
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,551
[bottle cap pops]

280
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,346
Thank you.

281
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,559
So, what do you have for me?

282
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,522
I went to her sibling's place,
but Esther wasn't there.

283
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,732
Even they don't know where she is.

284
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,235
Do you think they were telling the truth?

285
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,904
Esther's been avoiding
being charged with fraud.

286
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,697
It's been a month.

287
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,534
She could be out of the country by now.

288

[relaxing music continues]

289
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,457
Are you sure about any of this?

290
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,168
Why reopen
something that's already closed?

291
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,421
This could ruin
everything you've worked so hard for.

292
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,508
I would've done this ages
ago had I not lost my nerve.

293
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,928
You know, if it weren't for you,

294
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,140
I would've been in prison a long time ago
for a crime I didn't commit.

295
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:15,771
What about others like me?
Those you can still help?

296
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,401
Don't all the good things you've done…

297
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,903

Have you forgotten me?

689
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,969
This is Edong,

690
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,722
the first person you put in jail.

691
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:04,602
<i>And you're not</i>
<i>supposed to forget your first.</i>

692

[dramatic music playing]

693
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,816
How did you get my number?

694
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,112
[Edong sighs]

695
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,989
[dramatic music continues]

696
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,076
You're now enjoying your privileged lives.

697
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:27,291
Have you ever felt any
remorse for destroying my life?

698
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,586
- [blows land]
- [wailing]

699
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,422
[screaming in pain]

700
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,260
[dramatic music continues]

701
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,427
[giggling]

702
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,720
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

703
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,180
[laughter]

704
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,184
- Perfect.
- Ooh.

705
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,519
Like, totally!

706

[dramatic music intensifies]

707
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,073
<i>Your friends were</i>
<i>laughing in front of the camera.</i>

708
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,993
<i>But I saw the truth in their eyes.</i>

709
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,578
<i>They're not happy.</i>

710
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,290
<i>Well, you know, people need villains</i>

711
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,417
<i>to spice up their boring lives.</i>

712
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,626
<i>This week, I'm the villain.</i>

713
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,544
<i>I'm not worried,</i>

714
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,630
<i>because I'm sure</i>
<i>another villain will show up.</i>

715
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,758
<i>The reason I called is</i>
<i>because I want to help them.</i>

716
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,926
<i>What do you mean?</i>

717
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,263
[suspenseful music playing]

718
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,931
