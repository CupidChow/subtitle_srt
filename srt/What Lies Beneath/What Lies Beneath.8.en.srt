00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:48,314
But seriously,
next time can you be careful?

179
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,776
Do you really want
a suspension on your record?

180
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,027
When you're in college,

181
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,155
I'll let you protest all you want.

182
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,990
Join all rallies, fine.

183
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,869
But can you graduate high
school first without any trouble?

184
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,664
I promise, Ma. I'll be more careful.

185
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,209
I'll make sure
the principal doesn't see my next post.

186
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,419
- [quirky music playing]
- What? I didn't say to hide it.

187
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,755
I said don't post
things like that anymore.

188
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,424
- Okay, Ma! Bye! I'll go now!
- Hey, I'm warning you.

189
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,968
Seriously,
behave yourself. [clicks tongue]

190
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,638
- Uh.
- Hi, good morning.

191
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,889
- Beth.
- Yes?

192
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,934
Um, did you hear about,

193
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,103
about the cop that was killed?

194
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,688
Who?

195
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,818
I heard it's Celestino.

196
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,237
[unsettling music playing]

197
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,782
Wasn't he in charge of Louisa's case?

198
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,749
[unsettling music continues]

199
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,669
- [recorder clicks]
- <i>You may lose your scholarship</i>

200
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,338
<i>if you don't tell the truth!</i>

201
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:58,467
<i>Didn't you get</i>
<i>a scholarship from a university in Manila?</i>

202
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,887
He was killed?

203
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,974
They said it was brutal.

204
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,728
His body was… dumped in the trash.

205
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,982
[unsettling music continues]

206
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,612
Well, he's really trash.
He got what he deserved.

207
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,536
[unsettling music fades]

208
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,247
The company has no
legal claim over your property.

209
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,666
We can contest the title they're holding

210
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:34,295
based on irregularities in
their land transfer documents.

211
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,921
We'll also file a counterclaim

212
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,215
since the land's been
yours for more than 20 years.

213
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,137
We don't know how
to thank you properly, Attorney.

214
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,931
Please, take these.
They're from our own harvest.

215
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,434
It's the least we can do to repay you.

216
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,395
Oh no, it's okay.
I believe you need it more.

217
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,564
- It's okay.
- [both] Please, take these.

218
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,649
These are really for you.

219
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,027
- Uh…
- We're really thankful.

220
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,154
Don't worry about it.
You should keep them.

221
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,072
- We'll walk you to your car.
- Please.

222
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,075
- Take these.
- Uh… [breathes awkwardly]

223
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,286
Alright. Uh, thank you.

224
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,787
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Attorney.

[phone ringing]

226
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,374
Excuse me, I have to take this.

Hi!

241
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,183
Is the teachers'
lounge still on the second floor?

Uh…

245
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,616
You're Alice Miller, right?

246
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,744
I'm Joshua, Chloe's best bro.

247
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,580
Are you looking for Miss Beth?

248
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,916
Yeah. Nice to meet you, Joshua.

249
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,546
- He's lying, Auntie.
- [quirky music playing]

250
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,715
I didn't say anything!

251
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,593
Everything he says is sus.

252
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,804
What sus? That's not true!

253
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,182
Ah, you two, go straight home, okay?

254
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,142
Don't go roaming around.

255
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,020
How come <i>you,</i> Ma, get to roam around?

256
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,355
And what do you mean?

257
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,733
Your Aunt Alice and I are
just going to the gym opening.

258
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,402
Because they're serving free cocktails.

259
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,028
You know Amurao's definitely leveling up.

260
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,239
- Finally!
- Right?

261
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,200
Is the membership free? I'll sign up!

262
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,411
You should exercise this first.

263
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,787
- Yes, Joshua.
- Do some studying.

264
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,082
You barely passed those two subjects.

265
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,875
You can still do better.

266
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,502
That's not true!

267
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,795
I'm not basic!

268
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,505
I'm sure you're not.

269
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,217
Ma, we'll just get
milk tea on the way home.

270
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,677
- Let's go!
- Don't go anywhere else, okay?

271
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,803
Bye, Ma! Bye, Auntie Alice!

272
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,263
Bye, Chloe! Bye!

273
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,140
Oh, those kids.

274
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,475
So…

275
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,061
are we really going through with this?

276
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,731
Well, Mel really wants us to.

277
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,899
I guess she wants to prove

278
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,444
that what she's
saying about Lucas is true.

279
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,700
Uh… Beth?

280
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,327
I know I've said this before, but…

281
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,957
please don't tell Mel
about the divorce thing.

282
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,793
Oh, of course not.

283
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,171
Don't worry, okay?

284
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,299
Come on. I still have to change.
Can you drive me home first?

285
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,884
- Okay.
- Is this your car?

286
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,802
- Yeah, it's raining.
- Let's go.

287
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,221
- Let's share an umbrella.
- I'm glad you picked me up.

288
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,514
[Alice giggles]

289
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,402
I wonder why Mama and her friends

290
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,196
don't see Erica Melendez anymore.

291
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,991
Mama said she's a lawyer now,

292
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,079
but she didn't really
tell me much about her.

293
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,416
I'm curious about Louisa too.

294
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,920
She said Louisa died
when they were still in high school.

295
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,963
I didn't know that.

296
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,258
Did she say how Louisa died?

297
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:20,390
[intriguing music playing]

00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,824
Whoa! Look at this!

300
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,243
Hey!

301
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,121
[uneasy music playing]

302
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:46,458
It says here Louisa was killed.
Her throat was slashed.

303
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,757
Mama and her friends were
the ones who found her body?

304
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,678
[uneasy music continues]

305
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,013
- [scissors snips]
- [uneasy music ends]

306
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,685
[applauding]

307
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,312
Mayor, I'll tour you around.

308
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,605
Wow.

309
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,065
Very nice.

310
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,734
It's huge.

311
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,695
[Lucas chuckles]

312
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,196
Thank you. We are very happy

313
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,282
that you invested here
in Amurao, Mr. Santiago.

314
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,200
This means a lot to us.

315
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,662
Thank you for your support, Mayor.

316
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,374
Hopefully, you'll bring
your other businesses here too.

317
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,334
We'll get there, Mayor.

318
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,087
But I think the one
you should really thank

319
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,174
is my brother because
he's the one who encouraged me

320
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,468
to come back and open a branch here.

321
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,974
Yeah, I know your brother's story.

322
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,809
And I admire you

323
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,687
because you aren't
ashamed of what he's been through.

324
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,524
Mayor,

325
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,068
I'm proud of my brother.

326
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,157
He's been through a lot but he's changed.

327
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,285
He's been sober and drug-free for years.

328
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,206
He went to prison,
but he became a better man.

329
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,166
[Erica] Is that true?

330
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:14,421
[tense music playing]

331
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,090
Did he become a better man?

332
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:26,141
[tense music continues]

333
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,319
[tense music fades]

334
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,362
Let's go.

335
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,114
[beeps]

336
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,997
[Beth] Mel! Have you been waiting long?

337
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,290
No, I arrived around 10 minutes ago.

338
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,792
Why didn't you go inside?

339
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,627
So we can all go in together.

340
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,213
Wait, can you remind
me again why we're here?

341
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,423
Why is it a good idea for us to be here?

342
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,885
Because cocktails are always a good idea!

343
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,262
Come on, let's go!

344
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,471
[Mel giggles]

345
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,058
[mayor] Attorney Erica Melendez?

346
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,687
You work with my sister, Senator De Leon?

347
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,522
Yes, of course, Mayor.

348
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,649
- Please say hi to her for me.
- Sure.

349
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,945
[mayor] You didn't tell me, Mr. Santiago,

350
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,490
that you and
Attorney Melendez know each other.

351
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,703
Of course, you're from Amurao, Attorney.

352
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,791
Excuse me, Mayor. [inaudible whisper]

353
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,420
Mr. Santiago, Attorney,

354
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,130
- will you excuse us for a moment?
- Sure.

355
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,634
[tense music resumes]

356
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,929
What now, Attorney?

357
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,932
Not satisfied with harassing my brother,
now you're harassing me?

358
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,561
You only told me
to stay away from your brother.

359
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,603
Not from you.

360
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:58,817
[tense music continues]

361
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,901
What do you want?

362
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,529
Do you remember Esther Castro?

363
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,117
The witness who first
claimed your brother killed Louisa?

364
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,035
[Louisa grunts]

365
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,412
<i>I know who really killed Louisa Soria.</i>

366
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,458
She's missing.

367
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,462
[tense music continues]

368
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,524
And Rodrigo Celestino?

369
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,319
The lead investigator
who put Edong in jail.

370
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,737
Do you remember him?

371
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,782
He was found dead the other day.

372
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,869
What exactly are you getting at?

373
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,705
Were you and your brother involved
in what happened to them?

374
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,335
[tense music continues]

375
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,212
[Lucas] Let me get
this straight, Attorney.

376
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,216
Are you accusing my
brother of committing a crime outside

377
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,344
while he's locked up in Bagumbayan,
the very place you sent him to?

378
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,887
[Erica] Maybe not him.

379
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,765
Maybe someone else did it for him.

380
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,434
Well, you mean me?

381
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,521
So what, Attorney?

382
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,773
You want me to end up like my brother?

383
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,027
I don't know what you're talking about.

384
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:31,201
[tense music swells]

385
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,457
[music turns dramatic]

386
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:53,849
[dramatic music continues]

387
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,447
<i>- What do you want with Lucas?</i>
<i>- They're planning something.</i>

388
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,741
<i>Ester Castro is missing,</i>
<i>and Celestino was murdered.</i>

389
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,785
<i>So you really think</i>
<i>Edong and Lucas are behind this?</i>

390
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,287
<i>I don't believe it's just a coincidence.</i>

391
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,038
<i>You don't even have proof.</i>

392
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,124
<i>You're concerned about</i>
<i>the lack of evidence now, Beth?</i>

393
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,585
[Mel]<i> I know Lucas.</i>
<i>He would never do what you're saying.</i>

394
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,794
[Erica] <i>You know him that well?</i>

395
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,713
[Beth] <i>Are you still</i>
<i>hung up on what happened?</i>

396
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,839
<i>- Aren't you?</i>
<i>- No!</i>

397
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,549
<i>Because we did nothing wrong!</i>

398
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,926
<i>Edong is coming after</i>
<i>everyone who wronged him.</i>

399
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,136
<i>So that means…</i>

400
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,387
<i>We're next.</i>
