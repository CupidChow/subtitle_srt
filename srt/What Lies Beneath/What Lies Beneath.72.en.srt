When I was attacking Erica about him,

you didn't say anything.

What else, huh?

37
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,722

You were caught in the act.

That's why you're under hospital arrest.

Your wife filed a formal
complaint with her friends.

The police are finalizing their report

268
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,877
and they will submit
it to the Prosecutor's Office.

269
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,172
If the prosecutor finds
that there's probable cause,

270
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,966
then they will file charges.

271
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,803
That's when the judge will
issue a warrant for the additional cases.

272
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,639
Only then can we also apply for bail.

273

Don't worry.
I already talked to Secretary Joey.

How can we be sure
that you're telling the truth this time?

284

I could finally save my brother

285

start over again but I was wrong.

Nothing can stop him!

288
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,686
He'll destroy a lot of things.

289

00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,025
He won't stop.

292
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,987
I need to save him from himself.

293

No matter how
pleasant you sound right now,

I'm right, aren't I?

298
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,210
Why should we trust him?

299
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,754
Shouldn't I be the one asking that?

300
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,090
Didn't my brother tell you multiple times

301
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,052
that the watch found
in our house wasn't Louisa's?

302
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,970
He stole it from someone else,
and that's the truth!

303
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,513
But you lied, didn't you?

304
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,933
And you, Beth, you were the first to lie!

All of the evidence
was pointing to Edong!

what everyone already believed!

But we're also to blame.

351
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,636
And I think it's time to admit that!

352

- No!

No, Alice! I can't believe you'd say that!

I just want to start over, Beth!

357

And you know what,
I think I can finally do that.

[exhales sharply]

362
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,952
You know…

363
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,247
This is one of the things that has been
weighing me down from the past.

364
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,875
You too, right?

365
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,880
Don't you see how, ever since we did that,
everything has gone wrong?

366
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,176
So let's make this right.

367
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,471
Maybe Erica's right.

368
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,182
Maybe it's time to tell the truth.

369
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,059
- No!
- Let's show Edong…

370
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,852
This is on you, Alice.

371
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,314
You're so easy
to intimidate and be influenced!

372
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,984
You want me to speak up, right?

373
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,736
Then listen to me!

374
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,113
This is me speaking up!

375
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,116
[tense music continues]

376
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,787
Or do you only want me
to talk when I agree with you?

377
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,672
[tense music continues]

378
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,304
<i>People who commit</i>
<i>crimes should be punished.</i>

379
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,349
<i>They keep getting away</i>
<i>and are never held accountable.</i>

380
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,726
[Alice]<i> Why won't she admit the truth?</i>

381
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,562
<i>Does she really think she's not wrong?</i>

382
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:16,316
<i>If Erica is right</i>
<i>that the truth will pacify Edong,</i>

383
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,985
<i>why don't we do it?</i>

384
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,445
<i>If he did go</i>
<i>to your condo without you knowing,</i>

385
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,197
<i>that means he's hiding from you too.</i>

386
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,407
<i>How will you find him?</i>

387
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,409
<i>It's still possible</i>
<i>that he might contact me.</i>

388
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,454
[blow lands]
