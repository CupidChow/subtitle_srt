Are we just going to let them leave?

182
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,319

00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,164
- Maybe we can--
- [girl] Sir?

186
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,458
Ma'am, please sit.
I'm assisting someone else.

187
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,377
- Can you check the CCTV?
- Okay, ma'am.

188
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,129
[man] I'm sure it was right there.

189
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,630
Before I went inside the house--

190
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,883
Would it disappear if
you made sure it was locked?

191
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,509
Just put it on my table.

- [uneasy music playing]
- [indistinct chattering]

193
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,807
[Bianca] I'm Bianca Seropon.

194
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,435
The missing student.

195
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,354
[uneasy music continues]

196
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,649
I'm here to report
that I was not kidnapped.

197
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,152
And I'm still alive.

198
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,988
[uneasy music continues, ends]

199
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,408
[sobs] I can't believe
Louisa had a secret life

200
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,618
we knew nothing about.

201

[somber instrumental of
"Sabay Sabay Tayo" playing]

202
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,248
She went through so much.

203
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,877
Why didn't she tell us?

204
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,170
We could've helped her.

205
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,214
It's not our fault.

206
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,799
She chose to protect Liezel.

207
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,718
And you, Beth?

208
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,179
Who were you protecting

209
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,264
when you hid
your suspicions about Angelo from us?

210
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,228
I didn't say anything
because I wanted to be sure!

211
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,271
I didn't want to ruin Liezel's life

212
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,814
just because of my suspicion!

213
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,775
But you know I was
looking for answers, too!

214
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,153
If you had told me, I could've helped.

215
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,239
You wouldn't have been in danger.

216
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,324
And maybe we could've avoided all of this!

217

[Erica huffs]

218
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,411
Do you know how scared Chloe was for you

219
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,913
when she called me?

220
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,498
Chloe called you?

221
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,291
[Erica] That's why I'm here.

222
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,169
I can handle this on my own.

223
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,462
You're acting too much like a hero!

224
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,548
Am I the one acting like a hero or you?

225
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,968
Aren't you the one
who likes making decisions alone?

226
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,553
Leaving others to deal with it?

227
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,097
Isn't that what happened when you lied…

228
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,600
- about Louisa's watch?
- Wow, Amurao!

229
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,602
You still haven't moved on?

230
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,020
How am I supposed to move on?

231
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,022
That's why we're in this mess!

232
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,817
That's why Edong is
targeting Alice and Chloe.

233
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,572
He wants revenge for his
14-year sentence because of your lies!

234
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,991
But even now…

235
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,285
even now, you still won't admit it!

236
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,162
We just did what was right,
and you couldn't do it!

237
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,957
Do you really believe
that was the right decision, Beth?

238
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,542
Then why are you here?

239
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,796
Why are you investigating
Angelo for Louisa's death?

[Bianca] <i>People are</i>

246
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,628

[music fades]

248
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,506
I wasn't kidnapped.

249
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,552
I wasn't sold.

250
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,180
I just wanted to leave the house.

251
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,143
[Locsin] Why did you come back?

252
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,649
I heard about
the accusations against Miss Liezel

253
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,275
because of me.

254
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,324

you're close with Mrs. Basa.

[Bianca sniffles]

256
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,580
She was the only one who listened to me.

257
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,708
She's the only one I could trust.

258
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,211
Trust?

259
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,089

I'm a lesbian.

268
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,037

274
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,635
He said…

00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,638
I just needed--

00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,764
[sobs]

277
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,809
I just needed to taste a man.

278

He said that's
the cure for me being a lesbian!

She didn't believe me.

284
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,501
I got so depressed.

285
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,256
Miss Liezel noticed.

286
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,425
She talked to me.

287
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,635
I told her everything.

So, she just talked
to someone from the Women's Group.

She sent me there for help.

293

She, respected my wish

297
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:17,137
to leave Amurao and
start over somewhere else.

298
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:23,435
She said she understood me…

299
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,567
because she also wanted
to do the same thing before,

300
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,778

Why am I even running away?
