4
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:11,010
<i>We're here to serve you this.</i>

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,762
<i>A writ of habeas corpus.</i>

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,765
<i>Maybe you're finding</i>
<i>it hard to let go because…</i>

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,975
<i>you still like him.</i>

8
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,562
<i>No man has anything</i>

<i>"Even you have</i>

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,691
<i>That's what she said.</i>

11
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,651
<i>I know you don't want to tell Erica,</i>

12
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,319
<i>because that'll only make</i>
<i>Liezel's life more complicated.</i>

13
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,155
<i>But it's all over Amurao now.</i>

14
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,866
<i>They're saying</i>
<i>Liezel and Angelo might be involved.</i>

15
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:36,745
<i>Because if Angelo's innocent,</i>
<i>Erica's the only one who can prove it.</i>

I'm sorry.

You don't have to answer that question.

Marco, sorry.

36

I could've phrased things better--

37
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,117
[scoffs] No big deal.

38
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,078
I'm glad you told me.

[somber music continues]

40
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,417

44
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,891
[Samuel] Do you have any idea
what they say about you?

45
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,851
They say you're not just a kidnapper,

46
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,811
but a woman beater too!

47
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,396
And that video going around,

48
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,232
your visit to the police station,

49
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,485
only convinced them
further that you're hiding something!

50
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,569
[Liezel huffs] Pa…

51
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,613
If what they're saying were true,

52
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,657
Angelo would've been charged already.

53
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,699
But he hasn't.

54
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,078
[Samuel] What,
you think they care about the truth?

55
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:09,374
They only believe
what they want to believe!

56
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,750
[Angelo] You just said it.

57
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,961
So why pay attention to those people?

58
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,381
What matters most to me
is that my family believes me.

59
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,050
[tense music playing]

60
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,262
[Samuel] Those are
the very people I'll face in the church.

61
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,390
How could they trust me
to lead them to the right path

62
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,977
when my own daughter
has strayed so far from it?

63
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,734
Appear before the congregation on Sunday.

64
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,403
Give an explanation.

65
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,739
Is that really necessary, Pa?

66
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,324
Angelo's right.

67
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,827
Their minds are already made up.

68
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,078
You're a pastor's daughter!

69
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,163
You should've set a good example!

70
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,124
Instead, you've
always behaved like a brat!

71
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,125
A sinful woman!

72
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,838
Don't you realize everything
that's happening is because of you?

73
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,631
You're being punished by the Lord!

74
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,092
[breath quivering]

75
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,052
You should leave.

[tense music continues]

77
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,140
[Samuel] What did you say?

78
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,854
I said, leave!

79
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:23,406

There you go.

84
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:50,349
Thanks to your wife,
everyone thinks you're a troublemaker!

85
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,976
[Ryan] Ma.

86
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,145
I think that's just your interpretation.

87
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,481
- [scoffs]
- Why not be mad at Angelo?

88
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,149
My wife is the one who got hurt.

89
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,902
What if it were you who got hurt?

90
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,780
Beth has done nothing but cause trouble.

91
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,365
Your wife really
can't keep her mouth shut.

92
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,992
[Cecilia] Accusing Angelo
all sorts of things?

93
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,204
Tell me I'm wrong, that she's
not the one stirring up trouble.

94
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,080
- [Ryan] Ma.
- What?

95
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,956
Lower your voice. My wife might hear you.

96
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,083
[Cecilia] And so what?

97
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,294
What if your wife hears me?
Everything I've said is true.

98
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,089
Chloe.

99
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:22,924
Come on.

100
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,592
You should be used to this by now.

101
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,552
You know your grandma.

102
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:31,015
If World War 3 or a zombie apocalypse
happened, she'd probably blame me.

103
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,270
- Ma?
- Hmm?

104
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,941
Have you and Papa told
the police everything you know?

105
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,819
[exhales softly]

106
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,863
Haven't we told you?

107
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,283
There's no proof
it was Angelo at the cemetery.

[sighs]

109
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,210
But you know more, don't you, Ma?

110
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,629
What do you mean?

111
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,673
Uh…

Everyone at school knows…

116
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:18,354
you accused Miss Liezel of knowing
more about Bianca's disappearance.

117
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,358
That means you know something we don't.

118
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,944
You should talk to the police.

Come on now.

How could they not?

123
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:36,080
Those self-righteous
churchgoers of Pastor Samuel

124
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,249
have surely spread
the gossip all over Amurao.

125
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,502
[Chloe] Ma, you're not listening!

126

Liezel and Angelo may be your friends,

127
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,549
but you still have to talk to the police!

128
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,508

Yeah, I'll be fine.

184
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,859
Besides, I have to meet Miss Liwanag.

Yeah.

happened at the police station,

She and I have something
to discuss about Career Day.

- No. Why?

198

you get scared. Nervous.

Whenever I ask what Beth
said for you to give that look,

you'd say it's nothing,
and there you go again.

202

You'd say it's
nothing again. You're lying!

204

You went out "for a run?"

205
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,104
Don't tell me nothing
happened when you went out hiking.

206
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,689
Seriously, Angelo?

207
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,566
What're you saying, huh?

208
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,652
What did Beth tell you this time?!

209
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,571
You're letting
that woman poison your mind.

won't stop until she ruins us.

I'm begging you, Angelo.

Please just stop!

up Beth at the cemetery?

[Candelaria] For our Career Day,

264
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:55,806
I want our guest speaker
to be dedicated to their chosen field.

265
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,519
Someone who stands out and shines,

266
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,565
and can inspire our students.

267
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:09,695

- Me?
- Yes!

270
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,993
I thought that you could convince

271
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:19,329
Attorney Erica Melendez
to serve as our guest speaker.

272
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,626
You've been friends
since high school, right?

273
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,212
- Uh…
- Hmm?

274
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,881
Uh… Ma'am?

275
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,800
I don't think you need me for that.

276
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,094
Just call her office.

277
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,473
We did, but she declined.

278
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,807
She said she's busy.

279
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,269
Well, if that's what she said,
she must be very busy.

280
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,521
Well, I'm sure she is,

281
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:49,151
but maybe she wouldn't
say no to a friend like you.

282
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,280
I just want the students
to hear some words from her.

283
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,700
She's one of our most successful alumni.

If we're just basing it on success…

287
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,835
then why not
Mel Montenegro or Alice Miller?

288
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,088
Yes, we'll invite them, too.

289
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:13,717
But it'd be better if
Attorney Melendez comes.

290
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,012
She has a unique gravitas.

291
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,348
You're lucky to have them as friends.

292
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,850
They're all so successful.

293
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:28,816

00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,273
He left earlier.

359
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,528
- Why?
- Liezel, Angelo must've texted Beth.

360
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,197
Where is he? Where did he go?

361
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,658
[foreboding music fades]

[ominous music intensifies]

365
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,948
Liezel… [tongue clicks]

366
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,366
Liezel, where are you?

367
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,701
[line disconnects]

- [knife swooshes]
- [shrieks]

373
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,219
[young Beth] <i>Louisa!</i>

374
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,436
[Angelo] What are you doing here?!

375
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,570
[ominous music crescendos]

376
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,324
<i>Beth knows who possibly killed Louisa.</i>

377
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,825
[Chloe] <i>Yes, she was hurt!</i>

378
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,453
<i>I'm scared for her life, Attorney!</i>

379
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,914
<i>We've been calling Beth.</i>

380
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:41,998
<i>She's not picking up.</i>

381
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,083
<i>Liezel, where's Angelo?</i>

382
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,125
<i>He left earlier.</i>

383
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,126
<i>Mel!</i>

384
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,379
<i>If something bad happens to my wife,</i>
<i>I'll kill Angelo!</i>

385
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,089
<i>We're not yet sure what's happening!</i>

386
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,173
<i>We could be wrong!</i>

387
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,676
<i>Beth, face me! Let's get this over with!</i>

388
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,052
<i>They're already here.</i>
