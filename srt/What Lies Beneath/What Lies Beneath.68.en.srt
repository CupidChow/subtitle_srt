00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,124
You're still here.

183
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,338
I wanted to be here, just…

184
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,799
just in case you need it.

185
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:57,224
[gentle music continues]

186
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,309
[phone ringing]

187
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:05,441
- [music fades]
- [ringing continues]

188
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:09,945
Hello?

189
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,780
I'm in San Dimas right now.

190
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,616
What are you doing there?

191
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,368
My contact called me.

192
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,622
A body was found near
where Edong possibly washed up.

193
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,458
Who died?

194
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,877
Dolores Candelaria.

195
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,587
[Marco]<i> I already checked.</i>

196
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,299
<i>She has no family or</i>
<i>relations with Edong but…</i>

197
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,594
My contact told me that Dolores mentioned

198
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,346
someone was staying
at her house a while ago.

199
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,184
It could have been Edong.

200
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,644
Edong is alive, Marco.

201
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,147
[stirring music playing]

202
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,066
Laurence Kyo was attacked last night.

203
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,734
<i>He's in a coma.</i>

204
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,862
But his son, Lucas's friend…

205
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,405
Steve is dead.

206
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,199
I'm with Lucas right now.

207
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,578
- Where are you?
- We're at Lucas's condo.

208
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,164
[Erica] <i>We've reported Edong to the police</i>

209
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,043
Tell the police there that
their case may be connected to Edong.

210
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,087
Get out of there. Right now.

211
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,048
Laurence's men might target Lucas.

212
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,549
<i>Get out of there!</i>

213
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,428
[music fades]

214
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:22,309
[EKG beeping steadily]

215
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,940
[foreboding music playing]

216
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,691
<i>Find Lucas.</i>

217
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,527
<i>Once we have him,</i>

218
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,196
<i>we can force his brother out of hiding.</i>

219
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:40,244
[foreboding music continues, fades]

220
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,831
Mel, Anton destroyed your office.

221
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,875
- [Jo]<i> Everything's broken!</i>
- What do you mean?

222
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,002
<i>He made a mess of your things.</i>

223
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,964
The display cabinet and
the mannequins are all broken.

224
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,218
But--

225
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,345
Is there nothing left to save?

226
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,638
I don't know.

227
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,598
<i>Why?</i>

228
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,684
Are you planning to come back?

229
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,602
I need to.

230
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,898
I just have to attend an event here,
then I'll go straight back to Manila.

231
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,318
Mel, have you thought
about what you're saying?

232
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,071
<i>Didn't I tell you before</i>

233
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,823
that if you come back here,

234
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,659
you might have a hard time escaping again?

235
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,247
I can't put this off any longer, Jo. Okay?

236
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,082
<i>They're all demanding that I come back.</i>

237
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,209
My clients, my publicists…

238
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:33,046
And if I don't show up,
my career will be ruined.

239
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,840
<i>Career?</i>

240
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,383
What's the point of your career

241
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,427
if you don't have control over your life?

242
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,554
<i>Leave him.</i>

243
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:44,224
And before you come back here,
you should get a lawyer.

244
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,893
Wait a minute.

245
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,103
Are you planning to replace my husband

246
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,063
in controlling my life, Jo?

247
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,191
<i>That's what they do.</i>

248
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,985
They confuse and belittle us.

249
00:19:55,068 --> 00:20:01,658
<i>No matter how much</i>
<i>we love and protect ourselves,</i>

250
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,328
<i>we end up not knowing what to do.</i>

251
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:11,585
- [Mel wailing]<i> No!</i>
- [somber music playing]

252
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,839
I have nothing left to protect and love.

253
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,385
[crying] She's gone because of me.

254
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,013
<i>She's gone?</i>

255
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,182
<i>Who, Mel?</i>

256
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,186
[sniffles] I gotta go.

257
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,733
- Mel, wait! Mel!
- [somber music fades]

258
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,652
[Anton] Who the hell are you?

259
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,281
[ominous music playing]

260
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,080
I'll take you to the police station,
but I'm not going to hide.

261
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,666
I'm going to face them.
I can handle myself!

262
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,378
Lucas, Kyo's men are armed.
And there's a lot of them.

263
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,922
Do you think you're an action star,
Coco Martin?

264
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,383
- That you can defeat them all?
- Santiago!

265
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,009
Lucas, let's go.

266
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,721
Boss Oslo is asking for you.

267
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,559
If Oslo needs to talk to me,
tell him to come speak to me himself.

268
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:16,566
- [blows landing]
- [grunts, groans]

269
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,360
- [body thuds]
- [Lucas groaning]

270
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,488
You're the one poisoning my wife's mind.

271
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,157
- No.
- But I just heard you.

272
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,368
You were talking to her, right?

273
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,161
- [line ringing]
- Huh?!

274
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,124
Is that why
she doesn't want to come home?!

275
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,917
[woman]<i> Jo! Where are you?</i>

276
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm here in front of
Anton Montenegro at his house!

277
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,257
<i>Huh?! We'll be on our way! Are you safe?</i>

278
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,384
Yes, I'm safe…

279
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,846
…especially now
that he knows you're on your way.

280
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:46,888
Isn't that right, Anton?

281
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,016
- [tense music playing]
- What the fuck is that?

282
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,143
I am a member of Sinta…

283
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:55,522
a group that protects women

284
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,607
who are abused by their husbands.

285
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,527
Just like Mel, right?

286
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,155
[tense music continues]

287
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,740
Get the fuck out of my house!

288
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,826
And if something bad happens to Mel,

289
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,412
we'll know that you did it!

290
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,417
- [woman] <i>Jo! Jo!</i>
- [Jo grunting]

291
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,879
[Jo gasping for air]

292
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:19,838
<i>Jo!</i>

293
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,716
- [Lucas groaning]
- [kick landing]

294
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,969
- Argh!
- [kick landing]

295
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,723
- [grunts]
- [blows landing]

296
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,558
[Lucas groaning]

297
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,562
[Lucas] Get out of here! Hurry!

298
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:42,527
- [grunts, groans]
- [blows landing]

299
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,821
[gun cocks]

300
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,159
- [gunshot]
- [Lucas grunts]

301
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,828
Erica!

302
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,500
<i>Someone left this for you at the gate.</i>

303
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,127
[Seth] <i>Are you scared of the monster, too?</i>

304
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,421
<i>I don't have bad dreams like your mom.</i>

305
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,548
<i>Not that kind of monster.</i>

306
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,093
<i>The other one, the one that scares you.</i>

307
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,429
<i>The first time</i>
<i>I witnessed injustice, I kept silent.</i>

308
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,016
<i>I let the louder voices win,</i>
<i>even when I knew it was wrong.</i>

309
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,312
[student] <i>Who's the most dangerous</i>
<i>criminal you've encountered?</i>

310
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,314
<i>Is it Edong Santiago?</i>
