[Scott] <i>What scary man?</i>

180
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,234
Nothing! Just some nightmare he had.

181
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,070
You didn't tell me
you were taking him to the Philippines.

182

[scoffs]

183
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,367
Do I need your permission
to take my son on vacation?

184
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,411
<i>Well, he's my son, too!</i>

185
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,121
<i>So, I deserve a heads-up, don't I?</i>

186

[chuckles in disbelief]

187
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,207
<i>When are you coming back here?</i>

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,752
I don't know. I don't know.

189
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,004
We might stay here longer than expected.

190
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,672
<i>And what about your work?</i>

191
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,965
[sighs]

192
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,134
I already made arrangements with my firm.

193
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,137
I'm going to be working
remotely here in the Philippines.

194
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,806
<i>Taking my son without a return date.</i>

195
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,391
Alice, that's called kidnapping!

196

201
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,072

202

You know exactly what
you've been doing to me.

214

<i>No, no, no! I have never cheated on you!</i>

215
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,936
That's not what I'm talking about!

216
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,397

[unsettling music continues]

218
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,739
I'll let you know when
you can talk to Seth again.

219
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,032
Okay?

220
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,117

[Edong] <i>Celestino was just the beginning.</i>

[Edong] <i>He couldn't handle my tests.</i>

228
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,732
I dumped him in the trash…

229
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,861
because that's what he was, bro.

230
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,071
He was garbage.

231
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,614

[sinister music playing]

233
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,453
[Marco] Edong's name
is already out in the news,

234
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,330
but it looks like the cops here in Amurao
want to keep things quiet.

235
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,541
They should be alerting everyone.

236
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,794
The mayor doesn't want people to panic.

237
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,463
It's understandable, but…

238
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,216
I don't think they really understand
what Edong is capable of.

239
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,342
[sighs]

240
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,927
What's important is

241
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,889
that Beth and Alice
are now under protection,

242
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,682
and the NLEA's on high alert.

243
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,893
If Edong decides to be reckless

244
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,812
and goes straight
to Amurao for Alice and Beth,

245
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:52,938
it'll speed everything up.

246
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,358
He's going to make
it that easy for the police?

247
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,111
I don't think so, Marco.

248
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,281
It's important
that we speak with Lucas again.

249
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,201
If anyone knows
where Edong's hiding, it's him.

250
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,746
His reaction
to the video and the news last night…

251
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,456
Do you think it was real?

All I know is,

257
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,180
we shouldn't trust Lucas.

258
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,600
You don't need to help them.

259
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,146
<i>Your focus should be on yourself.</i>

260
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,942
Have you forgotten
everything we talked about?

00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,321
<i>You'll go to school again.</i>
<i>We'll start a business.</i>

262
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,823
Did you forget that? Edong…

You still don't understand, bro.

I told you I have plans, didn't I?

270
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,389
[Lucas] <i>Plans?!</i>

271
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,932
You've got plans for others!

272
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,185
But for yourself? None!

273
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,646
I'm not even part of your plan!

<i>Edong, the police are</i>

275
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,028
Turn yourself in before they kill you.

276
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,115
You'll understand eventually.

277
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,868
[Lucas] <i>End it with Celestino.</i>

278
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,078
Don't do it again!

279
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,497
You're not a killer!

280
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,916
We'll see each other again…

281
