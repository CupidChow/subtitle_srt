Louisa's was the reason we became friends.

196
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,050
She didn't deserve all the hate.

[Beth] Yet the people of
Amurao turned on her in disgust.

249

- But.

347
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,402
A dreamy fairytale love story?

348
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,820
Wow!

<i>I'm sorry, we have to go now.</i>

353
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,877
<i>Okay? I'm sorry.</i>

354
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,004
<i>Okay.</i>

355

356
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,091

Well, I truly have everything.

360
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,395
[Mel] Yes! I agree.

361
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,233
But,

362
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,819
I do wish…

363
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,240
my dad was there
to walk me down the aisle.

00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,168

372
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,189
[Beth] You know,
I really wanted to come back then.

373
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,358
But I couldn't.

374
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,028
I can barely travel
locally on a teacher's salary.

375
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,655
[chuckles softly]

376
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,157
- But you're happy.
- Mm-hmm.

377
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,325
And your cute
relationship with Ryan and Chloe.

378
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,827
She's right.

379
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,996
[laughs] That's true, actually!

380
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,166
I'm really happy my
daughter grew up smart.

381
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,252
And I'm thankful
that she's so mature and grounded.

382
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,503
But really,

383
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,048
Alice, did you ever
imagine Beth becoming a mom?

384
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,091
Oh, wow!

385
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,260
- Or a teacher?
- Right?!

386
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,012
- No way. Never!
- [Alice] No, no.

387
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,514
She used to get mad just teaching us,

388
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,183
what more with kids?

389
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,185
Oh come on, you guys!

390
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,061
Well, I can't believe it either.

391
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,773
Actually, if Ryan hadn't gotten me
pregnant back in third year,

392
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,775
I don't think I'd have a kid even now.

393
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,487
[light-hearted music playing]

394
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,114
<i>Hey, Ryan!</i>

395
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,492

<i>turn you down before you get it, huh?!</i>

396
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,036
<i>I don't like you!</i>

397
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,495
[young Ryan] <i>Um.</i>

398
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,873
<i>Probably like 20 more times.</i>

[squeals in frustration]

400
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,461
[young Beth] <i>That guy is so annoying!</i>

401
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,588
<i>It's actually kind of sweet.</i>

402
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,758
<i>Like one of those classic romantic movies.</i>

403
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,301
<i>- Hmph!</i>
- [giggling]

404
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,762
<i>I don't want to be some leading lady!</i>

405
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,931
<i>I want to be</i>
<i>a journalist like Karen Davila.</i>

406
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,391
<i>Men are useless anyway.</i>

407
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,893
<i>Look at my mom.</i>

408
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,853
<i>She kept searching for "the one,"</i>

409
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,813
<i>and just ended up getting beaten.</i>

410
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,106
<i>- So stupid.</i>
- [music stops]

411
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,654
You know what's even more shocking?

412
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,114
Erica became a lawyer.

413
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:45,118
[uneasy music playing]

[Alice clears throat, clicks tongue]

415
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:57,506
Have you guys, um,
seen or spoken to her over the years?

416
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,802
Well, I saw her in Manila.

417
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,804
- Oh?
- [Mel] There were a couple of events

418
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,806
we both attended, but…

419
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,600
we never really sought each other to talk.

420
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,603
Actually, from what I've heard,

421
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:15,190
she hasn't been back
to Amurao since she left in high school.

00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,055
