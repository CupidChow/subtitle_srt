Okay, good.

32
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,121
That gives me time to file a subpoena
for the psychiatric records.

They don't know Laurence Kyo either.

44

I'm Roman Bautista, from RTC Branch 68.

- [tense music playing]
- We're here to serve you this.

Writ of habeas corpus.

57
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,016
Issued by Judge Maria Amparo Benitez.

58

You were named as the respondent

59
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,230
in the case of Francine Valmoria,
who was reported missing.

60
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,023
In accordance with the court order,

61
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,486
you have five days
to submit your written return.

62
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,697
You're wasting your time.

63
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,365
I have nothing to do with that.

64
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,411

then you have no reason not to cooperate.

00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,055
- That I shouldn't have confronted Angelo.
- [music fades]

68
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,223
Yes!

We talked about this, remember?

70
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,727
We agreed to stay out of it.

71
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,564
And now I'm sure the whole Amurao
is talking about what happened!

72
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,316
That's also what you told Liezel, right?

73
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,942
You said you were
carried away by your emotions.

74
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,236
Well I was carried away by mine too!

75
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,030
What do you want, Beth?!

76
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,489
You were beaten up!

77
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,992
What do you want?!
Just stand around here doing nothing?!

00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:32,582
[pensive music playing, fades]

00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,624
[Liezel] Um…

80
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,044
Just pick us up later.

81

Even you…

86
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,686
have suspicions about your husband?

87
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,147
That's what she said.

88
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,317
What does that mean?

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,945
[unsettling music continues]

90
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,122

[unsettling music continues]

92
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,979

00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,915
We'll release to the media

96
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,625
the possible involvement of Laurence Kyo

97
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,918
in Francine's disappearance.

98
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:04,507
We already expect his camp to issue
a written return denying the accusations.

99
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:11,013
To make sure the court
and police won't dismiss the case,

100
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,640
we need to make noise.

101
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,685
We have to generate media pressure.

102
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,187
So we can gain public interest as well.

103
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,859
Patricia, look.

- [Samuel] What?
- Have you heard about what happened?

109

They said Beth was
beaten up at the cemetery.

110
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,709
They suspect Angelo did it.

- Really?
- Didn't you watch the video?

00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,262
You also heard Miss Beth's husband, right?

129

What's unclear about that?

[Beth] <i>Once this starts,</i>
<i>there's no turning back.</i>

176
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,107
<i>What if we're wrong?</i>

177
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,401
<i>Liezel and Angelo's lives will be ruined.</i>

178
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,111
<i>Are you prepared for that?</i>

179
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,655
[Ryan] <i>What if--</i>
<i>What if you and Chloe get hurt?</i>

180
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,616
<i>I'm not prepared for that.</i>

181

[uneasy music continues]

182
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,621
- [Joshua] Stop! I said stop!
- [boy 1] Does it hurt?

183
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,247
- Why were you so smug then?
- Huh? You're scared now?

184
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,166
- [boy 2] Skill issue, bro!
- [blow lands, wails]

185
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,167
Respond!

186
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,918
- [thuds]
- [grunts, whimpers]

187
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,253
[boy 1] Now, what?

188
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,630
- [Joshua] Stop!
- What? Huh?

189
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,632
- [Joshua] Enough!
- What?

190
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,425
- He has a skill issue, bro.
- Stop it! Enough!

191
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,302
- Oh!
- Leave him alone!

192
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,222
Why are you getting angry
when we're just defending you?

193
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,683
[uneasy music continues]

194
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,769
- [Alice] <i>Sorry.</i>
- [music fades]

195
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,230
I was, so emotional earlier.

196
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,153
That, recurring nightmare of mine…

197
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,989
[breathes deeply]
The one where I'm tied up in the dark.

198
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,993
I think, that's the reason why

199
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,622
I'm repressing memories
of Scott abusing me while I'm asleep.

200
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,959
But now…

201
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,338
I'm seeing myself in that situation.

202
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,634
But, I was so young then.

203
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,182
Do you think it's connected to
your sleepwalking to that abandoned lot?

204
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,810
Where they found
you when you were five years old.

205
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,437
[sighs heavily]

206
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,190
What if I was wrong, Mel?

207
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,694
What if everything I am going through now,
is not because of Scott,

208
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,198
but because of what
happened to me when I was a kid?

209
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,742
Uh…

210
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,161
Did you tell your therapist?

211
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,123
And did she say it is possible?

212
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:52,711
She said trauma
survivors can repress memories.

213
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:58,634
So, maybe I just forgot
what happened to me when I was a kid.

214
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,597
And maybe, maybe my memories
got triggered by something in the present.

215
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,893
- That is why I am confused now
- [somber music playing]

216
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,562
about what is real,

217
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,606
what I'm just imagining,

218
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,443
what is past, and what is present.

219
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,237
I'm scared.

220
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,823
What if I just pinned the blame on Scott

221
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,366
because of my confusion?

222
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,201
[somber music continues]

223
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,953
You're not even sure about anything yet,

224
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,663
so stop thinking about that for now.

225
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,790
Just take it one thing at a time.

226
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,167
Baby steps.

227
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,043
If you try to carry everything at once,

228
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,211
you might go crazy.

229
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,257
Am I not already crazy at this point?

230
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,341
[exhales sharply]

231
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,804
Is that why you didn't tell us right away?

232
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,932
Because you were
scared we'd think that about you?

233
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,184
[breathes deeply]

234
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:53,939
Maybe I just wanted
to believe in the fantasy.

235
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,149
[somber music continues]

236
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,986
The way you see
my life is like a fairy tale.

237
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,823
It's easier to believe that fantasy

238
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:08,329
than to accept
that my whole life is a mess.

239
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,956
[breathes deeply]

240
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,626
Erica was right.

241
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:20,007
I'd rather… pretend everything's okay

242
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,760
than face my problems.

243
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,974
Sometimes, we lie to ourselves.

244
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,144
[somber music continues]

245
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,231
But if that's what we need to survive,

246
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,651
can they really judge us?

247
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:43,531
[somber music continues]

248
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,952

[Ryan] <i>I know you don't want to tell Erica</i>

250
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,665
<i>because that'll only make</i>
<i>Liezel's life more complicated.</i>

251
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,876
<i>But it is all over Amurao.</i>

252
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,879
<i>They're saying</i>
<i>Liezel and Angelo might be involved.</i>

253
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,173
<i>Everyone's already talking about it.</i>

254
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,884
<i>Maybe it'll even help</i>
<i>Liezel if Erica finds out.</i>

[pensive music playing]

256
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,595
<i>Because if Angelo's innocent,</i>

257
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,472
<i>Erica's the only one</i>
<i>who can prove it, right?</i>

[Louisa] <i>You just don't want to admit</i>

<i>that the reason</i>
<i>you don't want to tell the truth</i>

261

Do you think Papa
would do that to your mom?

269
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,678
You're asking me that now…

270
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,307
but when the rumor was
it was my mom who hurt your mom,

271
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,475
you didn't even talk to me?

[sniffles]

273
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,607
[Ryan] <i>Then tell her you suspect</i>

<i>that it's possible Angelo might be</i>
<i>Louisa's secret boyfriend</i>

I don't care…

279
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,585
if our parents give suspicious vibes.

280
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,629
Joshua.

[uneasy music continues]

282
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,175
Joshua, son.

283
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,678
[Liezel] What happened to you, huh?

284
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,765
[uneasy music continues]

285
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,517
Let's go.

286
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,275
No matter how
many red flags they give off,

287
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,404
we'll still remain friends.

288
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,407
No matter what happens.

289
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,077
Even if our parents end their friendship.

290

[Chloe] We'll always be BNMW.

294
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,135
BNMW.

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,126
[Marco] He's loyal to Laurence Kyo.

299
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,170
Oslo has been
working for Kyo for a long time.

[unsettling music playing]

301
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:51,385
[Marco] Enforcer,
handler, cleaner… All in one.

302
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:56,849
He's Kyo's go-to guy
when he wants something done.

[music turns dramatic]

304
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,979
Whatever happened
to Francine and the others,

305
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,689
he definitely knows.

306
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,611
Based on what I gathered,

307
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:15,325
it was Oslo
who recruited and handled the girls.

308
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,204
[dramatic music continues]

309
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,833
[Marco] <i>Kyo knows that because</i>

00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:27,463
<i>they can move inside the world of the rich</i>
<i>without raising suspicion.</i>

311
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,008
<i>They can move</i>
<i>around freely supplying drugs.</i>

312

<i>Everyone's distracted by their beauty</i>

313

[Lucas] <i>I know they're</i>

316
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,816
I had already started distancing myself.

317
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,986
But apparently,

318
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,364
using my business for
money laundering wasn't enough.

319
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,576
Laurence wasn't content.

320
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,164
He threatened to have
my brother killed in jail…

321
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,584
if I didn't do what he wanted.

322
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,961
[Yuri] That's the thing, boss.

323
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,255
Are you sure about that?

324
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,049
If Kyo goes down,

325
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,094
you'll get dragged into it too.

326
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,513
No matter what happens,

327
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,142
even if Kyo gets into
trouble over those missing girls,

328
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,604
he'll protect his drug operations.

329
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,942
Because he's
maintaining it not just for himself.

330
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,823
He'll pass it on and he'll do everything
to make that happen.

331
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,784
[tense music playing]

332
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,785
Boss.

333
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:44,873
Next time,
can we meet the usual way again?

334
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,334
It's safer.

335
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:52,131
You mean without the son
of the drug lord you want to take down?

336
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,091
Is that what you're trying to say?

337
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,846
I'm the one who gave Lucas the info

338
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,223
about the missing beauty queens.

339
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,307
Hold on.

Are you saying
you want to take down your dad

341
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,608
so that you and our boss
can replace him, is that it?

342
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,486
I don't care about my father's empire.

343
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,407
I'd wreck everything my dad worked for…

344
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,993

without hurting him.

348
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,917
[Lucas] Oslo.

00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,169
He's the key.

350
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,882
If you need evidence
about the missing girls,

351
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,842
I'm sure he has it.

352
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,511
That's why I told you

353
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,597
that you won't find anything in our house.

354
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,183
Oslo handles everything.

355
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:50,772
- [music becomes dramatic]
- Well then, I also scouted Oslo's house.

356
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,400
I saw there are hidden security cameras.

357
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,736
But I can get inside.

358
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,948
I just want to know if
you're sure the evidence is there.

359
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,409
Possible.

360
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,746
But I'll keep looking for
other locations that he could use.

361
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,957
Oh and by the way,

362
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:14,171
Erica Melendez is
the one handling Francine's case.

363
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:18,675
[dramatic music continues, fades]

364
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,678
Did you notify the families
about the court petition?

365
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,140
Even if there's no direct link between Kyo

366
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,100
and the missing girls, there is to Oslo.

367
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,395
That's a reasonable
ground for the court to grant the writ.

368
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,648
I'll also leak
that connection to the media.

369
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,608
PBI won't like that.

370
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,736
But Francine and the others
have been missing for months.

371
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:42,074
Without media pressure, the
investigation and court will slow down.

372
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,410
We need to help their families find them.

373
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,373
[Steve] Dude,
you should've seen Dad's face

374
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,291
when he read the court document.

375
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,294
Especially when he saw Atty.
Melendez's name.

376
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,880
He called his lawyers
in lightning fashion.

377
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,342
[scoffs]
Your ex-friend is really something.

378
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,387
I mean, she can scare
Laurence Kyo just like that.

379
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,974
Dude, she's on this.

380
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,768
Maybe we can work with her.

381
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,981
[pensive music playing]

382
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,565
[sighs heavily]

383
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,526
I did all this for my brother.

384
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,864
I'm not working with
anyone who helped destroy his life.

385
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,616
[phone vibrating]

386
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,204
Boss.

387
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:34,293
The police have pulled
the search team for Edong.

388
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,629
[Erica] We expected that.

389
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:42,050
When they told the media
that they believe Edong's dead,

390
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,554
we already knew
they'd stop looking for him.

391
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,181
You know, I feel sorry for that bastard.

392
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,183
Life screwed him.

393
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,769
But it's better that he's gone.

394
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,523
That's one less threat to your life.

395
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:06,908
[music becomes sinister]

396
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,209
[sinister music ends]

397
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,461
<i>Attorney Erica, please.</i>

398
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,756
<i>My parents think</i>
<i>that the one who hurt my mom</i>

399
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,299
<i>is the same person who killed Louisa.</i>

400
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,594
<i>Don't you realize everything</i>
<i>that's happening is because of you?!</i>

401
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,929
<i>- You're being punished by the Lord!</i>
<i>- I said leave!</i>

402
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,807
<i>Even if Aunt Liezel and</i>
<i>Uncle Angelo are your friends,</i>

403
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,642
<i>you still have to tell the police.</i>

404
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,687
<i>Please, Angelo.</i>
<i>Stop hurting people, please.</i>

405
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,440
<i>- Please, that's enough.</i>
<i>- What did Beth tell you?!</i>

406
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,484
<i>You're letting that woman brainwash you.</i>

407
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,277
<i>She needs to learn her lesson!</i>
