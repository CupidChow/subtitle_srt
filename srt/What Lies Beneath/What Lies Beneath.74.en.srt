Not anymore.

you having an affair true?

28
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,780

[scoffs] If I say that it happened before,

32
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,792
does that mean it's
the reason for his abuse?

33
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,837
[Mel] Let me be clear.

34
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,675
<i>Anton started hurting me</i>
<i>the moment we got married.</i>

35
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,553
Before I could even
take off my wedding dress,

36
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,347
I already had bruises from him.

37
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,310
But even if that wasn't the case,

38
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,646
would my affair justify his abuse?

a mistake for remaining silent.

What do you think you could have done

47
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,632
to prevent this from happening?

48
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,176
[Jo] She can cover up her entire body,

49
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,555
conceal her bruises with makeup,

50
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,724
keep her mouth shut,

51
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,519
and obey all of her husband's commands.

52
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,522
Even if she did all of that,

53
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,317
Anton would have still abused her.

54
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:01,658
Because an abuser doesn't
need a reason to abuse someone.

55
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,786
They will do whatever they want

56
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,204
because that is who they are.

57
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,832
I am also a victim of
Anton Montenegro's abuse.

58
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,878

Because you look

when you've always
been a die-hard fan of his?

118
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,071
So I guess the bruises
my friends and I have

119
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,739
aren't enough for you to believe me.

120
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,909
So tell me. What's it going to take?

Take back everything that I said?

I can't do
that because it's already out there.

And you want us
to talk like we can fix this?

Let me guess,
you want me to get back together with him?

That's not going to happen

159
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,399
because I'll never get
back together with him!

160

for all of this, okay?

172
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,944
But I blame you too.

173
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,238
Because you're the one who taught me

174

first above everything else.

00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,421
You can't be your true self.

180
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,341
And I managed to break away from you

181
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,927
when I left medical
school and chose my own path.

182
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,722
But in the end…

183
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,641
[sobbing]

184
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,309
…It meant nothing.

185
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,770
Because I still…

186
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,024
I still wanted your approval, Dad.

187
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,902
- [sobbing]
- [melancholic music continues]

188
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:57,782
And so I married the perfect man

189
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:03,496
with a perfect
career and a perfect family.

190
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:08,209
Just to get the perfect
life that you would approve of.

191
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,130
Even if it meant losing myself.

192
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:17,218
[melancholic music continues]

193
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:21,764
[sobbing] So even if I'm all
bruised up and beaten up,

194
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,475
even if I feel like I'm going crazy,

195
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:28,979
I still had to smile like
nothing was happening.

196
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,442
And despite all of that, still nothing?

197
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,655
Not even a small nod from you.

198
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,075
If that's the case,

199
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,121
I don't need you as a father.

200
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,623
I don't need you!

201
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:48,999
- [slaps]
- [Mel] Ah!

202
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,292
[music fades]

203
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:59,635
- [solemn music playing]
- [Mel laughs]

204
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,761
Look.

205
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,182
Another man who likes to hit me.

206
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,563
So, Dad, were you inspired
by how my husband treats me?

207
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,651
Leave.

208
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:20,239
[solemn music continues]

209
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,617
- What the hell did you say to me?
- I said leave!

210
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:28,664
[exhales sharply] Leave
and don't you ever come back!

211
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,208
Because if you do,

212
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,336
then I'm gonna show
you just how hysterical I can be.

213
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,589
And you're not going to like it.

214
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,468
[solemn music continues]

215
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,139
[Cedric] Let's go.

216
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,144
I said, let's go!

217
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,230
[Mel crying]

218
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,736
I'm staying here.
I'm staying with our daughter.

219
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:06,118
[Cedric] Didn't you hear her?
She said she doesn't need us.

220
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,079
Let her suffer alone.

221
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,710
Let her suffer disgrace alone.

222
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,713
Cedric, stop it!

223
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,217
Stop thinking about yourself for
once and think about our daughter.

224
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,885
She needs us right now!

225
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,932
- Margie, I said we're leaving.
- [Margie sighs sharply]

226
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,769
She said she doesn't need you!

227
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:36,774
You! But me, I know she needs me!

228
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,781
Were going to leave right now.
If you don't come with me--

229
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,242
What will you do? You'll leave me?

230
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,913
Go ahead! I know all
your threats, I've heard them all!

231
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,583
I've put up with a lot
from you all these years.

232
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,337
Because I thought I was doing
what's best for our daughter, Mel.

233
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,381
But I was wrong.

234
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,134
- [music becomes poignant]
- So go ahead and leave!

235
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:08,806
Because I can't be with
someone who can walk away from our child!

236
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:13,394
[poignant music continues]

237
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:17,898
[Margie] Go.

238
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,110
My dear, I'm sorry…

239
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,488
I'm sorry.
All those years, I should've known!

240
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,409
I'm sorry,
I should've done something sooner.

241
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,537
- [Mel crying]
- Please forgive me.

242
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,789
I'm so sorry…

243
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,502
- [Mel crying]
- I'm sorry.

244
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,883
- [Marco] This early?
- [music fades]

245
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,426
Is it that bad?

246
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,430
- [Erica sighs]
- They recovered two so far.

247
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:53,017
We don't know if it's
the remains of the lost beauty queens.

248
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,895
Did you find anything?

249
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,938
I went to see Mrs. Ayoc's mother.

250
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,483
I pleaded if
she could ask her daughter again

251
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,193
if she really saw Edong.

252
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,739
Nothing. She just sent me away.

253
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,367
She said, that if she saw me again…

254
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,120
That if she sees us again,

255
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,956
they'll call the police.

256
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,084
[sighs heavily]

257
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,423
- [glass thuds]
- [sighs sharply]

258
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,009
There is so much to do.

259
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,429
But I don't know where to start.

260
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,808
[pensive music playing]

261
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,101
[glass thuds]

262
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,478
Mel needs me.

263
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,731
But Mr. Valmoria needs me too.

264
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,359
I also have to deal with Edong.

265
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,445
We need to prove that Edong is still alive

266
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,156
so I can ask for
a protection detail for everyone.

267
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,785
So we can start the manhunt for him.

268
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,038
I told you to let me handle it.

269
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,917
Let me look for
the evidence for the police.

270
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,836
After what happened to Mel,

271
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,215
we don't know what he'll do next

272
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,176
and who's next on his list.

273
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,597
[pensive music continues]

274
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,474
Mommy!

275
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,893
Hi, baby!

276
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,731
- What have you been doing, huh?
- [Seth] Um…

277
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,402
- Nothing. Yeah!
- Nothing?

278
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,736
- [Alice] What's nothing?
- [ominous music sting]

279
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,822
[Alice laughs]

280
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,782
- [Scott] Nothing? Really?
- [Seth] Uh-huh.

281

<i>abuse that he inflicted on me.</i>

284

285
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,177

286

<i>That's not true.</i>

287
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:59,893
<i>Anton was injured because we fought back.</i>

[unsettling music continues]

289
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,405
I'm still your baby. [laughs]

290
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,741
- My baby.
- Still your baby.

291
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,952
Mm-hmm. [clicks tongue]
