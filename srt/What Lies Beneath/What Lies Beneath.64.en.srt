177
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,909
It's hard to believe a couple of hours ago

178
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,537
he was running wild
around the house like a little devil.

179
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,457
But now he's so peaceful.

180
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:26,962
Hey.

181
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,133
[sighs]

182
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,968
Is it really okay?

183
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,430
I mean, can we really just let it go?

184
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,933
Like, what I did, what I accused you of?

185
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,436
[sighs]

186
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,400
Hey.

187
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,569
Hey, look at me.

188
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,491
It's…

189
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,993
It's not something
that should be lightly forgiven.

190
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,662
It shouldn't be lightly forgiven.

191
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,624
You doing this is
just too good to be true.

192
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,251
And after everything that's happened,

193
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,796
I shouldn't be
taking things at face value.

194
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,548
I told you the truth.

195
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,717
I mean, yeah.

196
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,386
It hurt, and it still does.

197
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,347
[somber music playing]

198
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,307
But I know it wasn't really about me.

199
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,811
You reacted that way because
you were going through something.

200
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,939
I love you enough to forgive that.

201
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:34,321
You know, life's going
to keep throwing crap at you, Alice,

202
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,990
and I'll be right here beside you.

203
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,867
You can always count on me.

204
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,078
That's what I promised you, remember?

205
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,747
[somber music continues]

206
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,084
In sickness and health,
till death do us part.

207
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,003
Remember? [sniffles]

208
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,635
You promise?

209
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,595
Always.

210
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,767
[somber music continues]

211
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,400
[crickets chirping]

212
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:16,488
[line trilling]

213
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,536
[somber music continues]

214
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,663
"PLEASE PICK UP, LIEZEL.

215
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,456
I ASKED JOSHUA FOR YOUR NEW NUMBER.

216
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,875
LET'S TALK."

217
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,137
[music fades]

218
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,056
[phone chimes]

219
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,475
"PLEASE PICK UP, LIEZEL.

220
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,103
I ASKED JOSHUA FOR YOUR NEW NUMBER.

221
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,688
LET'S TALK."

222
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,987
[crickets continue chirping]

223
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,831
You're going to sleep here again?

224
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,792
Yeah.

225
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,758
I called the CHK.

226
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,801
I requested,

227
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,471
to board the ship earlier.

228
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,605
Are we going to stay like this, Angelo?

229
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,652
Aren't we going to fix this?

230
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,825
Is there anything left to fix, Liezel?

231
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:50,874
[morose music playing]

232
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,724
[music fades]

233
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:12,354
[indistinct chattering]

234
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,110
What if it's Edong?

235
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,570
[dramatic music playing]

236
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,573
What if he was the one
who beat up Beth at the cemetery?

237
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,951
The one who texted her and Angelo…

238
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,787
Only Edong would
mess with people like that.

239
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,499
[laughing]

240
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,797
- [laughing continues]
- [sinister music playing]

241
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:45,512
[dramatic music resumes]

242
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,402
[dramatic music crescendos]

243
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:05,866
<i>Divorce her.</i>
<i>Find somebody better who deserves you.</i>

244
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,992
<i>Ma, I love her.</i>

245
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,660
<i>Even if it's painful and hard sometimes,</i>

246
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,078
<i>there's no one else like her.</i>

247
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,496
<i>Before I left Amurao,</i>

248
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,041
<i>I'm sure someone was</i>
<i>watching us when we were at the cemetery.</i>

249
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,876
[Marco] <i>They're sure he's dead.</i>

250
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,294
<i>That's what they want to believe.</i>

251
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,714
<i>I heard you're</i>
<i>working with Attorney. Melendez.</i>

252
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,050
<i>I won't let my brother drown in it.</i>

253
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,593
<i>I'm going to save my brother.</i>

254
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,386
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

255
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,680
<i>I'm going to save my brother.</i>
