[Steve] <i>Are you giving that to the police?</i>

00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:05,088
<i>You're going to admit</i>

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,132
<i>Are you trying to ruin your life?</i>

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,053
<i>About "Bana",</i>

[Chloe]
<i>Why does Mama think that Aunt Liezel</i>

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,224
<i>has something to do</i>
<i>with Bianca's disappearance?</i>

7
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:19,060
[Ryan] <i>Chloe, people are just</i>

<i>Ma, are you okay? Where's Papa?</i>

10
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,782
<i>He just went somewhere. Go on, dig in.</i>

15
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,181
- Ryan! [grunting]
- [Ryan] Love?

16
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,894
Love? Love!

17
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,566
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [heartbeat thumping]

18
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,611
- Love?!
- Ma!

[theme music playing]

20
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,606
- Isn't it terrifying?
- What happened?

21
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,067
Didn't you hear what happened to Beth?

22
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,616
- Liezel?
- Hmm?

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,368
Do you know about what happened?

24
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,328
Why? What happened?

25
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,748
Someone called Ma'am Liwanag
in the Principal's Office just now.

26
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,083
Beth is in the hospital.

27
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,168
They said she got beat up at the cemetery.

28
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,630
[unsettling music sting]

29
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,634
All good! Don't worry anymore.
It's just a minor wound.

30
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,971
It's normal for head
wounds to bleed profusely.

31
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,639
There is a hint of swelling.

32
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,601
But there's no
fracture or intracranial bleeding

33
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,686
based on the initial scans.

34
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:11,649
Regarding the abdominal area,
there's tenderness or bruising.

35
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,652
But there's no internal damage.

36
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,156
So far, your vital signs are stable.

37
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,242
But to be sure,

38
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,995
we will observe you for
the next 8 to 12 hours, okay?

39
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,163
- [Ryan] Thank you, Doc.
- Okay.

40
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,123
Okay. Please excuse us.

41
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,917
- Thank you, Doc.
- [Ryan sighs sharply]

42
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,003
- Good day, Mr. Mora, Mrs. Mora.
- Sir.

43
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,714
We just need to take Mrs.
Mora's statement.

44
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,882
Alright, sir.

45
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,385
Mrs. Mora, do you recognize
the person who did this to you?

46
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,346
[unsettling music playing]

47
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,515
I think…
I only saw the shoe he was wearing.

48
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,267
They were wearing black rubber shoes.

49
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,897
Did you notice the brand or
unique markings on the shoes?

50
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,899
[kick lands]

51
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,486
Nope. Just plain black.

52
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,073
[exhales deeply] I got nothing too, sir.

53
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,700
By the time I got to Beth,
he already got away.

54
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,119
Who do you think could do this?

55
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,372
And who holds a grudge against you?

56
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,915
[unsettling music continues]

57
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:13,753
If we're going to base
it on that, the list is very long.

58
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,422
Uh, we'll just
leave it in your hands, sir.

59
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,383
Please pass it on to Locsin too.

60
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,052
I don't want
the person who did this to get away.

61
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,223
Mr. Mora, Mrs. Mora,
thank you very much. We'll get going.

62
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,432
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

63
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,229
[Mel]<i></i>Oh my god. Beth?

64
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,482
- Beth! Oh my god, Beth!
- [Beth] Mel.

65
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,900
How are you?

66
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,737
What happened?
I was with Alice when Ryan called.

67
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,990
I'm so glad you're awake. How are you?

68
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,867
- I'm fine.
- [Mel sighs]

69
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,036
- [breathing laboriously]
- [line ringing]

70
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,458
[phone ringing]

71
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,301
What's up, Partner?

72
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,761
[heavy breathing] Where are you?

73
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,138
I'm at home.

74
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,476
You weren't at breakfast.
Where did you go?

75
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,312
I went for a run.

76
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,148
[tense music playing]

77
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,316
Was it you?

78
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,281
[hesitates] Are you
gonna pick us up later?

79
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,367
Of course. Why not?

80
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,455
Alright.

81
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,916
[tense music continues]

82
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,216
[music fades]

83
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,426
Alice.

84
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,097
I want you to talk to me about your dream

85
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,392
like you're watching a movie.

86
00:05:55,563 --> 00:06:00,693
Describe what you see to me.

87
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,073
No need to interpret it yet.

88
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:09,952
[sinister music playing]

89
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,997
I… I was there again.

90
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,126
In the cramped space.

91
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,881
[sinister music continues]

92
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,802
I don't know. I, I don't know where I am.

93
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,389
It's too dark.

94
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,352
I can't see anything. [breath shaking]

95
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,355
[Isla] It's fine.

96
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,149
You're doing well, Alice.

97
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,613
[Alice] My… My hands are tied.
I'm crying. [breath shaking]

98
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,990
[sinister music continues]

99
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,243
[Isla] What are you feeling, Alice?

100
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,915
How does your body feel in that space?

101
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,127
[Alice] I'm scared.

102
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,130
[crying] Terrified.

103
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,966
[crying]

104
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,968
[Isla] Okay, Alice. Relax.

[crying]

106
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,557
[Isla] Let your feelings stay with you.

[eerie music continues]

108
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,811
Know that I am here.

109
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,105
Now.

110
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,276
With me. Safe.

- [crying]

112
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,701
[Isla] What comes next?

113
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:38,499
There's… There's something.

114
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,710
There's someone.

115
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,130
There's… There's someone outside.

116
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,132
[footsteps approaching]

117
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,758
[Isla] It's okay, Alice.

118
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,553
Take your time.

- [crying]
- [footsteps approaching]

120
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,182
What's out there?

121
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,268
I can hear, footsteps.

122
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:02,315
- [sinister music continues]
- [footsteps]

123
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,108
I feel so small.

124
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,696
[young Alice crying] <i>Mama! Papa!</i>

125
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,656

- [distorted noises]
- [crying]

128
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,082
- [distorted noises]
- [young Alice screams] <i>No!</i>

129
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,293
I can't take it. I can't take it!

130
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:26,088
[music becomes somber]

131
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,509
- I can't. [sniffling]
- Breathe, Alice.

132
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,763
[breathing deeply]

133
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,479
[somber music continues]

134
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,397
That wasn't me now. [sniffles]

135
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,944
That was the kid. She was crying.

136
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,451
Does that mean it was really me?
Was that me when I was a child?

137
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,537
[somber music continues]

138
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,873
I, I don't know what's the truth anymore.

139
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,793
[crying]

140
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,044
Did something--

141
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,381
Did something really
happen to me when I was a kid?

142
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,050
Is that why I couldn't remember anything

143
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,636
from when I was five years old? [cries]

144
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:18,599
Did I bury it all?
Did I bury it all away from my memory?

145
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,309
I don't know…

146
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,687
[Alice sighs deeply]

147
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,898
And why do I blame it all on Scott?

148
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,984
Why?

149
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,904
Was I wrong this whole time?

150
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,032
Oh my gosh! [crying]

151
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,160
Alice, breathe with me.

152
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,289
- Inhale.
- [inhales sharply]

153
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,541
- [exhales shakily]
- Exhale.

154
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,253
- [blows steadily]
- Inhale.

155
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,172
[inhales deeply]

156
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,382
Exhale.

157
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,843
[exhales heavily]

158
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,013
You are not alone.

159
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,266
[somber music continues]

160
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,269
We have uncovered important matters today.

161
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,481
There are two different
timelines in your memory.

162
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,483
And that's okay.

163
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,445
Memories don't come back in order.

164
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,698
You don't need to have
everything figured out now.

165
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:20,536
The important thing is
that you were brave enough to face it.

166
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:26,667
We'll work through it one step at a time.

167
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,128
Okay.

168
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,842
[somber music fades]

169
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,887
[phone ringing]

170
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,388
[Mel sighs]

171
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,349
Chloe, go on ahead.

172
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,101
- I just have to take this call.
- Alright, Auntie.

173
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,438
[phone ringing]

174
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,317
- Jo?
- Ma'am.

175
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,487
I really can't find any
videos in Sir Anton's files.

176
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:01,285
[ominous music plays, fades]

177
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,372
Didn't we agree not to say anything?

178
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,251
I know, but she accused
me of bad-mouthing Angelo.

179
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,380
It just suddenly came out of my mouth.

180
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,760
Besides, in all honesty,
I'm getting worried for Liezel.

181
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,887
What if our suspicions are right?

182
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,847
She might become the next victim.

183
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,476
But what if Angelo did do this to you?

184
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,854
What if Liezel told him what you said,
that's why he attacked you?

185
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,607
What if…
What if I hadn't arrived in time?

186
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,526
- Maybe--
- Love. Love…

187
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,196
I'm fine. Look at me, I'm okay.

188
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,699
But that doesn't mean it's over.
This could happen again.

189
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,453
If you don't want to tell
the police, let's just tell Erica.

190
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,913
What?

191
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,957
Wasn't she the one
who told you about the letter?

192
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,044
Then tell her your suspicions
that Angelo might have been

193
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,047
Louisa's secret boyfriend,
that he possibly killed her.

194
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,591
I don't know.
Leave the investigation's up to her.

195
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,135
- No.
- She could even link it

196
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,010
to your missing student.

197
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:00,970
No!

198
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,680
What do you mean, no?!

199
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,057
We can't do that!
We're still not sure about everything.

200
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,563
[claps] But we can be sure
that Erica will be fair and careful.

201
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,108
Once this starts, there's no turning back.

202
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,734
What if we're wrong?

203
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,028
Liezel and Angelo's lives will be ruined.

204
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,113
Are you prepared for that?

205
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,241
What if… What if you and Chloe get hurt?

206
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,203
I'm not prepared for that.

207
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:31,500
[somber music playing]

208
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,670
Hey. I brought you soup.

209
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,172
Thank you.

210
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,258
Your doctor said it's okay to eat.

211
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,927
Ryan, there's also
coffee here if you want.

212
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,391
I'll go back to the auto repair shop.

213
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,143
The mechanic might be there now.

214
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,353
- I'll drop Chloe off at school, too.
- [music fades]

215
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,608
Pa, I want to look after Mama.

216
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,319
It's okay, Chloe. Go to school.

217
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,155
Your Auntie Mel's here anyway.
She'll look after me.

218
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,830
Let's go, Chloe.

219
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,665
- We'll get going, Mel.
- Take care.

220
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,132
[Mel sighs deeply]

221
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,472
You don't think Scott did this, do you?

222
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,935
I mean, you were
kinda hard on him last time.

223
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,896
And we even forbade him from seeing Alice.

224
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:39,443
[unsettling music playing]

225
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,911
[music fades]

226
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,581
Chloe.

227
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,334
Don't worry.

228
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,336
I'll take care of your mom, alright?

229
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,089
Are you okay?

230
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,884
Pa…

231
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,470
When Mama and her friends saw Louisa

232
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,014
on the night she died,

233
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,392
was that scary?

234
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,853
[Ryan sighs] In your mother's stories,

235
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,565
yes.

236
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:22,319
But describing it as scary seems wrong.

237
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,114
Because that's nothing compared to

238
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,074
what your mom and
her friends went through.

239
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,409
Scary is too weak of a word.

240
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,788
When I first found out…

241
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,917
how they found Louisa's body,

242
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,795
and everything they went through,

243
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,506
it was like, they're cool!

244
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,300
They're so fierce.

245
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,344
[sniffles] What the sigma.

246
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,389
But I didn't really
understand it at the time.

247
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,808
[exhales shakily]

248
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,226
Mama said that,

249
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,563
I was thinking of
it just like any other story.

250
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,940
[melancholic music playing]

251
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,359
But for her and her friends…

252
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,195
that story's absolutely true.

253
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,532
[melancholic music continues]

254
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:12,453
[crying, sniffling]

255
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,457
Mama's right. [sniffles]

256
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,794
When I saw Mama, lying on the ground

257
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,005
covered in blood,

258
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,341
that's when I realized

259
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,510
this isn't just a story.

260
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,432
[sniffles] I realized
how terrifying it really is.

261
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:38,854
- [crying]
- [melancholic music continues]

262
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:51,408
- [scraping]
- [music becomes unsettling]

263
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,706
[Ryan] Angelo!

264
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,125
Angelo! Come out of there!

265
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,794
[gate rattles]

266
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,128
Angelo!

267
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,797
[gate rattling]

268
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,090
Hey, Angelo!

269
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,884
[stirring music playing]

270
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,636
[gate clatters]

271
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,887
Angelo!

272
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,681
[gate clatters]

273
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,894
Beth's in the hospital.

274
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,188
- Did you do that to her?
- What do you mean?

275
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,731
Did you attack my wife?!

276
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,442
- [Angelo] Why would I do that?
- [Ryan] Just admit it!

277
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,695
- [bystander 1] Angelo, Ryan!
- You have the nerve to get mad

278
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,655
after what your wife did to my wife?

279
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,198
What about what you did to my wife?!

280
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,826
- [bystander 2] Hey, that's enough!
- [bystander 3] Stop it!

281
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,786
- [bystander 4] Stop it, you two!
- [bystander 3] Stop!

282
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,956
- [Ryan] Aah!
- [bystander 3] Stop it!

283
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,833
- [grunting]
- [bystander 3] Stop that!

284
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,835
- They're fighting!
- Stop it!

285
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,713
[bystander 5] Oh god,
someone stop them! Stop them!

286
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,172
- [bystander 3] Stop it!
- [grunting]

287
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,425
- Stop it.
- Agh!

288
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,676
- [music ends]
- [Alice sighs deeply]

289
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,518
It's a good thing Ryan
and Chloe arrived in time.

290
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,525
Do you have any idea
who could have done this?

291
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,655
Um…

292
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,949
Alice, do you know where Scott is?

293
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,617
[uneasy music playing]

294
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,077
Why do you ask?

295
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,043
Well, we think it could be him, Alice.

296
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,421
Beth wasn't very nice
to him the last time, remember?

297
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,923
[Alice scoffs] Scott?

298
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,010
I-- Why would he…

299
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,639
Well, if your speculations
about him are correct,

300
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,269
then, most probably,
he's capable of doing this too. Right?

301
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:46,273
[uneasy music continues]

302
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:51,445
[phone ringing]

303
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,365
Love?

304

[investigator]<i> Sir,</i>
<i>ma'am is inside the hospital now.</i>

305
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:03,040
That Scott guy. Is he coming near Mel?

306
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,250
The foreigner husband?

307
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,460
<i>No, sir.</i>

308
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,342
I don't trust any of
her friends' husbands.

309
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,428
I don't trust my wife either.

310
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,973
Are you sure?

311
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,391
[investigator] <i>Yes, sir.</i>

312
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,560
She didn't go anywhere else?

313
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,146
It's just Alice and Beth?

314
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,732
Yes, sir, it's just them.

315
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,985
The condo that Mel went to in Manila,

316
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,281
I got the name of
her friend who lives there.

317
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,496
If Mel goes back
there or anywhere else in Manila,

318
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,249
tell me right away.

319
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,834
Alright, sir.

320
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:52,923

I'LL GIVE YOU A REASON TO COME HOME"

[tense music continues]

324
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,794
- [woman] Anton!
- [music fades]

325
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,382
Hey, what's going on with you and Mel?

326
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,050
Did you get into a fight?

327
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,510
Did she move out?

328
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,512
She's staying with a friend, right?

329
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,014
Uh…

330
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,684
No, it's… nothing serious.

331
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,519
[scoffs] OMG.

332
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,770
Something did happen.

333
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,230
Come on, tell me.

334
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,317
I'm sure you need someone to talk to.

335
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,906
[sighs]

336
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,994
We fought.

337
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,291
I want to start a family.

338
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,170
[melancholic music playing]

339
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,881
But you know her, career first.

340
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,299
[woman] Hmm.

341
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,842
Spotlight above all.

342
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,679
But of course,
I don't want to pressure her

343
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,431
to do something she doesn't want to do.

344
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,266
I just reminded her.

345
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,643
We had a deal.

346
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,312
Once she's settled with her career,

347
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,231
we'll have kids.

348
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,608
But when I ask her if,

349
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,445
she's ever going to stop wanting more,

350
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,572
she gets mad at me

351
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,659
and accuses me of being unsupportive.

352
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,703
[melancholic music continues]

353
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,080
Tsk. Shit.

354
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,123
I shouldn't have asked her that.

355

[music turns sinister]

356
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,629
I warned you, didn't I?

357
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,674
She's not a good match for you.

358
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,427
There's someone better for you.

359
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,682
[sinister music playing]

360
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,648
You do not choose who you fall for.

361
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,986
And I'm in love with her.

362
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,740
I'd forget everything for her.

363
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,953
Even if it's a dream
of mine to become a dad.

364
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:32,291
[sinister music continues]

365
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,845
[sinister music fades]

366
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,596
I'm filing a complaint!

367
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,683
- He attacked me in my home!
- You punched me first!

368
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,560
I just went there to ask something.

369
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,312
You made it a big deal.

370
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,188
So, I'm filing the complaint.

371
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,110
- Beth!
- [Beth] Ryan.

372
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,987
My love, what are you doing here?

373
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,406
I told you not to come here.

374
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,199
And you're still under observation.

375
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,492
She insisted.

376
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,494
Why did you do this to Ryan?

377
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,831
If you have something against me,
take it out on me, not on my husband!

378
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,500
He already did.
That's why you ended up in the hospital.

379
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,295
What are you accusing my husband of now?

380
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,589
Beth was attacked at the cemetery.

381
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,382
Thank goodness
there were no serious injuries.

382
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,550
And you're blaming me?

383
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,052
Do you have any evidence?

384
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:29,306
[unsettling music playing]

385
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,557
[Liezel] Beth!

386
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,851
Angelo did get mad
about what happened at church,

387
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:36,313
but why are you accusing him of
attacking you without any proof?

388
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,398
I thought we were friends.

389
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,442
Liezel, you know the reason.

390
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,361
You have your suspicions
about your husband, too.

391
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:48,158
[unsettling music continues]

392
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,663
Wait, hold on.

393
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,956
Everyone, calm down.

394
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,500
I don't understand.

395
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,834
Who's asking what?

396
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:02,631
[unsettling music continues]

397
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,681
Anton!

398
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,141
I'm going now.

399
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,227
Just hang in there, okay?

400
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,603
[music fades]

401
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,605
Yeah, trying.

402
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,691
Thanks for saying that.

403
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,943
By the way, are you free?

404
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,820
Do you want to have some coffee with Kat?

405
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,280
Actually, Tin should've been here too,

406
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,157
but she just came back from the States.

407
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,951
- Tin?
- Mm-hmm.

408
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,495
The one from Azur Residences?

409
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,498
- She's been in the US?
- Yeah.

410
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,624
She stayed for a month.

411
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,627
She's jet-lagged since
she just got home last night.

412
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,879
See you.

413
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,716
[ominous music playing]

414
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,230
- I'll get the car, love.
- Alright.

415
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,153
Are you sure?

416
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,779
You don't want to push
through with the complaint?

417
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,114
[music fades]

418
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:12,492
As Locsin said, I don't have any evidence.

419
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,495
All I saw were his shoes.

420
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,916
[Mel] Shouldn't they be
checking all of Angelo's shoes?

421
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,127
Isn't that what
the police should be doing?

422
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,629
Yeah, well, they won't do that.

423
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,465
You had your suspicions about Angelo,

424
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,719
but you let me think it was Scott?

425
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,263
[morose music playing]

426
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,056
[scoffs] At the hospital.

427
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,142
You said it could be Scott.

Alice.

429
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,062
That-- That was me, I, I said that.

430
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,440
But, still.

431
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,818
You never said
you were suspecting someone else.

432
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,238
You let me think
that it could be Scott, right?

433
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,244
Alice, you told us about Scott.

434
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,998
You can't blame us for
coming to our own conclusions.

435
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,585
And I already told you I don't
even know what's real anymore.

436
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,796
I don't know if I'm going crazy!

437
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,925
You know, it's possible
that I ruined my marriage

438
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,385
for something that's not even real.

439
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,804
Then you go and add to my confusion!

440
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,682
Do you even understand?
