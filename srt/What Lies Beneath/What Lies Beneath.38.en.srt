00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,544
<i>Attorney, what are the implications</i>

00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:05,338
<i>if the other half of</i>
<i>a couple filed for an annulment?</i>

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:08,383
<i>- Is there a prenup?</i>
<i>- What about domestic abuse?</i>

4
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:12,887
<i>That may fall under</i>
<i>emotional abuse, physical abuse,</i>

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,557
<i>habitual cruelty, or controlling behavior.</i>

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,353

<i>How, Edong?!</i>

12
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,073
<i>I love you so much, Lucas.</i>

13
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,158
<i>Edong!</i>

14
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,827
How much have we collected?

[tin can clinks]

16
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,213
- Should we move to another place?
- [plastic bottle crinkles]

17
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,423
Let's go.

[tense music continues]

22
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,521
[boy 1] Isn't that the escaped inmate?

23
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,107
- You're right.
- He's a murderer, right?

24
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,693
Let's get out of here, dude!

25
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,028
[grunts, body thuds]

26
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,280

29
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,039
Attorney!

30
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,714
You are unbelievable, Attorney.

31
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,384
Why are you coming at us so hard?
I thought we were friends.

32
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,928
Wow, friends?

33
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,472
I thought we were just using each other.

34
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,017
The case has been closed, Attorney.

35
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,519
We've found what's rotten in the system.

36
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,771
Usman's going straight to jail.

37
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,066
And it's only a matter of
time before Santiago's arrested.

38
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,612
I doubt you'll bring him in alive.

39
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,947
You don't want him to speak, right?

40
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,451
Congressman is right.

41
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,912
You should take it easy.

42
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,539
Careful, Attorney.

43
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,042
Stress can be dangerous.

44
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,296
Are you threatening me, Ayoc?

45
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,468
Because if you are,
then you really do have something to hide.

46
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,595
That's your interpretation, Attorney.

47
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,056
I'm only concerned for your well-being.

48
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,557
I wouldn't want you getting hurt.

49
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,642

Huh?

60
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,912
Why are you following her?

61
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,497
I'm harmless, sir.

62
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,832
Who are you?!

63
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,711
I work for Mr. Montenegro.

[unsettling music playing]

65
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,466
Ma'am, he asked me to keep an eye on you.

66
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,843
For your safety.

- Hey!

72
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,700
Um…

73
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,410
Were you able to buy what you needed?

74
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,078
Yeah!

75
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,997
Did you get to see your Aunt?

76
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,291
Yeah, I did!

77
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,876
- That's great.
- That's great.

No movement here yet,
but they're on standby.

82
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,606
Okay. Update me
as soon as anything changes.

83

Tsk! [sighs sharply]

85
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,071
They really want Edong dead.

86
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,114
Men! Let's go! Let's go!

87
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,993
[dramatic music continues]

88
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,372
I'll call you back.

89
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,749
Wait, why?

<i>Sir, they found Edong!</i>

94

Where?!

95
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,986
- [laughing]
- You are something else, bro.

96
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,155
For those who can still eat sweets,

97
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,657
- the cake's here!
- Wow!

98
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,283
- Wow!
- Can I have some?

99
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,493
That looks good!

100
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,745
Chloe and Joshua will love this!
Where are they?

101
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,997
They're inside, doing something.

102
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,542
You know how inseparable those two are.

103
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,168
- You got that right.
- [Liezel chuckles]

104
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,753
[man] Did you two
get pregnant at the same time

105
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,089
so your kids would be best friends?

106
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,550
- Now that's what you call friendship!
- [chuckles]

107
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,886
Of course not!

108
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,012
Come on.

109
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,181
Ryan and I just got a little carried away.

110
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,892
That's why we got
pregnant in our third year of college.

111
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,352
[chuckles, laughs]

112
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,313
- Then they followed our footsteps.
- Huh?

113
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,231
Exactly!

114
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,608
Good thing Pastor Samuel
didn't condemn you to hell.

115
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,027
- [laughter]
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

116
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,656
Look, her father and I agreed that

117
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,033
I could only propose
to her once she got her diploma.

118
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,702
- Mm…
- Right…

119
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,954
But she finished
her degree in just three years,

120
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,664
so I had to put a ring on her right away!

121
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,624
- Ah!
- [claps, chuckles]

122
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,960
So when I took my board exam,

123
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,712
someone was already kicking in my belly.

124
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,589
- Oh, boy!
- There you go!

125
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,633
Okay, that's all for
today's history class.

126
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,051
We'll be having a quiz tomorrow.

127
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,386
- [chuckles]
- Just kidding.

128
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,512
No, come on.

129
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,014
- Let's drink.
- Yes!

130
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,223
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

131
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,183

- [music fades]

134
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,414
Shut the door.

135
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,624
- Shut the door!
- Why?

136
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,593
What's going on?

137
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:35,973
I it looked up and both
Karen Davila and Maria Ressa are fine.

138
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,851
So why do you
look like your idols just died?

139
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,858
[uneasy music playing]

140
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,156

If he won't surrender,

148
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,454
our orders are to take him dead or alive.

149
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,206
- Are we clear?
- [in unison] Sir, yes, sir!

150

I miss you.

182
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,400
You had me followed?

183
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,319
Of course.

184
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,863
I want to protect you at all times, babe.

185
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,325
And I don't trust
anyone to keep an eye on you.

186
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,620
You're my dear sweet wife after all.

187
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,914
Bullshit, Anton!

188
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,834
Just be straight with me, okay?

189
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,629
Why don't you just ask me?
Just ask me, go!

190
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,924
Is there something I should ask you?

191
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,593
[scoffs]

192
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,180
You sure know there is.

193
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,098
You know exactly
what I'm talking about, Anton.

194
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,561
The guy you paid saw
me come out of a law office.

195
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,146
[Anton] <i>And?</i>

196
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,483
Is that supposed to be a problem?

197

[uneasy music playing]

198
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,404
<i>Am I the reason you went there?</i>

199
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,616
<i>I am confident that</i>

200
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,118
<i>you won't file a complaint against me.</i>

201
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,747
I am so nice to you. [chuckles softly]

202
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,751
I even let you
stay there with your friends.

203
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,837
<i>I don't think you're</i>
<i>planning anything else.</i>

204
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,634
Because, you know
what I hate the most, right?

205
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,636
[uneasy music fades]

206
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,681
I hate being blindsided and betrayed.

207
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,268
<i>Because when I get hurt…</i>

208
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,479
God knows what I might do.

209

[inhales sharply]

211
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,780
I just went there for
a consultation about a contract.

212
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,115
That's all.

213
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,117
[ominous music continues]

214
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,201
See?

215
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,996
No problem then.

216
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,540
I love you, babe.

217
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,003
<i>You know, I miss you so much that…</i>

218
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,090
I'm considering
accepting Alice's invitation.

219
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,801
So I can stay with you.

220
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,511
[scoffs]

221
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,389
As if you would.

222
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,516
<i>I know you, Anton.</i>

223
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,186
You can't stop yourself from hurting me.

224
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,733
You can fool other people,
but not my friends.

225
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,985
<i>So?</i>

226
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,906
You want to start with Beth, Anton?

227
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,868
[tense music playing]

228
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:15,289
So I guess you're just
going to have to miss me…

229
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,666
babe.

230
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,253

Sir.

245
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,606
Just keep following my wife.

246
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,776
Report her every move to me.

247
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:26,694
Okay?

248
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,195
Yes, sir.

[tense music fades]

250
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,704
Did you write that?

251
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,040
I don't think I heard them say that.

252
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,042
What language is this anyway?

253
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,712
Is it Bisaya? Look it up.

254
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,547
[tongue clicks]
Why not look it up yourself?

255

[keyboard clacking]

256
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,851
"Bana".

257
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,894
It means husband.

258
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,937
A man.

259
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,565

The cake's here. Do you guys want some?

262
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,611
Yes! Cake!

263
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,655
Come on.

[unsettling music continues]

265
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,997
We'll eat some later.

266
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,670
Why? What's keeping you guys busy?

267
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:31,175
Uh, just pictures of you and Mama
from when you were in high school.

268
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,719
I saw you there. You looked so young.

269
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,182
Do you really think
we were born looking this old?

270
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,767
Silly.

271
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,187
If you want to eat cake,
just come downstairs, okay?

272
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,521
Help yourselves.

273
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,692

[Ryan] Oh, please.

276
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,927
He has pulled all the foolish tricks.

277
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,512
[Angelo] Hey! That's not true.

278
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,763
[Ryan] Don't deny it.

279
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,600
Liezel is close to being a saint
for putting up with you.

280
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,228
Oh, do you remember this?

281
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,271
He just disappeared the whole day.

282
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,190
Auntie really panicked.

283
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,858
She made us all look for him.

284
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,652
[Ryan] Oh, turns out…

285
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,778
<i>Bana?</i>

286
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,988
<i>I never heard Louisa say that term.</i>

287
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,949
<i>And you think that's her boyfriend?</i>

288
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,493
<i>I mean, obviously, it was a love note.</i>

289
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:43,122
<i>But if she really had a boyfriend,</i>
<i>then why did she keep it a secret from us?</i>

290
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,583
<i>Why? Do you think he had anything to do</i>
<i>with what happened to Louisa?</i>

291
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,710
[Ryan] Surprise, he was hiking.

292
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,878
[laughter]

293
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,421
It was because…

294
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,508
we had had a fight.

295
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,968
I was heartbroken.

296
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,345
I thought we'd break up.
I needed some fresh air.

297
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,180
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

298
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,516
You wouldn't get it, guys.

299
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,768
You didn't have a girlfriend back then.

300
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,770
- [chuckles]
- [Angelo] That's it.

301
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,857
[man] Hold on. Do you still hike?

302
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,693
Man, haven't you heard?

303
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,361
He's out hiking snowy mountains now.

304
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,156
I was supposed to climb another summit.

305
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:22,119
But when I heard about
the things happening here,

306
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,453
I postponed it.

307
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,539
- [somber music playing]
- [man] That Edong is a jerk.

308
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,749
Even now, he's still causing trouble.

309
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,793
Isn't he satisfied with
what he has done in the past?

310
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,962
[man] Hold up, hold up.

311
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,381
Why is he so entwined with your circle?

312
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:38,093
Was it true that he and
Louisa fought over drugs?

313
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,056
So you're one of those
who spreads rumors around here, huh?

314
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,475
Louisa never used drugs.

315
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,104
Gosh. She's dead,
yet she still gets badmouthed.

316
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,606
Chill out, Beth.

317
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,692
We were just asking. We didn't know her.

318
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,943
Enough, man.
