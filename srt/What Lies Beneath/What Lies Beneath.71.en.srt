1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:01,918
<i>Ma'am Mel has just left.</i>

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,254
<i>She came from a condo here in Manila.</i>

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,715
<i>Did you lend your place</i>
<i>to Mel while you were away?</i>

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,717
<i>No. Why would I do that?</i>

5
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:11,803
<i>Mel, listen.</i>

6
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:13,555
<i>Never, ever go back to that house.</i>

7
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>Your husband is dangerous!</i>

8
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,935
<i>Who's the most dangerous</i>
<i>criminal you've faced, Attorney?</i>

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>Was it Edong Santiago?</i>

10
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,397
[guard]<i> Sir, someone left this for you.</i>

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,065
[Mel]<i> What are you doing here?</i>

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>Let's go home.</i> [grunts]

13
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:27,986
[Beth] <i>Let go of her!</i>

14
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,529
- [thwacks]
<i>- Ah!</i>

15
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,822
- [blows land]
- [both grunting]

16
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,240
[coughing]

17
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,867
- [grunts]
- [groans] <i>Ah!</i>

18
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:34,784
[grunts]<i> Argh!</i>

19
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,411
[bones cracking]

20
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,996
[vase shatters]

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,955
[body thuds]

22
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,253
[Mel crying]

23
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:54,012
[theme music playing]

24
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,957
[tense music playing]

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,375
[Erica]<i> He pushed me…</i>

26
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,502
<i>I couldn't breathe.</i>

27
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,670
[camera shutter clicking]

28
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,221
[tense music continues]

29
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,849
[Beth]<i> I tried pulling</i>
<i>him away from Erica,</i>

30
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,226
<i>but he pushed me, so I hit my head.</i>

31
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,730
[camera shutter clicking]

32
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,150
[Beth]<i> Before Erica,</i>
<i>I saw him strangling Mel.</i>

33
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,154
<i>I found them like that.</i>
<i>I ran to help my friend.</i>

34
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,823
[doctor] Multiple contusions to the skull.

35
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,409
- [music fades]
- How are you feeling now?

36
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,994
- [camera shutter clicking]
- I feel…

37
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,413
dizzy and a bit nauseous.

38
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,457
Patients reports dizziness and nausea.

39
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,001
[camera shutter clicking]

40
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,961
[Alice] I should've
checked on them earlier.

41
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,507
When I saw him strangling Erica…

42
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,426
[uneasy music playing]

43
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,677
I froze.

44
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,890
She almost died and I just stood there.

45
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,353
You came, and you did something.

46
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,231
I'm safe because of you.

47
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,735
[uneasy music continues]

48
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,029
You were the one
who hit his head with a vase?

49
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,740
I got scared that he might kill Erica.

50
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,867
[camera shutter clicking]

51
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,036
[ominous music playing]

52
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,162
[camera shutter clicking]

53
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,630
- [camera shutter clicks]
- [groans]

54
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,756
[Anton breathing heavily]

55
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,841
[ominous music continues]

56
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,552
[Erica] Please assign
police officers outside his room.

57
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,095
He must not be allowed to leave.

58
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,555
There already are, Attorney.

59
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,307
He's under hospital arrest.

60
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,351
He can't just leave easily.

61
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,728
He should be sent straight to jail.

62
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,398
He still has a right to medical attention,
even when he's under arrest.

63
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,276
We'll prepare our sworn statements,

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,154
tomorrow morning we'll file the complaints
with the prosecutor

65
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,074
We're looking at four cases here.

66
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,994
For me, Mel,
and Beth: serious physical injuries.

67
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,706
For me and Mel: frustrated homicide.

68
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,169
For Mel: grave coercion and violation

69
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,463
of the Anti-Violence Against Women
and Children Act.

70
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,174
[Locsin] I'll handle securing
everything that needs to be secured.

71
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,970
I'll make sure Anton Montenegro
cannot leave the hospital

72
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,471
without a police escort.

73
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,555
Thanks.

74
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,307
Thank you.

75
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,643
Excuse me.

76
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,561
- [unsettling music playing]
- [footsteps retreating]

77
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,688
[sighs heavily]

78
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,905
How long has he been hurting you?

79
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,826
[unsettling music continues]

80
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,716
[music fades]

81
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,177
[doctor] The CT scan shows
there's no fracture or bleeding.

82
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,431
But we still need to keep you here
for a few days for observation.

83
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,184
- Okay, Doc.
- I'll go ahead.

84
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,602
Thank you.

85
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,147
[exhales heavily]

86
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,233
Have you been in touch with your lawyer?

87
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,484
This is a mis--

88
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,111
It's a mistake!

89
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,322
I already told you,
you arrested the wrong person.

90
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,449
I'm the victim here. Don't you see?

91
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,659
They all ganged up on me.
Four against one!

92
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,786
Once you have your own legal counsel,

93
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,371
we can take your statement.

94
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,540
But since you don't have one yet…

95
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,834
That's Officer Medina.

96
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,461
He'll be keeping an eye on you

97
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,962
while you're under hospital arrest.

98
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,505
Bro…

99
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,925
Bro, please. You have to believe me.

100
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,094
I'm the victim here.

101
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,971
[dramatic music playing]

102
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,056
Please?

103
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,683
- [Erica] <i>For a long time</i>…
- [music fades]

104
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,101
Since the very beginning?

105
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,270
[melancholic music playing]

106
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,354
[Alice] Mel.

107
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,067
Is that true?

108
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,242
[melancholic music continues]

109
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,453
[Mel] <i>Who needs a big house, Beth?</i>

110
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,289
<i>Just look at what you,</i>
<i>Ryan, and Chloe have.</i>

111
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,416
<i>I bet you're proud and happy.</i>

112
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,794
[Beth]<i> So you punched Anton?</i>

113
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,587
[Mel]<i> We joke around. A lot.</i>

114
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,466
<i>And sometimes,</i>
<i>it becomes a little too playful.</i>

115
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,759
<i>A little too physical.</i>

116
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,803
[melancholic music continues]

117
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,846
All the stories coming out

118
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,808
about you beating him up,

119
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,476
about you not wanting to have kids…

120
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,436
They're not true, are they?

121
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,440
He's been gaslighting
everyone to make you look bad.

122
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,026
And you endured all that, Mel?

123
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,821
Why didn't you leave him sooner?

124
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,824
Because I've been handling it, okay?

125
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,992
- [Mel crying quietly]
- [somber music playing]

126
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,412
And up until earlier, I was handling it.
I can deal with it.

127
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,165
I can take him, okay?

128
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,000
[breathing sharply]

129
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,921
I have to.

130
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,675
[somber music continues]

131
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,010
Because I have a lot to lose.

132
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,056
And you know people can be so cruel.

133
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,059
Just because someone is
good-looking, rich, charming…

134
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,894
A man.

135
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,357
They always seem
to get a free pass, you know?

136
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,317
People always listen to them,

137
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,071
people always believe
every word they say. But us?

138
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,115
It seems like it's always our fault.

139
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,285
Women always end up being the bad guys.

140
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,911
We're always the villains.

141
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:38,749
[somber music continues, fades]

142
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,376
[cries]

143
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,046
[voice breaks] And I worked
so hard for my career, you know?

144
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,342
People look up to me.

145
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,636
They respect…

146
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,263
They respect me.

147
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,599
I don't want to lose that.

148
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,727
I don't want my life
ruined just because of Anton.

149
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,061
Because…

150
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,981
He's more than capable of doing that.

151
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,858
[somber music continues]

152
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,235
[Erica] That's why
you wanted to stay with Alice.

153
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,906
Why you didn't want to go home.

154
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,201
[cries, breathes shakily]

155
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,744
You were trying to leave him.

156
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,079
[sniffles]

157
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,332
Was he threatening you?

158
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,085
[somber music continues]

159
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,130
So this isn't the first
time this has happened.

160
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,927
Mel.

161
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,553
Talk to us.

162
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,014
[crying quietly]

163
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,310
Can you stop looking at me like that?

164
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,813
- I'm not a victim!
- [Erica inhales sharply]

165
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,024
I don't need your pity!

166
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,612
[Alice] Is that why you didn't tell us?

167
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,240
Because you thought
we would judge you, Mel?

168
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,075
But why?

169
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,327
- We're your friends.
- Oh, really?

170
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,871
We're friends?

171
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,834
Then why didn't you tell us, Alice
you were going through something?

172
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,963
You kept a secret from us
for the same reasons, didn't you?

173
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,468
[young Alice]<i> Friends don't</i>
<i>keep secrets from each other!</i>

174
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,555
[somber music continues]

175
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,806
You're right.

176
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,729
I guess we're not
the friends we used to be.

177
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,025
And we haven't been for quite some time.

178
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:34,824
[somber music continues]

179
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,205
It doesn't matter
if we're the same as before,

180
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,584
or how many times you tried
to leave that demon of a husband.

181
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,253
What matters is
that you're not going back to him.

182
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,548
Right?

183
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:54,260
[somber music continues]

184
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,139
[cries quietly]

185
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,726
It's over.

186
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,020
[sighs in relief]

187
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,396
[Erica] For him.

188
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,024
But not for you.

189
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,944
I will help you break
free from Anton safely

190
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,780
and get what is rightfully yours.

191
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:20,244
I won't let him do
to you what he said he'd do.

192
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,873
[somber music continues]

193

195
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,049
Love.

196
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,675
What happened to you?

197
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,428
- Are you okay?
- It's nothing. Just scratches.

198
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,598
"Just scratches?" Your old
wound haven't even healed yet.

199
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,356
Wow. Look at you.

200
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,815
All for one, one for all?

201
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,567
Is that still your motto?

202
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,986
Together forever? Even in fights?

203
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,658
Mel, is what Miss Vangie said true?

204
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,451
She said your husband did this.

205
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,205
It's hard to believe
blabbermouths like her.

206
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,123
[Beth] Well, for once, she's right.

209
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,468
What happened to you,
my sweet, sweet boy?!

210
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,552
[gasps]

211
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,475
What kind of room is this?

212
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,852
They're expecting you to stay here

213
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,521
while you're being held?

214
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,399
I'll have you transferred
to a bigger room. Okay?

215
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,609
I'm so sorry, Ma.

216
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,404
- No.
- Mel is determined to ruin me.

217
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,157
She and her friends are going
to press charges against me, Ma.

218
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,158
What?!

219
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,370
I'm sorry you're
getting dragged into this.

220
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,621
Don't worry.

221
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:50,167
That's why Atty.
Atillero and I are here to fix this.

222
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,671
I will not let that woman ruin your name!

223
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,214
You won't go to jail.

224
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,049
I promise you.

225
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,093
I always take care of everything.

226
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,594
Right?

227
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,555
Thanks, Ma.

228
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,142

- [uneasy music continues]

229
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,436
Hello?

230
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,938
Oh, Secretary Joy.

231
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,565
Thank you for returning my call.

232
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:14,942
Yes.

233
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,277
[music fades]

234
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,488
Anton, tomorrow
we will hold a media conference

235
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,699
so you can air your side of the story

236
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,786
and so we can show
everyone the extent of your injuries.

237
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,455
Do you think they'll allow it?

238
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,457
It's well within your rights.

239
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,333
They can't stop you.

240
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,835
And if they try,

241
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,753
we'll file an injunction against them.

242
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,132
Besides, your mom's
connection to the Justice Department

243
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,343
will make sure no one stands in our way.

244
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:46,432
[sinister music playing]

00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,100
[music fades]

246
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,856
[Lucas] Are you okay?

247
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,402
Someone called Marco.
I insisted on coming with him.

248
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,908
[pensive music playing]

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,376
Is he the one who did this to you?

250
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:21,300
[pensive music continues]

251
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,259
Sorry.

252
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:29,433
The doctor said the swelling
will subside after a few days.

253
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,399
[Erica] Mel.

254
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,652
Are you okay?

255
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,695
[Lucas] What did he do to you?

256
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,282
He hit my head on the wall repeatedly.

257
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,035
I was worried

258
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,455
that something bad might happen to you.

259
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,792
That's what I've been
worried about since the beginning.

260
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:59,380
[pensive music swells]

261
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,592
[Lucas exhales heavily]

262
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,971
Erica.

263
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,895
[music fades]

264
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,106
[Alice sighs]
Maybe I should've stayed with them.

265
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,441
Your friends told you it was fine.

266
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,986
And you're better
off resting here at home.

267
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,739
But are you sure you're okay?

268
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,617
I froze.

269
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,203
The night that Louisa died,
I froze, Scott.

270
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,624
And that happened again
earlier when Anton was choking Erica.

271
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,295
I hate it. I hate it.

272
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,506
It makes me feel so weak.
I'm such a coward.

273
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,966
Hey. Hey.

274
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,801
You're not a coward.

275
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,845
You saved Erica.

276
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,390
I blame this all on him too.

277
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,058
Him?

278
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,936
Whoever took me when I was five.

279

[somber music playing]

280
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,483
All of this… the trauma, the nightmares,

281
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,320
all of this came out of that.

282
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,404
Right?

283
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,658
I am like this because of that.

284
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,411
[sniffles]

285
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,164
I need to find him, Scott.

286
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,625
I need to know what happened.

287
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,669
You will.

288
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,546
You will.

289
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,842
[music becomes unsettling]

290
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,803
- Why didn't you call me?
- [music fades]

291
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,765
I didn't want to bother you.

292
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,396
You almost died,
and you didn't want to bother me?

293
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,648
What kind of an excuse is that?

294
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,109
Look.

295
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,528
Our relationship's
been a bit complicated lately.

296
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,033
I didn't want to bother
you with my personal problems.

297
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,454
[sighs heavily]

298
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,624
"Personal problems."

299
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,961
Erica, even if you stab me,

300
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,172
even if you shoot me,
I still want to know.

301
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,049
What if something worse happened to you

302
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,760
and you didn't tell me,
how do you think I'd feel?

303
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,596
If you were in my position,
you'd get mad too, right?

304
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,226
[soft music playing]

305
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,310
You're right.

306
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,437
Sorry.

307
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,692
No matter what happens,

308
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,780
Even if you just bumped
your finger on a rock or whatevs,

309
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,324
call me.

310
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,828
"Whatevs"?

311
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,162
Whatevs.

[soft music continues]

313
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,421
That's what the woman
who works in our eatery always says.

[Erica chuckles]

315
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,716
It's rubbed off on me. It's your fault!

316
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,343
You're such a troublemaker. Tch.

317
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,346
I don't think "whatevs" suits you.

318
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,140
- Obviously.
- [laughs]

319
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,850
But seriously,

320
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,519
call me.

[soft music continues]

322
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,737
Has Lucas mentioned
anything about Mel to you?

323
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,365
No. Why?

324
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,452
It seemed like he already knew

325
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,454
that Anton had been abusing Mel.

don't worry about me, okay?

334
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,500

<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Montenegro,</i>

women don't attack
other people without any reason.

00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,210
[Anton]<i> You're right.</i>

361
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,045
<i>There was a reason.</i>

362
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,591
<i>I confronted my wife</i>

363
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,844
<i>because I found out</i>

364
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,888
<i>that she had an affair.</i>

365
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,474
[dramatic music continues]

366
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,186
Let's go to the Women
and Children Protection desk.

367
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,523
[Anton]<i> But she got mad instead.</i>

368
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,942
<i>She suddenly started hitting me.</i>

369
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,528
<i>And when her friends saw us,</i>

370
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,864
she acted like I was the one hitting her.

371
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,241
So her friends attacked me, too.

372
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,744
They ganged up on him?

373
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,245
Who did Mel have an affair with?

374
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,663
Do you have proof?

375
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,749
Uh…

376
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,878
<i>He's a businessman.</i>

377
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,547
[reporter]<i> What business man?</i>

378
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,426
<i>Lucas Santiago.</i>

379
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:27,100
[dramatic music continues, fades]

380
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,061
[Lucas] Ma.

381
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,064
When I last visited you…

382
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,359
I thought everything was going to be okay.

383
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,570
I thought we would be able to start again.

384
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,615
I thought I could save Edong.

385
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:45,953
[melancholic music playing]

386
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,373
[sniffles]

387
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,751
I couldn't do it, Ma.

388
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,256
Please forgive me.

389
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,509
I couldn't do it.

390
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,932
[Anton breathing heavily]

391
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,811
<i>I've always loved Mel.</i>

392
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,607
<i>Even when the truth came out</i>

393
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,651
<i>that she was physically abusing me…</i>

394
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,279
[dramatic music resumes]

395
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,072
<i>I still stayed with her.</i>

396
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,325
<i>And even now,</i>

397
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,412
<i>after everything that has happened,</i>

398
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,373
<i>I still love Mel.</i>

399
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,583
My gosh, how embarrassing!

400
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,877
People from Amurao are on the news again.

401
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,546
[Lorna] What's more embarrassing is that

402
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,508
they're tolerating
the behavior of Dr. Barrera's daughter.

403
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,261
Look, it's humiliating.

404
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,929
- [Anton]<i> She was physically…</i>
- [Ryan] Uh…

405
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,681
- Miss Lorna.
- [Lorna] Oh.

406
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,433
What's going on there?

407
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,018
My goodness, Ryan,

408
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,437
your wife and her friends

409
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,565
were mentioned in
Anton Montenegro's interview.

410
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,899
Can I see?

411
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,693
- [Anton]<i> I love Mel.</i>
- [Lorna] Sure.

412
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,071
[Anton]<i> But I've been silent</i>

413
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,240
<i>way too long.</i>

414
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,326
What's wrong?

415
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,660
[Anton] <i>Because I wanted to hope…</i>

416
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,870
[Ryan] Look.

417
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,164
<i>…that we can still fix our marriage.</i>

418
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,041
- [camera shutter clicking]
<i>- But…</i>

419
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,251
- [camera shutter clicking]
- [inhales deeply]

420
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,337
<i>I was probably wrong for doing that.</i>

421
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,506
- [camera shutter clicking]
- [fake sobbing]

422
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,717
[camera shutter clicking]

423
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,094
[inhales, breath quivers]

424
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,347
[camera shutter clicking]

425
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,683
[sniffles]

426
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:36,104
[dramatic music intensifies]

427
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,691
[music becomes foreboding]

428
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,109
[camera shutter clicking]

429
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,652
[sniffles]

430
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,659
We need to go.

431
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:54,664
[foreboding music continues]

432
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:09,221
[foreboding music continues]

433
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,390
[cackling]

434
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:17,771
[laughing manically]

435
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,240
[laughing manically]

436
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,783
[Beth] <i>It was Lucas, Mel?</i>

437
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,910
<i>He made me feel protected.</i>

438
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,079
[Beth] <i>Did it ever occur</i>
<i>to you that he might just be using you?</i>

439
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:37,082
<i>Don't talk about us</i>
<i>like we're some dirty little secret</i>

440
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,836
<i>because he was the one</i>
<i>beautiful thing that saved me!</i>

441
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,921
<i>What did you tell him</i>
<i>about what happened before?</i>

442
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,424
<i>Beth, it wasn't entirely our fault,</i>
<i>but we're also to blame,</i>

443
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,009
<i>and I think it's time to admit that.</i>

444
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,011
<i>We only said</i>
<i>what everyone already believed!</i>

445
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,513
<i>So you finally admit it. You lied!</i>

446
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,431
<i>So many lives have been ruined</i>

447
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,517
<i>because of the first one you destroyed!</i>
