- [Liezel] Partner!
- [chuckles]

Partner!

Partner, what's that?

29
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,007
Tsk. I told you that
we don't need this, remember?

30
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,134
Our cooking range is still working.

31
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,136
But, Ma, this one is bigger.

32
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,346
[Angelo] That's right, partner.

33
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,388
Think about it.

34
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,726
You can bake and cook anything you want

35
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,645

36
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,980

[clicks mouth] Well, it's here already.

39
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,781
It'd be a hassle to return it, right?

40
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,450
- You two.
- Alright. Let's set it up.

41
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,410
- Now? Okay then.
- Help me. It's heavy. [grunts]

42
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,746
This range is huge, partner.

43
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,624
I'm excited about what you'll cook.

Hey.

52
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,452
Chloe and I can now bake with this.

53
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,204
Oh. Wow!

54
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,542
Yeah. I heard you guys earlier.

55
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,168
You were here?

56
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,422
Yeah.

57
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,466
So, the noise I heard earlier was you.

60

- I know.
- Ryan will surely like it.

61
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,395
These two are really something.

62
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,440
You should bring Ryan here.
We'll drink and have appetizers.

63
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,733
- [Angelo laughs]
- Silly!

64
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,067
Let's have some snacks.

65
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,320
- You take care of that, okay?
- Let's set this up.

66
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,196
Come on, Beth. Let's eat.

67
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,448
Here's the juice.

Ma, did you know?

71
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,962
Did you know that he was coming?

72
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,005
[Susan] <i>No.</i>

73
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,924
That's why I called. I was surprised too.

74
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,344
Scott just posted
a photo of him with Seth.

75
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,013
What?

Hello!

83
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,212
I know you.

84
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,714
You're Mommy's friend, right?

85
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,467
You have something on your face.

86
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,053
Where's your mom?

87
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,846
I'm with my daddy.

[music fades]

89
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,642
Hey, I'm sorry. He ran off from me.

90
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,813
Buddy, remember?

91
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,482
No talking to strangers.

92
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,943
She's not a stranger, Daddy.

93
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,903
She's Mommy's friend.

94
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,988
You're… Alice's husband?

95
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,699
Yeah. You do know her.

96
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,743
Yeah. We used to be…

97
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,370
[pensive music playing]

98
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,789
We were classmates in high school.

99

[panting] Babe! Babe!

100
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,835

Alice.

104
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,219
Is something wrong?

[unsettling music continues]

106
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,020

[unsettling music fades]

108
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,495
- I'll see you on Monday, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,039
I wanted to invite
you to shop at the thrift store,

110
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,333
but it seems
you can't be disturbed right now.

111
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,085
Angelo might get mad at me.

[uneasy music playing]

113
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,924
I hope they find Bianca soon.

114
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,969
I feel bad for her family.

115
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,805
[uneasy music continues]

116
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,056
I know.

117
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,976
Who is she? What happened?

118
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,150
She's one of
our students who has gone missing.

119
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:08,529
They're not sure if
she ran away or got kidnapped.

120
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,990
Is that so?

121
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,953
[sighs] I hope they find her soon.

122
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,789
Partner.

123
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,459
We should tell Joshua to be more careful.

124
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,961
Yeah, I know.

125
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,217
[uneasy music continues]

126
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,345
Anyway, I'll go now.

127
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,263
Okay. Take care.

128
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,057
- See you.
- Okay.

129
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,769
[music fades]

130
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,729
It's raining. Careful.

131
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,316
Uh… You guys go ahead. I'll follow.

132
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,027
But please don't leave.

133
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,616
Are you sure you're okay?

134
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,326
[Scott] Alright,
just let me open the door.

135
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,328
Yeah. Why-- Why wouldn't I?

136
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,541
Are you going back to the US?

137
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,917
Is that why he's here?

138
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,086
- [car door closes]
- [Alice] Um…

139
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,631
We're staying.

140
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,632
Um…

141
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,425
He's just visiting.

142
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,927
He'll go back there first.

143
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,973
[tense music playing, fades]

144
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,724
Um… Alice…

145
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,434
About what happened the other night…

146
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,602
Oh. No.

147
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,312
It's okay.

148
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,524
I understand.

149
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,280
I can't imagine how difficult
it was for you to feel that way.

150
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,614
It must have been hard.

151
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,158
You have to let it out somehow.

152
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,662
[tense music continues]

153
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,666
I guess that's also why I came to see you.

154
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,669
I wanted to tell you a lot of things.

155
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,089
And I was told that,

156
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,134
repressing emotions isn't a good thing.

157
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,802
So…

158
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,513
I've been trying my best…

159
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,224
to handle my emotions.

160
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,352
So, don't worry.

161
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,812
I won't hold it against you.

162
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:11,027
[pensive music playing]

163
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,653
Anyway, I…

164
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,780
I have to go.

165
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,742
Alice.

166
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,288
Despite everything that happened…

167
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,751
I hope you know
that I will always wish you well.

168
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,004
I hope you know that.

169
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,424
[gloomy music continues]

170
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,929
I know.

00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,016
[pensive music continues]

172
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,065
Erica!

[music fades]

174
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,532
Ma'am, sir, you're back!

175
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,950
Hi, Rose. Hi there.

176
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,120
Nanny Rose, we had ice cream!

177
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,205
Wow!

178
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,666
Rose, can you help me for a bit?

179
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,459
We need to give Seth a bath.

180
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,877
Okay. Come, baby.

181
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,213
Let's go upstairs so you can take a bath.

182
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,340
Alice, can we just talk, please?

183
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,425
- Ugh!
- [Mel] My god!

184
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,927
Scott!

185
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,304
Is that really you?

186
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,931
[hesitates awkwardly] Hi.

187
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,808
- How are you?
- I'm fine, Mel.

188
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,937
Alice, why didn't
you tell me Scott was coming?

189
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,313
Wait.

190
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,232
Unless this is a surprise.

191
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,526
Oh my god! You're so sweet!

192
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,611
- You've got a sweet husband!
- [chuckles]

193
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,029
[Mel chuckles]

194
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,824
Well, maybe I can
leave you two to catch up.

195
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,617
I just need to…

196
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,245
- …give Seth a bath.
- Yeah, okay. I got Scott. Come.

197
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,705
How are you? How are your parents?

198
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,249
They're fine.

199
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,376
[overlapping chatter]

200
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,460
[plate thuds]

201
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,714
Thank you for coming, Erica.

202
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,427
I know you're busy but,

203
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,804
I have many questions for you.

204
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,643
Beth and Mel said something.

205
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,980
They said Mama doesn't like you.

206
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,731
But…

207
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,776
That's not true, right?

208
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,033
Why don't you ask your mother?

209
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,702
[chuckles softly]

210
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,580
Because Mama--

211
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,167
I mean, you know her,
she's not the type to talk about you.

212
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,381
Didn't you ever ask why?

213
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,512
It's good you called me.

214
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,266
So I can clear things up
and tell you what's really true.

215
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,813
Your mother has a deep hatred towards me.

216
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,982
[sullen music playing]

217
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,443
Not once did she ever
treat me like a real daughter.

218
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,530
What do you mean, Erica?

219
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,909
- Mama's not like that.
- She let me live in her house,

220
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,952
fed me,

221
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,246
but that's all it ever was.

222
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,918
Didn't you ever wonder
why I ended up in Manila?

223
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,712
Because she told me

224
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,966
not to show myself
to her again if I continued studying.

225
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,220
Erica…

226
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,015
Didn't you two fight
because you wanted to study in Manila,

227
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,975
but Mama wanted you to stay in Amurao?

228
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,770
So you wouldn't have to be far from her?

229
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,772
[snickers] That's what she told you?

230
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,024
Erica, Mama isn't like that.

231
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,860
Maybe you two just
misunderstood each other.

232
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,490
Just because she was a good mother to you,

233
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,575
doesn't mean she was the same to me.

234
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,996
That's what I want
to explain and make clear to you.

235
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,500
That's why I agreed to meet you.

236
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,752
[sullen music continues]

237
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,088
You don't need to message me anymore.

238
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,799
We don't need to have any connection.

239
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,469
Whatever your mother and I had before,

240
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,804
it's long gone.

241
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,641
I have nothing to do with your family.

242
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,769
Why are you saying all this?

243
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,938
And why do you keep repeating it?

244
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,107
"Your mother… Your mother…"

245
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,567
She's your mother too, Erica!

246
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,027
I've said it again and
again but you still don't get it!

247
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,031
She was never a mother to me!

248
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,617
[bag zips]

249
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,792
[door opens, closes]

250
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,588
[music fades]

251
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,299
[exhales]

252
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,057
[sighs]

253
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,646
Come on.

254
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,148
It's time to take a bath.

255
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,482
You stink.

256
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,152
[sniffs]

257
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,740
No, I don't!

258
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,533
Let's go.

259
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,954
[sighs heavily]

260
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,124
[breathes deeply]

261
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:21,879
[unsettling music playing]

262
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:44,276
[unsettling music continues]

263
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,578
I am Alice.

264
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,831
[exhales] I'm in this room.

265
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,416
I'm safe.

266
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,086
I'm safe. [exhales]

267
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:07,716
[panicked breaths]

268
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,009
Mom?

269
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,095
[music fades]

270
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,180
Mommy, what happened?

271
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,724
Are you okay?

272
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,059
[exhales]

273
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,438
Is your tummy ouchy?

274
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,276
Just a little bit.

275
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,445
Just a little bit, but don't worry, baby.

276
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,488
Mommy is fine.

277
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,659
[smooches]

278
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,162
There! I kissed it so it can get better.

279
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,247
[chuckles]

280
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,125
[whimpers, chuckles]

281
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,459
Thank you.

282
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,462
Thank you, baby.

283
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,298
I'm always better because of you.

284
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,719
[inhales deeply]

285
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,138
Let's go, let's take a bath.

286
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,807
[sighs heavily]

287
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,145
[Althea] Erica!

288
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,273
Erica, wait.

289
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,900
Erica, please!

290
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,322
Erica, please, talk to Mama.

291
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,159
I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.

292
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:20,122
Whatever the issue is,
you can fix it, right?

293
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,206
Erica, please…

294
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,167
You wanted answers.

295
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,544
Now that I gave them
to you, you can't take it?

296
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,756
Mama's not like that, Erica.

297
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,508
It's impossible she did all that.

298
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,219
- Please talk to her, Erica.
- "You're brainless!"

299
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,348
That's what she told me.

300
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:42,144
<i>They have brains good enough for college.</i>

301
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,729
<i>Do you?</i>

302
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,648
That I wasn't smart enough for college,

303
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,777
so I should just
work so I'd be useful to her.

304
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,615
Even when Louisa died,

305
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,119
when I needed her the most,

306
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,416
she made me feel like
I was just a burden to her

307
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,335
and to your family.

308
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,378
<i>Is this going to take long?</i>

309
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,881
<i>I still have to pick up</i>
<i>my other kid from school.</i>

310
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,258
<i>Do what you want. It's your life.</i>

311
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,385
<i>As long as we're clear, okay?</i>

312
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:20,766
<i>Once you walk out that door,</i>
<i>don't expect anything from me.</i>

313
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,644
[Erica] All she ever did was belittle me,

314
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,897
tell me over and
over I'd never be anything.

315
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:33,904
Hear that your whole life,

316
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,031
you start to believe it.

317
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:41,078
[somber music plays, fades]

318
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,162
[student 1] <i>Yeah, I want that.</i>

319
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,039
[man] <i>Hey, where are the plates?</i>

320
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,958
<i>Bring out the plates!</i>

321
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:46,959
[student 3] <i>What's going on?</i>

322
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,794
<i>Hold on, the plates aren't out yet.</i>

323
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,547
<i>Oh no, the plates! Wait, just a second.</i>

324
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,093
[woman] <i>You idiot!</i>
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?!</i>

325
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,386
<i>You're so slow!</i>

326
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,347
<i>I've been yelling outside forever.</i>
<i>You didn't hear me?!</i>

327
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,517
<i>What a waste of my money</i>
<i>paying you, letting you stay here!</i>

328
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,561
<i>If I wasn't short on staff,</i>

329
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,479
<i>I'd have kicked you out already!</i>

330
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,314
<i>And now you're dreaming?</i>

331
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,942
<i>Dreaming of going to a university?</i>

332
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,610
<i>You can't even handle things here!</i>

333
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,196
<i>Pathetic! You're dreaming too big!</i>

334
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,907
<i>Just give me your college money instead,</i>

335
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,618
<i>you look like you're only</i>
<i>good for washing dishes anyway.</i>

336
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,412
<i>Do it properly! Get it together!</i>

337
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,705
[scoffs loudly]

- [woman] <i>Add more dish!</i>
- [man] <i>Why that look?</i>

340
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,920
<i>Do it right. Do your job.</i>

<i>Where's my money?</i>

348
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,318
<i>Money?</i>

349
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,488
<i>Oh! The coins?</i>

350
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,740
<i>Yes, but they were mine.</i>
<i>I worked for those!</i>

351
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,534
<i>Give me back my money!</i>

352
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,077
<i>It's gone.</i>

353
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,121
<i>Used it for booze.</i>

<i>But if you want it…</i>

355
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,252

00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,438
<i>You're a monster!</i>

364
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,982
[woman] <i>Hey! What are you doing?</i>

365
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,483
<i>What are you doing, huh?</i>

366
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,778
<i>She asked for it. Who am I to say no?</i>

367
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,365
<i>You shameless girl!</i>

368
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:10,245
<i>After I took you in,</i>
<i>this is how you'd repay me?</i>

369
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,497
<i>- You're shameless!</i>
<i>- I didn't do anything wrong!</i>

370
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,833
<i>He stole my money!</i>

371
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,003
- [sobbing]
<i>- Oh, really? I don't care!</i>

372
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,797
<i>Get out of here! Leave!</i>

373
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,175
<i>Is this it? Here you go!</i>

374
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,135
<i>Get out of here! Leave!</i>

375
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:29,681
[somber music playing]

376
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:36,688
[sobbing]

377
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,735
- [object clatters]
- <i>Watch it.</i>

378
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,741
[sobbing]

379
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,591
[somber music continues]

380
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,606
[Erica] <i>I had to hit rock bottom…</i>

381
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,443
<i>to realize that I only</i>
<i>got away from Amurao,</i>

382
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,988
<i>but not from your mother's belittlement.</i>

383
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,410
And when I finally got her out of my head,

384
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,622
only then was I able to recover.

385
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,833
[somber music continues]

386
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:42,462
I learned that I shouldn't
let anyone belittle me.

387
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,258
I began to believe in myself…

388
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,344
not in her words.

389
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,808
I survived on my own.

390
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,686
I succeeded on my own.

391
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,189
[sobs] Erica.

392
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:05,402
[somber music continues]

393
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,905
[sobs] Erica, please return to us.

394
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,827
[sobbing, sniffling]

395
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,916
Even if she was a good mother to you,

396
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,088
that doesn't mean the things
I experienced with her were not true.

397
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,262
[somber music intensifies]

398
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,482
[music fades]

399
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,693
[exhales sharply]

400
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,820
I can't wait to drink this.

401
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,572
Hey, guys! Do you know…

402
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,116
there's a Hollywood gala in November?

403
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,869
One of my clients just
called me to confirm her attendance,

404
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,413
and she's forcing me to go with her.

405
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,664
I might as well, right?

406
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,375
And then, maybe I can visit you after.

407
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,002
- Yeah?
- Sure.

408
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,545
- Of course.
- [chuckles]

409
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,839
Hey, you should file a leave from work.

410
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,674
Hmm…

411
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,552
- Of course. Yeah.
- Yay! [chuckles]

412
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,471
It's going to be so fun for sure.

413
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,682
[exhales sharply]

414
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,101
[chair scrapes]

415
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,899
[clears throat]

416
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,235
[Mel] Are you okay?

417
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,824
[snorts] Yeah, I'm just… [breathes deeply]

418
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,785
I'm just tired, you know.

419
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,245
It's been a long day.

420
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,872
You know, maybe we should call it a night.

421
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,585
Yeah, you know, actually, I'm tired, too.

422
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,587
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's just have this drink.

423
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,797
- Yeah.
- Okay?

424
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,800
I had the guest room
prepared for you, by the way.

425
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,760
Wait, wait… [chuckles]

426
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,221
- You must be kidding me.
- [uneasy music playing]

427
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,140
Come on, Alice! Your husband
hasn't seen you in a long time,

428
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,976
and you're making him
sleep in the guest room?

429
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,102
Seriously?

430
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,646
- [chuckles]
- [snorts]

431
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,274
Of course, I was joking.

432
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,733
- [chuckles] Oh my…
- Come on.

433
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,736
I meant, the bathroom of the guest room.

434
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,822
You know, in case
he wants to freshen up, he can go

435
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,074
- straight to the bathroom.
- Okay, I get it.

436
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,242
- Yeah.
- Whoo. Cheers.

437
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,326
Cheers, guys. Let's finish this,

438
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,452
- and let's hit the hay?
- Cheers.

439
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,954
- Yeah?
- Cheers! [glasses clink]

440
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,330
[chuckles]

441
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:26,084
[uneasy music continues]

442
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:38,638
[music becomes eerie]

443
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,733
[Scott] Alice.

444
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,195
Why doesn't Mel know
we're in the middle of a divorce?

445
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,780
Why haven't you told them?

446
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,574
Huh?

447
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,452
[distorted voice] Does this
mean that we still have a chance?

448
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,162
That you have changed your mind?

449
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,622
Because that's
the only reason I can think of…

450
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,750
Because I can't think of any other reason

451
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,877
why you hid the truth.

452
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,211
Huh?

453
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,047
[music becomes tense]

454
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,048
Alice.

455
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:15,717
Alice.

456
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,344
Touch me, and I'll scream.

457
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,137
I swear.

458
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,183
[tense music continues]

459
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,325
<i>I don't want him to stay here,</i>
<i>but I'm afraid he'll take Seth.</i>

460
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,370
[Beth] <i>Her and Scott are getting</i>
<i>a divorce. I'm worried about Alice.</i>

461
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,039
<i>I can sense that she's afraid of Scott.</i>

462
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,791
<i>He'd tie me up at night.</i>

463
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:51,836
<i>He can't say it's not</i>
<i>true because I remember it.</i>

464
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,881
<i>- Alice, calm down.</i>
<i>- Why do I remember it?</i>

465
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,591
<i>Mel, Alice is our priority.</i>

466
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,551
<i>We have to keep an eye on her.</i>

467
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,847
<i>Liezel, you told me</i>
<i>you didn't know Bianca that well.</i>

468
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,599
<i>But her sister said you two were close.</i>

469
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,600
<i>What are you getting at?</i>

470
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,519
<i>Give me back my daughter!</i>

471
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,646
<i>- Damn you!</i>
<i>- Please stop!</i>

472
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,647
[Angelo] <i>If it weren't for her,</i>

473
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,816
<i>the people in Amurao</i>
<i>wouldn't gossip about you!</i>

474
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,692
<i>- I know Beth.</i>
<i>- But she doesn't know me.</i>

475
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,111
<i>She doesn't know what I'm capable of.</i>

476
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,154
- [sobbing]
<i>- Finish her.</i>
