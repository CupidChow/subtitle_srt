Of course, we're very happy.

A wrong has been made right.

65

But I hope the renewed criticism

66
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,883
of how NLEA handles warrantless arrests

67
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,301
and hot pursuits

68
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,596
brought about by my
clients' case will not die down.

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,765
The police has victimized so many people

00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,850
through their abuse of power,

71
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,937

How about you, Sissy B?

No, we're not filing a complaint.

I'm really grateful

77
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,740
for how our attorney defended us.

My brother isn't scheduled to visit today.

Is there a problem?

00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,764
It's not your brother.

94
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,140
They won't let me tell you.

- [assistant warden] Attorney.
- [music fades]

98
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,628
You just showed up
here insisting to see an inmate.

99
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,714
I'm sure you know
we have a procedure for that.

100
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,800
You can't just force your way in.

101
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,220
And you're not even
on Santiago's visitor list.

102
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,554
He'll refuse to meet with you.

103
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,099
Then tell him his brother's here.

104
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,311
Your inmate called
a lawyer in the middle of the night.

105
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,606
It's not only outside official call hours.

106
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,234
Also, isn't there
a no-cellphone policy here?

107
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,069
Even personnel aren't allowed to have one.

108
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,115
So how did Edong Santiago get a cellphone?

109
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,909
Do you really want me
to report this to the bureau director?

110

[sighs]

111
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,745
No need to do that, Attorney.

112
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,791
One idiot messes up and
the whole place takes the hit.

113
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,668
We follow the rules here.

114
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,920
Don't worry,
I'll have your allegation investigated.

115
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,507
Someone probably
just took pity on Santiago.

116
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,635
He's actually
well-respected by his fellow inmates.

117
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,387
He even helps my jail officers

118
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,348
maintain peace and order in his block.

119
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,142
[chuckles] You know, Attorney,

120
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,060
I'm close to writing to the Pope

121
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,021
to have him canonized.

122
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,899
So will you let me see that saint,

123
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,860
or should I write to your boss?

124
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,238
[tense music playing]

125
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,169
Good day, Attorney.

126
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,005
[tense music continues]

127
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,801
You look tired.

128
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,724
Did you get any sleep last night?

129
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,811
[pensive music playing]

130
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,273
I haven't had a good
night's sleep in the past 14 years.

131
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,026
That's what you wanted to know, right?

132
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,489
I should've done this a long time ago.

133
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,450
I should've faced
you and talked to you back then.

134
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,704
I want you to understand
why things happened the way they did.

135
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,125
We were only sixteen, Edong.

136
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,420
We were younger than you.

137
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,633
- The cops pressured us--
- Did they beat you up…

138
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,678
[uneasy music continues]

139
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,890
…so bad you thought you were going to die?

140
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,600
Attorney?

141
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,229
No.

142
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,856
Did they also disgrace your names

143
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,985
and call you all sorts of things,

144
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,281
until you couldn't even
remember who you were anymore?

145
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,035
- No, but I hope you know--
- A monster.

146
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,788
Animal.

147
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,748
Scum.

148
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,544
That's what they called me here.

149
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,672
[uneasy music continues]

150
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,007
[breathes sharply]

151
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,677
But let's forget about that, Attorney.

152
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,225
That's all in the past.

153
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,565
[foreboding music playing]

154
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,946
[Beth] You mentioned
in our group chat before

155
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,906
that you ran into
Lucas and he was nice to you.

156
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,825
I didn't realize he was that friendly.

157
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,118
[scoffs] Yeah.

158
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,121
Like I said before,
we have a lot of mutual friends.

159
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,624
We run into each other at
business expos and events.

160
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,878
But is he like really okay with you?

161
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,589
[Alice] I mean,

162
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,134
his brother ended up in
jail because of our testimony.

163
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,636
[sighs] Well…

164
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,973
Actually,
I felt awkward around him at first.

165
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,183
But then he was the one who told me

166
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,602
we didn't have to be awkward.

167
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,645
He said he's already
moved on from the past.

168
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,690
He might've been mad
with us before, but not anymore.

169
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,983
Oh, really now?

170
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:13,779
Yeah, and actually, he's been a really
good friend to me a couple of times.

171
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,244
So, let's go?

172
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,746
Go?

173
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,456
To the gym opening.

174
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,625
No. You guys go without me.

175
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,918
Uh, I don't know, Mel.

176
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,712
[scoffs] Come on, guys.

177
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,631
It's been 14 years.

178
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,467
Lucas is right.
It's time we should move forward.

179
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,095
[scoffs] We can all move forward,
but in separate directions.

180
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,680
[sighs]

181
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,557
[chuckles softly]

182
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,186
[unsettling music playing]

183
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,859
- [car door opens]
- Wait.

184
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:56,072
[unsettling music continues]

185
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,908
Thank you so much for visiting, Attorney.

186
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,662
[inhales sharply]
But I have to go back inside now.

187
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,790
We have a Bible study.

188
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,959
I came here to tell
you I never forgot about you.

189
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,254
[tense music playing]

190
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,174
You're one of
the reasons I became a lawyer.

191
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,887
I've been reviewing
your case again, Edong.

192
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,515
I want to help you.

193
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:27,478
[tense music continues]

194
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,067
I'm not the one
who needs your help, Attorney.

195
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,904
Like I said,

196
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:41,200
I'll correct my own mistakes.

197
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,911
And I want to help you all,

198
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,832
make things right too.

199
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,793
What do you mean?

200
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,795
[chuckles]

201
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,672
[inhales sharply]

202
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,592
- [Erica] wait.
- [inhales deeply]

203
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,387
[exhales slowly]

204
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,347
Don't worry, Attorney.

205
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,350
I'm sure…

206
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,895
we'll see each other again.

207
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:15,276
[tense music continues]

208
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,662
[tense music swells, fades]

209
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,205
Seth?

210
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,208
Seth! Baby?

211
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,210
[unsettling music plays]

212
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,004
[exhales]

213
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,256
Seth?!

214
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,802
Oh, God.

215
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,096
Wait.

216
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,306
Seth?

217
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,517
[unsettling music continues]

218
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,935
Baby?

219
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,354
Seth?

220
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,398
[man] Right.

221
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,777
[Seth] The eclipse is faster than that.

222
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,571
- Really? [laughs]
- Yeah.

223
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,448
- [Alice] Seth!
- Mommy!

224
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,116
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

225
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,286
[unsettling music continues]

226
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,079
[Edward] <i>Mike isn't just my cousin.</i>

227
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,706
<i>He's like a brother to me.</i>

228
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,503
<i>This is going to be hard for all of us,</i>
<i>but we'll get through it.</i>

229
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,130
<i>I'm here for you guys, and I know…</i>

230
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,174
<i>you're here for me too.</i>

231
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:26,096
[unsettling music continues]

232
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,643
[music fades]

233
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,562
[Marco] What did you tell Santiago?

234
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,401
Did you admit that your friends
lied about Louisa's watch?

235
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,612
What if he uses that against you?

236
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,365
What if he tells someone?
What if it spreads online?

237
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,284
There's no legal repercussion for me.

238
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,371
I wasn't even a lawyer back then.

239
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,540
We were minors,

240
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,583
and the police manipulated us.

241
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,461
That's what I wanted Edong to understand!

242
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,797
If that suddenly comes out,

243
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,841
it's definitely going
to affect your reputation.

244
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,596
[sighs] Where do you think
our investigation's gonna go?

245
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,392
When I find who really killed Louisa,

246
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,771
and when I can prove Edong's innocent,
I'll put everything out there.

247
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,482
Everyone will know what actually happened.

248
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,900
[morose music plays]

249
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,194
[sighs deeply] And you're right.

250
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,574
People will judge me, one way or another.

251
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:31,245
I'm so sorry, Uncle Edward.
I didn't recognize you right away.

252
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,122
I was so worried about Seth.

253
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,208
[laughs] I understand.

254
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,210
I guess I've aged quite a bit.

255
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,754
Oh, not really, Uncle. Only slightly.

256
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,756
- [Edward laughs]
- Right?

257
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,134
Beth still drops by
to visit us from time to time.

258
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,969
We also see each other at church.

259
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,888
Your friend hasn't forgotten about us.

260
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,181
Oh, of course, Uncle!

261
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,226
We practically lived at
your place back in high school.

262
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,478
- [laughs]
- We kept finishing all your groceries.

263
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,732
Your Aunt Christina and I were always
happy whenever you kids were around.

264
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,609
[Beth, Edward chuckle]

265
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,986
How is she?

266
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,032
Alzheimer's?

267
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:13,370
Some days are good, some aren't.

268
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,916
But earlier, when she woke up,

269
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,209
she recognized me.

270
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,588
[chuckles] And she wanted to

271
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,299
visit her cousins to catch up.

272
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,927
I'm heading back there to check on her.

273
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,764
You take care of yourself too, Uncle.

274
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,769
[Tim] <i>Are you heading back?</i>
<i>We have to move fast.</i>

275
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,146
Mel, Pure Glow just called.

276
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,190
They're asking how
you plan to fix the issue.

277
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,483
[Mel] <i>I'm on my way.</i>

278
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,194
[clicks tongue] This really
happened right in the middle

279
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,279
of my rehearsals for the G&G fashion show.

280
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,533
I-I'll call you back.

281
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:53,953
[chuckles softly]

282
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:01,835
[sullen music plays]

283
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,130
[cellphone vibrating]

284
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,720
[vibrating continues]

285
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,770
[sullen music continues]

286
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,493
- [cellphone vibrating]
- [music fades]

287
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,663
Hello?

288
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,501
Who?

289
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,921
[foreboding music plays, fades]

290
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,800
[Edward sighs]

291
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,177
When your aunt got sick,

292
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,264
I ended up neglecting the house.

293
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,558
It became too big for us,

294
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,519
so we moved to an apartment.

295
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,023
But I couldn't bring
myself to sell it. We love that place

296
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,983
and we have so many good memories there.

297
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,070
So when you convinced
me to have it restored

298
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,781
instead of torn down,

299
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,408
I agreed.

300
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,452
Thank you for what you're doing.

301
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,829
Don't worry, Uncle.

302
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,706
We won't neglect the house.

303
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,042
[chuckles] Make it yours.

304
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,253
- Mrs. Miller?
- [Alice] Oh, yes?

305
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,464
We're the ones installing the CCTV.

306
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,466
Oh! Right, yes, um…

307
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,426
You know all the areas, right?

308
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,970
Yes, ma'am. Ten areas in total.

309
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,723
Yes, and please don't
forget the outdoor placement.

310
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,475
- [man] Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

311
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,810
Alright, ma'am, we'll get started.

312
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,271
[sighs]

313
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,065
[Beth] Ten CCTVs?

314
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,649
Isn't that a bit too many?

315
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,194
I mean… [scoffs]

316
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,945
you can never be too sure.

317
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,448
Especially with Seth in the house, right?

318
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,325
But ten?

319
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,661
I guess I just got used
to the States, you know.

320
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,164
Even when I'm not home,
I can always check on him.

321
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,835
Uh, Alice, Beth,

322
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,337
I'll pick up your aunt now, okay?

323
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,214
Take care, Uncle.

324
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,965
- Take care, Uncle Edward.
- Alright. Okay.

325
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,967
[uneasy music plays]

326
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,469
[clears throat]

327
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,014
- [car door closes]
- [sighs]

328
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,893
The judgment will come, Marco.

329
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,980
But once I have evidence
that can help Edong's case,

330
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,774
the truth will come out.

331
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,985
- [inhales sharply]
- [brooding music plays]

332
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,529
[exhales deeply, clicks tongue]

333
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,448
What did Santiago say?

334
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,245
[sighs] He wouldn't listen to me.

335
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,749
I should've gone to him sooner.

336
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,503
I shouldn't have been a coward.

337
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,049
I should've told him
earlier what we were doing.

338
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,553
But I wanted to face him

339
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,055
when I had something
that could help his case.

340
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,724
I thought that would make it easier.

341
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,186
I thought that would make
it easier for him to understand.

342
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,731
[brooding music continues]

343
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,235
[Edong] <i>I'm not the one</i>
<i>who needs your help, Attorney.</i>

344
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,112
<i>Like I said,</i>

345
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,616
<i>I will correct my own mistakes.</i>

346
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,286
<i>And I want to help you all</i>

347
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,497
<i>make up for yours too.</i>

348
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:30,335
[uneasy music playing]

349
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,754
[glass clatters]

350
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,133
He keeps saying that he's
moved on from what happened.

351
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,468
But? [Marco sighs]

352
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,638
[uneasy music continues]

353
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,599
He wouldn't call me if that were true.

354
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,395
If I haven't moved on, how could he?

355
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:52,649
[uneasy music continues]

356
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,823
[music turns somber]

357
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,292
- [maid] Good afternoon, ma'am.
- [music fades]

358
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,418
[Anton] Welcome home, babe.

359
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,212
I missed you.

360
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,298
Even if you gave me a hundred black eyes,

361
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,841
I'd still forgive you.

362
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,968
[Mel] Come on, Anton.

363
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,888
Stop acting like it's my fault.

364
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,389
I never said--

365
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,768
Then you sure did a hell of a good job
making it seem like I was the problem!

366
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,895
I already explained, right?

367
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,397
I didn't want to cancel on the guys babe.

368
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,609
Look, you got angry.

369
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,237
And when you get angry,
you strike out at anything.

370
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,947
- [scoffs]
- And I'm usually the target.

371
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,407
Excuse me?

372
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,825
Hey, Anton!

373
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,119
Playing the martyr doesn't suit you!

374
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,625
[tense music plays]

375
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:00,050
[tense music intensifies]

376
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,975
[music fades]

377
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,980
[Erica] Okay, I already signed that.

378
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,274
Someone will pick it up later, okay?

379
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,150
[secretary] Good morning, Attorney.

380
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,361
Someone's waiting for you inside.

381
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,613
But I don't have any appointments today?

382
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,199
They might be a potential new client.

383
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,081
[sighs heavily]

384
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,171
Hi, sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Attorney Erica Melendez.

385
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:42,801
[dramatic music playing]

386
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:58,400
[dramatic music continues]

387
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,030
<i>When I first arrived here,</i>

388
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,781
<i>I was full of anger.</i>

389
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,369
<i>But it became clear</i>
<i>to me what I had to do.</i>

390
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,580
<i>Punish the perpetrators.</i>

391
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,206
[Beth] <i>I think they're</i>
<i>keeping something from me.</i>

392
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,127
<i>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</i>

393
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,795
<i>I'm reinvestigating Louisa's murder.</i>

394
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,756
<i>- I want to know the truth--</i>
<i>- You're concerned</i>

395
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,049
<i>about the truth now, Attorney?</i>

396
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,301
<i>If you try to approach my brother again,</i>

397
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,719
<i>you have to face me first.</i>
