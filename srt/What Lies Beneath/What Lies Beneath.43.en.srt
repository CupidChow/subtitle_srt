<i>We'll search this area next.</i>

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,260
<i>He was armed and dangerous,</i>

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,762
<i>so our officers were forced to shoot him.</i>

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,722
<i>I was there!</i>

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,849
<i>"Armed and dangerous," huh?!</i>

8
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,851
<i>He didn't have a weapon on him!</i>

9
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,020
<i>Nothing! He had nothing!</i>

10
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,021
[Ryan] <i>Why don't we just ask them?</i>

11
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,316
[Beth]<i> Why would they do that if</i>
<i>they have something to hide?</i>

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,652
[Ryan] <i>What if</i>
<i>they're not hiding anything?</i>

13
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,529
[Beth] <i>That's not how investigations work.</i>

14
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,698
[Ryan]<i> Why? Who's investigating?</i>

15
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,284

[slurring] I already told you.
You don't need to help me.

28
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,656
- I can manage.
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,075
That's also what you said
when you were on the floor earlier.

30
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,203
[exhales deeply] Okay.

31
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,705
Uh, I'll just get some water.

I'll be back, okay?

34
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,966
I was so arrogant, wasn't I?

35
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,471
I thought it'd be that easy…

But…

39
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,820
it looks like Edong is really gone.

40
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,910
I couldn't save Louisa then.

41
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,083
I can't save Edong now either.

He won't forgive us that easily.

50
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,708

What?

53
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,589
Maybe that's why he lost his mind.

54
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,968
I mean, if that happened to me,
I'd go insane too.

What?

71
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,313
You saw that, right?

72
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,689
It was blood.

73
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,485
Maybe it's just ketchup.

74
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,069
Yeah, it's just ketchup.

75
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,613
Ketchup, really?

76
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,490
Fine, it's blood.

77
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,826
But that doesn't mean
he killed or hurt anyone.

78
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,704
Maybe it's blood from his hand.

79
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,707
Yeah, that's why
the knife and his clothes have blood.

80
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,083
That's the point!

81
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,377
Why was he holding a bloody knife?

82
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,172
And did you see
the bloody clothes in the bag,

83
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,882
we don't know who it belongs to?

84
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,551
Can you even imagine
what else might be in that bag?

85
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,554
Do you get it now?

86
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:38,518
We need to prove that he
has nothing to do with Louisa's death.

87
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,144
Louisa, really?

88
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,021
Louisa has been dead for a decade.

If you want,
we can just ask Angelo about it.

Isn't that why you went there…

91
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,695
even though I told you not to?

92
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,572

Yes, I got it on video.
Do you want to see it?

Why wouldn't I be?

114

You've done everything you can…

…for Edong.

116
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,169
That's enough.

117
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,508
Tell that to Lucas.

What?

122
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,112
What kind of question is that?

[melancholic music continues]

124
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,285
Maybe the reason
you can't let go of what happened…

125
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,497
is because
you still have feelings for him.

126
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,542
So, what you're saying is…

127
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,336
everything I'm doing…

128
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,589
everything I've worked hard for…

129
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,343
is all because I have feelings for a guy?

130
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,263
Is that it?

131
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:08,018
- A guy has nothing to do with my problems.

[Mel] How are you?

147
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,832

[sobs softly]

00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:06,554
Lucas, no matter how angry I am
at your brother, you're not part of that.

152
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,181
I'm worried about you.

153
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,351
You know how I feel about you. [sobs]

[somber music continues]

155
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,772
Do you remember when we were at the bar?

156
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,484
I kept avoiding you.

157
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,070
I couldn't even look at you.

158
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,489
Because of of you…

159
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,034
my brother's life was ruined.

162

<i>Good night.</i>

163
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,010
[Lucas] You think I want
to have any connection with you?!

164
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,263
That's the last thing I would ever want!

<i>I just want,</i>

168
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,372
<i>to say sorry for what I said last time.</i>

169
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,044
<i>It's just really hard</i>
<i>to forget what happened.</i>

170
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,426
<i>Especially since</i>
<i>my brother is still in prison.</i>

171
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:34,058
<i>But I realized I shouldn't</i>
<i>have blamed you and your friends.</i>

172
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,852
<i>We were so young back then.</i>

173

00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,772
<i>Don't you run with your husband?</i>

184
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,565
<i>Hmm.</i>

185
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,067
<i>We run too.</i>

186
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,238
<i>But, it's always a race with him.</i>
<i>It's always a competition.</i>

187
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,364
<i>It's not fun.</i>

188
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,074
<i>Not like when I run with you.</i>

189
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,118
[chuckles slightly] <i>Excuse me.</i>

190
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,919
<i>You know what I miss?</i>

191
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,006
<i>I miss the smell of the sea breeze.</i>

192
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,384
<i>I loved that whenever I'd</i>
<i>go by the shore with my brother.</i>

193
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,762
<i>Before he changed.</i>

194
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,975
<i>But he's doing better now.</i>

195
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,853
<i>He quit all his vices.</i>

196
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,231
<i>He's a model prisoner now.</i>

197
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,693
- [Lucas chuckles slightly]
<i>- That's… That's good!</i>

198
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,043
<i>By the way, I have a question.</i>

199
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,588
<i>I've been curious</i>
<i>about this for a long time.</i>

200
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,430
<i>That watch you found</i>
<i>with my brother's things…</i>

201
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,850
<i>…you said it belonged to Louisa.</i>

202
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,685
<i>How sure are you that it was hers?</i>

203
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,146
[uneasy music playing]

204
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,856
[stammers, chuckles awkwardly]

205
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,441
<i>Why would you even ask that?</i>

206
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,945
<i>Nothing, I just think about it a lot.</i>

207
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,698
<i>Because when they presented it in court--</i>

208
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,828
<i>I mean, anyone could've owned that watch.</i>

209
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,956
<i>And nothing actually</i>
<i>proved it belonged to Louisa.</i>

210
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:09,088
[chuckles awkwardly]
<i>I'm sorry, can we not talk about the past?</i>

211
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,424
[chuckles awkwardly]
<i>I get anxious and nervous.</i>

212
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,676
<i>You know? We just reconciled.</i>

213
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,595
<i>I don't want to ruin this.</i>

214
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,558
<i>- You're right.</i>
- [music fades]

215
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,519
<i>Anyway…</i>

216
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,688
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>all I want is to move forward.</i>

217
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,734
<i>And I know my brother wants that too.</i>

218
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,903
[pensive music playing]

219
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,279
<i>So…</i>

220
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,367
<i>You know, for both of us.</i>

221
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,956
[pensive music continues]

222
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,719
- That's the reason I got close to you.
- [music fades]

223
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,847
[Mel sobs softly]

224
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,933
Because I had questions,
I wanted answered!

225
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,309
[sobs]

226
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,352
So…

227
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,939
[voice breaks, sobs]
What you're saying, Lucas, is…

228
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,483
W- what we had.

229
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,111
[breath hitching, sobs]

230
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,947
None of it was real? Huh?

231
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,740
None of it was real?!

232
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,119
- [breath quivering, sobbing]
- [somber music playing]

233
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,495
No!

234
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,081
[crying] Lucas, that's not true!

235
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,791
I don't believe you!

236
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,085
[inhales sharply] I don't believe you!

237
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,045
[somber music continues]

238
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:32,921
[Lucas] <i>Mel?</i>

239
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,091
- [Mel sobs softly]
<i>- What happened?</i>

240
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,468
<i>Huh?</i>

241
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:42,806
- [sobbing softly]
- [music becomes tender]

242
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,812
<i>That damn bastard!</i>
<i>Where else did he hurt you?!</i>

243
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,272
[sobs]

244
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,356
<i>Where?</i>

245
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,028
<i>- I'll kill him!</i>
<i>- Don't! No, please. Please.</i>

246
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,448
[sobs, stammers] <i>Lucas,</i>
<i>just get me away from here, please.</i>

247
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,532
<i>- What?!</i>
- [sobs]

248
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,452
<i>Mel, do you know what</i>
<i>my father did to my mother?!</i>

249
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,580
<i>He kept hurting</i>
<i>her over and over until she died!</i>

250
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,499
<i>Is that what you want</i>
<i>to happen to you, huh?!</i>

251
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,919
<i>Nothing will happen even if I die!</i>

252
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,921
<i>No one will care!</i>

253
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,590
<i>He told me he'd make</i>
<i>sure no one would care!</i>

254
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,050
<i>That's not true!</i>

255
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,261
[tender music continues]

256
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,804
<i>I care.</i>

257
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,185
<i>I care about you.</i>

258
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,479
<i>Mel…</i>

259
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,442
<i>Do you understand that?</i>

260
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,281
[sobs]

261
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:45,202
[tender music continues]

262
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,879
[music fades]

263
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,340
[Mel sobs] If what you're saying is true,

264
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:04,388
you wouldn't stop asking questions
until you get the answers you want, Lucas.

265
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,056
- [sobbing]
- [somber music playing]

266
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,268
After that one time--

267
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,019
Lucas, after that one time,

268
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,523
you never asked me again about the past.

269
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,025
[sobs]

270
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,903
Lucas, you comforted me!

271
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,573
You were there for me!

272
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,450
You were the only one I could tell

273
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,537
what I was really
going through with Anton.

274
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,331
Lucas, you loved me!

275
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,208
[sobs]

276
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,044
Lucas, you loved me!

277
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,382
You loved me more than Anton ever could!

278
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,052
And if you're saying you just used me,

279
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,596
then why did you keep my secret?

280
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,723
Huh?!

281
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,183
Why did you keep my secret

282
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,853
when you could've held it against me?!

283
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:57,024
[somber music continues]

284
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,317
Lucas…

285
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,111
[sobbing]

286
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,946
Lucas, I love you.

287
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,782
Lucas, I--

288
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,827
I love you… I love you. [sobs]

289
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,247
And I know you loved me too!

290
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,166
I know that!

291
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,460
Lucas, I know that!

292
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:21,965
Just…

293
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,510
Just go.

294
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,220
[whimpers] No…

295
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,396
[somber music continues]

296
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,694
[sobbing]

297
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,293
[music fades]

298
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:13,600
[sinister music playing]

299
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,477
[man] <i>Sir. Ma'am just left.</i>

300
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,021
<i>She went to a condo here in Manila.</i>

301
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,189
Condo?

302
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,275
What building?

303
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,903
<i>Azur Residences, sir.</i>

304
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,822
<i>She was inside for almost an hour.</i>

305
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,659
[sinister music continues]

306
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,411
Find out who she visited there.

307
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,454
Now!

308
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:40,168
[sinister music crescendos]

309
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,673
<i>I really thought I could</i>
<i>bring justice to you and Edong.</i>

310
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,383
<i>But I shouldn't have stopped there.</i>

311
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,926
<i>I need to know the truth.</i>

312
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,012
<i>One of our classmates has</i>
<i>been missing since last night.</i>

313
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,431
<i>We suspect that Louisa</i>
<i>number two is the missing one.</i>

314
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,433
<i>Miss Liezel is your friend, right?</i>

315
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,435
<i>I know she was close to my sister.</i>

316
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,689
<i>I came from Bianca Seropon's house.</i>

317
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,274
<i>Isn't she also your student?</i>

318
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,316
<i>No.</i>

319
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,526
<i>The kid went missing</i>

320
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,487
<i>the same night we saw</i>
<i>him holding a bloody knife.</i>

321
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,823
<i>Do you think Angelo is really involved?</i>
