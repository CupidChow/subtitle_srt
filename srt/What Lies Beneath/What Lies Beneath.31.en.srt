I just have to go out, Ma.

Maybe Miss Oma's eatery is still open.

28
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,484
A bowl of warm soup will be good for you.

The cops came here asking

[ominous music resumes]

42
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,081
Why don't you make the barangay watchmen

and the attorney look for her?

44
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:08,086
They all intimidated Aunt Esther,
that's why she left.

99

- She's in Bataan.

110
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,879
In Dinalupihan.

[sinister music continues]

112
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,552
You got your answer. Leave us alone.

[huffs] The furniture is broken,

122
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,590
there's damage
to the door and the wall as well.

123
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,552
There were bloodstains on the floor,
but they weren't Edong's.

124
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,307
But the fingerprints and
trace evidence matched him.

125
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,101
What about the mother and son?
Were they traced?

126
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:01,606
[exhales] I think Edong
got Esther's location from them.

127
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,361
He killed them after
getting what he came for.

128
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,072
They died even before Esther.

00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,492
[Marco breathes deeply]

130
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,826
How about Mel?

131
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,786
She's in Amurao.

132
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,455
With Alice and Beth.

133
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,834

00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,464
[Ryan] Did I bring
the right uniform, love?

136
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,509
You did, love. Very good.
You've gotten better at ironing.

137
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,135
Because I'm scared of you.

138
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,888
[giggling] That tickles! You're so silly!

139
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,848
- Excuse me guys…
- Close the door--

140
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,559
…can you leave that in
the bedroom? It's offensive.

141
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,062
We're just starting breakfast,
and you're already on dessert.

142
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,605
Oh, please!

143
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,066
You and Anton are so
sweet to each other on social media.

144
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,901
I bet you're even sweeter in real life.

145
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,195
- [chuckles softly]
- [Ryan] Here, love.

146
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,490
Seth, wait a minute. I'm thirsty,
I'm just going to get something to drink.

151
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,506
You know, I'm really,
really glad that you're here.

152
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,674
We all thought…

153
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,134
I know, that I ended up like Louisa?

It's EOP every day.

00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,045
"EOP"?

[Chloe] <i>Bruh, shocking news!</i>

182
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,304
<i>Edong chopped someone's hand off!</i>

183
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,473

[Joshua] <i>What the?!</i>
<i>Wild, bruh! Whose hand was it?</i>

185
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,519
<i>That's one heck of a psycho!</i>

186
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,398
Chloe? Chloe, come down!
It's time for breakfast.

187
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,026
- We'll be late for school.
- [Chloe] Yes, Ma!

189
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,999
Attorney!

190
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,045
You have a subpoena from
the homeowners' association.

191
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,630
Make sure you show up, okay?

[paper rips, rustles]

194
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,813
[Beth] Mel, you should take extra care.

195
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,483
You shouldn't have left
home without a security detail.

196
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,944
Why did you do that anyway?
Where did you go?

197
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,281
Well, I was supposed to have a meeting,
but when I got inside the building,

198
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,660
I felt like someone was following me,

199
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,995
so I backed out.

200
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,416
Without telling Anton?

[ringing continues]

205
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,682

- Yeah, sure.

206

- [Jo] <i>Hello, Mel?</i>

Yes, ma'am.

- <i>Thank you for your service,</i>

213

214
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,001

Mel, are you okay?

291
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,870
I'll call you again.

292
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,875

[music fades]

295
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,804
Come on, let's eat.
We have to go to work soon.

296
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,931
- Okay.
- [Beth] Come on.

297
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,355
She's putting all
the residents here in danger.

298
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,150
What if next time the bomb's real?

299
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,360
That's true.

300
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,196
You know what should happen?
She should leave this place.

301
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,740
I agree, 100%.

302
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,660
It's not just her job that's dangerous,
she's dangerous too.

303
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:44,081
You don't know this, but Attorney Melendez
pepper-sprayed me in the parking lot.

304
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,291
I was minding my own business

305
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,252
and out of nowhere she assaulted me.

306
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,171
<i>Ahh! What the heck?!</i>

307
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,257
[woman] I can't believe it.

[uneasy music plays, fades]

309
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,099
Attorney, you have the floor.

310
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,768
First of all, I own my unit.

311
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,895
I'm not renting it.

312
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,023
So no, you can't easily boot me out.

313
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,609
It's in our owner's contract.

314
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,279
Go ahead, you can check.

315
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:20,742
And if dangerous jobs
are your basis for removing me,

316
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:25,998
why don't you remove Miss 901 too?

317
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,333
[tense music playing]

318
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,919
Ma'am, your husband's
a police officer, right?

319
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,547
Every day he deals with criminals.

320
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,425
And 1001?

321
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,344
He's a radio announcer.

322
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:44,057
He got death threats last
year but he's still here, right?

323
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,602
What about unit 512?

324
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,229
What's your problem with my friend?

325
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,606
Nothing.

326
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,234
But that small community he's demolishing

327
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,320
to build a Chinese casino does.

328
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,281
Since last year up until last month,

329
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,908
protesters have been coming here.

330
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,659
[tense music continues]

331
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,329
And just two months ago,
someone came after me in my unit

332
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,584
because she thought her husband's mistress

333
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,712
used their conjugal money to buy a unit.

334
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,214
My god.

335
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,049
She almost pulled my hair out.

336
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,635
Good thing I calmed her down.

337
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,929
<i>I didn't graduate</i>
<i>from a prestigious school</i>

[tense music continues]

341
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,570
- I didn't know about that.
- So, if you're filing

342
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,490
a complaint to remove me,

343
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,200
I demand that they get removed, too.

344
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,663
So, I suggest you think about it.

345
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:52,751
Also, don't be surprised if you see
a police presence around the building.

346
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,338
They're here for your protection.

347
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,547
That's good.

348
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,799
At least, we are safe.

349
00:20:58,882 --> 00:20:59,841
I agree.

350
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,350
[tense music continues, fades]

351
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,692
So, any news?

352
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,361
It's not Mel's, right?

353
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,570
Is she safe?

354
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,324
[Erica] The hand belongs to Esther.

355
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,661
The one you helped
escape and send to your brother.

356
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,954
Remember?

357
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,541
Is Mel safe? That's all I want to know.

358
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,750
Yes!

359
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,170
But Edong killed Esther.

360
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,134
<i>You're really heaven-sent to us, Faustina.</i>

361
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,930
<i>Our work got easier when you came.</i>

362
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,809
<i>Yes, even Father's always</i>
<i>in a good mood because of you.</i>

363
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,022
<i>We should always help each other.</i>

364
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,318
<i>If you need anything, just tell me.</i>

365
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,530
[unsettling music playing]

366
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:07,701
<i>And just a reminder about</i>
<i>the payments for the pilgrimage.</i>

367
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,120
<i>- Let's keep doing the novena.</i>
<i>- Sure.</i>

368
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,122
<i>- Alright, we'll go now.</i>
- [phone chimes]

369
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,001
"YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CHURCH.

370
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,711
DO YOU THINK THE LORD IS HAPPY WITH THAT?

371
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,588
IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW,

372
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,798
GO BACK TO THE CHURCH, AND WE'LL TALK."

373
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,343
[unsettling music continues]

374
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,427
<i>Faustina?</i>

375
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,888
<i>Are you okay?</i>

376
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:28,972
<i>What happened?</i>

377
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,433
<i>Uh…</i>

378
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,730
<i>Uh, I think I left my handkerchief inside.</i>

379
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,023
<i>I'll get it.</i>

380
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,776
<i>Are you sure? We can go with you.</i>

381
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,947
<i>I don't want to take</i>
<i>time away from your kids.</i>

382
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,408
<i>I'm sure they're looking for you.</i>

383
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,078
<i>Go now. It's okay.</i>

384
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,455
<i>You even thought of that? You're so kind.</i>

385
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,248
<i>- Alright, we'll go now.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

386
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,333
<i>Take care.</i>

387
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,418
<i>She's so kind.</i>

388
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:03,548
[music becomes foreboding]

389
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:09,054
[electricity crackling]

390
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,228
<i>You're the one who texted?</i>

391
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,437
<i>Who are you?</i>

392
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,689
<i>What do you want?</i>

393
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,359
<i>You want money?</i>

394
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,694
<i>You want a cut of it?</i>

395
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,740
[foreboding music continues]

396
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,913
[gasps]

397
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,833
- [Erica] He killed someone again!
- [music fades]

398
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,669
When will he stop, Lucas?

399
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,547
How many more people need to die?

400
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,341
<i>Who are you?</i>

401
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:51,304
[foreboding music resumes]

402
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,430
<i>Edong?</i>

403
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,143
<i>I finally found you…</i>

404
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,813
<i>Esther.</i>

405
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,439
<i>How did you escape--</i>

406
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,359
<i>Stay away from me, you lunatic.</i>

407
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,443
<i>Stay away!</i>

408
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,487
- [Edong] <i>Come here.</i>
- [Esther grunts]

409
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,489
<i>Let go of me. Let go of me--</i>

410
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,492
Before you turn Esther into a saint,

411
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,911
know that she's full of lies.

412
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,708
She blamed my
brother to escape her own sin.

413
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,711
<i>- Shh.</i>
<i>- Let go of me!</i>

414
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,962
<i>Let go of me--</i>

415
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,964
[Esther breathing heavily]

416
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,507
[Esther sobbing] <i>Let go of me.</i>

417
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,010
<i>Your hand is cold.</i>

418
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,012
[whimpering] <i>Let go of me!</i>

419
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,973
<i>Because of your hands,</i>

420
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,185
<i>I was imprisoned for 14 years.</i>

421
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,603
<i>I'm…</i>

422
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,771
<i>- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>- Oh, really?</i>

423
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,816
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

424
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,401
<i>How does this feel?</i>

425
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:51,156
[Esther screaming in pain]

426
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,453
[tense music playing]

427
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,829
[bones cracking]

428
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:02,834
[screaming]

429
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,795
<i>Before you turn Esther into a saint,</i>

430
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,756
<i>know that she's full of lies.</i>

431
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,883
<i>She blamed my</i>
<i>brother to escape her own sin.</i>

432
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,760
<i>So, it's right that he killed Esther?</i>

433
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,720
<i>Just because she made a mistake,</i>
<i>she deserved to die?</i>

434
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,180
<i>You call that justice?</i>

435
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,184
<i>You're next.</i>

436
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,604
<i>Is that Anton?</i>

437
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,689
<i>- Babe!</i>
<i>- You can't drag me home, Anton.</i>

438
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,358
<i>If you do, the whole world will know</i>

439
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,984
<i>what kind of monster you are.</i>

440
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,070
<i>Let's just say I have videos.</i>
