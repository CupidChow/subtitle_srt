<i>I gave you attitude.</i>

180
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,464
<i>Oh, it's fine. I'm used to it.</i>

181

183
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,474
<i>That's just how it is here.</i>
<i>You're all the same.</i>

184
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,435

[scoffs] <i>Why not?</i>

188
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,654
<i>Because I'm sick of those kinds of people.</i>

189
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,115
<i>I don't want to turn into them. No way.</i>

198
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,934
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- Your father blamed it on me.</i>

199
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,938
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- Yeah! You know what he said?</i>

200
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,942
<i>Amurao is being punished</i>

205
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,583
<i>He blamed it on me too! </i>[laughs]

206
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,087
<i>- Did he really?</i>
<i>- You know, I have no words.</i>

207

<i>Are you proud of him or something?</i>

211
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,685

- [chuckles]

225
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,352
<i>Or a killer.</i>
<i>Who knows what he could've done?</i>

<i>Who'll be responsible? Me!</i>

227
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,481
