<i>Mommy, wake up!</i>

00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,509
<i>Please, wake up, Mommy!</i>

4
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,970
<i>What the hell happened here?</i>
<i>He's staying with me tonight.</i>

5
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,096
<i>- Give him to me!</i>
<i>- Stop it.</i>

6
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,724
<i>Alice, no! Can't you see he's terrified?!</i>

7
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,642
<i>It's causing so many rumors!</i>

8
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,061
<i>They're saying</i>
<i>Louisa's killer is still alive.</i>

9
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,022
<i>And it's the same</i>
<i>person who took your classmate.</i>

10
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,275
<i>You know, my brain just can't accept it.</i>

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,903
<i>Bianca's sister herself</i>
<i>said she was close with Liezel.</i>

12
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,740
[Ryan] <i>There are a lot of</i>
<i>reasons for someone to lie.</i>

13
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:35,160
<i>But not all of them</i>

[door rattles]

18
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,023
Stop!

19
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,241
You have to tell the police about them.

20
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,373
But would you do that?

21
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:27,670
Unless I'm sure of the truth,
I'm not going to do that!

22
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,507
What if I go to the police,
and find out I was wrong?

23
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,551
I'd be ruining Liezel's life.
I can't do that!

24
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,470
[Louisa] But
you were able to do that before.

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,347
Have you forgotten?

26
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,433
You've already
ruined someone's life before.

27
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,812
[sinister music continues]

28
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,652
Oh? Why can't you answer?

29
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,906
That was for you! I did that for you!

30
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:55,907
For me?

31
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,286
Weren't you afraid of
losing your college scholarship?

32
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,331
Isn't that what
Celestino used against you?

33
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:07,168
So you chose
the person he wanted to put in prison.

34
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,087
That wasn't about me.

35
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,173
You didn't really care about me, Beth.

36
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,510
You don't care about Bianca

37
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,595
because you only love yourself.

38
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,014
- That's not true!
- Prove it.

39
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,017
Go to the police.

40
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,938
Tell them about Angelo and his secret.

41
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:34,320
Beth, point the investigation
into my death in the right direction.

42
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,783
Even if you need
to confess that you lied about the watch.

43
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,871
That watch wasn't mine, right?

44
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,748
And not once…

45
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,419
did Edong ever touch any of my things!

46
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,837
Tell the truth!

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,214
But that was the truth I knew back then!

48
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,008
You're greedy. You're a liar!

49
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,427
- I'm not lying!
- Selfish. You're selfish!

50
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,722
You're jealous!
You just don't want to admit

51
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,390
that you don't want to tell the truth

52
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,851
because you don't
want to prove that Erica's right.

53
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,729
About Edong. About you.

54
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,314
[music intensifies]

55
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:13,776
Erica became everything
you dreamed of for yourself.

56
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,946
She's the one who's looked up to,
listened to, respected.

57
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,489
- Shut up!
- While you,

58
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,409
you're still living the life
you said you'd run away from.

59
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,287
Are you ashamed of your life, Beth?

60
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,290
- I said, shut up! [crying]
- Do you feel small?

61
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,542
What would Chloe say once she finds out

62
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,836
her mother is a big liar?!

63
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,923
Erica's already her idol.

64
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,842
What more when she finds out
what you did to Attorney?

65
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,762
Will you be ruined in her eyes?

66
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,515
Shut up! That's not true!

67
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,645
Shut up! Shut up! [sobs]

68
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,944

[music intensifies]

70
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,166
You're the fake one! Liar!

71
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,212
- Aah! [breathing heavily]
- Love, you had a nightmare.

72
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,674
Are you okay?

73
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:30,186
[theme music playing]

[crickets chirping]

75
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,510
[Annette] Isn't this your favorite?

76
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,471
Eat while it's still hot.

77
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,390
- I'm getting hungry.
- Eat with us, Annette.

78
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,517
Thanks.

[Erica]<i> Even though</i>
<i>she was a good mother to you,</i>

81
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,525

[sniffling]

83
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,782
<i>So you want me to believe that,</i>

84
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,493
<i>because your father left Mama,</i>

85
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,828
<i>she started treating you that way?</i>

86
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,999
<i>You really are still a child.</i>

87
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,629
<i>You still don't know</i>
<i>that not all mothers love their children.</i>

[melancholic music continues]

89
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,934
- I met up with Erica, Ma.
- [music fades]

90
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,022
She said she
doesn't come back here anymore

91
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,108
because that's what you wanted.

[uneasy music playing]

93
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,571
Did you really cut Erica off?

[Frank sighs deeply]

95
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,494
- [chair scraping]
- [Frank] I'll get going.

96
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,581
- [Frank breathes deeply]
- Okay.

97
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,504
- [utensils clattering]
- Ma.

98
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,005
Is that true?

99
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:09,470
I don't understand why
you keep chasing after your sister.

100
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,347
You were still young when she left.

101
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,307
You grew up without her.

102
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,935
Just leave her be!

103
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,438
[Althea] You're
saying the same thing as her.

104
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,940
But no matter what you tell me,

105
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,402
it won't change
the fact that she's still my sister.

106
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,654
[melancholic music continues]

107

[Althea inhales sharply]

108
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,616
She said you didn't
have a good relationship.

109
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,495
She said you didn't love her.

110
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,917
[breathing heavily]
But Ma, that isn't true, right?

111
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,173
Maybe she just remembered wrong.

112
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,259
Or maybe she was just too angry that time.

113
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,261
Everything she said is true.

114
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:54,015
[melancholic music continues]

115
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:02,190
You really made her feel like
she wouldn't go anywhere in life?

116
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,735
But why, Ma?

117
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,446
She's your daughter, too!

118
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,993
I can't imagine you doing this
to someone else, let alone your child.

[Althea breathing heavily]

120
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,498
You wouldn't understand.

121
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,917
Then help me understand, Ma!

122
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,252
Enough, Althea!

123
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,963
Stop trying to reach
out to that sister of yours!

124
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,674
She doesn't want to see us anymore, right?

125
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,346
She doesn't need us,
and we don't need her either.

126
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,264
So let her go!

00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,381
she just had a nightmare,
but I don't believe her, Beth.

179
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,216
<i>I know there's something wrong.</i>

180
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,135
Does she have a problem with Scott?

181
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,928
Did she mention anything?

182
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,931
Just ask her.

183
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,224
I did!

184
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,892
But she didn't answer me.

185
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,854
What's going on? Is there a problem?

186
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,397
Please tell me.

187
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,190
Umm…

188
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,735
[exhales sharply]
They're getting a divorce.

189
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,157
And they're having
problems with Seth's custody.

190
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,366
<i>What?</i>

191
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,660
Why didn't she just tell us?

192
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,954
When she came home to the Philippines,

193
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,373
she acting like
everything was fine with Scott.

194
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,334
Remember when she came back,

195
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,212
you had a viral scandal?

196
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,299
You had your own problems,

197
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,302
so she didn't want to worry you about it.

198
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,599
Mel, she also sleepwalks.

199
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,225
Sleepwalk?

200
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,436
<i>When I slept there the other night,</i>

201
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,439
I saw her crying outside her room.

202
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,940
She looked like a ghost.

203
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,318
<i>She even answered my questions.</i>

204
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,446
I thought she was awake at the time.

205
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,657
<i>Mel, I'm only telling you this</i>

206
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,951
<i>because I'm worried about Alice.</i>

207
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,288
You're there, so keep an eye on her.

208
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,748
And Scott too.

209
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,501
<i>Alice told me that she's worried</i>

210
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,794
Scott might take Seth without a warning.

211
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,591
But I feel like she's scared of Scott.

212
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,051
I think so too.

213
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,012
<i>You should come over, Beth.</i>

214
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,847
Let's talk to Alice.

215
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,558
I'll let you know, if I can drop by today.

216
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,519
I just have to take care of something.

217
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,646
It's important.

218
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:40,319
[unsettling music playing]

219
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,084
[Samuel] Praise the Lord!

220
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,796
Praise the Lord!

221
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,173
He is our Savior.

222
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,218
The one we can rely on.

223
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:08,264
The one we can truly run to for help.

224
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,518
Because He is Almighty.

225
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,896
Thanks be to the Lord!

226
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,940
Thanks be to the Lord.

227
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,276
Praise the Lord.

228
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,319
We adore You.

229
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,738
Argh! You almost broke my arms!

230
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,366
- You're too heavy!
- [laughter]

231
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,159
[Isla]<i> Your husband is there?</i>

232
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,286
Yes.

233
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,038
[panicked breaths]

234
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,207
I- I know you said that

235
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,752
I shouldn't call
you outside of our sessions, but…

236
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,838
I don't know what to do.

237
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,257
<i>I don't want him to stay here.</i>

238
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,675
<i>I wanted to say no,</i>

239
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,469
<i>but I was afraid that if I say that,</i>

240
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,054
he might take Seth.

241
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,098
He might take my son.

242
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,352
<i>Alice, I need you to do</i>
<i>the grounding technique.</i>

243
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,854
What do you see?

244
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,606
[breath quivering]

245
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,357
[stuttering] Chair.

246
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,319
[exhales heavily] <i>Table.</i>

247
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,529
[exhales heavily] <i>Window.</i>

248
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,324
[exhales slowly]

249
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,118
[Scott grunting] Let's try one more time,

250
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,537
I doubt I can carry you for long. [laughs]

251
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,830
[exhales] Seth.

252
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,124
[Scott]<i> He's staying with me tonight.</i>

253
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,375
[Alice]<i> What?</i>

254
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,920
- <i>No! No!</i>
- <i>He's staying with me, Alice.</i>

255
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,963
[Isla]<i> Alice?</i>

256
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,341
[crying] Last night,

257
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,509
I had another nightmare.

258
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,929
[breath quivering] Seth saw it.

259
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,681
<i>He was traumatized. </i>[sniffling]

260
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,768
I traumatized my son. [inhales sharply]

261
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,020
<i>Now that your husband is there,</i>

262
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,940
your trauma response might get worse.

263
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,734
<i>Do you have someone else at home?</i>

264
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,444
Um… [sniffs]

265
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,154
Aside from our helper,

266
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,531
my friend is here too.

267
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,866
<i>Okay, good.</i>

268
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,661
- Alice, I need you to--
<i>- Sorry.</i>

269
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,037
<i>Sorry, I have to go.</i>

270
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,873
<i>- I have to go.</i>
- Alice? Wait, Alice!

271
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,210
According to Joshua 24:15,

272
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,838
"But as for me and my family,

273
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,257
we will serve the Lord."

274
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,802
- Amen!
- Amen!

275
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,096
[Samuel] And with us right now

276
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,348
to give their testimonies

277
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:18,602
on how they have kept
their family intact and happy,

278
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,980
let's give a big round of applause

279
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,273
to my daughter, Liezel,

280
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,401
and my son-in-law, Angelo.

281
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,654
[congregation clapping]

282
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,870
[Angelo coughs]

283
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,789
You know…

284
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,502
Our LDR setup wasn't easy.

285
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,881
Umm… he means
long-distance relationship.

286
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,591
We know what it means.

287
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,428
[laughter]

288
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,680
You know…

289
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:59,059
I've been away from my family
for months because of work.

290
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,272
Fortunately,
Liezel and I have known each other

291
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,232
ever since we were kids.

292
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,193
We grew up together.

293
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,697
Eventually, we started dating

294
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,282
and got married.

295
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,327
Together, we served this church.

296
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,038
Our church.

297
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,501
It all prepared us for
whatever might come in our lives.

298
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,675
Over the course of our marriage,

299
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,928
we've seen how each other changed.

300
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:42,644
And yes, we do get upset
with each other and fight sometimes.

301
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,812
[both chuckle]

302
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:49,401
I'll admit, Liezel and I,
get into small fights often.

303
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,529
But despite all of it,

304
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,491
we choose to forgive each other,

305
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,825
to love each other.

306
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:02,539
That's why, as you can see,
our relationship is solid.

307
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,419
[clapping]

308
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,721
[unsettling music playing]

309
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,973
[ominous music sting]

310
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,936
[unsettling music resumes]

311
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,737
You want to get some ice cream again?

312
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,197
With Mommy?

313
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,283
Mommy just needs some rest for now, okay?

314
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,743
We can come back for her later.

315
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,411
We just need to leave Mommy for now.

316
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,913
[Alice] Hi, baby!

317
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,041
Hey. Hi.

318
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,210
- [Alice] Are you okay?
- [Seth] I'm good.

319
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,547
I'm sorry if Mommy scared you last night.

320
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,007
I just… I had a bad dream.

321
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:59,304
- Are you mad at Mommy?
- Don't scare me again, Mommy.

322
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,889
I won't, I won't.

323
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,517
I promise.

324
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,645
He wants to get ice
cream again, right, buddy?

325
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,564
Yay! Ice cream!

326
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,693
- Alright, let's go! Come on, buddy.
- Seth, time for your bath.

327
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,824
What were you telling him?

328
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,868
That you have to leave me?

329
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,704
- What? Alice, I just--
- Is that why you're here?

330
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,331
To take him away?

331
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:30,043
[morose music playing]

332
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,716
What happened last night?
Why did you act that way?

333
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,178
And what kind of nightmare
did you have to scare Seth that way?

334
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,347
And you were blocking the door?

335
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,933
The door was locked.

336
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,312
So if you weren't blocking the door
to stop someone from coming in,

337
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,606
was it to stop someone from coming out?

338
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,317
- [exhales heavily]
- [music becomes tense]

339
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,112
You know it's hard to ask questions

340
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,489
if they're not being answered, right?

341
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,784
That's what you gave
me these past months, Alice.

342
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,663
Question upon question
without any answer or clarification.

343
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,833
Why should I give
you what you can't give me?

344
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,420
[tense music continues]

345
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,381
[music fades]

346
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,342
- [man] Here they are.
- Oh! How are you guys?

347
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,553
- [Angelo] Hello.
- [man] How's your family?

348
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,639
Beth!

349
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,850
- [Liezel chuckles]
- [man chattering indistinctly]

350
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,771
You know, I was so surprised,
I almost dropped the mic.

351
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:35,192
Why? Scared your father might kick me out?

352
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,195
During the first and
last time I came here,

353
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,572
it looked like he really
did want to kick me out.

354
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,282
That's why I didn't drop by again.

355
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,118
Still, you came back.

356
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,456
I need to talk to you.

357
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,583
What about?

358
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,881
[uneasy music playing]

359
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:04,554
Liezel, you told me
that you don't know Bianca very well.

360
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:09,518
But I talked to her family.
Her sister said you and Bianca are close.

361
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,687
Uh…

362
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,356
Maybe…

363
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,235
She must be mistaken.

364
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,154
She said that you and Bianca often talked.

365
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,867
Uh… We just greeting each other.

366
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,203
Maybe she just saw us greeting each other.

367
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,832
She was a student of mine,
and we go to the same church.

368
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,458
Of course, we'll greet each other.

369
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,127
You're hiding something!

370
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,338
Liezel, we've been friends for many years.

371
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,217
I can tell when you're
hiding something from me.

372
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,969
Why are you asking these questions?

373
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,512
What are you trying to say?

374
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,557
You know something
about Bianca's disappearance!

375
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,019
If you're trying to cover
up for someone, whoever it is,

376
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,478
you have to tell the police!

377
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,646
About what?!

378
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,065
What is it that you want me to tell them?

379
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,233
[Vangie gasps]

380
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,446
[uneasy music continues]

381
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,663
I'm telling the truth! I heard it! It's--

382
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,043
Do you know?

383
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,756
You know who took my daughter?

384
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:25,010
No… I… I don't know.

385
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:29,014
But Beth said that you do.
Vangie said so too. Is it true?!

386
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,017
[uneasy music continues]

387
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,479
Tell us what you know!
Where's my daughter?

388
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,231
[crying] I'm begging you.

389
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:43,820
Tell us the truth. Don't lie anymore.

390
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,575
<i>You're the fake one. Liar!</i>

391
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,911
[Angelo] That's enough.

392
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,122
Stop, all of you!

393
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:59,127
Would God be delighted
with all your gossiping in His temple?

394
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,463
It is a sin!

395
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,092
[Vangie]
We're sorry, Pastor. We apologize.

396
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,136
[music becomes ominous]

397
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,265
[Vangie] Oh dear,
I didn't know it would start a fight.

398
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,975
I'm sorry, Pastor!

399
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,977
I just said what I heard.

400
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:22,317
[ominous music crescendos]

401
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,611
- Your favorite ice cream, son.
- [Mel] Hey, Scott!

402
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,987
Seth! Wait up!

403
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,117
We want ice cream too. Right, Alice?

404
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,912
- Mm-hmm!
- Yay!

405
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,330
We're all getting ice cream!

406
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,624
- We're all getting ice cream!
- [Mel chuckles] Right?

407
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:42,170
What's your favorite flavor?
Mine is mint chocolate chip!

408
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:48,802
Mint? Eww! That tastes like toothpaste!

409
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,929
- Auntie Mel!
- [chuckles] You're so silly!

410
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,639
It's because you don't
like brushing your teeth!

411
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,224
[chuckling]

412
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,059
Let's go, buddy? Come on!

413
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,646
We're gonna wait for
the rain to let up first, okay?

414
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,022
Or you might get sick.

415
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,399
[whispers] Thank you.

416
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,360
[unsettling music playing]

417
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,487
What's going on, Liezel?!

418
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,823
What is that woman talking about?!

419
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,160
How disgraceful!
You just had to do it inside my church!

420
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,078
What kind of mess
did you get yourself into?!

421
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,497
I don't know either, Pa.

422
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,041
I have no idea what she's talking about.

423
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,797
Liezel, I'm really sorry.

424
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,966
I didn't know it would lead to this.

425
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,219
You! I told my daughter
to stay away from you long ago!

426
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,554
You really have no--

427
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,556
[music becomes sinister]

428
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,683
What exactly did you tell them,

429
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,728
for them to treat Liezel like this?

430
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,772
[sinister music continues]

431
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,482
You need to leave.

432
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,945
Angelo, wait.

433
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,326
Leave!

434
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,829
[sinister music intensifies]

435
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,334
[knife scraping]

436
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:08,840
- [sinister music continues]
- [scraping continues]

437
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,931
<i>He ties me up at night.</i>

438
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,976
<i>He can't deny</i>
<i>it because I remember it all!</i>

439
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,854
<i>- That's enough, that's enough!</i>
<i>- I remember it all!</i>

440
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,065
<i>We could've protected our friend!</i>

441
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,816
<i>That bastard, Scott!</i>

442
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,610
<i>She's dying to always be right,</i>

443
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,612
<i>even if it ruins her friend's reputation!</i>

444
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,199
<i>People in Amurao are</i>
<i>gossiping about you because of her!</i>

445
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,618
<i>She didn't mean to hurt me.</i>

446
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,870
<i>- I know Beth!</i>
<i>- But she doesn't know me.</i>

447
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,455
<i>She doesn't know what I'm capable of.</i>
