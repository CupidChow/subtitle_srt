<i>If you'll be together after high school,</i>

178
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,394
<i>I will give you my blessing.</i>

179
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,360
[Angelo] Every day,

180
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,363
I waited for
everything to come crashing down.

181
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:46,784
[somber music playing]

182
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,874
[young Angelo] <i>Partner!</i>

183
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,678
[young Liezel] <i>Ah, we have to go.</i>
<i>We're going on a date.</i>

184
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,348
<i>Also, we're official now.</i>

185
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,684
<i>Papa knows about our relationship.</i>

186
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:16,021
[somber music continues]

187
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,571
- [music fades]
- [cicadas chirping]

188
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:31,954
[melancholic music playing]

189
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,797
[young Liezel sniffles]

190
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,551
<i>Didn't your father say</i>
<i>we have to wait after our graduation?</i>

191
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,471
<i>He said it's fine.</i>

192
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,516
<i>And he's not sending me to Bicol anymore.</i>

193
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,476
<i>We'll attend</i>
<i>our graduation together, partner.</i>

194
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,439
[Angelo] I had so
many questions that night.

195
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,317
"Why aren't you leaving anymore?"

196
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,612
"Why did your father
approve of our relationship so fast?"

197
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,364
"How come you were smiling,

198
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,075
yet your eyes looked so sad?"

199
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,161
"Did you and Louisa get into a fight?"

200
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,830
<i>That's awesome, Romeo!</i>

201
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,873
<i>Whoo!</i>

202
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,833
<i>What is this? A free show?</i>

203
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,462
[melancholic music continues]

204
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,548
[Angelo] "What's wrong if
we saw Louisa kissing someone?"

205
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,259
"So what if you got into fight?"

206
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,347
You'd still love her and not me, anyway.

207
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,976
[melancholic music continues]

208
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,233
<i>Let's go to Boardwalk.</i>

209
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,318
[sniffles]

210
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:57,915
[music becomes unsettling]

211
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:58,999
<i>Partner…</i>

212
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,127
<i>Hey.</i>

213
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,631
<i>Do you love me?</i>

214
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,385
<i>You're asking me?</i>

215
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,887
<i>Where is that coming from?</i>

216
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,557
<i>And what kind of question is that?</i>

217
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,061
<i>We've been friends since we were young.</i>

218
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,772
<i>We're "partners", remember?</i>

219
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,694
<i>It's not about the years, is it?</i>

220
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,655
[morose music playing]

221
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,701
<i>You can love anyone,</i>
<i>even someone you just met.</i>

222
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,704
<i>You can have feelings for them,</i>

223
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,082
<i>and it can be greater than</i>
<i>what you feel for someone…</i>

224
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,961
<i>you've known your whole life.</i>

225
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,550
<i>Liezel, ever since we were kids…</i>

226
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,261
[sniffles]

227
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,597
<i>I knew that you're</i>
<i>the one I want to be with forever.</i>

228
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,561
<i>Do you feel the same way?</i>

229
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,232
<i>Yes.</i>

230
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:10,112
[morose music continues]

231
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,742
[sniffles, sobs]

232
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,872
<i>I thought I'll be fine by lying to myself.</i>

233
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,793
<i>W-What are you talking about?</i>

234
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,048
<i>Angelo…</i>

235
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,428
<i>Angelo!</i>

236
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,723
<i>Where are you going?</i>

237
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,768
[music becomes unsettling]

238
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,977
[Angelo] I went home.

239
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,104
<i>Partner!</i>

240
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,150
[Angelo] I didn't
want to dwell on that night.

241
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,779
I wanted to sleep it off.

242
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,491
I would be fine when I wake up.

243
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,160
But I couldn't.

244
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,497
I felt like bursting.

245
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,167
Why did you kill her?

246
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,923
[unsettling music continues, fades]

247
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,466
I didn't leave.

248
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,511
I didn't leave you.

249
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,263
I told you that I'm choosing you!

250
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,350
You didn't have to kill her!

251
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:27,231
[unsettling music continues]

252
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,025
Partner, I saw you kill Louisa!

253
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:35,239
[ominous music playing]

254
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:56,093
[ominous music continues]

255
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,473
[sobs]

256

[ominous music continues]

257
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:21,451
[music becomes suspenseful]

258
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:45,225
[suspenseful music continues]

259
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,772
[Liezel] You killed the person I love!

260
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,024
<i>Aah!</i>

261
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:57,571
[sinister music playing]

262
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:18,550
<i>I'm Bianca Seropon, the missing student.</i>

263
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,928
<i>Miss Liezel is innocent.</i>

264
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,555
<i>She was just trying to protect me.</i>

265
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,392
[Mel] <i>I can't believe Louisa</i>
<i>had a secret life we knew nothing about.</i>

266
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,062
<i>Why didn't she tell us?</i>
<i>We could've helped her.</i>

267
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,647
<i>She chose to protect Liezel.</i>

268
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,275
<i>Who were you protecting</i>
<i>when you hid your suspicions, Beth?</i>

269
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,653
<i>If you had told me sooner,</i>
<i>I could've helped you!</i>

270
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,238
<i>This wouldn't have happened!</i>

271
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,657
<i>- You're such a smartass!</i>
<i>- Isn't that what you are?</i>
