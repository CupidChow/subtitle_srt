I've already filed a Court

And I told them to act on it immediately.

109

That's permissible under
section 6 of rule 102 due to the urgency.

- What did PBI say?
- They'll open the case.

They've been interested in
Laurence Kyo for a long time.

Because of drugs.

113
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,770
But they couldn't go after him

114
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,397
because he has a lot of connections.

115
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,150
But if we prove
that he has something to do

116
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,778

that will break his protection.

Are you going to punish her for that, too?

179
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,303
[young Erica] <i>My father left you.</i>

180
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,098
<i>Blame him, not me.</i>

181
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,851
<i>Why would you punish me, too?</i>

182
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,770
[Annette] <i>You look just like him.</i>

183
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,482
[somber music continues]

184
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,068
Do you know why I like working with you?

185
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,697
Because your life, is your business.

186
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,407
And my life is my own.

187
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,325
It's none of your concern.

188
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:29,665
[somber music continues]

189
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,250
It's sad to be alone.

190
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,712
Don't you feel lonely?

191
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,589
I'm used to it.

192
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,760
No one gets used to loneliness.

193
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,346
People who say that

194
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,391
aren't telling the truth.

195
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:57,860
[music becomes sullen]

196
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,042
[exhales heavily]

197
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,634
[music becomes uneasy]

198
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,447
[uneasy music continues]

199
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,074
- [flashlight clicks open]
- [Ryan squeals]

200
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,202
Chloe! What are you doing?

201
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,539
You'll give me a heart attack!

202
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,499
Why are you still awake?

203
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,458
Pa…

204
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,963
Why does Mama think Aunt Liezel
is involved with Bianca's disappearance?

205
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,966
Chloe, people just
made up stories about it.

206
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,467
It's all just gossip.

207
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,220
But Joshua's anger is real.

208
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,846
He won't talk to me, either.

209
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,474
- [sighs]
- So…

210
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,226
Did something happen?

211
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,604
Pa…

212
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,398
You know something, don't you?

213
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,150
You just won't tell me.

214
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,946
It's so hard living with
two investigative journalists.

215
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,698
Pa.

216
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,157
Chloe.

217
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,995
Let the adults deal
with the problem, okay?

218
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,455
But how will I fix things with Joshua?

219
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,042
[sighs] I don't even know the truth.

220
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,378
Chloe.

221
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,590
Can't you act like a kid for once?

222
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,175
There are other things to think about.

223
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,719
Think about your crush.

224
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,930
Wait, not that.

225
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,434
Come on, go to bed. You have school later.

226
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,229
And next time, turn on the lights.

227
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,939
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

228
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,275
- [huffs]
- [inaudible mumbling]

229
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:08,866

[crickets chirping]

232
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:10,511
[tense music playing]

233
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:35,244
[tense music continues]

234
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,059
- [leaves rustling]
- [music fades]

235
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:08,110
[unsettling music playing]

236
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,970
[unsettling music continues]

237
00:17:54,698 --> 00:18:00,370
[music becomes foreboding]

238

239
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,975
[latch clicks]

240

[knives clinking]

241
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,778
[case closes]

242
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,869
[sinister music sting]

243
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:50,504
[foreboding music resumes]

00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,316
- [knives whooshing]
- [gasps]

246
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,945
[suspenseful music sting]

247
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:27,833
[suspenseful music playing]

248
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:47,352

00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,533
[ominous music playing]

251
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,671
[ticking]

252
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,966
[ominous music continues]

253
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,302
- [knife whooshes]
- [heartbeat thumping]

254
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,388
- [clock ticks]
- [knife whooshes]

255
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,099

- [clock ticks]

257

[heartbeat thumping]

258
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,565
- [birds chirping]
- [music fades]

259
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:38,195
[flapping, chirping]

260
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,992
[leaves scraping]

[birds chirping, flapping]

262
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,255
You don't think I'm
that kind of person, do you?

263
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,634
Like what Alice said?
It wasn't you, right?

264
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,137
The Louisa in my dream.

265
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,059
Aren't we the same, Louisa?

266
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:15,232
We do what needs
to be done even if it's hard.

267
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,945
[wind blowing]

268
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:24,700

[uneasy music playing]

273
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:10,787
Oh! [chuckles nervously]
Eat some more. Here you go.

274
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,331
Finish it, alright?

275
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,006
[uneasy music continues]

276
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,467
Ma, are you okay?

277
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,595
[chuckles softly] Of course!

278
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,973
Where's Papa?

279
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,685
Uhh…

280
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,729
He left early.

281
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,065
He just went somewhere.

282
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,234
Go on. Dig in.

283
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:51,620
[foreboding music playing]

284
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:10,347

[footsteps approaching]

286
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:44,506
- [ominous music continues]
- [footsteps approaching]

287
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,391
[music fades]

288
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,269
[thuds]

289
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,522
<i>Mrs. Mora, did you recognize</i>
<i>the person who did this to you?</i>

290
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,233
<i>I only saw that they were</i>
<i>wearing black rubber shoes.</i>

291
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,027
<i>Who would do this?</i>
<i>Who holds a grudge against you?</i>

292
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,737
<i>The list is very long.</i>

293
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,532
<i>You don't think Scott</i>
<i>did this to you, do you?</i>

294
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,075
<i>You were kind of hard on him last time.</i>

295
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,911
<i>- Scott?</i>
<i>- If your speculations are right about him</i>

296
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,497
<i>then most probably</i>
<i>he's capable of doing this too.</i>

297
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,375
<i>Angelo, come out!</i>
<i>Were you the one who beat my wife up?!</i>

298
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,587
<i>Why are you accusing him of</i>
<i>attacking you without any proof?</i>

299
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,047
<i>You have your suspicions</i>
<i>about your husband, too.</i>
