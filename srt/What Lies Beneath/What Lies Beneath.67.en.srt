1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,711
<i>- Ayoc is dead.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:03,837
<i>Someone broke into his house.</i>

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,171
<i>Was he alone when it happened?</i>

4
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,090
<i>He was with his wife and kids.</i>

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,095
<i>Everything that Oslo does</i>

6
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,264
<i>is connected to his boss' drug business.</i>

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,933
<i>I haven't figured out where</i>
<i>the evidence is actually hidden.</i>

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>The media has exposed his boss' connection</i>
<i>to the missing beauty queens,</i>

9
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,649
<i>I was saved because</i>
<i>I still need to finish my mission.</i>

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,401
<i>And I'm the only one who can do it.</i>

11
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,070
[inhales deeply, screams]

12
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,114

- [glass shattering]

00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:35,827
[wailing, crying] <i>Ma!</i>

[Edong whimpers]

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,627
[crying] Ma!

00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,215
[dramatic music playing]

17
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,967

18
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,764
[whimpers]

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,605
[crying]

20
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:08,151
[dramatic music continues]

21
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:17,368
- [music becomes sinister]
- [heart beating]

23
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,656
[students laughing, squealing]

24
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,117
Hey! Hey! Hey!
No horsing around in the hallways!

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,910
Sorry, ma'am! Sorry, ma'am!

26
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,245
Such flirts!

27
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,706
Like you never went through that yourself.

28
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,332
Wow! Coming from you?

29
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,793
But when am I going
to see you and Angelo like that again?

30
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,878
[chuckles softly]

31
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:56,009
[morose music plays]

32
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,304
- [chuckles softly]
- Wow. Gossip here, gossip there.

33
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,555
My god.

34
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,473
Looks like you'll be trending for a while.

35
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,851
Just ignore it. Don't mind them.

36
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:08,021
Oh wow! You're so strong now, huh?

37
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,148
Finally, you've rubbed off on me.

38
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,651
So this is what it feels
like to be Elizabeth Mora.

39
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,655
Being an open book but
not caring about what others say.

40
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,115
[chuckles]

41
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,410
That's how it should be.
Those people don't put food on our table.

42
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,494
[chuckles]

43
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,538
[Angelo] <i>Bro.</i>

44
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,209
Uh…

45
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,507
Bro.

46
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,428
I just want to apologize to you.

47
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,597
For everything.

48
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,893
I tried calling and texting you, but…

49
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,479
[birds chirping]

50
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,356
I honestly don't know what to say.

51
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,984
If you can't let this go,

52
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,486
I'll accept that.

53
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,406
But that's really not
what I want to happen.

54
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,201
[gentle music playing]

55
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,160
Bro…

56
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,704
Liezel thought the same,

57
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,998
but I still forgave her.

58
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,125
[chuckles lightly]

59
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,836
I'd rather be the bigger man.

60
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,880
That's what you call it, right?

61
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,216
[both chuckle softly]

62
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,386
[Ryan] You know what?
Your vocabulary is improving.

63
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,221
What movie did you even hear that from?

64
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,556
[laughs slightly]
From an English movie, bro.

65
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,601
Don't watch it,
you might not understand it.

66
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,270
- You're so silly.
- [laughs]

67
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,108
Negative. Oslo's not on the list.

68
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,153
Like I said, he's loyal to his boxing gym.

69
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,572
He wouldn't work out here.

70
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,325
And you said
he wouldn't have done deliveries.

71
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,663
You know, I could
check the lockers one by one.

72
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,622
Wait, dude!

73
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,708
I found it.

74
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:56,504
[thrilling music playing]

75
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,588
[huffs]

76
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,424
[Lucas] "Manny Peñalosa"?

77
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,176
[Steve] A combination
of his boxing idols' names.

78
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,762
He brags about them when he's drunk.

79
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,597
That's him, dude.

80
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,600
[metal door clangs]

81
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,438

[thrilling music continues]

86
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,273
Attorney,
I've been saying it over and over.

87
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,650
What part do you not understand?

88
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,987
There's nothing in the report
or any description

89
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,406
of the suspect who killed Ayoc.

90
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,076
Didn't his wife and kids
get a good look at the killer?

91
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:12,246
How could they when Mrs.
Ayoc said the killer wore a mask?

92
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,418
[unsettling music playing]

93
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,796
- <i>Please have mercy.</i>
- [boys crying]

94
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,173
<i>Please spare my children.</i>

95
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,759
<i>They're innocent. Leave them out of this.</i>

96
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,427
<i>Just kill me instead.</i>

97
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,471
<i>Kill me instead! Kill me!</i>

98
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,765
<i>Just kill me!</i>

99
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,183
<i>Stop this!</i>

100
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,603
<i>Please-- </i>[screams]

101
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,439
[unsettling music continues]

102
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,941
[young Edong crying] <i>Ma!</i>

103
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,192
[Edong] <i>Shut up…</i>

104
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,737
- <i>They're innocent.</i>
- [whimpering continues]

105
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,240
<i>Please leave them out of this.</i>

106
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,992
[gasps] <i>Shut up.</i>

107
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,080
<i>- I'm begging you!</i>
- [boys sobbing]

108
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,249
- [Mrs. Ayoc] <i>Have mercy.</i>
- <i>I said…</i>

109
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,043
[sobbing continues]

110
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,129
<i>…shut up!</i>

111
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,797
<i>- Ahh!</i>
- [tense sting]

112
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,593

- [Mrs. Ayoc] <i>Shh… Shh…</i>

115
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:20,523
[unsettling music continues]

116
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,774
[boy whimpers]

117
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,693
<i>When the police ask you…</i>

118
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,361
[breath quivering] <i>What?</i>

119
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:30,867
<i>…tell them you don't</i>
<i>know who killed your husband.</i>

120
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,787
[boys sobbing softly]

121
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,872
<i>Is that clear?</i>

122
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,960
- [sobs grow louder]
- <i>Is that clear?!</i>

123
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,880
<i>Yes. I- I didn't see you.</i>

124
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,548
<i>We didn't see you.</i>

125
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,843
[boys continue sobbing]

126
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,220
[Erica] Are you sure
she's telling the truth?

127
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,056
We know how to do our job.

128
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,100
Hey, buddy, we're just asking.

129
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,770
And I've answered you again
and again, but you're not listening.

130
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,022
Like you know better than the witness.

131
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,065
Edong Santiago is the killer.

132
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,443
- [tense music plays]
- The one who escaped from Bagumbayan?

133
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,070
His escape brought to light
the involvement of the wardens

134
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,739
in the prison drug trade.

135
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,116
What if they're racing to kill each other?

136
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,076
Ayoc was just the unlucky one?

137
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,662
That's some intense drama, Attorney.

138
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,998
What, a ghost killed Ayoc?

139
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,334
Everyone knows Santiago is dead.

140
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,961
That's why those
San Dimas cops got promoted.

141
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,255
They've been
searching for the body for days.

142
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,924
Did they find even a fingernail?

143
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,928
I'm telling you, Edong Santiago is alive.

144
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,515
Come on, guys.
Let's go see our badass batchmate.

145
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,309
What trouble have you gotten into now?

146
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,937
Geez, trouble?
Can't we come by just to ask something?

147
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,359
Um, do you still have records and reports
of the disappearance cases from 1999?

148
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,070
May 25, 1999, to be exact.

149
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,488
Why? Who went missing?

150
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,158
It was me.

151
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,995
I was five when it happened.

152
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,291
I just want to know
the details of my disappearance.

153
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,793
Is that possible?

154
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,546
1999?

155
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:11,175
Files from 1999 weren't
encoded in our database.

156
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,593
[clicks tongue] Wait.

157
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,682
1999…

158
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,934
Thank you for coming with me.

159
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,520
You know how to thank me.

160
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,688
- [Alice chuckles]
- You too.

161
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,900
[sighs] Fine. We already
agreed to give a career talk, remember?

162
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,861
- And you're going to crush it, right?
- Yes, of course.

163
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:31,946
[chuckles softly]

164
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,698
[telephone rings distantly]

165
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,491
- There it is.
- Here.

166
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,451
It says here that…

167
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,830
- at 9:50 in the morning…
- [exhales heavily]

168
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,041
you were with your mom at
the market when you disappeared.

169
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:50,006
At 7:30PM, you were spotted
crying in a vacant lot in Lunaran.

170
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,174
[Alice] Uh…

171
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,845
That's roughly 10 hours.
Is that all that's stated there?

172
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,931
"Found with very
minor scratches on the wrist.

173
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,683
No signs of foul play.

174
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,519
No request for further
investigation." That's all.

175
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,687
That's the whole entry.

176
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,606
Let me see.

177
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,150
Hey, this is an official record.

178
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,027
If you want to see it, file a request.

179
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,779
Come on, you sound like we're strangers.

180
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,864
File a request?

181
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,117
That's a waste of paper and trees.
Do you even have flood control measures?

182
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,454
[huffs]

183
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,247
[tense music playing]

184
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,915
- [muffled whimper]
- [man grunts]

185
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,126
- [woman whimpering]
- [man grunts]

186

- [muffled] <i>Please don't!</i>
- [gun cocks]

187

188
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,256
[gasps]

189
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,299
Fuck.

190
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:37,970
[tense music continues]

191
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,810
[Steve whispers] Fuck.

192
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,771
Two beauty queen's down.

193
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,318
[tense music swells]

194
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,111
<i>Hurry! Put her inside!</i>

195
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,239
Smile! You're on camera, asshole!

196
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,744
[tense music continues]

197
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,037
<i>Pour it in.</i>

198
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,749
[tense music continues]

199
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,875
<i>Hurry up.</i>

200
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,836
[cement pouring]

201
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,881
[tense music continues]

202
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,596
[music fades]

203
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,557
I'm sure Ayoc's wife
is just too scared to talk.

204
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,102
I can't blame her.

205
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,854
She has children to protect.

206
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,690
But if we can't prove that Edong is alive,

207
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,651
the police won't do anything.

208
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,862
We won't be able to protect
who we need to protect from him.

209
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,739
That's not your fault.

210
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,410
[solemn music playing]

211
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,120
Erica, what happened to Ayoc…

212
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,539
To his wife and kids…

213
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,874
That wasn't your fault.

214
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,088
[breathes deeply]

215
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,925
Aren't we the reason for his killings?

216
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:04,223
[solemn music continues]

217
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,357
It's his decision to kill,
no matter the reason.

218
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,235
It's blood on his hands, not yours.

219
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,906
You're being too hard on yourself.

220
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,284
Just stop it?

221
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:29,165
[solemn music continues]

222
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,916
- [exhales deeply]
- [music fades]

223
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,713
We can talk to Mrs. Ayoc's mother.

224
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,632
But Ayoc's family's
under police protection now.

225
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,343
Even relatives won't
be able to get near them easily.

226
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,139
[uneasy music playing]

227
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,767
I knew Dad's capable of a lot,
but seeing it myself?

228
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,603
He wasn't in the videos.

229
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,229
But Oslo was there.

230
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,900
That's enough to trigger an investigation.

231
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,860
They should do everything they can,

232
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,112
until Oslo has no
choice but to point to Dad.

233
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,200
What's your plan?

234
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,329
I'll turn this over to the police.

235
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,789
- Y-You can't do that.
- [sighs]

236
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,459
[uneasy music continues]

237
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,710
I'll do it.

238
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,505
You'll only get involved.

239
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,465
And you won't?

240
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,676
[music fades]

241
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,429
Maybe…

242
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,892
Maybe this is…

243
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,102
[inhales deeply]

244
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,772
…how I pay for everything I've done.

245
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,440
Pay for what?

246
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,859
You were just trapped in this shithole!

247
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,487
You've always wanted to leave.

248
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,822
[unsettling music playing]

249
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,742

<i>You're talking to that investor?</i>

00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,327
- [blow lands]
<i>- Ugh!</i>

251
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,912
<i>Are you planning to quit?</i>

252
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,497
- [grunts]
- [blow lands]

253
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,707
<i>You already sold your soul to me,</i>

254
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,378
<i>so I own you for as long as I want.</i>

255
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:01,840
[unsettling music continues]

256
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,052
[Laurence] <i>Do you see him?</i>

257
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,472
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

258
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,725
<i>Make it clean,</i>

259
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,062
<i>but also make sure he feels it.</i>

260
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,606
<i>Once everyone's asleep, boss.</i>

261
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,609
<i>Leave my brother alone.</i>

262
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,194
<i>Don't hurt my brother!</i>

263
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,946
<i>Don't ever lay a finger on him!</i>

264
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,322
<i>Don't!</i>

265
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,617
- [Steve] I escaped.
- [music fades]

266
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,411
I went abroad.

267
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,454
But you…

268
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,748
You stayed here.

269
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,419
It's my fault you got
dragged into all of this.

270
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,798
That's why I'll find a way to get you out.

271
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,843
[sniffles] You and your brother…

272
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,762
You're both the same.

273
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,265
You've been imprisoned for so long, too.

274
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,311
Not just by Dad, but also by your brother.

275
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,645
[breath quivering, sniffles]

276
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,774
I never saw you get
the chance to live for yourself.

277
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,569
[melancholic music playing]

278
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,279
Everything you do,

279
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,323
every decision you've made,

280
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,366
was for your brother.

281
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:14,163
To help him,
to prepare him for the life outside.

282
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,540
To set him free.

283
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,751
Even if it cost you…

284
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:20,961
this.

285
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,505
[Steve sniffles]

286
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,051
But I hope that when
all of this is finally over,

287
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,470
now that your brother is gone,

288
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,848
and Dad's finally out of the picture,

289
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,479
you can finally live for yourself.

290
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,816

00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,613
[private investigator] <i>You're right, sir.</i>

293
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,158
<i>Your wife has known</i>
<i>Lucas Santiago since they were kids.</i>

294
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,661
<i>They were both born and raised in Amurao.</i>

295
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,662
[breathes deeply]

296
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,955
What else?

297
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,499
<i>You wanted to know if</i>
<i>they met in the past two weeks?</i>

298
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,960
They did, right?

299
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,169
Negative, sir.

300
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,213
No confirmed information about this.

301
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,339
[huffs]

302
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,715
Are you sure?

303
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,678
<i>They last saw each other</i>
<i>at the opening of Lucas's gym, in Amurao.</i>

304
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,472
<i>But your wife was there with her friends.</i>

305
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,100
Do you really expect me to believe that?

306
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,559
- [tense music playing]
- [exhales]

307
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,854
It only means they're slipping past you.

308
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,022
I told you,

309
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,358
Mel went to that man's condo.

310
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,276
<i>I can't confirm that information</i>

311
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,277
right now.

312
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,613
What? Why?

313
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,157
<i>Even the poor</i>
<i>neighborhoods have CCTV cameras now.</i>

314
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,993
I already spoke with the admin.

315
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,621
They said all CCTV footage
is automatically erased every week.

316
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,706
- [grunting]
- [thud]

317
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,666
Shit!

- [tense music continues]
- [breathing sharply]

319
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,336
Then try something else!

320
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,963
There are plenty of ways!

321
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,048
I'm not going to tell
you how to do your freakin job!

322
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,009
I didn't get anything new from you.

323
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,845
Of course I know they knew each other.

324
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,973
I found that out after
I saw that asshole spiraling on TV

325
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,599
when his criminal brother died.

326
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,352
But why did it seem like nothing to Mel?

327
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,523
Like they were barely acquaintances.

328
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,066
[tense music continues]

329
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,027
Something's not adding up here.

330
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,362
Find out.

Gosh, what a mess.

335
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,377
Mel, I'm sorry.
I told you we shouldn't have come here.

336
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,795
It's so cramped and messy.

337
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,839
Come on, Beth. It's fine!

338
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,799
But you know what's weird?

339
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,843
With everything that's happened to us,

340
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,887
this is the first time
we've been able to come here.

341
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,472
[chuckles awkwardly] You're right.

342
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,017
But we really should've
just gone to Alice's place.

343
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,435
Where is she anyway?

344
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,896
She's in the car, talking to Miss Susan.

345
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,565
- It's just crazy here.
- Hey! Welcome to our palace!

346
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,649
Hi, Ryan.

347
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,901
- Hi, Mel.
- [Mel gasps]

348
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,486
- Hi, Chloe!
- Hi, Miss Mel!

349
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,989
- Come on, sit down.
- [Mel giggling]

350
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,407
- Hi!
- Sweetheart, let her sit.

351
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,659
- Let me help you with that.
- Oh, thank you!

352
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,744
- Please sit.
- So sweet.

353
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,120
- [both giggle]
- She really is.

354
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,205
Chloe, give me a hand.

355
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,581
- Let's clean this up.
- Oh, wow.

356
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,333
Beth, can you believe it?

357
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,710
We were Chloe's age when MABEL was formed.

358
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,339
Yeah, and she inherited
her mother's brains, beauty, and courage.

359
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,508
- And of course…
- Her father's mischief.

360
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,425
- My goodness.
- True.

361
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,928
Mel, sorry about our house.
It's such a mess.

362
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,138
- And it's so hot. Sorry again.
- Don't be.

363
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,099
Yeah, Mel. The place is a mess,

364
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,476
but admit it-- It feels welcoming.

365
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,560
- [Beth scoffs]
- [Ryan] Hmm?

366
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,812
- [chuckles] Welcoming?
- That's true.

367
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,939
- You're actually proud of that?
- [laughter]

368
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,316
Guys, look. I got you toasted steamed bun

369
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,859
from my favorite restaurant.

370
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,152
Grab one, Chloe.

371
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,987
- Thank you, miss.
- [Mel giggles]

372
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,490
[mellow music playing]

373
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,658
[Ryan] I'll get you a plate.

374
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,660
Where do we keep them again?

375
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,328
[Erica] Uh, excuse me?

376
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,997
Uh, good evening.

377
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,333
I'm Atty. Erica Melendez.

378
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,002
You're the mother of Evelyn Ayoc, right?

379
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,088
I won't talk to you

380
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,508
or to anyone involved
with my son-in-law's death.

381
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,426
Wait, hold on.

382
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,596
I didn't come here to cause trouble.

383
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,681
[woman sighs]

384
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,225
But if you're able to speak with Evelyn,

385
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,103
maybe you could ask
her if it was Edong Santiago

386
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,980
that she saw kill her husband.

387
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,565
[morose music playing]

388
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,859
I won't disclose to anyone what she says.

389
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,570
Ma'am, wait.

390
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,779
Ma'am.

391
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,656
Ma'am, please. Hold on a second.

392
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,740
[gate handle clanks]

393
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,825
Ma'am.

394
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,910
[music fades]

395
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,954
Ten hours.

396
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,875
A lot can happen in that time, right?

397
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,590
But if you were kidnapped,

398
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,593
why would they let you go after ten hours?

399
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,470
[uneasy music playing]

400
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,681
We're not sure if they sent her back.

401
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,269
Maybe she escaped, that's why
they found her in that vacant lot.

402
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,731
The odd thing is,

403
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,816
the report says

404
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,610
when you were returned,

405
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,320
you didn't have any injuries.

406
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,363
Just a few scratches.

407
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,034
But do you guys
really think that they did it right?

408
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,703
I don't know. I mean--

409
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,582
If they mishandled
your psychological diagnosis, then…

410
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,335
they could also do
that with your physical, right?

411
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:15,547
[uneasy music continues]

412
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,679
Hey, don't let your mind wander too much.

413
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,307
We don't know the real story yet.

414
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:38,111
[uneasy music continues]

415
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,405
[Steve] <i>Dude,</i>
<i>I know you don't want to hear this,</i>

416
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,409
<i>but we can turn over</i>

417
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,411
<i>She's already conducting an investigation</i>

418
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,665

419
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,918

420
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,044
<i>And you too.</i>

421
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,381
<i>Then give it to her anonymously.</i>

422
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,134
<i>That's the best way to do this.</i>

423
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,720
<i>If we get involved,</i>

424
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,806

<i>She won't give up on</i>

429

I know I told Alice to just stay calm.

434

But damn, what really happened?

[Mel sighs]

436
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,687
Do you think it was physical abuse?

Huh?

438
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,775
If that's the case, then the suspect
could've long disappeared by now.

Amurao…

00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,991
Just full of murderers,
thieves, and abusers.

442
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,701
They never stop coming.

443
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,203
Hey! Stop saying that.

444
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,913
You did good here.

445
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,166
What? [chuckles awkwardly]

446
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,043
Is it really good living in a house

447
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,211
that's full of holes and falling apart?

[morose music continues]

00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,427
Who needs a big house, Beth?

450
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,555
Just look at what
you and Ryan and Chloe have.

451
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,349
I bet you're proud and happy.

452

Mel…

00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,778
The thing that came
out on social media saying

454
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,529
you don't want to have kids…

455
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,531
That's not true, right?

No.

It's not true.

But--

[clicks tongue]

Excuse me.

You got a package.

[suspenseful music playing]

468
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,189
"FOR THE MISSING ONES"

Who's this from?

00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,027
Uh, Attorney,
it was left at the guardhouse.

They're in Erica's office.

Let's see how far she can go with them.

<i>We have a copy of the files.</i>

478
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:49,553

they're in Atty. Melendez's hands,

<i>we'll still find a way.</i>

480
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,348
What I told you-- Take it seriously.

Leave before the evidence blows up.

482
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,647
I'm certain your father will find out
that we're behind all of this.

<i>What about you?</i>

484
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,483
He's going to kill you.

485
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,527
Look.

486
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,362
You can come with me.

487
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,323
<i>Just return once everything calms down.</i>

488
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,742
Look for Edong's body later.

[Steve] <i>At least you're safe.</i>

490
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,455
So what? Backpack tour in Europe?

491

[Steve] <i>Why not?</i>

492
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,751
We've been talking about it since college.

<i>to break free from your dad forever</i>.

You're finally making your own decisions.

you'll do what's right for you, okay?

507

[chuckles softly] Shit, dude.

508
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,005
We'll cry about this once
we're in Paris and Amsterdam.

509
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,841
Seriously, start packing.

510
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,845
I'm at Le Ciel now, on my way to see Dad.

- Yeah, dude.

<i>Alright. Be careful.</i>

513
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,729
After that, buy
your ticket and leave. I'll follow you.

Did you leave this here? What's in this?!

Why are you even asking?!

519
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,079
You have it, take a look!
Don't drag me into this!

And you won't even stay?

Only selected staff are here.

530
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,528
The bodyguards are
outside so we won't be disturbed.

We're going to celebrate her.

532
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,035
[tense music playing]

533
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,790
Every year,
you make a big deal out of this day.

534
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,628
Like Mom wasn't beaten half
to death by you when she was alive.

535
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,340
She practically lived in
the hospital because of you.

536
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,134
Shut up!

537
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,263
I loved your mother.

538
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:45,061
And that kind of love? It kills.

539
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,606
Right, Dad?

540
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,901
[tense music continues]

541
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,965
[tense music continues]

542
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,134
What's this?

543
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,386
- [knife swooshes]
- [Laurence gasps

544
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,057
[labored breathing] Ahh… Ah…

545
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,183
[groans in pain]

546
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,269
[panicked breaths]

547
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,068
<i>Don't walk the path of the wicked.</i>

548
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,277
[Oslo] <i>Find Lucas.</i>

549
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,197
<i>If we have him,</i>
<i>we can lure his brother out of hiding.</i>

550
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,949
<i>Steve, I'll just call you later.</i>

551
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,204
<i>Edong? You're alive?!</i>

552
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,498
<i>I was saved so I could save you.</i>

553
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,666
<i>You shouldn't surround</i>
<i>yourself with these people.</i>

554
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,835
<i>I'll keep you away from her.</i>

555
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,546
<i>- I'll help you.</i>
<i>- Edong, what's happening?!</i>

556
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,756
<i>Edong?!</i>

557
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,216
[Mel screaming] <i>Ah! Aah!</i>

558
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,342
[Lucas] <i>Edong!</i>
