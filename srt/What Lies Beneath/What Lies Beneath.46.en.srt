Why do you always
look at me like that, Alice?

17

I found out that he bribed
them to conduct a manhunt

<i>Okay, okay. I'll pay you.</i>

<i>Full payment upon agreement.</i>

189
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,820
<i>No way! I'll pay fifty down.</i>

190
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,739
<i>The rest, upon completion.</i>

195

<i>Thank me once you've passed the class.</i>

196
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,213
<i>Sure! Sure. You know what?</i>

197
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,132
<i>I would have paid</i>
<i>you more if you just asked for it.</i>

198
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,842
<i>Well, if you just asked for it,</i>

199
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,761
<i>I would've given you a discount.</i>

200
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:11,016
[Steve] Even before,
I knew you were a great hustler.

201
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,771
I probably wouldn't have
graduated if it weren't for you.

202

[laughs, groans]

203
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,526
Because you're the one with the ambition.

204
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,405
You're the one with great ideas!

205
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,448
I even told myself

206
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,451
you would've been
the perfect son for my dad.

207
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,747
[Steve sighs] I think
that's why I introduced you to him.

208
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,377
At least, in a way…

209
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,630
his money can pay for something decent

210
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,216
if you were the one using it.

211
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,554
I didn't expect this to happen.

212
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,683
I didn't know

213
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,561
that he will involve
you in his drug business.

214
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,279
When I learned about your father's plan…

215
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,826
I could've backed out.

217
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,831
But I didn't.

218
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,632
Because I knew it would help my brother.

I'll make your father

227
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,432
Are we okay?

228
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,020
Why wouldn't we be?

229
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,148
[Erica smacks lips] Hmm.

230
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,486
We need to check
the new lead on Louisa's case.

232
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:38,288
<i>How did she become</i>
<i>the next Louisa Soria, if Edong is dead?</i>

233
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:43,335
<i>Because there are rumors</i>
<i>that Edong didn't kill Louisa.</i>

234
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,587
<i>If that's true,</i>

235
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,175
<i>then the real killer is</i>
<i>the one who took that missing student.</i>

236

<i>- Didn't you watch it?</i>
- [woman]<i> No.</i>

237
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,391
[Marco] So… there's a missing student.

238
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,851
And because of TikTok,

239
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:03,605
people think there's only
one suspect in both cases?

240
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,984
The people of
Amurao are good at two things.

241
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,028
Believing in gossip.

242
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,821
And creating gossip.

243
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,783
But still, we need to check it out.

244
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,660
[tense music ends]

245
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,912
[Beth] People are talking about your post.

246
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,831
It's causing so many rumors!

247
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,500
People are saying
Louisa's killer is still alive.

248
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,336
And that it's the
same person who took your classmate.

249
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,214
But Ma, I didn't even
say anything about it though!

250
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,718
All I said was,
it's possible that Edong isn't the killer.

251
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,137
Because that's what
Attorney Erica believes.

252
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,305
[Beth exhales sharply]

253
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,892
I never said
that it was connected to Bianca.

254
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,061
The people connected the dots and assumed.

255
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,521
The police are
getting pestered with calls!

256
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,106
They watched it too!

257
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,735
Haven't I told you to stop investigating?!

258
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,819
But Ma,

259
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,948
the only reason you're stopping me
is because you're scared of Edong.

260
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,911
[sighs] But the news said he's dead!

261
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,662
That's why I thought everything was fine!

it still turned out like this.

266
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,215
From now on,
you're banned from posting, okay?

267
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,676
But Pa, people are
waiting for my next post!

268
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,887
It would ruin my momentum, for real!

I checked Angelo's bag,

Nothing.

Don't do that again, okay?

What if Angelo catches you?

You know, my brain just can't accept it.

286
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,830
Why did she have to lie?

287
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,626
Bianca's sister herself
said she was close with Liezel.

288
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,836
Then…

289
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,089

Liezel is aware of
whatever Angelo is doing.

Then why would she lie if it's nothing?

There are a lot of
