[Jo] <i>Mel, listen.</i>

00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,837
<i>Never, ever go back to that house.</i>

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,755
<i>Your husband is dangerous!</i>

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,298
<i>He could kill you.</i>

5
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,176
<i>You sure you're okay?</i>

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,178
<i>Yeah. I'm fine.</i>

7
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:17,517
[Candelaria] <i>I thought you could</i>
<i>convince Atty. Erica Melendez</i>

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,977
<i>to be the guest speaker.</i>

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>You're so lucky</i>
<i>to have them as your friends.</i>

10
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,605
<i>They're all so successful.</i>

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,443
<i>Who's the most dangerous criminal</i>
<i>you've faced, Attorney?</i>

12
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,861
<i>Was it Edong Santiago?</i>

13
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,655
<i>I'll save you from her, bro.</i>

14
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,075
<i>I won't let her ruin and poison your life.</i>

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,286
[man] <i>Sir, someone left them for you.</i>

[tense music playing]

17
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,834
[investigator] <i>Ma'am Mel has just left.</i>

18
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,796
<i>She came from a condo here in Manila.</i>
<i>Azure Residences.</i>

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,799
[Tin]<i> Lucas Santiago lives here too.</i>
<i>The owner of the gyms.</i>

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,136
<i>Lucas, you jog here too?</i>

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>I just got invited by my friends.</i>

22
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,890
<i>- Nice to see you.</i>
<i>- Nice to see you both.</i>

23
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,269
Bitch!

24
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,562
Fucking bitch!

25
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,689
Bitch!

26
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,691
Fuck!

[indistinct chattering]

32
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,501
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,301
You know, I really thought
you accepted Beth's invitation.

34
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,427
No.

35
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,013
I came here because I had
something important to tell you.

36
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,558
Ma'am Liwanag has requested
we take a group photo inside the school.

37
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,726
Is it okay with you?

38
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,895
- Wait--
- And there's food

39
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,813
at the office later.

40
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,816
- Wait, I need to talk to you.
- Let's talk later.

41
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,152
You should make
the most out of the VIP treatment.

42
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:18,907
It's not every day my
successful friends visit Amurao High.

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,534
Come on, let's take
pictures before it rains.

44
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,163
Edong's still alive!

45
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:30,418
[unsettling music playing]

00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,891
[music fades]

47
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,769
Send two wreaths to the chapel ASAP.

48
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:48,686
- Sir.
- Sir.

49
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,980
One should be under
the prison management's name,

50
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,398
and the other should be
under my name.

51
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,483
Copy, Warden.

52
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,112
[phone ringing]

53
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,531
Hello?

54
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,741
[Edong] <i>Captain.</i>

55
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,868
Your assistant's dead.

56
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,495
[ominous music playing]

57
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,080
Will you be next?

58
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,623
[breathes deeply]

59
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,832
What do you want, Edong?

60
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,001
<i>So you already know.</i>

61
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,255
You failed, Warden.

62
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,298
I'm still alive.

63
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,759
[Edong chuckles]

64
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,636
<i>Too bad for you.</i>

65
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,847
I still have a lot of
things to do, Warden.

66
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,977
Now, if you stand in my way,

67
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,854
<i>I'll come for you next.</i>

68
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,651
<i>You don't want that to happen, Warden.</i>

69
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:42,407
[ominous music intensifies]

70
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,993
Are you girls alright? Eat up.

71
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,870
We prepared that for you.

72
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,581
Look after your friends, okay?

73
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:55,795
- [high pitched tone playing]
- [indistinct chatter becomes distant]

74
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,853
- [glass breaks]
- [Liwanag] Oh!

75
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,896
It broke.

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,735
[ominous music resumes]

77
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,955
[glass breaks]

78
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,466
[ominous music continues, fades]

79
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,550
Alice.

80
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,681
I thought everything was over.

81
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,975
I thought he was dead.

82
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,769
No. Alice, calm down.

83
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,812
We're still not sure if it's true.

84
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,564
- Right--
- It's true.

85
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,734
He killed an assistant
warden at Bagumbayan prison.

86
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,487
I was there when
Edong called Lucas to--

87
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,696
Wait.

88
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,158
You were with Lucas?

89
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,579
He killed Lucas's friend, Steve Kyo.

90
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,415
He also killed a woman at San Dimas.

91
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,669
How's Lucas?

92
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,671
Will you stop?! I don't care about Lucas!

93
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,673
We should worry about ourselves!

94
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:29,889
[ominous music resumes, fades]

95
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,432
Can we just talk somewhere else?

96
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,354
[unsettling music playing]

97
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,492
He killed the woman who helped him?

98
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,536
That's our theory.

99
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,871
The woman was a healer.

100
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,499
She lives alone and isolated.

101
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,627
Her acquaintance said she took someone in.

102
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,129
That was Edong.

103
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,672
The time coincides.

104
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,300
And he was the one
who tricked Beth and Angelo

105
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,928
so they'd hurt each other?

106
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,680
I'm sure that was also him.

107
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,850
If that's the case,

108
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,937
he's just here in Amurao

109
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,148
watching us.

110
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,113
[music fades]

111
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:31,200
How nice that you're all still friends.

112
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,412
You're famous now too! [chuckles]

113
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:38,833
Thank you for bringing your friends
to my coffee shop, Beth.

114
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,586
Actually, I wanted
to bring them to another place

115
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,463
where there are no nosy people.

116
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,507
But it was full, so we had no choice.

117
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,592
[Vangie chuckles]

118
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,510
You're such a jokester.

119
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,679
Enjoy your drinks. [chuckles]

120
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,055
They're good.

121
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,224
[uneasy music playing]

122
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,517
Enjoy.

123
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,103
Go on, try it.

124
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,692
Oh, I'll excuse myself now. Enjoy.

125
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,570
[music fades]

126
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,281
I'm warning you, lower your voices.

127
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,825
She's the number
one gossip here in Amurao.

128
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,332
Sorry, guys.

129
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,502
I can't offer my place.

130
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,047
I haven't told Scott yet about Edong.

131
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,633
I honestly thought
I didn't have to because…

132
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,092
he's, he's dead.

133
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,844
- Right?
- [Erica] Alice.

134
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,679
Alice, tell him now.

135
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,601
All of you should tell your family.

136
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,394
Edong's more violent now.

137
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,649
I don't know what he'll do next or who…

138
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,651
his next target is.

139
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,238
But the police are looking for him, right?

140
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,491
If they found him once,
they can find him again.

141
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,911
The police are still
hesitating to believe Lucas.

142
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,873
And the only person
who saw him is Ayoc's wife.

143
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,959
But she doesn't want to talk.

144
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,128
Tch. Does my family
have to go through this again?

145
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,922
What else does that bastard want?

146
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,174
Hasn't he done enough?

147
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,134
Does he want us to invent a time machine

148
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,845
so he doesn't go to jail 14 years ago?

149
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,723
[unsettling music playing]

150
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,809
[Edong] <i>Have you been sleeping well</i>

151
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:24,480
<i>the past 14 years</i>
<i>after what you did to me?</i>

152
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,316
<i>You lied.</i>

153
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,319
<i>And because of that,</i>
<i>I was imprisoned in here.</i>

154
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,198
- There's something else we can do.
- [music fades]

155
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,492
Tell the truth.

156
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:41,247
[tense music playing]

157
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,498
Let's face him.

158
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,083
Let's face everyone.

159
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,793
Let's tell them the truth.

160
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,213
Let's tell them
we our statements were wrong,

161
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,674
and it's the reason Edong went to jail.

162
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:56,554
[tense music continues]

163
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,140
It's the root cause of all this, right?

164
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,184
He knows we wronged him.

165
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,480
Including Amurao, the police, the law.

166
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,358
He feels like everyone ganged up on him.

167
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,153
If we admit that we lied, he might--

168
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,654
I'm not going to admit anything!

169
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,823
We did the right thing
for Louisa, remember?!

170
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,702
Why can't you admit it even now, Beth?

171
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,787
Stop using Louisa as an excuse.

172
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,914
We made a mistake, and that's the truth!

173
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,335
What you really want
to say is I made a mistake. Right?

174
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,253
I said it clearly. Us.

175
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,756
Really, Erica?

176
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,633
Ever since we met again,

177
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,677
you've been implying that it was my fault!

178
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,387
It was all our fault!

179
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,016
You think I don't regret everyday
that I didn't speak up back then?

180
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:46,687

00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,521
[Alice] Erica? Erica, are you okay?

358
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,608
[Alice sobs]
Erica, come on. Can you stand?

359
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,735
[Alice] It's okay.

360
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,820
- Ah…
- [Erica whimpers]

361
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,530
Okay, can you stand?

362
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:03,994
[music becomes poignant]

363
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,245
Mel…

364
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,955
I can't believe my staff!

365
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,082
I'm their boss,
yet here I am doing everything here!

366
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,500
They're all so lazy! So--

367
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:15,047
[poignant music continues]

368
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,261
[Mel crying]

369
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:31,271
[poignant music swells]

370
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,151
[Erica] <i>I'll help you</i>
<i>break free from Anton safely</i>

371
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,819
<i>and get what's rightfully yours.</i>

372
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,490
<i>I confronted my wife</i>
<i>because I learned that she had an affair</i>

373
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,033
<i>with Lucas Santiago.</i>

374
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,827
<i>Don't talk about us like</i>
<i>we're some dirty little secret</i>

375
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,039
<i>because he was the one</i>
<i>beautiful thing that saved me!</i>

376
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,207
[crying]

377
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,126
[Lucas] <i>I think it was my brother</i>
<i>who sent that picture to your husband.</i>

378
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,672
[Edong] <i>"Be alert and of sober mind."</i>

379
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,217
<i>"Your enemy, the devil,</i>
<i>prowls around."</i>

380
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,302
<i>Beth, it's not entirely our fault,</i>

381
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,762
<i>but we also made a mistake,</i>

382
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,305
<i>and I think it's time we admit that.</i>

383
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,349
<i>We only said</i>
<i>what everyone already believed!</i>

384
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,850
<i>So you finally admit it! You lied!</i>

385
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,769
<i>So many lives have been ruined</i>

386
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,771
<i>because of the first one you destroyed!</i>

387
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,774
