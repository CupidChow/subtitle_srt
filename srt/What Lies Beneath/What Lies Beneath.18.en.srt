12

16
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,760

17

Agh!

52
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,162
Miss Esther.

00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,755
What? You thought I killed her?

00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,632
If we hadn't arrived,
maybe you would have.

58
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,051
I came here to talk to her.

59
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,428
I didn't even do anything,
she just suddenly ran away.

60
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,642
What, you going to
call me a murderer again?

61
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,060
Why are you here?

62
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,146
Why did you track down Esther Castro?

63
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,399
Because you're accusing me of killing her!

64
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,110
You even dragged my brother into it.

65
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,445
So I searched for her and look!
She's alive!

66
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,409
[tense music fades]

67
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,203
Where are you taking me?! Let go of me!

68
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,080
I said let go of me!

69
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:55,753
[grunts, groans]

70
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,840
I can't breathe!

Your head hit the ground earlier.

I'm just helping you.

73
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,724
I'll take her to the hospital
for a CT scan, just to be safe.

74
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,229
If she needs to be hospitalized,
we'll take care of it.

75
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,815
You're running from an investigation.

76
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,028
We won't detain
you because we have no right to.

77
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,572
But I can help you.

78
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,409
I'm sure you'll face more charges

79
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,119
since you're a fugitive.

80
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,372
But I can represent you.

81
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:35,168
All I ask in return is
for you to tell the truth.

82
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,628
[tense music continues]

83
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,298
Why did you lie about Edong Santiago?

84
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,758
I didn't lie!

85
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,762
I didn't lie about Edong!

86
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,806
And I'm glad I put that monster
of a brother of yours in jail!

87
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,893
Monster? You're the one
who made my brother suffer!

88
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,436
Get him away from me! Get him away--

89
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,354
Miss Esther,
we're trying to talk to you calmly.

90
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,731
- Sir! Help!
- We're not going to hurt you!

91
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,357
- Help me!
- [man 1] Hey!

92
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,151
- Please help me!
- What are you doing?

93
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,360
Please help me!

94
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,489
They're forcing me to pay my debt,
but I don't have money yet!

95
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,615
Wait a second.

96
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,700
I'm Attorney Erica Melendez.

97
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,868
Don't believe her.

98
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,496
Believe me! Please, sir! Sir, believe--

99
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,831
Let me see your ID if that's true.

100
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,667
Wait, I'll get it from the car.
I'll show you.

101
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,545
Sir, believe me!
Don't leave me! They'll kill me!

102
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,547
[Marco] Why don't
you just mind your own business?

103
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,965
This has nothing to do with you.

104
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:23,841
[man 2] What did you say?

105
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,844
- [grunts]
- [thud]

106
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,762
[Erica] Miss Esther!

107
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,347
- [Erica] Miss Esther!
- Ugh!

108
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,515
- Let me go!
- [Lucas grunts]

109
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,433
- Miss Esther!

110
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,726
Let me go!

115
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,986
No!

[tense music continues]

117
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,369
What did you do?

118
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,079
She kneed me in the groin. She got away!

119
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:57,792
[tense music continues]

120
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,015
- [music fades]
- [both pant heavily]

121
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,476
[Marco] She's gone.

122
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,981
Shit!

123
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,818

124
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,864
[door chain clinking]

125
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,074
- Come in.
- How are you doing?

126
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,827
- Faster.
- How's Seth? Is he okay?

127
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,582
- Is he okay?
- He's asleep.

128
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,584
[sighs deeply]

129
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,169
- Sit down.
- Okay.

130
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,301
Let me see.

131
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,469
[Alice exhales deeply]

132
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,180
So, did they get a look at the face?

133
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,183
If his back wasn't facing the camera,

134
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,227
his head was down or covered by a cap.

135
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,772
He knew there was CCTV at the house.

136
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,987
[dramatic music playing]

137
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,447
You let her go, didn't you?

138
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,532
Huh?

139
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,120
What's your plan?

140
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,538
Let her go,

141
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,667
and when you find her again,
do whatever you want to her?

142
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,544
Like what you did to Celestino?

143
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,838
You still think I'm a murderer, Erica?

144
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,715
Even after seeing Esther alive

145
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,383
and being proven wrong?!

146
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,428
You'll still stand by what
you believe about me and my brother?

147
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,056
[dramatic music continues]

148
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,266
<i>Miss Esther, don't you remember me?</i>

149
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,769
<i>I'm Lucas Santiago, Edong's brother.</i>

150
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,523
[young Lucas] <i>Maybe you made a mistake.</i>

151
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,566
<i>My brother didn't do that to Louisa.</i>

152
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,152
<i>You can take back</i>
<i>what you said to the police.</i>

153
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,237
<i>Please!</i>

154
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,490
<i>I know you.</i>

<i>Stay away from me!</i>

157
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,788
<i>Go away!</i>

158
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,416
<i>- I just want to talk to you!</i>
<i>- Stay away from me!</i>

159
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,835
<i>- Stay away--</i>
<i>- People said you were dead!</i>

160
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,755
<i>And they're blaming my brother again.</i>

161
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,423
<i>I just want to set things right.</i>

162
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,884
<i>- Stay away from me!</i>
- [grunts]

163

[panting] <i>Aah! Aah! Aah!</i>

166
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,436
<i>Stay away from me! Let go of me!</i>

167
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,854
<i>The case has long been closed.</i>

168
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,648
<i>My brother will be out in a year.</i>

169
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,776
<i>Nothing will happen</i>
<i>to you if you just tell the truth.</i>

170
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,779
<i>That you're alive,</i>
<i>and that you lied about my brother!</i>

171
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,993
<i>Oh god, help me. </i>[sobbing] <i>Help me.</i>

172
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,287
<i>You're evil!</i>

173
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,498
<i>People like you and your brother</i>

174
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,460
<i>are the reason this</i>
<i>country is in the dark!</i>

175
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,713
<i>You're a demon! You're evil!</i>

176

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,183
[dramatic music continues, fades]

182
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,518
Erica…

183
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,062
You need help.

184
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,898
Maybe it's you who's
obsessed with the past, not us.

185
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,150
I saw you!

186
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,693
You let her escape!

187
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,570
I told you, she kicked me!

188
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,280
You even left us earlier!

189
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,575
Something's wrong, Lucas.

190
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,535
I can feel it!

191
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,247
If there's one thing
I learned from what happened before,

192
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,124
it's to trust my instincts.

193
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:30,504
[tense music playing]

194
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,635
I know…

195
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,347
I know you and your brother are angry.

196
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,975
But to take justice into your own hands

197
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,437
and hurt others, is not the answer.

198
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,605
Then what is?!

199
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,565
The law?

200
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,860
Isn't that the same law
that screwed over my brother?!

201
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,363
It's the same thing
that's so easy to twist,

202
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,698
and manipulate by anyone!

203
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,243
My brother and I never hurt anyone.

204
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,330
But I will never trust the law again!

205
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,000
Only a fool would!

206
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,086
And I'm no longer a fool.

207
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,046
You know what I've learned in this world?

208
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,756
When you're weak,

209
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,425
you get eaten alive.

210
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,598
And I'll make sure that never happens!

211
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:27,269
[tense music continues]

212
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,942
What happened to you?

213
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:45,204
[tense music swells]

214
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,047
I am like this because of you.

215
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:59,760
[music becomes pensive]

216
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,179
And because of what your friends did.

217
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:14,024
[pensive music continues]

218
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,079
Doesn't that CCTV have another angle?

219
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,081
- How about the gate angle?
- [sighs]

220
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,626
Chloe and Joshua
said they saw him outside.

221
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,754
There's a hidden camera there.

222
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:41,886
[unsettling music playing]

223
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,146
[Alice screams]

224
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,940
They're right.

225
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,527
The same person who chased Chloe
caused the chaos at my house.

226
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:04,158
[unsettling music continues, fades]

227
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,660
She hasn't come back since earlier.

228
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,871
She hasn't called us either.

229
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,000
Your aunt is now wanted by the police.

230
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,754
You could also be
charged with aiding and abetting.

231
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,130
[chuckles wryly]

232
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,798
You guys are unbelievable.

233
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,968
I already told you,
I don't know where she is!

234
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,054
Shouldn't you be the ones who know?

235
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,599
My mother's sick,
and you're still harassing us.

236
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,685
No offense,
but please, just leave us alone.

237
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,604
[door slams]

238
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,982

"I FOUND ESTHER.
SHE'S AT HER SISTER'S HOUSE.

his face from here.

- [music turns dramatic]
- No!

252
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,829
That's impossible!

253
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,041
He's in prison, right? That can't be!

254
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:21,337
- [breathing heavily]
- [dramatic music continues]

[Erica] <i>The brothers</i>

256
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,302
<i>Esther Castro is missing,</i>

257
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,305
<i>I heard Esther's been</i>
<i>hiding because of a fraud case.</i>

258
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:35,559
<i>And Celestino was killed</i>
<i>by a syndicate he crossed once.</i>

259
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,519
<i>So, after 14 years,</i>

260
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,064

Edong?

What do you mean?

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,752
[Alice] <i>Someone</i>

Okay? And when we
checked the CCTV, it was Edong.

283
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,134
And he even harassed Beth's daughter!

284
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,303

That your brother can

00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,558
That's him!

That's impossible!

00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,230
That's how he killed Celestino!

You've been calling me nonstop, huh?

You know, Attorney, if this continues

323
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,335
I might think you have feelings for me.

324
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,963
Edong Santiago
has been leaving the prison!

325
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,257
Is he escaping,
or are you letting him out?

Attorney, what are you talking about?

327
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,888
Santiago's in Bagumbayan.

328
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,099
And if a prisoner escapes,
we don't cover that up.

329

He was caught on CCTV
standing outside my friend's house!

So, don't lie to me, Warden!

That's impossible, Attorney.

332
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,862

I'm on my way to Bagumbayan now.
