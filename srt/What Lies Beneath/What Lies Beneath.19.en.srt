3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,424
<i>- Why are you here?</i>
<i>- 'Cause you're accusing me of killing her!</i>

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,261
<i>Doesn't that CCTV have another angle?</i>

5
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,012
<i>There's a hidden camera there.</i>

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,266
<i>The same person who chased Chloe,</i>
<i>caused chaos at my house.</i>

7
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,058
<i>Why?</i>

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,436
<i>Edong's going after</i>

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,937

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,648
<i>Edong Santiago's been leaving the prison!</i>

11
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,817

[Ayoc] <i>That's impossible, Attorney.</i>

22

Those CCTV cameras

<i>Sometimes, the image is blurry.</i>
<i>You can't always trust that!</i>

It could even be AI-generated!

25

<i>I'll have the CCTV footage reviewed.</i>

31
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,486

Visit Edong Santiago.

35
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,210
He has the flu. Take good care of him.

- It can't be! I mean-- [breathes deeply]
- [music fades]

39
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,645
I-If Erica's right that Edong
can get in and out of prison,

40
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,565
then it's possible that he was
the one who killed Celestino.

[unsettling music playing]

42
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,277
He could quite
possibly be coming for us next.

We don't know anything yet, okay?

44
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,114
He caused distress last night.

45
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,866
He went to your house.

46
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,535
- But eventually left Chloe.
- [Alice groans]

47
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,956
If we're his targets, he would've done
to us what he did to Celestino.

48
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,835
Hang on, I'm going home
to talk to Ryan and Chloe.

49

Wait, how are you going to go home?

50

Okay. Be cautious, okay?

52
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,179

Am I not under observation?

I already signed the waiver.

- What are you talking about?!
- You heard the doctor!

65
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,885
If you had punched me
just a little bit harder, Anton,

66
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,470
I could've died!

67
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,350
Maybe that's what you want. No?

68
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,979
You couldn't handle a successful wife,

69
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,147
that's why she's better off dead!

You're at fault too.

If he dares to break into our house,

118
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:53,162
he will feel the wrath of Panday and Cap--

119

- Captain…
- Just put it down.

Okay, okay.

You're so corny.

Edong was in Amurao?

135
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,741
He escaped prison?

136
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,662
The CCTV footage captured his face.

Why Chloe?

If Erica is right about
Edong coming after us,

140
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,800
why is he going after my daughter?

Didn't the doctor say
that I have to stay for the night?

159
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,283
For my observation.

160
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,287
Yes ma'am, but sir said you
wanted to go home. Is there a problem?

161
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,416
You know, Reema's been calling.

162
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,045
She wants to know how you're doing.

163

She's starting to worry about you.

164

In fact, she is starting
to get worried about you.

165
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:19,475
Even Aunt Millet and Uncle
are starting to worry about you.

166
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,395
They're worried if you're too sick,

167
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,938

There's no problem.

171
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,457
I'd just feel more comfortable at home.

172
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,167
I just wanted to make sure it's alright.

173
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,379
