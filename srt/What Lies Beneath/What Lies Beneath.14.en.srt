[softly] Baby…

Rose told me about what happened.

78
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,534
She said she was woken up by a loud noise.

79
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,870
It was so intense, like something slammed.

80
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,831
When she went downstairs,
she saw you carrying Seth

81
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,000
and calling the police.

82
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,545
Then, suddenly, the window shattered.

00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,977

99
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,720
That's how I found you.

100
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,224
You kept saying that no
one will take Seth away from you.

101
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,308
Alice…

102
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,810
did you really think

103
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,437
the intruder was after your son?

104
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,609
Because a man also
scared Chloe and Joshua last night.

105
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:48,866
My gut tells me he's
the same guy who broke into your home.

106
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,995
Chloe said they saw
the man outside your house.

107
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,330
- Mom?
- Yeah?

108
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,374
[Seth] I feel tired.

109
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,085
Oh. Yeah, you can sleep here.

110
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,921
Get some rest, baby.

111
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,384
[sighs deeply]

112
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,095
I know who did this.

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,181
It's Scott.

114
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,142

Boss?

123
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,121
Is Edong still unavailable?

124
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,206
[guard] He'll be out in a bit. Just wait.

125
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,879

131
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,947
How have you been, brother?

132
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,782
Hmm…

133
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,911
Last time I came to visit,
you were coughing.

134
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,079
You seemed to be sick. Are you okay now?

135
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,040
Don't worry about me.

136
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,334
I'm fine.

137
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,712
Okay.

138
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,924
I brought you some food.

Hey.

142
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,857
What happened to your hand?

143
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:49,570
[tense music playing]

144
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:51,948
Nothing.

145
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,616
I just…

146
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,952
pushed myself too hard at the gym.

147
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,704
[tense music fades]

148
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,331
How was the branch opening in Amurao?

149
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,292
Well, uh…

150
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,420
The mayor came.

151
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,548
Good.

152
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,675
Good.

153
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:15,096
I want everyone to know
how successful you've become.

154
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,557
You're the one I've been bragging about.

155
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,183
I told them,

156
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,937
that seeing you turn over a new leaf
inspired me to get my life together.

157
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,064

[unsettling music playing]

00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,332
No matter how much I want
to claim I'm behind your success,

160
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,796
I know that's not true.

161
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,135
When I was sent here…

162
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,636
[chuckles bitterly]

163
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,473
I thought you'd end up like me.

164
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,435
But you didn't.

165
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,522
You proved that you could achieve…

166
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,776
everything you wanted.

167
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,156
Not everything, Edong.

00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:20,411
[unsettling music continues]

169
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,335
I haven't gotten you out of here.

170
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,879
Don't worry about that, bro.

171
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,506
That's not important.

172
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,969
- But--
- Just focus on yourself.

173
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,640
It's important to me, Edong.

174
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,145
Soon enough, you'll be eligible to apply
for commutation of sentence.

175
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,482
If you just keep up your good record,

176
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,859
they'll have no reason to reject it.

00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,604
By the way, Edong…

185
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,483
I heard you called Erica Melendez.

186
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,536
You threatened her and her friends.

187
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,793
- Your husband?
- [music fades]

188
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,755
You think he'd come here to do that?

189
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,050
Besides, the guy who
threatened Chloe wasn't an American.

190
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,845
[scoffs] Well then,
he must have hired someone.

191
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,639
He paid someone to threaten me.

192
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,644
Alice, what's really going on?

193
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,773
Are you saying
that your husband would do that?

194
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:17,027
Do you really think he'd have you
followed here to threaten and hurt you?

195
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,865
Would he really drag other people
like my daughter into this?

196
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,325
[sighs sharply] Look. Look.

197
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,827
He found out, okay?

198
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,747
He found out that I
brought Seth to the Philippines.

199
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,750
He knows that we're here.

200
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,128
Before the attack, he found out.

201
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,714
Did you see his face?

202
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,134
Do you remember anything about the man?

203
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,303
There might be
something distinct about him.

204
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:47,766
- [unsettling music playing]
- [Edong laughing]

205
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,688
[Alice] He was laughing.

206
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:56,108
He was laughing like he enjoyed it.

207
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,446
It's as if he were messing with us.

208
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:05,034
[unsettling music continues]

209
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,124
[music fades]

210
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,418
I threatened them?

211
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,296
No, it's not like that, Lucas.

212
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,049
I just wanted them to know

213
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,092
that I've moved on from what happened.

214
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,470
What for, Edong?

215
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,889
Why did you do that?

216
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,641
You shouldn't have done that.

217
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,769
What if they report
that you have access to a cellphone?

218
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,855
It will destroy
everything you've worked for.

219
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,191
Edong.

220
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,070
- It'll destroy all our plans.
- Lucas.

221
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,448
Didn't I tell you…

222
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,992
that I can manage?

223
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:54,959
[ominous music playing]

224
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,545
You know what I went through, Lucas.

225
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,717
They treated me here like a door mat.

226
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,471
They would beat me up every day.

227
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,808
They abused me every day.

228
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,478
Fighting back…

229
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,273
only makes things worse.

230
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,401
But I learned…

231
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,865
that fighting back
shouldn't be done in haste.

232
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,158
[ominous music continues]

233
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,702
I waited…

234
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,622
and gathered strength.

235
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,752
I studied their every move…

236
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,549
until they thought I couldn't fight back.

237
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,884
And then…

238
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,803
[ominous music continues]

239
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:53,267
I showed them
that they couldn't hurt me anymore.

240
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,269
- [thud]
- [music fades]

241
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,984
- [clock ticking noise]
- [sinister music playing]

242
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,905
That's our promise
to each other, remember?

243
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,910
No matter what happens…

244
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,706
I'll make sure to see it through.

245
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,459
- [ticking noise continues]
- [sinister music continues]

246
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,252
Our plan stays.

247
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,175
[sinister music continues, fades]

248
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,969
You really didn't see or
get a glimpse of the man?

249
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,932
I only saw his silhouette
through the glass window.

250
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,143
When he threw the rock,
we ran to the restroom.

251
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,728
[Edward exhales sharply]

252
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,774
You chose to live in that subdivision
because there are roving security guards.

253
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,567
And yet this happened.

254
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,905
Have there been any
reports of break-ins these past days?

255
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:48,906
[officer 1] None, sir.

256
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:52,409
Based on the information
we got from Ma'am Miller and Rose,

257
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,244
nothing was reported stolen.

258
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,164
[Alice] We'll still
double-check everything.

259
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,333
I'll be discharged anyway.

260
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,086
[sighs sharply] If it wasn't robbery,

261
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,754
then what?

262
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:07,091
Don't worry.
We'll make sure to catch the suspect.

263
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,468
[officer 1] We're
also getting the statement

264
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,179
of Mrs. Mora's daughter and her friend.

265
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,181
It's possible that they saw the suspect

266
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,102
and we'll see if
we can produce a police sketch.

267
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,979
[officer 2] Do you have a CCTV at home?

268
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:20,980
[dramatic music sting]

269
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,856
[officer 2] Are they all working?

270
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,818
Yes, we have.
They were just installed recently.

271
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,572
I can give you access
so you can see the footage.

272
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,076
That will help a lot
in identifying the suspect.

273
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:41,333
- [keypad clacking]
- [unsettling music playing]

274
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,755
Alice.

275
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,841
Are you okay?

276
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,010
- [breath quivering]
- [keypad clacking]

277
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,177
[officer 1] It's okay, ma'am.

278
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,471
You don't have to go over the footage.

279
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,142
Just give us access and we'll review it.

280
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:02,271
[unsettling music continues]

281
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,986
- Wait. I'll go first!
- No, I'll go first!

282
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,904
He'd been acting creepy from the start.

283
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,239
No cap.

284
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,118
He meant she's not lying.

285
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,454
He meant Chloe's telling the truth.

286
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,872
Okay, continue.

287
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,167
- Then, he asked me about Aunt Alice.
- Hm?

288
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,836
He even called her "Alice Quintana"

289
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,546
even though she's married now.

290
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,966
He said he knows Aunt Alice very well.

291
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,803
That was when
I realized he was kind of sus.

292
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,014
- "Sus"?
- It means suspicious.

293
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,892
Do you remember what he looked like?

294
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,101
He was tall and thin.

295
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,312
No! He got a big built!

296
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,521
What makes you say that?

297
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,647
He was wearing a hoodie!

298
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,858
- No, he wasn't!
- He was! It was dark-colored!

299
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,735
No, he wasn't!
Stop acting like you know better!

300
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,236
She really is your daughter, Beth.

301
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,654
She's just like you.

302
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,782
You treated me like
that back in high school too.

303
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,201
Yeah. I think she did the same to me.

304
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:57,951
[chuckles]

305
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,953
Just focus on interviewing them, Locsin!

306
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,832
So, aside from his clothes,

307
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,292
do you remember his face?

308
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,630
He was wearing a cap,
so we couldn't see his face.

309
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,050
[tense music playing]

310
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,052
<i>Louisa!</i>

311
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,347
[grunting]

312
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,807
<i>You bastard!</i>

313
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,810
- [Ryan] You okay, love?
- [tense music fades]

314
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:27,606
[uneasy music playing]

315
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,027
The nerve of him to sue me?

316
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,904
He's the one who has no road manners.

317
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,031
[scoffs] What a reckless rider.

318
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:41,161
That's why I always say that motorcycles
should be banned in the Philippines.

319
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,456
So, you're telling me

320
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,753
that you pointed a gun at a delivery rider
just because he overtook you on the road?

321
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,505
Well, I did everyone a favor.

322
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,258
And you want me to represent you?

323
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,009
They say you're the best.

324
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,931
So, you think you're above the law?

325
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,018
That you can do anything you want

326
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,230
because you're rich and
you have a gun? Is that it?

327
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,944
I became a lawyer
because of people like you.

328
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,781
I don't represent people like you, sir.

329
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,368
In fact, I'd rather put you in jail.

330
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,454
How dare you! Do you know who I am?!

331
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,248
[phone buzzing]

332
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,002
- Any news?
- [man] Where the hell are you going?!

333
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,503
We're not done yet!

334
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,130
Don't you dare waste my time!

335
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,425
[Marco] <i>I talked</i>
<i>to the valet here at the bar.</i>

336
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,511
He said Santiago left at 2 AM.

337
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,973
So, Santiago's lying
about being here until 5 AM.

338
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,224
Is he sure?

339
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,019
Wasn't it a party?
There were a lot of people.

340
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,814
He said he wouldn't forget
him because he gave a huge tip.

341
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,691
He was so excited

342
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,194
<i>that he even called</i>
<i>his wife after Santiago left.</i>

343
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,863
<i>I checked his call log and confirmed it.</i>

344
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,742
He called his wife at 2:17 AM.

345
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,328
So, what Lucas posted wasn't true?

346
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,580
[suspenseful music playing]

347
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,666
It's possible that the man the kids saw

348
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,961
isn't the same man
who broke into Mrs. Miller's house.

349
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,755
Two suspects?

350
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,966
So, the two incidents are not related?

351
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,426
It's possible, right?

352
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,763
Mm-hmm. But I think they're connected.

353
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,099
If there are two suspects,
they could be accomplices.

354
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:32,105
- [foreboding music playing]
- [overlapping chatter]

355
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,316
- Oh, it's Boss. Boss.
- Hey, Boss.

356
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:41,782
[indistinct chatter]

357
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,660
