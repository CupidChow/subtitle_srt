to ever get in here again. I--

94
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,923
I was honestly torn
between staying here or at the hotel,

95
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,633
but I feel safer here.

96
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,261
The hotel's just too big,
there are too many entry points.

97
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,099
It's safer for you
if you all stay here together for now.

98
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,145
It's easier for the NLEA to protect you
if there's only one focus--

99
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,688
What?! That's not acceptable!

100
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,233
Doing that will make
things easier for Edong.

101
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,860

separate plans into one.

Just share with Mel what we talked about.

But also tell her to take
the necessary precautions.

163

But for how long?!

164
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,336
You said it yourselves, right?!
Edong doesn't just get caught easily!

165
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,256
So how long can the NLEA protect us?!

Can they handle it for a few weeks?!

my brother's been leaving the jail.

And I don't know where he is.

177

But he will definitely contact you.

178
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,925
Why are you questioning me?

179
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,304
Why don't you investigate
the people in Bagumbayan?

180
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,183
They're the ones doing shady stuff.
They know my brother's moves.

181
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,685
We've sent his identifying details,

182
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,354
including his face
to every precinct in the country.

183
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,484
We'll be watching every place
he could possibly go or hide!

184
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,279
[tense music playing]

185
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:04,783
What do you think
the police will do to a cop-killer?!

186
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:06,869
Huh?!

187
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,207
So if you want
your brother to return to prison alive…

188
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,793
- [loud bang]
- …start talking!

189
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:20,090
[tense music continues]

190
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,432
I don't know where my brother is.

196
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,794
Hello, Edong! Where are you?

197
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,629
[Edong] <i>How are you, Lucas?</i>

198
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,548
Have the police come to speak to you?

199
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,383
[Lucas] <i>Why did you leave?</i>

200
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,718
That wasn't part of our plan, Edong.

201
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,596
You probably already
know I can get in and out of prison.

202
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,267
They have me deliver things, drugs.

203
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,935
<i>The wardens are behind it.</i>

204
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,645
Why did you do this?

205
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,898
<i>Bro, I promised you, didn't I?</i>

206
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,860
I don't use anymore.
I'll never go back to that.

207
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,445
I'm just a runner.

208
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,865
<i>If they're forcing you to be one,</i>

209
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,366
then let's clean this up.

210
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,076
Be a witness.

211
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,413
<i>Edong, your commutation</i>
<i>of sentence is close.</i>

212
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,540
That's not important anymore, bro.

213
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,042
<i>What do you mean it's not important?</i>

214
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,211
In a year or two, you'll be free.

215
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,089
[stammers] Y-You
already have a room at my condo.

216
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,344

[unsettling music continues]

222
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,409
But that wasn't
the only thing they did to me.

223
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,411
[young Edong] <i>Let go of me!</i> [sobs]
