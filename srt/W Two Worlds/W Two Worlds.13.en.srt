1
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,530
W-Two Worlds

2
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,820
Episode 13

3
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,410
Congressman is running late.
He'll be here in 20 minutes.

4
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,540
Kang Chul is trying to bother you
even in his death.

5
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,450
He wrote something strange in his will.

6
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,540
What did he write?

7
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,990
Don't worry too much.

8
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,910
Someone at death's door
could write anything.

9
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,830
I'll help you become President.
I know a lot about Kang Chul.

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,490
-They had a phone call?
-Pardon?

11
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,280
Han Cheol-ho and the killer
talked over the phone.

12
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,200
Yes.

13
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,990
I think we can make
something out of this.

14
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,330
-Who?
-Han Sang-hoon.

15
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,200
In it, he wrote that we should
investigate the phone call...

16
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,120
between that killer and you.

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,950
He's making it seem like
you have a relationship with that man.

18
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,620
He's a cunning one.

19
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,540
He didn't want to die alone.

20
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,580
Hey.

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,620
Can you send me...

22
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,450
...a copy of Kang Chul's will?

23
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,450
Murder without context.

24
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,030
Murder without context

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,700
A mass shooting without a purpose.

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,540
Manipulated recording.

27
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,540
That's how I'll die.

28
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,580
I'll die without reason. In vain.

29
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,790
Investigate the phone call between
the killer and Han Cheol-ho.

30
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,200
Those two are connected.
I'm sure of it.

31
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,950
Although I don't exactly know how.

32
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,660
Those two are connected.
I'm sure of it.

33
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,830
Please find out
how they're related for me.

34
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,580
I'm innocent.

35
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,330
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

36
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,990
Even so, we need to confirm
what's on the will.

37
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,660
They'll investigate on the call.

38
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,910
I just called to give you a warning.

39
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,280
Recording

40
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,990
Yes, it's me.

41
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,830
Do you know what you'll do
once I'm caught?

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,990
I do. You will...

43
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,330
kill me.

44
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,790
I'll help you become President.

45
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,030
-What?
-I'll help you.

46
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,410
I know a lot about Kang Chul.

47
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,830
He'll become a murderer.

48
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,370
And the killer behind
his father's death will be him, too.

49
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,280
You're insane.

50
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,740
What on earth are you...

51
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,330
I'll make it happen for you right now.

52
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,280
Why did you call me?

53
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,660
Don't you know?

54
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,030
If you become the president,
it will all be thanks to me.

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,410
You can pay me back later.

56
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,240
We're in this together now.

57
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,830
More

58
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,030
Delete

59
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,540
Do you want to delete this file?

60
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,660
No files

61
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,330
Do you think Han Cheol-ho
will try to kill him for that?

62
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,330
His character is
a simple-minded antagonist.

63
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,870
That's how your father made him.

64
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,160
I'm sure he'll do it as long as
there are no unforeseen variables.

65
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,580
I hear Kang Chul is dead.

66
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,240
-Did he really die?
-What is it to you?

67
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,120
You should worry about your own life.

68
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,740
-I'm asking you if he's dead.
-Don't look at me like that.

69
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,870
Yes. He's dead. Why?

70
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,620
-Idiot.
-What?

71
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,450
You idiots really have no
idea what's going on.

72
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,990
-What did you say?
-Go get Han Cheol-ho.

73
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,660
-What?
-Congressman Han Cheol-ho.

74
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,160
-Call him. Tell him I called for him.
-What?

75
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,160
He better not get any ideas.

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,410
If he's trying to get rid of me,
I'll kill him first.

77
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,280
He better be careful if
he doesn't want a hole in his head.

78
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,990
Tell him to go find Kang Chul.
He's not dead.

79
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,450
Understand?

80
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,410
Are you crazy? Okay.

81
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,830
I'm sorry. There was traffic.

82
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,700
I went ahead and started first.

83
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,990
Do you know Han Sang-hoon?

84
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,490
He's the criminal that was arrested
for the mass shooting.

85
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,620
-What about him?
-He's looking for you.

86
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,080
-He's asking to see you.
-Pardon?

87
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,410
You've never met him, have you?

88
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,700
-How would I know him?
-That's what I mean.

89
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,580
Maybe someone's setting you up.

90
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,450
Now that the troublemaker
Kang Chul is dead,

91
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,120
this man is stirring up trouble.

92
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,030
Gosh.

93
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,950
I'm sorry I'm late.

94
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,200
Hi, come on in.

95
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,910
-The traffic's quite heavy, wasn't it?
-Yes.

96
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,660
He got me good.

97
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,660
I thought he was insane, but I was wrong.

98
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,740
A trap?

99
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,410
Why?

100
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,410
How did Kang Chul know
to write it in his will?

101
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,790
I'll get rid of it.

102
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,660
I'll nip it in the bud.

103
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,200
Hello?

104
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,410
How have you been?

105
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,870
What are your boys doing these days?

106
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,660
I have a job for you.

107
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,120
I have a job for you.

108
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,280
Myungsei University Medical Centre

109
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,450
She always calls when I'm about to eat.

110
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,120
Hello? Yes, Yeon-joo.

111
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,950
Have you see the webtoon?
It went up a while ago.

112
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,080
I had a surgery so I just saw it.

113
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,540
I see.
The story's moving forward well.

114
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,580
-How's Dad?
-He's still the same.

115
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,620
I checked a minute ago.

116
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,200
Check again.

117
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,990
I checked 10 minutes ago.

118
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,280
Fine.

119
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,450
He's still the same.

120
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,870
Is the killer still alive?

121
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,790
It looks like Han Cheol-ho
is hiring men for the job.

122
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,280
The time there and here
are different. I have no idea.

123
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,830
In my opinion,

124
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,990
I think it's almost time.

125
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,910
-What about him?
-Who?

126
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,200
Oh, Chul? He went out.

127
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,830
-Where?
-I don't know.

128
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,240
He doesn't sit still for a minute.

129
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,120
Keep checking on Dad for me.
I done here, so I'll be right over.

130
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,910
-Hello?
-What are you doing?

131
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,120
I just got off work.

132
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,870
Where are you anyway?
I heard you went out.

133
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,790
Come out. I'll buy you coffee.

134
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,740
Are you nearby?

135
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,540
Okay. I'm leaving now.

136
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,370
What do you want to drink?

137
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,660
Iced coffee.

138
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,200
Coffee? Okay.

139
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,080
Do I look okay?

140
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,080
You look absolutely gorgeous.

141
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,700
I'll leave now.

142
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,410
See you tomorrow.

143
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,450
Is she seeing someone?

144
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,740
Hope is making me imagine again.

145
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,660
Dad.

146
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,240
Dad.

147
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,910
When Dad returns safely,

148
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,240
the real finale of "W" will begin.

149
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,410
What are your boys doing these days?

150
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,620
Who are Han Cheol-ho's underlings?

151
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,330
The gang is called Baekcheong.

152
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,790
Han Cheol-ho used to help them
when he was a prosecutor.

153
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,280
This is great!

154
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,200
Where should we go
after getting the work done?

155
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,330
Let's go somewhere nice.

156
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,870
Jang Won-hui is their leader.

157
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,910
He was on several other episodes.

158
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,540
This music is great! Go faster!

159
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,160
You have their personal
information, right?

160
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,540
Yes. I'll go get it.

161
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,620
This is the list of
Cheol-ho's gang members.

162
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,330
Seo Do-yoon will pass
all the information he got...

163
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,120
from Chul to broadcasting stations.

164
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,910
Gangdong Police will
eliminate all social evils!

165
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,910
Cheol-ho goes to prison
like he was supposed to,

166
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,120
for the reasons associated with
Chul and Han Sang-hoon's death.

167
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,700
Kang Chul

168
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,370
The citizens who once loathed Chul...

169
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,280
start missing him again.

170
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,740
He dies, but regains his fame
as the lead character...

171
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,910
and escapes the crisis
of ceasing to exist.

172
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,080
The end

173
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,950
With Chul coming back to me,

174
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,910
"W" ends with a happy ending.

175
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,910
When the cartoon ends,

176
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,910
he will be no longer tied
up to the setting of "W".

177
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,990
He will no longer be
the lead character of a cartoon.

178
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,910
He won't have to suffer through
a set story as the lead character.

179
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,200
Dad's inside.

180
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,240
He will just be a special person
who can travel between two worlds.

181
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,740
Dad.

182
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,700
We're here.

183
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,740
How are you?

184
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,910
He will live here now.
There's no problem.

185
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,790
Can I join you?
I haven't eaten yet.

186
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,240
Have a seat. Have a seat.

187
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,120
I'll get the rice.

188
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,240
Stop eating so loudly!

189
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,620
You're chewing so loudly.

190
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,910
There is no way Dad is
going to accept the situation easily.

191
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,080
But he will accept us one day.

192
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,330
Fine, let's forget it. Forget it.

193
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,410
What can I do now?
It already happened.

194
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,490
He's a human.
I didn't draw him.

195
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,030
What are you doing?

196
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,910
Do you want to play go?
I heard you like it.

197
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,450
Who's winning?

198
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,790
Dad, did you lose again?

199
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,620
Let's play one more time
so that you can beat your friends.

200
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,330
It will be hard to find
another player like me.

201
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,540
Unless you learn
from a professional player.

202
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,790
I have to wait patiently...

203
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,660
and take it slowly.

204
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,910
Tell him to sit.

205
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,700
Have a seat.

206
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,910
Have a seat.
Come, have a seat.

207
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,240
Do you drink coffee?

208
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,700
Yes, thank you.

209
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,080
Oh my, aren't you handsome?

210
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,910
You're lovely.

211
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,990
How old are you?

212
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,540
I am 30 years old.

213
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,330
That's perfect.

214
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,490
You look like you came out
of a comic book.

215
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,490
What's so fine about him?

216
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,030
Mum will be difficult,

217
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,830
but Auntie will help me.

218
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,200
You're tall, too.

219
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,490
-Auntie only cares about the looks.
-You are so handsome.

220
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,540
Did you already pay?

221
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,450
I was going to pay.

222
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,080
I should at least buy the coffee.

223
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,950
I'm making my wife work alone.

224
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,330
I guess your conscience is working.

225
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,280
I have conscience.
I just don't have money.

226
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,990
By the way, why are you here?
I was going to go home.

227
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,080
I had somewhere to go after this.

228
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,700
Where?

229
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,700
I'm curious about what's happening.

230
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,030
In the cartoon?

231
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,330
I want to know how things are going,
and I have to meet Do-yoon, too.

232
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,950
I need to settle the inheritance issue.

233
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,830
What will you do about it?

234
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,620
I'm going to establish a foundation...

235
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,280
that supports crime investigations.

236
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,910
Do-yoon will run it.

237
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,120
I can't bring the money here anyway.

238
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,450
I see.

239
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,280
Are you disappointed?

240
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,870
What? No.

241
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,910
You seem very disappointed.

242
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,200
No, not at all. Why do you say that?

243
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,910
Maybe you liked me for my money.

244
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,740
Should I bring some gold bars?

245
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Draw me a few things
and our task will be complete.

246
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,330
-What's this?
-It's a voice file.

247
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,790
This will need to be in Han Cheol-ho's
office to be found as evidence...

248
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,280
so that we can put him in jail.

249
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,700
We should get your father back
some time tonight.

250
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,700
Are you sure?

251
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,950
If there are no variables.

252
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,740
What variables?

253
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,830
I just hope there won't be any.
Don't worry too much.

254
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,870
Hey, Yeon-joo!

255
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,490
I'm glad I found you here.

256
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,370
I told you about him, right?

257
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,660
-I have something to tell you.
-Pardon?

258
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,830
I'm going to survive.

259
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,990
I was a fan before, but
I'll oppose "W" starting from today.

260
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,160
-What?
-You probably know...

261
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,660
how much I hoped for
Mr Oh's beautiful ending.

262
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,030
But you've seen it, right?
You must have seen what happened.

263
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,240
Oh Yeon-joo appeared again!
I'm so sick of that character!

264
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,490
So I made a conclusion.

265
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,740
Kang Chul is more foolish
than Yeon-joo.

266
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,030
And the one more foolish than Chul...

267
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,620
...is me who's reading
this webtoon like a fool.

268
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,740
Therefore,

269
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,660
I have abandoned "W".

270
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,280
"W" is no longer a work.
It's only trash.

271
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,910
What? What?

272
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,990
Are you upset that I offended
your father? I don't care.

273
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,030
Tell your father about my anger.

274
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,950
On behalf of the readers,

275
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,540
I can't hide my anger or disappointment.

276
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,660
I'll write things that oppose
his work 100 times.

277
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,870
Tell him to brace himself
for penalty points.

278
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,120
You'll probably never see
such a transparent hater.

279
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,620
My screen name is Professor Park.

280
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,870
Tell him that the hater
called Professor Park is me.

281
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,450
Isn't that too much of a nonsense
for you to become a hater?

282
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,540
Pardon?

283
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,620
Is Kang Chul that foolish?

284
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,120
Isn't Yeon-joo a decent woman?

285
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,620
Which Yeon-joo do you mean?

286
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,660
Do you mean Yeon-joo here
or in the comic?

287
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,450
I don't know any
Yeon-joo who is decent.

288
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,240
You don't like her much?

289
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,790
I can't decide which one is worse.

290
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,280
Is she that bad?

291
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,330
Especially Yeon-joo here.

292
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,790
She's both horrible and disgusting.

293
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,620
She's horribly disgusting.

294
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,240
-Dr Park?
-Yes?

295
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,030
Would you like to order?
Shall I buy you some coffee?

296
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,240
-Let's go.
-Wait.

297
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,990
Who are you, by the way?

298
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,370
Hello, I'm Yeon-joo's friend.

299
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,790
Oh, I see.

300
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,910
I beg your pardon.

301
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,950
-I was upset, so please understand.
-What would you like?

302
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,120
You like iced latte, right?

303
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,280
What's wrong now?

304
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Haven't we met before?

305
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,490
-We have?
-Isn't that right?

306
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,620
I've never met you before.

307
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,620
Why do you seem so familiar?

308
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,490
Do you look like someone?

309
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,990
Kang Chul?

310
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,950
Kang Chul?

311
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,870
That's right. You look like him.

312
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,200
That's right.

313
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,410
-You look exactly like him.
-What are you doing?

314
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,990
-Many people say that.
-Right?

315
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,790
Goodness, how is this possible?

316
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,030
You look exactly like him.

317
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,030
-Doctor, let's go order...
-Seriously,

318
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,990
you'd be perfect for
the movie based on the comic.

319
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,030
You'd be the perfect actor for it.

320
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,790
-Do you think so?
-Of course.

321
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,370
Why don't you audition?
What do you do?

322
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,030
-I'll give you my business card.
-Okay.

323
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,240
Let's see. President Kang Chul.

324
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,200
Kang Chul?

325
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,740
Many people say that I look like him,
so I made it for fun.

326
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,910
Goodness, wait a minute.

327
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,830
You're such a funny man.

328
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,030
You're so funny.

329
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,950
It's nice to meet you, President Kang.

330
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,370
-Doctor, we have to get going.
-Okay.

331
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,450
Where did you meet such a funny man?

332
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,620
It's so great to meet you.
We should really talk.

333
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,240
-Wait. We should...
-Dr Park!

334
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,330
-Okay.
-Please.

335
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,740
-Let's go for a drink sometime.
-Come on.

336
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,280
We used up our 20 minutes with him.

337
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,410
I don't have to walk you home,
right? Draw as soon as you get home.

338
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,910
Okay.

339
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,080
You won't get in danger, right?

340
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,620
You know I am free to do whatever I want.

341
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,120
Don't worry about me.

342
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,540
Please be careful.

343
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,280
I'll call you.

344
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,620
Is the hotel building where
I used to live in the reference?

345
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,540
Yes, here it is.

346
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,660
I only changed the name to Miracle Hotel.

347
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,910
What's the address?

348
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,950
I'm not sure.

349
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,990
Where are you?

350
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,490
-I'm on my way home.
-We aren't inside the comic, right?

351
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,240
What do you mean?

352
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,620
How could we talk on the phone, then?

353
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,950
We're talking on the phone now.

354
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,790
Then why did I see So-hee just now?

355
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,870
So-hee? Do you mean Yoon So-hee?

356
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
No.

357
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,620
What are you talking about?

358
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,490
Never mind, I'll call you later.
I'm not sure what's going on.

359
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,080
Soo-bong.

360
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,990
Soo-bong.

361
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,830
Soo-bong.

362
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,950
Where did he go?

363
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,120
Myungsei University Medical Centre

364
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,280
-Hello?
-What happened to Dad?

365
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,370
-What?
-The door's open and he's gone.

366
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,540
What happened to Dad?

367
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,200
I definitely locked the door.

368
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,200
I'll call you after I found him.

369
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,330
Yeon-joo.

370
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,490
-Dad?
-Yeon-joo.

371
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,540
Dad.

372
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,030
Dad.

373
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,200
-When did you get here?
-A minute ago.

374
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,740
I didn't empty it out like you
told me to, but what will you do?

375
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,120
I need a place to stay
when I come back here.

376
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,950
Where are you coming from?

377
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,120
-From the moon?
-Gosh.

378
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,030
Stop joking around.
I'm serious.

379
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,790
I was at your funeral yesterday.
I don't feel like joking around.

380
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,330
I'm sorry.
It's too complicated to explain.

381
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,700
I'll tell you in time.
Where is the will?

382
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,410
Here.

383
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,910
Cha Young-ho Law Firm

384
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,280
Transferrer

385
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,280
Don't give it to me.
I don't want to deal with it.

386
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,080
Who else can I trust?

387
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
I told you I'm retiring.

388
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,240
I'm going to start martial arts again.

389
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,740
I hate dealing with paperwork.

390
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,200
I'll leave it under your name for now.
You can deal with it later.

391
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,540
Stop being such a...

392
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,280
Right. Have you seen So-hee?

393
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,540
-What?
-I think So-hee saw you.

394
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,450
-Where?
-At the lobby.

395
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,620
She says she saw you driving out.

396
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,450
Did she really see me?

397
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,950
So-hee, I have to get going.
I have to meet someone.

398
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,620
I'll get you a cab.

399
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,030
I just saw Chul.

400
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,120
-What?
-He was here just now.

401
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,870
He drove up in his car,
but it suddenly disappeared.

402
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,120
What are you talking about?
That makes no sense.

403
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,240
He's dead.

404
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,830
No. He saw me, too.

405
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,660
How can this be?

406
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,910
It was suddenly day-time.

407
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,450
I saw sunlight as I was walking out.

408
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,370
That's when Chul appeared.

409
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,030
But now it's suddenly night-time again.

410
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,240
His car disappeared, too.

411
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,030
What is happening?

412
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,280
It was so hard to cover up.
You need to be more careful.

413
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,910
Hello? Yes.

414
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,990
I'm out right now.

415
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,620
There is...

416
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,410
another variable?

417
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,950
Yes, I was definitely
thinking about So-hee.

418
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,660
I was suddenly reminded of her
as I drove up to the hotel.

419
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,740
I'm the protagonist
and I'm living in the real world.

420
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,910
Then it's the third hypothesis?

421
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,280
If I think of a character
from the cartoon,

422
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,830
they can be summoned into the real world.

423
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,910
Did I...

424
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,580
accidentally summon someone?

425
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,990
Does it hurt anywhere?
Are you all right?

426
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,950
I think I'm okay.

427
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,990
Do you want water?

428
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,910
You should rest for a bit,
then go to the hospital.

429
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,490
You need to get some tests.
Who knows what damages you have?

430
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,910
What happened?

431
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,080
How did I come back?

432
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,200
It's just as the story you had
originally planned.

433
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,080
Kang Chul came back and wrote it instead.

434
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,910
He's making Han Cheol-ho
kill the killer.

435
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,790
He said that's the only way
to bring you back.

436
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,660
Kang Chul?

437
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,910
Yes, Chul.

438
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,910
He came here, Dad.

439
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,490
Don't you remember?
We spent a few days together.

440
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,200
I don't know.

441
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,410
I don't know.

442
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,450
Don't think about it for now.
You need to rest.

443
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,740
Where is Chul?

444
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,490
Where is he?

445
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,410
He went back there.

446
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,240
Into the cartoon?

447
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,450
Yes. He didn't know when you'd be back.

448
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,830
He'll come back once he confirms
the killer is dead.

449
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,030
I better call Soo-bong.
He's going to be so happy.

450
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,740
He's been having heart palpitations
because of you.

451
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,910
That means Kang Chul isn't here, right?

452
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,910
I waited for nothing.

453
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,660
Pardon?

454
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,830
I was thinking...

455
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,660
this would be my chance
to get rid of you both at once.

456
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,870
Dad.

457
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,120
Dad?

458
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,410
How am I your dad?

459
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,030
Do-yoon!
Where is Han Cheol-ho right now?

460
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,990
How can that happen? How is that
possible in a police station?

461
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,870
I'm speechless.

462
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,620
All right. Call me back.

463
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,540
-What happened?
-It's Ms Yoon, about Han Sang-hoon.

464
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,990
-Is he dead?
-No, he escaped.

465
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,990
-What?
-Can you believe that?

466
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,870
How can they lose a killer when
they already had him in the station?

467
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,450
Hey. Can't you hear me?

468
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,540
Don't send me to prosecution!

469
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,330
Han Cheol-ho will kill me en route.
Don't you understand?

470
00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:00,080
He's going to send men to kill me!

471
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,240
You better protect me right now,
you fools!

472
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,870
Call Han Cheol-ho.

473
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,830
I said, bring Han Cheol-ho!

474
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,330
Seriously.

475
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,330
Hey, where did he go?

476
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,490
What?

477
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,950
What happened?

478
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,370
Come by 10 AM. Okay.

479
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,240
Yes. My name is Park Soo-bong.

480
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,740
I've been having pain in my heart.

481
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,580
I'll be right there.

482
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,120
Yes, thank you.

483
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,030
Goodness.

484
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,950
Were you locked in here?

485
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,910
Come out now.

486
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,120
Dad?

487
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,120
How am I your dad?

488
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,620
It's been a while, Yeon-joo.

489
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,910
You were the problem. You.

490
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,910
The story got messed up because of you.

491
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,330
You kept on drawing.

492
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,740
Kang Chul should've been long dead.

493
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,910
You hid him and saved him.

494
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,280
You took the book to the other world
and made Chul realise everything.

495
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,990
If it weren't for you,
this would've ended a long time ago.

496
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,910
Do you know how much of a hassle this is?

497
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,910
I read all the cartoons here.

498
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,700
I know how Chul goes back and forth
between the two worlds.

499
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,700
Once you get how it works, it's easy.

500
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,330
It was easy enough for me to do.

501
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,200
Do you want to go with me?

502
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,540
To find your husband?

503
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,330
He just disappeared
during the investigation.

504
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,700
-Does that make sense?
-When was that?

505
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,280
It must've been about an hour.

506
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,540
I'm sorry. I'll call you again.

507
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,410
Where are you going?

508
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,410
Where are you going?

509
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,450
Oh Yeon-joo

510
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,490
Kang Chul

511
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
All right.

512
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,620
Draw a car.

513
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,200
Draw a mobile phone, too.

514
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,700
I'll have you know we were all ready.

515
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,370
But all of a sudden, a siren went off.

516
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,240
He had run off. He ran from
the investigation room.

517
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,030
Are you hearing yourself?

518
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,240
How can he get out of that room?

519
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,870
How could he get out of there?

520
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,870
It's getting worse.

521
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,580
Caller ID Restricted

522
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,700
Hello?

523
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,990
I told you not to bother me, didn't I?

524
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,370
You never listen to me.
I helped you so much.

525
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,240
How did you leave that room?

526
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,370
Don't bother me!

527
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,280
I can kill you right away, you hear me?

528
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,120
You don't even know how things work.
What makes you think you can kill me?

529
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,580
And do you think I don't know
about that gangster Jang Won-hui?

530
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,870
Prepare a safe house.

531
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:48,910
Right now.

532
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,830
Find a place within five minutes
and send me the address.

533
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,700
I told you.

534
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,620
We're on the same boat now.

535
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,080
Hey.

536
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,200
Why am I on your boat?

537
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,950
Chul is alive.

538
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,870
He's not dead yet.

539
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,540
Don't think about anything else
if you want to catch him. Okay?

540
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,080
Let's go to Gwangmyeong.
Drive.

541
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,830
Good job.

542
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,910
You can rest after this.

543
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,740
I don't need that tablet now,

544
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,080
so destroy it completely.

545
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:37,830
Go.

546
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,910
Gosh.

547
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:14,950
Oh gosh.

548
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,620
Oh, Chul.

549
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,370
-Wait out here.
-What?

550
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:23,700
Come in later. It's dangerous.

551
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,410
Chul! What's wrong, Chul?

552
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,330
What's going on?

553
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,410
It's dangerous here.
Go somewhere else.

554
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,120
What's happening? I thought
everything was going well.

555
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,200
-The killer kidnapped Yeon-joo.
-What?

556
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:18,240
The killer kidnapped Yeon-joo?
How did he...

557
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,540
Chul! Chul! Chul!

558
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,080
Darn it.

559
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,330
Where am I supposed to start?

560
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,540
Just who is he?

561
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,410
Hello? Are you on the way?

562
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,620
Listen to me carefully.

563
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,950
Do not kill him.
Just watch what he does.

564
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,700
I have something to check,
so make sure he doesn't run!

565
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:57,080
Do you get it?

566
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,620
Good. I will go there.

567
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,200
Where did you send
Han Sang-hoon?

568
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:16,200
-You are...
-What's the address you mentioned?

569
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,490
Where is Sang-hoon?

570
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,660
How are you still alive?

571
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,540
Tell me now.
I don't have time.

572
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,870
Sir! Sir! What's going on?

573
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:42,990
Han Cheol-ho

574
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:46,370
Who are you?

575
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,700
-Kang Chul...
-Kang Chul?

576
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,830
Sir! Sir!

577
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,740
Are you all right?

578
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,910
What happened?
He looked a lot like Kang Chul.

579
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,910
Gwangmyeong

580
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:24,700
Why don't I take you to the hospital?

581
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,370
Leave me alone for a while.

582
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,240
I am sorry.

583
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,240
I didn't see anyone going in.
For this to happen...

584
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,490
-Kang Chul...
-Yes?

585
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,080
Kang Chul is alive.

586
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:44,740
But Chul died, didn't he?
He looked quite similar, but...

587
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,700
He was right.

588
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,540
It's even better if
there's a will of his repentance.

589
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,620
Who are you?

590
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,910
There's something.

591
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,910
There's something that I don't know.

592
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,370
How dare you threaten me from both sides?

593
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,700
-Prepare the car.
-Where are you going?

594
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,540
If there's something we don't know,
we should find out.

595
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:23,910
Turn left.

596
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,200
Turn right over here.

597
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,830
Okay. Stop here.

598
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:44,540
Under construction

599
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,120
Turn off the car.

600
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,160
Get off.

601
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,080
I wanted to shoot you
in front of your husband.

602
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,160
But I think this is the only way
to make Chul come here.

603
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:34,620
I waited so long for this.

604
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:37,200
But Kang Chul didn't remember you.

605
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,950
What's the point of shooting you
when he couldn't recognise his wife?

606
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,740
Now that he knows who you are,

607
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,540
there's a point in shooting you.

608
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:54,910
Please...

609
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:57,910
Please...

610
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,910
let me go.

611
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:06,540
I can't. You're his family.

612
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:09,160
The purpose of my existence
is to get rid of you.

613
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,450
Please, I beg you.

614
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,950
So why did you marry him?

615
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,410
No one asked you to be
the female lead in the comic.

616
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,580
Did you think it'd be a good ending?

617
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,280
To be continued

618
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:06,030
What is that?

619
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,910
Have you lost your mind?

620
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:11,660
Move, you brat!

621
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,910
"W" by Oh Seong-moo

622
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,910
Did you think it'd be a good ending?

623
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,910
Gosh.

624
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,910
What's that?
What's going on?

625
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:30,910
What should we do?

626
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:48,990
Idiots.

627
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:50,540
What's the problem?

628
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,200
To be continued

629
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,410
I'm going back in.

630
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,660
I mean, how can this be happening?

631
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,280
Are you sure you've
never seen her before?

632
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,540
Yes, I'm sure.

633
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:17,240
I don't think she even lives here.
Who should I call?

634
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,580
It's disturbing.

635
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,240
It's quite absurd.

636
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,330
She doesn't have a bag or a mobile phone.

637
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,660
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

638
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:30,620
What happened...

639
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:32,910
to the woman who was here?

640
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,240
Goodness!

641
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,240
What happened here?

642
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:51,330
I found a woman passed out
and covered in blood,

643
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:53,790
so I called an ambulance.
It just left a moment ago.

644
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,870
-Is she alive?
-She was alive then,

645
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,540
but I'm not sure because she was dying.

646
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,120
Which hospital is she at?

647
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:05,990
I heard she's in critical condition...

648
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:07,620
from bleeding too much.

649
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,910
You seem injured. Are you okay?

650
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,620
What's your relationship
with the patient?

651
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:24,910
I'm her husband.

00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,240
W-Two Worlds

653
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,030
Where is Yeon-joo?

654
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,830
Where's Yeon-joo?

655
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:04,450
Yeon-joo?

656
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:07,620
Even if I kill you right now,

657
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:09,540
it won't be considered a crime.

658
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:13,200
No one will find out
even if you die here again.

659
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,410
I have to save her.

660
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,580
What happened to Yeon-joo?

661
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,870
She is dead.

00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:35,120
