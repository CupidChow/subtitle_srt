1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,350
W-Two Worlds

2
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,300
With accumulated sales
hitting 10 million copies

3
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,420
-Thank you.
-Sure.

4
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,960
"W" is Korea's best webtoon series.

5
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,000
Kang Chul finds out
through Oh Yeon-joo

6
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,420
that he's a main character
of a webtoon series.

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,590
He comes out into
Yeon-joo's world of reality.

8
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,340
So I guess this is where you created me.

9
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,550
With those petty fingers of yours.

10
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,170
He tries to get his life back.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,550
Through Oh Seong-moo,
he realises that his life is

12
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,380
a fake reality that the artist set up.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,210
Finally,

14
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,300
in order to create
a proper ending to his life,

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,710
he chooses death.

16
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,920
And in that moment,
the webtoon series "W" ends.

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,880
The end

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,130
After two months,

19
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,550
Yeon-joo, who couldn't forget Chul,

20
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,210
accidentally finds out that
Chul is not dead.

21
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,800
Please save him.
I think it's possible.

22
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,210
What do you mean? Isn't it over?

23
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,210
Time didn't pass. It stopped.

24
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,630
"The end" meant that
time stopped in the last scene.

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,880
He's still in the river right now.

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,300
The End

27
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,840
To be continued

28
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,220
Episode 7

29
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,800
I don't want to eat ramyeon.

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,420
Forget the ramyeon.

31
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,880
Do you remember?

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,670
I think

33
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,090
I heard it a long time ago from Mr Oh.

34
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,250
Something about "W."

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,210
I heard you...

36
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,630
I heard you created "W."

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,000
He said Kang Chul's character
was created by you.

38
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,500
-What do you mean?
-He said...

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,710
he based "W" on a story
you wrote as a kid. Do you remember it?

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,250
That's 9.7. She lost it.

41
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,210
Firing point 1, 9.7.

42
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,590
Oh, there she goes.

43
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,880
No way! I can't believe it!

44
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,500
We should've won!

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,090
Girls!

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,300
Keep it down!

47
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,170
I told you.
Keep the volume down.

48
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,840
Mum, this is an important moment.
Come hurry here.

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,340
Did we win a gold medal?

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,340
We were winning the whole time,
but it just became a tie.

51
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,920
By the way,
isn't she absolutely gorgeous?

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,920
She's only a high school student,
yet she's really good.

53
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,710
She's shooting.

54
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,130
What do we do, Yeon-joo?
I think my heart will burst.

55
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,130
Let's see how it goes.

56
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,800
Nancy Johnson, the American shooter...

57
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,300
We lost it!

58
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,210
-No way!
-I don't believe it.

59
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,630
What a shame.

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,500
She must've been too nervous.

61
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,380
-Let's go together.
-Let's eat.

62
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,250
We're doomed.
It's such a shame.

63
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,710
-Isn't she beautiful?
-She's seriously beautiful.

64
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,130
I thought we would win the gold medal!

65
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,500
Gosh.

66
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,000
He's an 18-year-old
sophomore in high school.

67
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,000
High school sophomore.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He's a national shooting athlete.

69
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,420
He should be 180cm tall.

70
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,340
No, make it 185cm tall.

71
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,380
His name is...

72
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,500
What should I call him?

73
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,090
Yeon-joo.

74
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,090
-Your friend, Seul-a called.
-Oh, thanks.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
-Hello?
-Hey, are you done?

76
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,800
I should call and tell the teacher
I can't get it done by tomorrow.

77
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,960
-I didn't do it either. I'm busy.
-What are you doing?

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I finally found the man of my dreams.

79
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,340
Gosh, did you change
your ideal type again?

80
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,000
No, it's real this time.

81
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,420
Listen.

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,340
He's a high school sophomore
and a national shooting athlete.

83
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,630
He joins a competition
and turns the game around.

84
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,590
And he's a genius, too.
He's a good student and a good athlete.

85
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,750
He's over 185cm tall. He's thin,
but he's got a muscular body.

86
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,920
He's very sweet.

87
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,710
He's kind and funny too.

88
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,800
He sounds amazing.

89
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,840
Who is it?
Does he go to our school?

90
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,130
-No.
-Then which school is he from?

91
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,840
Let me see his face.

92
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,920
You can't see his face.

93
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,000
You can't meet him.

94
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,710
Okay.

95
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,420
See you tomorrow. Bye.

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,840
High school sophomore,
national shooting athlete

97
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,000
-How is it going...
-Don't look! Don't!

98
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,300
I didn't look.
What's wrong with you?

99
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,500
Yeon-joo, I need to see it.

100
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,500
I have to see it
to tell you anything. Come on.

101
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,840
I need to see it. Let me see.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,340
That's a new character!

103
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,710
He's nothing like Chul.

104
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,920
It's too difficult.

105
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,090
I can't draw this.

106
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,710
Mr Oh said you draw well.

107
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,880
I heard you wanted to
be a cartoonist once.

108
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,460
I haven't drawn in ages.

109
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,380
And I'm not used to this pen.

110
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,500
We didn't have this before.

111
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,880
If you can't do it, just give up.

112
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,550
-When Mr Oh comes back
-Hey.

113
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,090
Don't say anything to Dad.

114
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,090
I'll save him.

115
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm going to save Chul.

116
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,090
Gosh.

117
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,920
Not everyone can draw a cartoon.
Good luck.

118
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,880
Life is sometimes

119
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,000
-Did you see that?
-Someone just fell off!

120
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,920
-Hurry up!
-Flash the light over there!

121
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,210
Someone's in here!

122
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,090
The prison breaker is here!

123
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,170
Over here!

124
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,000
Freeze! Don't move.

125
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,300
Yes. They say he isn't hurt.

126
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,630
I don't know that.
I'll let you know when he wakes up.

127
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,630
There's no need for you
to come over right now.

128
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,300
He's awake. I'll call you back.

129
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,590
What happened?

130
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,500
Explain why you went to Han River
and why you fell off that bridge.

131
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,210
Someone pushed you, right?

132
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,710
Why on earth did you go there
in the middle of the night?

133
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,550
What happened?

134
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,000
That's what I'm asking you.

135
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,500
What is the date today?

136
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,880
What did I do today?

137
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,000
-I don't know when it started
-What's with you?

138
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,250
You don't remember?

139
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,960
You suddenly disappeared after
you visited Yeon-joo.

140
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,170
Everyone was busy looking for Yeon-joo
after she escaped,

141
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,210
and you were missing all day.

142
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,340
I tried to find you, but you didn't
answer your phone.

143
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,000
Then I got a call from the police
that you fell off a bridge.

144
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,000
Why did you go to Han River
at that hour and fall off a bridge?

145
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,250
What's going on?

146
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,960
Ms Yeon-joo was...

147
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,590
-You're awake.
-What's with Yeon-joo?

148
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,590
What happened to you at the river?

149
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,420
What were you going to say?

150
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,380
They found Ms Yeon-joo.

151
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,670
-Did they catch her?
-I just got a call. She was caught.

152
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,420
That's a relief.

153
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,840
They would've blamed us
if she's not found.

154
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,420
-Where was she?
-She was in the detention centre.

155
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,880
What do you mean?

156
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,550
They couldn't find her
yet she was in there all along?

157
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,420
Where are you going?

158
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,960
Where are you going this late?

159
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,710
Tell them I need to see her now.

160
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,750
Suspect Oh who escaped from
Seoul Detention Centre

161
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,710
and caused a disturbance
was caught a while ago.

162
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,550
The police expected the suspect
to flee downtown, but it appears

163
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,250
she was hiding inside the detention
centre when she was caught.

164
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,880
She is arrested and now being taken
to Seoul Jungbu Police Station,

165
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,250
where investigation is expected to
continue throughout the night.

166
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,800
Mr Kang?

167
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,000
-Good evening.
-You must've heard the news.

168
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,710
We're taking the suspect
to Jungbu Police Station.

169
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,710
-You may...
-I'm sorry, but I need to talk to her.

170
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,300
Wait. I can't let you do that.

171
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,500
-Please make an official request
-It won't take long.

172
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,750
Please give me five minutes.

173
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,000
Are you okay?

174
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,880
I was curious what happens after
jumping off a bridge. You seem fine.

175
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,550
-How...
-How are you still alive?

176
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,420
When you threw yourself from the bridge,

177
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,380
the river police's boat was passing
under that bridge coincidentally.

178
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,800
An even bigger coincidence was that

179
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,840
there were two divers on that boat.

180
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,130
The moment you fell, the divers
went in the water and saved you

181
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,920
right before you stopped breathing.

182
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,000
You were so lucky.

183
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,000
I can't believe someone can be
that lucky.

184
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,670
What about your father?

185
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,340
He's alive.

186
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,750
Two months have passed over there.

187
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,920
He's healed and is on a trip.

188
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,880
Don't tell me

189
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,750
your father saved me.

190
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,800
It wasn't my dad.

191
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,710
I saved you.

192
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,840
I'm the one who saved you.

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,340
Which means...

194
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,420
this would be...

195
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,670
the third time you owe me your life.

196
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,710
How did you do it?

197
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,170
Do you want to know?

198
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,840
Answer my question first,

199
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,420
and I'll tell you.

200
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,590
You're saying things
I said to you before.

201
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,300
If you lost your goal in life,

202
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,130
you can set up a new goal.

203
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,500
Don't jump off a bridge and
give up your life.

204
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,670
How can taking revenge be
your only goal in life?

205
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,340
If you're not sure what to do
with your life,

206
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,380
I can tell you right now
what you should do.

207
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,300
Get me out of here.

208
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,130
Not the way I escaped before,
but legally.

209
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,960
Get me out legally.

210
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,670
I don't want to be chased by the police
every time I come to see you.

211
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,670
You said you owe me your life,
but you've done nothing for me.

212
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,210
You know what an ungrateful person
you are, right?

213
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,920
I want you to pay me back from now on.

214
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,210
Do everything in your power
to save me from this.

215
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,920
You're a competent man, right?

216
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,840
If you want to know how I saved you,

217
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,420
get me out first.

218
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,210
I'll tell you after I'm out of
the detention centre.

219
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,880
You want me to bail out a prison breaker?

220
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,880
Do you think that's easy?

221
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,750
I know it's not easy.
So you should work very hard to do it.

222
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,090
Don't think about anything else.

223
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,340
Sir, I can't let you
talk to her any longer.

224
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,420
I'm going.

225
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,840
Also,

226
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,840
your life from now on
isn't my dad's work anymore.

227
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,130
That's already over completely.

228
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,960
From now on,

229
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,670
think of this as a sequel
we're making together.

230
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,920
My dad and I don't have the same taste.

231
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,630
I hate things like murder, revenge,
gunfight or thriller.

232
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,630
What I like is..

233
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,420
...sweet romance.

234
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,130
We need to go now.

235
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,250
Emergency Transport

236
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,800
-I'm sorry.
-If you want to visit her,

237
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,000
come to the police station
tomorrow morning.

238
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,960
Okay, I'll do that.

239
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,250
President Kang.

240
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,920
Where have you been?

241
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,710
Yoon So-hee,
Chul's friend and personal assistant

242
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,710
President Kang.

243
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,960
Where have you been?

244
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,250
What's wrong?

245
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,250
Seo Do-yoon

246
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,420
Seo Do-yoon, Chul's bodyguard

247
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,420
Call the legal team for me.

248
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,380
It's regarding Oh Yeon-joo.

249
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,630
Can't you hear me?
I asked where you were hiding.

250
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,090
Why aren't you answering me?

251
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,750
Say something, would you?
Just say anything!

252
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,550
Geez, she's starting again.

253
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,590
Where did this thing come from?

254
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,090
-Sir.
-She looks normal,

255
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,000
but why is she doing this to me?

256
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,550
Forget it.
She needs a psychiatric test.

257
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,250
If I talk to her any longer,
I'll lose my mind.

258
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,630
He's here.

259
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,090
Really?

260
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,630
Hello.

261
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,380
I heard you were coming,
so we chose this place.

262
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,550
It's more comfortable here.

263
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,130
I'm sorry for breaking the rules.

264
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,710
It's no trouble at all.

265
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,090
You're considered one of us anyhow.

266
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,920
Would you like some coffee?

267
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,380
That would be nice.

268
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,500
We've turned off the cameras.
So you may talk comfortably.

269
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,000
You came early.

270
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,300
Did you figure out a way already?

271
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,250
I heard it's not easy to bail
someone who broke from prison.

272
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,960
It's because you have power.

273
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,920
Who are you?

274
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,000
Who are you to decide
what to do with my life?

275
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,920
Who gave you the right?

276
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,880
I don't think I need you to tell me
how you saved me.

277
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,710
You must have drawn me yourself.

278
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,000
I don't know why, but you must have.

279
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,340
Maybe it's possible since
you're his daughter.

280
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,090
I honestly don't care about that.

281
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,960
However,

282
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,500
do you think it's your right
to draw and save me?

283
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,000
Why did you save me when I chose to die?

284
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,880
Who are you?

285
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,670
Are you a higher being?

286
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,920
You tried to kill me when
I desperately wanted to live.

287
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,340
Now you brought me back from death.

288
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,750
Is this a joke?

289
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,800
Is it thrilling and fun for you people?

290
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,550
How...

291
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,000
How could you say that?

292
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,630
Why would I...

293
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,420
You probably thought
I'd thank you for saving me.

294
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,960
A sequel?

295
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,500
You said it was a sequel.

296
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,710
You like sweet romance,

297
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,840
so you wanted to play with me?

298
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,000
What can I say?

299
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,420
You can just come here and have fun
when you're bored,

300
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,710
then return to your world after.

301
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,130
Did you bring me back for your romance?

302
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,590
Am I some kind of toy?

303
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,130
How...

304
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,300
How could you take it that way?

305
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,420
How do you expect me to live?

306
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,920
Do you know where I have been?

307
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,920
Kang Yoon

308
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,420
You have both parents,

309
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,000
but I don't.

310
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,670
I used to think they died,

311
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,800
but they never existed.

312
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,090
I was born alone as an orphan

313
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,000
at the tip of an alcoholic man's pen.

314
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,750
Why had I been sad?

315
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,210
What did I long for?

316
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,710
Don't get ahead of yourself.

317
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,420
You must feel proud of yourself,
but don't.

318
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,960
What you did was useless.
I'm not grateful.

319
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,420
Why did you create a sequel when
no one wants to continue this life?

320
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,800
I did a useless thing.

321
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,000
Do you realise now

322
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,630
that you've made a mistake?

323
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,800
Yes.

324
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,000
I realise that now.

325
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,500
Why did I even bother?

326
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,670
I shouldn't have cared even if
you stayed in the water forever.

327
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,920
Why did I work so hard all by myself
these past two months?

328
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,750
Exactly.

329
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,800
Why did you?

330
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,090
You should have kept working
at the hospital and dated people.

331
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,550
Why did you do this?

332
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,920
Why did you hold on to
such a pathetic webtoon

333
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,880
-and come here handcuffed
-Because I love you!

334
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,960
I know it doesn't make sense,

335
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,210
but I fell in love with you.

336
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,000
I love you.

337
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,340
Do you know you're unbelievable?

338
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,750
I love you.

339
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,420
You know that doesn't work on me.

340
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,880
It's because I love you!

341
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,250
You were acting so big as if
you'd never get swayed.

342
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You're easily swayed
by those little words.

343
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,500
Don't be so hard on me.

344
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,880
I don't come here because I want to.

345
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,000
I get dragged in here because
you keep thinking about me.

346
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,500
You thought about me in the water
and even now.

347
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,250
Am I wrong?

348
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,880
You're right.

349
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,420
I was afraid.

350
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,000
Of what?

351
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,130
I was afraid
I'd never be able to see you again.

352
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,550
Oh my.

353
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,630
Are you sure this is okay?
I think the detective saw us.

354
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,920
I don't care.

355
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,210
We're making arrangements.
Don't worry.

356
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,750
Is he still talking to her?

357
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,420
Did they know each other
before the incident?

358
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,920
-Pardon?
-What?

359
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,210
That's not possible.

360
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,000
They seemed close.

361
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,670
And not just close.
They seemed very close.

362
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,710
If I were to pick the happiest moment
in my 30 years of life,

363
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,210
funnily enough, I'd pick the night
I was lying alone in the cell.

364
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,670
I feel bad for my mum, but that was...

365
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,500
I wonder if she's home.

366
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeon-joo.

367
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,550
She's not home yet. What time is it?

368
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,340
Oh, my. Why isn't she home yet?

369
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,590
I completely forgot about my mum
who would be waiting for me.

370
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,670
-My gosh.
-Who was it?

371
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,380
Was it you? Was it you?

372
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,340
How can you be eating snacks
when someone is dying?

373
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,920
I didn't care if I couldn't work
at the hospital anymore.

374
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,840
My life started to feel unrealistic,

375
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,630
I almost deluded myself that

376
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,250
my life here at this moment was real.

377
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,960
Prisoner 4205, you have a visitor.

378
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,540
Okay.

379
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,210
-Where's Kang Chul?
-He's busy. Please sit.

380
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,540
-He wanted me to deliver his message.
-His message?

381
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,500
He'll walk you through
the legal issues later.

382
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,040
Mr Kang wanted me to tell you this.

383
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,960
I found out that there are many
types of sweet romance that girls like.

384
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,000
-What?
-Tell her to narrow it down

385
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,540
so I can pay her back.

386
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,670
Number one, a Cinderella story
with glamorous parties.

387
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,670
-What?
-Number two,

388
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,120
a romantic trip to the country.

389
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,870
Number three, a simple everyday romance.

390
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,370
What on earth is this?

391
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,370
Right. I'll add one more.

392
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,210
Number four, a bold and sexy,

393
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,120
adult-only romance.

394
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,370
-What?
-Mr Kang wanted me to tell you

395
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,460
he personally prefers number four.

396
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,370
Please pick one.
Which one would you like?

397
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,750
Pick what? What is this?

398
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,540
I heard you told him to pay back
what he owes with sweet romance.

399
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,540
No. This isn't what I meant.

400
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,420
This feels like business, asking me
to choose one of those options.

401
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,000
I didn't ask him to come up with
a business plan.

402
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,870
This is how he deals with things.

403
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,670
You should pick one so we can
start getting things ready.

404
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,870
Are you seriously

405
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,420
-telling me to choose one?
-Yes.

406
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,790
-What was number four?
-A bold and sexy, adult-only...

407
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,710
No, not that one.

408
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,540
-Maybe number one?
-Sure.

409
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,870
-A Cinderella story with parties.
-No.

410
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,960
-How about number three?
-A simple everyday romance.

411
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,170
Wait, hold on.

412
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,790
I do want to experience
glamorous parties.

413
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,290
-Is it number one, then?
-Hang on.

414
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,290
Gosh, you're so impatient.

415
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,000
Number three?

416
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,420
That's four fingers.

417
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,830
Number three?

418
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,330
Number three? All right.

419
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,120
I'll let Mr Kang know.

420
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,830
Wait.

421
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,960
I'm still stuck in here.

422
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,790
-Why are you telling me that
-You'll be out soon.

423
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:26,420
-How?
-Our attorney will explain that.

424
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,580
President Kang Chul

425
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Sir, Mr Son is here.

426
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,370
Mr Son.

427
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,960
Please come in.

428
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,670
I heard you are getting married.

429
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,500
Married?

430
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,830
Just on the document.

431
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,580
We're arranging papers so it appears
you married him last year in the US.

432
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,120
Wait. Are you saying you already...

433
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,750
...registered me as married? Me?

434
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,790
Yes. You have two problems.

435
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,710
One is you can't identify yourself.

436
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,870
The other is that you ran away
without giving testimony.

437
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,870
You were with Mr Kang on the night
of the rooftop attack.

438
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,670
You should state that you ran away
because you were afraid

439
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,120
your relationship with Mr Kang
would be revealed.

440
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,870
It sounds valid
and guarantees your identity.

441
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,120
Are you really going to register
your marriage with Ms Yeon-joo?

442
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,080
It seems so.

443
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,460
That's the only way to get her out.

444
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,080
I know you have to prove her identity,

445
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,000
but registering her as your wife
is too much.

446
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,960
If you legally become a married couple,

447
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,370
there is no escaping it.

448
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,790
If I can't escape,
I'll just live with her, then.

449
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,540
She's an unidentified woman.

450
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,870
How are you going to deal with
your assets later?

451
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,580
I know her identity,

452
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,120
and assets don't mean anything.

453
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,670
What?

454
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,290
Assets don't mean anything to me now.

455
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,080
That's why I wanted to see you.

456
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,830
I want to stop looking for
the criminal now.

457
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,710
I'm giving up on finding
the true criminal.

458
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,710
I want you to give up as well.

459
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,370
What are you talking about?

460
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,790
It's meaningless now, too.

461
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,790
I don't deserve to continue.

462
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,170
You called me on the phone

463
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,080
after you visited Ms Yeon-joo.

464
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,290
I know you said something to me then.

465
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:45,170
I heard it, but I don't remember
what it was.

466
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,250
You told me that

467
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,580
there are moments that
you don't quite remember.

468
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,790
I understand what you meant.
I experienced it myself.

469
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,420
I was on the phone with you,

470
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,000
but when I came to my senses,

471
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,080
I couldn't remember what you said next.

472
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,830
Then you went missing all day.

473
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,710
Yes.

474
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,830
Did you go to another world?

475
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,790
Yes.

476
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,670
Where is that?

477
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,210
I can't tell you.

478
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,620
-Why not?
-If I tell you,

479
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,790
it would be so hard on you.

480
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,540
It'd be unbearable.

481
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,960
So I can't tell you.

482
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,210
You're making me frustrated.
I came all the way here,

483
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,790
-yet you can't tell me anything?
-No.

484
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,670
I can never tell you.

485
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,710
I can tell you two things.

486
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,210
I know who Oh Yeon-joo is.

487
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,420
Thankfully, she's not a strange lunatic.

488
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,580
There would be no problem
if she's to be my wife.

489
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,170
I'm just worried she won't
stay beside me.

490
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,210
And I no longer need to
find the criminal.

491
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,170
Please don't ask me why.

492
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,210
W Project ends here.

493
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,420
Then just tell me this.

494
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,870
Why did you go to Han River?

495
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,960
Why did you fall?

496
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,580
I wanted to die.

497
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,290
I didn't know how to continue.

498
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,460
I still don't know.

499
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,790
But I feel like living.

500
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:38,250
So I should think more
about what to do from now on.

501
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,250
You're a third generation
Korean-American.

502
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:50,870
You first met Mr Kang, who was
on a business trip, on May 2015

503
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,960
and got married in Chicago
in September, correct?

504
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,490
-Yes.

505
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,410
At the time of arrest,

506
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:04,380
you were living with Mr Kang
in the penthouse of Seoul Prime Hotel.

507
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,460
-Yes.

508
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,620
When we ambushed, you ran away because...

509
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,580
....you two were in the middle of a fight
and were considering divorce.

510
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,870
Mr Kang testified you didn't
want the press to find out

511
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,000
that you two are married.
Is that correct?

512
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,420
Yes.

513
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,080
Wear the ring first.

514
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,870
-Is this a wedding ring?
-Yes.

515
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,420
Many people are watching you,
so wear it from now on.

516
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,540
Let's go.

517
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,870
You better put this on.

518
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,210
Why?

519
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,870
You'll know once we're outside.

520
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,960
She's here.

521
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,790
-Welcome, Mrs Kang.
-Welcome, Mrs Kang.

522
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,170
Mrs Kang?

523
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,420
They've been waiting for you.

524
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,870
Say hello.

525
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,370
They are the security team.
Mr Park, Mr Yoon and Mr Oh.

526
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,370
-You recognise them, right?
-Yes.

527
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,000
And they are the hotel staffs.

528
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,620
-It's nice to meet you, Mrs Kang.
-It's nice to meet you, Mrs Kang.

529
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,670
It's nice to meet you, too.

530
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:54,370
Hey, I know the situation,
but do you seriously want me

531
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,580
to stay here in the same room with Chul?

532
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,580
Yes, you are married.
Of course you should share room.

533
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,750
The staff are watching.

534
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,830
But even so, it's a little...

535
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,080
I've filled the bathtub, Madam.

536
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:12,420
You should wash up and rest.
Mr Kang will come home at night.

537
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,870
I'm married?

538
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,170
Who is President Kang's
Secret Wife, Ms Oh?

539
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Mystery of the Secret Marriage,
A Korean-American?

540
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,170
No way.

541
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,500
Who is President Kang's Woman?

542
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:56,000
President Kang Secretly Married
to a Beautiful Woman

543
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,790
Am I...

544
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:01,960
...really married?

545
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,670
I feel much better after the shower.

546
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,290
Thank you.

547
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,790
Everything is in pair.

548
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:37,830
So it was number four.

549
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,790
Number four is your taste.

550
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,000
A bold and sexy, adult-only romance.

551
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,580
Right?

552
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,870
-When did you come?
-You said it was number three.

553
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,500
Are you sure you like everyday romance?

554
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,120
I don't think so.

555
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:00,080
I was just checking what it is.
I didn't know what it was.

556
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,420
Really?

557
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,120
I'm sure men's underwear exists
in the other world as well.

558
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,960
Just let it slide.

559
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,170
-Should I?
-Let it slide!

560
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,000
We haven't seen each other for days.
Stop teasing me.

561
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,830
-Why are you smiling?
-I'm happy to see you.

562
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,870
Gosh, you haven't even visited me once.

563
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,580
I was too busy.

564
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:29,040
It turns out getting married
unexpectedly is tough.

565
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,500
I had to create a scandal
and match it with my schedule,

566
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,710
and I had to memorise it to testify.

567
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,420
I know. It was too much.

568
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,870
I said I like sweet romance,
not getting married.

569
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,370
We can start doing sweet things now.

570
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,170
I studied hard for it.

571
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,500
-You studied about it?
-Right.

572
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,500
I had something to do here.

573
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,870
Stay right there.

574
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,080
What's wrong with my heart?

575
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,120
What's going on?

576
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,870
-Oh dear!
-Don't come out.

577
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,580
Have a seat.

578
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,420
I've never done this,
so I'm not sure it'll work.

579
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,170
What is it?

580
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,080
It said to tie your hair.

581
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,330
-What?
-I asked the female staff,

582
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,750
and they got me this book.

583
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:43,210
The book lists the sweet, humble
and romantic things women love.

584
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,540
What?

585
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,290
-Stay still.
-Oh, dear.

586
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,830
Stop it.

587
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,790
-You're really doing this?
-Yes.

588
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,080
Comfortable and Lovely

589
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,500
You studied with this book?

590
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,290
I had to study.
I knew nothing.

591
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,620
I was asked to pay back
when I didn't know anything.

592
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,210
Studying is my forte.

593
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,040
-By the way, do you like this?
-What?

594
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,670
Is this sweet?

595
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,790
I love it.

596
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,460
You do? I'm glad.

597
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,120
This is interesting.
How is this sweet?

598
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,750
I can tell you majored in engineering.

599
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,500
What's wrong?

600
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,580
It's your first time doing this, right?

601
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,210
Yes.

602
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,540
I never thought you were like this.
I'd never seen this side of you.

603
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,120
Pick what other things you want to do.

604
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,290
If we try hard, we can finish
10 things a day.

605
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,170
This isn't homework.

606
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:56,870
Shouldn't we do a lot while we can?

607
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,500
We don't know when we will part again.

608
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:15,290
Don't look at me like that.
You might disappear.

609
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,830
Something must be wrong with my heart
that I get swayed easily.

610
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,080
So don't cry or suddenly say you love me

611
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:25,120
if you want to stay with me for a long time.

612
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:33,790
I give up.

613
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,540
It's too difficult.

614
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,250
Let's say I did it once
since I tied the hair.

615
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,540
Okay.

616
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,420
Good job.

617
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,620
What else shall we do?
There's still time until dinner.

618
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,170
You shouldn't read books like that.

619
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,620
Come with me.

620
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,830
What are we going to do?

621
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,040
Goodness.

622
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,420
What are you doing?

623
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,710
Lie down.

624
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:36,870
What?

625
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:39,870
Gosh.

626
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,620
I heard reading is done like this.

627
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,500
Page 172.

628
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,420
Here it is.

629
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,750
Did you memorise the pages?

630
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,170
I told you I studied a lot.

631
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,290
See what else is there.

632
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,210
There's also shopping
for groceries together.

633
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:04,210
Is grocery shopping fun for real women?

634
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:06,210
Of course it's fun

635
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:10,580
when the man carries the basket
and wonder what we'll make.

636
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,790
Then let's go grocery shopping later.

637
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,790
Really?

638
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,580
How about tying your shoelaces?

639
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,290
That sounds great.

640
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,670
How about this?

641
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,420
I'd love that.

642
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,830
How about this?

643
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,960
This one is easy.

644
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,670
Is this homework to pay me back?

645
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,340
If I'm not?

646
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,000
I think you're enjoying it more.

647
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,380
No way.

648
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,050
President Kang.

649
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,090
Don't you know how to knock?

650
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:26,090
I'm sorry. I'm not yet used
to the fact that you're married.

651
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,880
What is it?

652
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,590
Mr Seo would like to see you
at the rooftop garden.

653
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,250
-Why didn't he come in?
-I don't know, sir.

654
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,300
All right.

655
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,460
Mark the ones you want to do today.

656
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,710
I keep telling you,
but I like adult-only things.

657
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,340
My heart hurts.

658
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,670
Caller ID Restricted

659
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,880
Hello?

660
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:39,840
Hello

661
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,750
Where are you?

662
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,630
How did you come back to life?

663
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,760
President Kang, is everything all right?

664
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,300
Yes, it's fine.

665
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,880
Why did you press the emergency button?

666
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,880
I pressed it by mistake.

667
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:08,380
Okay, sir.

668
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:24,800
-Do-yoon.
-Chul.

669
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:26,500
I need you to trace a caller ID.

670
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,630
-Which number?
-A call I received five minutes ago.

671
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,300
Find the caller ID.
Something seems odd.

672
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:33,750
Okay.

673
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,210
Why didn't you come into the room?

674
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,000
I couldn't say it
in Ms Yeon-joo's presence.

675
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,710
What's going on?

676
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,090
Resignation letter
So-hee turned in her resignation.

677
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,750
I saw her earlier today.
She told me to give it to you.

678
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,170
I understand how you feel,

679
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,420
but you should talk to Chul in person.

680
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,750
I don't want to.

681
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,340
I can't do it.

682
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,300
I don't want to see him.

683
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,710
Could you give it to him instead?

684
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,210
It's a fake marriage.
You know that.

685
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,050
Do you really think so?

686
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,920
I don't think it is.

687
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,170
Even if it isn't,

688
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,340
leave personal feelings out of work.

689
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,300
I guess I'm not professional.

690
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,500
I can't continue being
his personal assistant

691
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,090
and see that woman.

692
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,880
Tell her to take a few days off.

693
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,500
I'll go see her.

694
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,050
Okay.

695
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:58,500
By the way...

696
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,250
Seriously.

697
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,800
Just listen.

698
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:05,750
It's very strange.

699
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:11,960
I'm sorry.

700
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,590
Thank you for everything.

701
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,710
You'll be back anyway.

702
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,000
I don't think so.

703
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,960
Let's shake hands.

704
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:39,710
What...

705
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,590
What's wrong?

706
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:49,420
-Her hand disappeared?
-Like a ghost.

707
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,500
It suddenly went translucent
like a ghost.

708
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,300
It doesn't make sense,

709
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,500
but I definitely saw it.

710
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,090
Gosh.

711
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,420
Have I lost my mind?

712
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,630
President Kang, what about dinner?

713
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,250
Please prepare it. We'll eat.

714
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,710
Your wife has fallen asleep.

715
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,050
-She's asleep?
-Yes.

716
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,420
She must have been tired.

717
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,960
I'll eat with her once she wakes up.

718
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,420
You'll be hungry.

719
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,340
-It's all right.
-Okay, sir.

720
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,500
Comfortable and Lovely

721
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,300
She marked so many.

722
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,090
Caller ID Restricted

723
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,960
Hello?

724
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,420
Where are you?

725
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,300
How did you go back?

726
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,500
How did you go back?

727
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,750
You can't die on your own.

728
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,090
Do you know how long I've waited?

729
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,210
Who are you?

730
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,590
Who am I?

731
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,170
Don't you know me?

732
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,920
I killed your family

733
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,090
at your house 10 years ago.

734
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,590
It never existed.

735
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,380
There is no true criminal.

736
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,750
It was just a set-up from the start.

737
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:10,210
It was a set-up to make
the main character stronger.

738
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,050
Who...

739
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,630
...are you?

740
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,880
I said I killed everyone in your family.

741
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,500
Just four shots.

742
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,090
I shot them straight in the forehead.

743
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,840
I'm a great shooter just like you.

744
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,300
That's why you should find me.

745
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:35,500
Why would you die before finding me?
You can't die now.

746
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:40,800
This won't end
until you and I finish our business.

747
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:45,000
I see you have a new family now.

748
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,960
It's her turn now.

749
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,840
I'll shoot a hole in her forehead.

750
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,210
I'll shoot a hole in her forehead.

751
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,670
Wait for it.

752
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,340
Hello? Hello

753
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,090
True criminal, an unidentified man
who killed Chul's family

754
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,620
W-Two Worlds

755
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,800
I won't die.
I'm immortal in this world.

756
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
There is no principle without variables.

757
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:04,590
It's not normal for you to bleed.

758
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,750
It means you'll die if you get shot.

759
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:08,840
Does the true criminal know me?

760
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,250
The criminal is in the real world.

761
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,170
Promise me one thing.

762
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,000
If you go back to your world,
draw a scene where I dream.

763
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,880
Draw a scene where I wake up
from a dream, okay?

764
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,090
Yeon-joo, forget about me for now.

765
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,380
Character set-up,
reasons of existence.

766
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,920
Everything will be solved if
we go back to the time we haven't met.
