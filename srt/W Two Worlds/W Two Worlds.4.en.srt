1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,530
W – Two Worlds

2
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,590
With total sales hitting
10 million copies,

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,010
"W" is Korea's best webtoon series.

4
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,300
Kang Chul is the main character.

5
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,720
The artist of the best-selling "W",
Oh Seong-moo...

6
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,430
is terrified by Kang Chul
who has come to life,

7
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,050
and tries to kill Kang Chul.

8
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,510
Groaning

9
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,800
Oh Seong-moo's daughter, Oh Yeon-joo
gets dragged into the webtoon world...

10
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,010
and saves Kang Chul's life.

11
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,180
You saw him, right?

12
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,590
You saw Kang Chul, too.

13
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,880
She realises that Kang Chul is not
just a cartoon character.

14
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,220
-Please let me in.
-No, you are not allowed.

15
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,630
Oh, no. Please.

16
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,130
She tries to stop her father.

17
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,550
Are you okay?

18
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,010
Yeon-joo appears in front of him
when he is in danger...

19
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,090
and disappears after saving him,

20
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,720
bringing Kang Chul closer to the truth.

21
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,300
I can do it if I want to.

22
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,010
No way.

23
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,300
Finally, she's in my arms.
She's the key to my life.

24
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,220
By the way, is she really pretty?

25
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,840
Why does everyone say she's beautiful?

26
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,010
As time passes,
his feelings for Yeon-joo change.

27
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,220
Are you married?

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
No.

29
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,340
That's good.

30
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,550
Episode 4

31
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,010
He's not there?

32
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,930
Hey, are you really sure about that?

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,970
All right. Pull everyone out.

34
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,630
They haven't done much work.

35
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,430
Okay.

36
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,880
Son Hyeon-seok, Director of
crime investigation programme

37
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,090
You didn't have to come here.
Everyone hates to see you.

38
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,590
Why?

39
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,590
They're ashamed.

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,180
Their employer has been attacked,
and they haven't found any clues.

41
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,630
Of course they're ashamed.

42
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,720
They're all getting ready to resign.
Myself included.

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,760
Gosh.

44
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,930
You're only saying that
to stop me from nagging.

45
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,470
I mean it.

46
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,550
We lost the lead once again.
There's no trace at all.

47
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,970
I got video footage of the truck
entering here, but not when it left.

48
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,380
It's driving us nuts.

49
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,130
Is that right?

50
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,880
By the way,
what happened to Oh Yeon-joo?

51
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,340
So-hee said something, did she?

52
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,180
The case is not advancing
because you lost that woman.

53
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,340
You know that all of us
are desperately looking for her.

54
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,880
Why would you hide her?

55
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,880
She can't disclose her identity,
so I'm protecting her.

56
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,050
And why can't she reveal her identity?

57
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,840
Why do you want to protect that girl?

58
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,930
How are you two related?

59
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,840
-What?
-I saw the video taken at the store.

60
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,300
There's definitely something going on.

61
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,180
You saw that?

62
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,970
Gosh, seriously.

63
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,590
I think Ms Yoon is upset.

64
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,380
She must be.

65
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,630
I was wondering when
you two would get married.

66
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,180
There's no girl like her.

67
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,300
Well, I'm old-fashioned,
so what do I know?

68
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,130
You two figure it out.

69
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,800
Anyway, I need you to explain to me.

70
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,880
You shouldn't keep anything from me.

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,550
That's precisely why I am here.
I have something to tell you.

72
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,630
About that nurse...

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,180
-Why did you switch the medicine?
-...who injected me wrong medicine.

74
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,720
I really don't remember anything.

75
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,680
I really have no idea. I don't know
why I switched the medicine.

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
If you don't know, why did you run?

77
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,680
I don't know why I tried to run away.

78
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,840
It's just that, after a while,

79
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,050
I realised something wasn't right.

80
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,930
That woman is still insisting
she doesn't know anything.

81
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,050
It's actually very strange.

82
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,840
She has no motive to kill you.

83
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,340
She's just an earnest nurse.

84
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,180
Why would she suddenly kill you?

85
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,880
It just doesn't make any sense.

86
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,680
I'm stuck.

87
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,470
You have to be stuck.
There's no context.

88
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,510
-Context?
-Yes, context.

89
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,340
Things without context like this
keep happening to me.

90
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,720
I suddenly got stabbed
with a knife for no reason...

91
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,840
and was saved by a strange girl
who suddenly appeared.

92
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,970
I almost got hit by a truck
and almost died.

93
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,340
And that truck just
inexplicably disappeared here.

94
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,220
I told you, right?

95
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,260
It was like this, too,
on the day I got stabbed.

96
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,340
I remember a guy calling me and
claiming to know the real murderer.

97
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,880
But I don't remember who it was
and why I trusted that.

98
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,840
Don't follow me.

99
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,010
I don't know why I ditched my guards
before a dangerous encounter.

100
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,630
That's why I was helplessly attacked.

101
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,970
That day, I acted foolishly as if
I was determined to die.

102
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,180
What's strange is that
I don't remember why I did it.

103
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,010
It's the same for that nurse, too.

104
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,550
The nurse doesn't know
why she tried to kill me.

105
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,760
Same with that truck.

106
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,260
It came out of nowhere.

107
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,930
There was no license plate either.

108
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,800
I looked at the driver,
and he wasn't even trying to stop.

109
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,510
He almost hit a person,
but he didn't even bother to stop.

110
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,630
Then he disappeared like smoke here.

111
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,380
Everything that's been happening
to me these days is like that.

112
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,180
There should be motive and suspect
to every crime, but it's missing.

113
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,970
Just like what happened 10 years ago.

114
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,970
I've been desperately trying
to find the answer to this.

115
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,760
We've been through so much.

116
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,090
I even bought the broadcasting station.

117
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,590
We came up with the TV show
in order to legalise it,

118
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,800
when in fact,
it's an investigation headquarters.

119
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,680
I've invested billions in it.

120
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,340
But what did we get out of it?

121
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,050
Of course, other cases were
solved in the meantime.

122
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,010
We helped arrest 99 percent
of the suspects.

123
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,970
Thanks to that,
I get treated like a hero.

124
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,130
However,

125
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,680
I still have no clue about that guy.

126
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,680
We don't know his motive.
He's not likely a psychopath.

127
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,300
We got neither a strand of his hair
nor a witness in the past 10 years.

128
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,760
So?

129
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,380
These days, I even started
thinking weird thoughts.

130
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,630
Perhaps the person
we're desperately looking for...

131
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,970
...is in another dimension.

132
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,680
That may explain why I can't find him...

133
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,180
even though I try so hard.

134
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,470
What are you talking about?

135
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Are you saying the suspect is
an alien or something?

136
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,050
He could be an alien.

137
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,510
What?

138
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,880
But not the alien we imagine.

139
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,550
They look like us
and behave just like us.

140
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,760
Like Yeon-joo for example.

141
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,970
She knows everything about me.

142
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,470
It's as if she's been looking
over my life from above.

143
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,800
That was the saddest scene.

144
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,430
The Han River Bridge.

145
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,430
I...

146
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,630
...cried as well at the time.

147
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,840
I was afraid...

148
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,300
...Chul would really kill himself.

149
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,470
She even knows my feelings
and thoughts that I never told anyone.

150
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,970
-How does she know it?
-I don't know.

151
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,470
Thankfully, she genuinely wishes me well.

152
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,630
-She tries to save my life.
-Why?

153
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,180
I'm not sure.

154
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,760
It seems like there's also someone
who harbours hostility against me.

155
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,760
That person manipulated
those incoherent events...

156
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,590
and is dying to kill me.

157
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,260
Who would that be?

158
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,840
I don't know.

159
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,300
But I realised one certain fact.

160
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,760
That person did all this.

161
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,800
-Did I surprise you?
-Of course.

162
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,430
You'll think differently if you see
a girl survive a gunshot to her chest.

163
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,430
I'm sure that Yeon-joo is
the key to my life.

164
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,840
She's the only one who can
open the door to all the secrets.

165
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,470
What's all this?

166
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,180
They're things you'll need including
clothes, shoes and cosmetics.

167
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,130
Are you saying they're all for me?

168
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,550
Goodness. I can't wear them all.

169
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,590
Mr Kang ordered us to
prepare enough items.

170
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,800
If you have your own preference,
please let us know.

171
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,930
That dress he bought me was
over 3,000 dollars.

172
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,930
How much would all those be?
50,000 dollars?

173
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,380
Or is it millions of dollars?

174
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,430
Oh, dear. What is it?

175
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,180
I just wanted to give you a hand.

176
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,550
It's okay. I can do it by myself.

177
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,380
You can wait outside.

178
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,590
I was told to serve you from now on.

179
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,800
Did you say serve?

180
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,260
You will serve me?

181
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,590
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,930
You don't really have to.

183
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,590
-May I help you with that?
-It's fine.

184
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,380
-Here, let me.
-I can do it. It's okay.

185
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,720
You don't have to do my makeup.

186
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,300
I'll be done soon.

187
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,470
It's okay. It's a bit uncomfortable.
I'll do it myself.

188
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,090
Mr Kang likes the feminine style.

189
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,340
What do you mean by that?

190
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,130
Why do I have to dress up
according to his personal taste?

191
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,340
I thought you were his fiancee.

192
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,630
-Excuse me?
-I heard you are his fiancee.

193
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,720
-Me?
-Yes.

194
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,720
I see.

195
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,430
Why is the story going this way?

196
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,380
"W" is a heroic action webtoon.

197
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,840
Gosh. Why is it becoming
like a romantic drama?

198
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,050
This is making my heart flutter.

199
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,590
Mr Kang is calling.

200
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,340
Okay.

201
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,380
Hello?

202
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,880
What are you doing?

203
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,340
Even hearing his voice
makes my heart pound.

204
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,970
Are you doing okay?

205
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,430
I'm calling because I'll be out of reach
until tomorrow.

206
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,010
Are you comfortable there?

207
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,260
When did I become your fiancee?

208
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,630
Right.

209
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,760
The staff might find it strange.

210
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,880
I can't exactly say I'm locking you up.

211
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,510
Are you offended by it?

212
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,720
Not exactly.

213
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,340
Are you afraid
your boyfriend might find out?

214
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,130
I don't have a boyfriend.

215
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,470
You don't? Why not?

216
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,010
Do I have to have a boyfriend?

217
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,300
No. But you're an attractive woman.
I don't get why you're single.

218
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,720
Are you teasing me?

219
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,510
You said if I'm beautiful,
everyone else would be beautiful.

220
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,130
You may not be beautiful,
but you are charming.

221
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,930
How should I say it?
You're charming in an idiotic way.

222
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,590
Hello?

223
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,380
Are you upset? I was just joking.

224
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,300
I'm not upset.

225
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,970
I really am an idiot
whose heart flutters even by that.

226
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,380
Don't laugh and sound too happy.
Remember you locked me up.

227
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,180
If you want to go home,
feel free to call me.

228
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,970
You know that, right?

229
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,380
Good night.

230
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,760
I love you.

231
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,800
You know that doesn't work on me.

232
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,970
I know. I just took a shot
since you told me I was charming.

233
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,470
It didn't work again.

234
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,090
Good night.

235
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,840
I'm an idiot.

236
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,590
If I hear it one more time,
I might get swayed.

237
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,550
Hear what?

238
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,470
So this is how a penthouse looks.

239
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,050
Wow, it's great.

240
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,550
Three days have passed.

241
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,050
How much time has passed in
the real world? 5 minutes? 30 minutes?

242
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,470
What do I do?
I'm getting used to the life here.

243
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,680
How can I go back?

244
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,430
My gosh.

245
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,930
You're here.

246
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
Yes.

247
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,930
What are you doing?

248
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,010
I couldn't sleep,
so I was just looking around.

249
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,340
How are you feeling?

250
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,050
I'm fine.

251
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,380
Would you like to have
a glass of wine with me, then?

252
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,090
Wine?

253
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,550
Yes. You seem bored.

254
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,260
I am a little bored.

255
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,430
Let's go.

256
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,510
Where are you going?

257
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,840
Upstairs.

258
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,300
President Kang said...

259
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,970
We're just going upstairs
for a glass of wine.

260
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,340
You can come with us.

261
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,720
I assume you have a family.

262
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,760
-I do.
-They must be worried about you.

263
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,510
Chul is so selfish to lock you up here.

264
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,880
My family probably hasn't noticed
that I'm gone.

265
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,130
But it's been two days.

266
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,050
They don't really care about me.

267
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,970
I see.

268
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
I forgot to make a video call.

269
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,260
Please go ahead.
It'll just take five minutes.

270
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,380
Please show her the way.

271
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,800
Excuse me?

272
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,970
This way, please.

273
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,470
Thank you.

274
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,380
Yes.

275
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,590
She's seated.

276
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,630
Pardon?

277
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,510
It's pretty.

278
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,590
I guess it's not all that bad.

279
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,630
I normally wouldn't come to
a place like this.

280
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,630
-For two people?
-Yes.

281
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,970
Wait...

282
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,300
Aren't you that person?

283
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,550
You're the doctor on the rooftop
when President Kang got stabbed.

284
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,930
What building is this?

285
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,470
This is a hotel.
Seoul Plaza Hotel.

286
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,760
It's you, isn't it?

287
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,130
Everyone looked all over for you
after you disappeared.

288
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,840
The police are looking for you, too.
Didn't you know?

289
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,010
You're even on the news.

290
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,470
Why didn't you come back sooner?

291
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,300
Well, that's...

292
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,130
I didn't know it was this hotel.
So it was the rooftop of this hotel.

293
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,550
Excuse me for a moment.

294
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,800
Oh, no. What should I do?

295
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,510
She's here!

296
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,970
The lady who gave President Kang first
aid when he got stabbed is here.

297
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,090
What?

298
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,180
Gosh.

299
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,340
Who is she?

300
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,340
Oh Yeon-joo

301
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,630
So? What will you confess this time?

302
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,680
What do I do?
The police might catch me.

303
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,220
The police? Why?

304
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,630
Ms Yoon...

305
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,970
Excuse me. Hold on a second.

306
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,680
We must find her right away.
She's nearby.

307
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,510
-Someone passed by here.
-Over there.

308
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,930
Where should I go?

309
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,880
I can't have the police get me.

310
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,050
-Me neither. Where are you?
-I'm going down the stairs.

311
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,260
-She's over here.
-Goodness.

312
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,880
Stay calm. Hide somewhere to buy time
until I figure out the situation.

313
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,380
I'm on the 28th floor.

314
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,300
I'll call you again.

315
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,180
What's going on?

316
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,090
I told you to protect her.

317
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,840
Ms Yoon said it was your order.

318
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,800
Go to the 28th floor.
She'll be hiding somewhere.

319
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,430
-Help her.
-Yes, sir.

320
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,970
There she is!

321
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,340
-Hurry up and get her.
-Gosh.

322
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,340
Check the surveillance camera.

323
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,180
Ms Oh!

324
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,090
I'll use Room 2816.

325
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,180
Hey, stop there!

326
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,840
Come with us.

327
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,260
Where are you?

328
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,550
It's me, sir. I'm sorry.

329
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,010
She got caught.

330
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,220
Why do you have her mobile phone?

331
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,720
She secretly threw it to me
before she got caught.

332
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,970
I don't think she'll say anything about
what happened in the penthouse.

333
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,930
What's going on?

334
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,550
-So-hee made trouble.
-What?

335
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,800
-Where's Yeon-joo?
-She was caught by the police.

336
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,090
I heard it wasn't President Kang's order.

337
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

338
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,380
Hello?

339
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,760
Hello, Detective Park.

340
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,470
Oh Yeon-joo has been caught?

341
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,970
Where?

342
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,010
She was in the hotel?

343
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,340
Here's the first news.

344
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:02,050
The only witness in President Kang of
JN Global's attack has been identified.

345
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,510
There are many assumptions and rumours
regarding the case...

346
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,050
that has remained unsolved for months.

347
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,930
-We'll have to wait...
-She's finally caught.

348
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,470
...if we can finally find some clues.

349
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,300
Ms Oh, who pretended to be a doctor,

350
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,260
was initially known and considered
as the only witness.

351
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,340
However, as time passes,
it seems likely that...

352
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,300
-she's a suspect.
-Tell us the truth!

353
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,220
-Please tell us about the case.
-Ms Oh!

354
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,050
What's your name?

355
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,130
-Oh Yeon-joo.
-That's not your name.

356
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,880
What's wrong with you?

357
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,050
What's your real name?

358
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,010
Oh Yeon-joo.

359
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,050
What's your social security number?

360
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,050
Social security number!

361
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,930
-I don't know.
-What's your home address?

362
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,010
I don't have one.

363
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,840
You know Kang Chul, right?

364
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,680
He's more powerful than the police.

365
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,930
No one can do anything to him
because of the press.

366
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,680
And people hail him as their hero.

367
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,880
The hero was stabbed by a knife,

368
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,130
but we couldn't find any clue
for over two months.

369
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:13,300
Do you know how bad it's been?
Let's make things easier.

370
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,970
Please, Miss.

371
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,880
What's your social security number?

372
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,380
I just can't understand.

373
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,470
Here you go.

374
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,090
There's nothing.

375
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,930
She doesn't answer anything.
And we can't identify her fingerprint.

376
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,300
She must be an illegal immigrant.

377
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,010
I sought help from the Chinese police,
but something's weird.

378
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,760
I can feel it.
Something's off.

379
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,550
You can tell just by looking at it.

380
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,880
No, this isn't it.

381
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,010
Ms Yeon-joo.

382
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:29,380
I'm sorry, but from my perspective,
this was for the best.

383
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,800
I was worried about President Kang
looking down on the police.

384
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,430
And we can't keep you locked in forever.

385
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,840
It doesn't make sense...

386
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,510
for him to be living with a suspect.

387
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,300
He doesn't even know who you are.

388
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,880
Cooperate with the police in
the investigation and we'll help you.

389
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,050
But for now, we can't help you.

390
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,260
How can a victim help a suspect?
You should prove your innocence first.

391
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,430
Reveal your identity.

392
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,760
Tell them everything you witnessed.

393
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,840
After that, we'll provide you
with everything including a lawyer.

394
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,260
I have no identity to reveal.

395
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,010
Everyone has an identity.

396
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,760
I don't. I really don't have one.

397
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,300
Someone must have told you
how they switched the injection.

398
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,970
Why would you appear
without knowing anything otherwise?

399
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,550
It doesn't make sense.

400
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,510
Why do you carry a fake business card?

401
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,720
There must be a reason why
you carry it with fake information.

402
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,260
What's the reason?

403
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,970
Someone must be behind all this.

404
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,180
Who's really behind this case?

405
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,930
Aren't you going to tell me?

406
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,510
You can't stay quiet forever.

407
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,090
What are you going to do?

408
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,180
Answer me!

409
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,930
Did Oh Yeon-joo admit
being the culprit?

410
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,840
-How do you feel?
-What was the reason?

411
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,130
-What was your reason?
-What happened?

412
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,180
Tell us the truth!

413
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:32,590
After investigating, police concluded
that she's likely instigated a murder.

414
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,380
Suspect is taken into custody
for further questioning...

415
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,630
and to prevent her from running away
and destroying evidence.

416
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,880
Ms Oh was admitted to
Seoul Detention Centre today.

417
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:44,260
The victim, President Kang got the news
while on his business trip to the US.

418
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,720
New inmate coming in.

419
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,090
President Kang, did you hear the news?

420
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,010
The police believe she's the culprit.
Do you remember the situation then?

421
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,430
I don't remember it at all.

422
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,630
Do you think the woman is the culprit?

423
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,470
Definitely not.

424
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,380
I'm not someone who'd
be knocked down by a woman.

425
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,340
There are rumours of
your prior relationship with Ms Oh.

426
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,380
What do you think about that?

427
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,470
I don't believe in such rumours.

428
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,470
Don't believe it.

429
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,260
-Excuse us.
-Excuse us.

430
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,630
-Could you say more?
-President Kang.

431
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
-President Kang.
-Could you say a little more?

432
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,630
-Is it true?
-Do you not remember?

433
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,930
-Could you say more?
-President Kang.

434
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,970
-Please say a little more.
-Please, President Kang.

435
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,970
I'm sorry.

436
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,800
Let's stop by the police station first.

437
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,800
Ms Oh was imprisoned this afternoon.

438
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,550
-Where?
-Seoul Detention Centre.

439
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,220
You're all very quick
when making a mistake.

440
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,760
So-hee just texted me
saying you don't answer the phone.

441
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,010
Here's the information we prepared.
Please review it.

442
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,340
Okay.

443
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,130
-Hello, where's Chul?
-It's me.

444
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,970
President Kang, did you arrive?

445
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,800
Everyone is waiting for you.

446
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,050
I'm going to the prison first.
Send them off.

447
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,260
Excuse me for a second.

448
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,220
Even the lawyers don't know
what to do about it.

449
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,930
We have nothing to defend her with
even if she gets arrested.

450
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,510
She's not saying anything.

451
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,090
That's why I protected her.
She can't say anything.

452
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,130
Yet you cornered her into
a deadly situation.

453
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,340
That's not my fault.

454
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,550
Why wouldn't you reveal your identity
if you are innocent?

455
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,380
She's not saying anything and
her mouth is shut tight.

456
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,630
Isn't it obvious now?

457
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,800
Oh Yeon-joo is not a witness.
She's the suspect.

458
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,800
For whatever reason,
she pretended to save you...

459
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,430
and approached you again.

460
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,720
You're completely fooled
by her illogical claim.

461
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,680
The person whose life
almost got ruined is me.

462
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,130
Did you forget?

463
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,090
That's exactly what they did to me.

464
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,930
They said it was not logical at all.

465
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,180
They asked why I went to school
instead of watching football.

466
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,090
I couldn't answer because
I really didn't know anything.

467
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,380
That's how the victim
suddenly turned into the suspect.

468
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,130
That will probably
happen to Yeon-joo, too.

469
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,590
You can't understand it logically.

470
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,760
Everyone looks at the appearance
instead of looking at the context.

471
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,840
And they believe it as a fact.

472
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,340
You say you acted sensibly.

473
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,550
But in fact, you didn't understand
Yeon-joo's context at all.

474
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,680
She didn't want to harm me,

475
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,050
so she threw my mobile phone
right before getting caught.

476
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,720
Her identity is not important.

477
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,260
If you understand the essence of
her action, you wouldn't doubt her.

478
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,300
I started my business to help people
sacrificed by common knowledge.

479
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,380
And yet you created another victim.

480
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,720
So you can't be my personal assistant.

481
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,260
You should just remain as my friend.

482
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,550
You're fired.

483
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,590
It's hot.

484
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,180
Inmate 4205.

485
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,720
Inmate 4205.

486
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,930
Yes?

487
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,970
I am sorry I'm too late.

488
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,760
It took me two days to come back.

489
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,760
How is it in there?

490
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,340
It's hot.

491
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,720
I see.

492
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,300
It's hot, isn't it?

493
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,510
I stayed here for a long time, so I know.

494
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,470
I spent four seasons here,
and it's unbelievably hot during summer.

495
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,590
Is it tough?

496
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,680
No.

497
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,720
Yes.

498
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,010
I just can't believe this.

499
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,630
I can't get used to it.

500
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,930
This only happens in movies.

501
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,760
I never imagined I'd end up here.

502
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,800
I'm just a normal citizen.

503
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,470
Normal citizens come here, too.

504
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,970
Not many people know they'd come here.

505
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,260
It happens unexpectedly.

506
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:43,220
When you wake up, you find yourself
sitting inside a prison cell.

507
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,180
Listen carefully.

508
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,220
The current situation is hopeless.

509
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,970
I have no reason to help you,
and the problem will only get bigger.

510
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,930
Murder attempt, murder instigation,
illegal stay and your instigator.

511
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,550
You'll be investigated over and over
for various reasons.

512
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,220
There will be continuous
investigations and trials.

513
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,300
It's never-ending.

514
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,260
That's how your life gets ruined.

515
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,340
They already decided that
you are the suspect.

516
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,760
They are exhausted
from the last two months.

517
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,720
So you have to be the suspect.

518
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,260
They'll do anything to make that happen.

519
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,550
They'll humiliate you, scare you
and destroy your mind.

520
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,760
It may be for several weeks
or even months. Nobody knows.

521
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,130
After going through all that,

522
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,010
you won't be able to live
as an ordinary person.

523
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,550
So answer my question.

524
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,680
I believe you've only told me the truth.

525
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,760
So there's only one way
to avoid what will happen.

526
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,430
Give answers to the questions I ask...

527
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,430
and disappear from here.

528
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,550
Where are you from, Yeon-joo?

529
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,510
If I disappear from here,

530
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,510
all hell will break loose.

531
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,260
It probably will.

532
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,800
But it's nothing you should
be worried about.

533
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,300
You just have to disappear
and go back to your home.

534
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,680
I will take care of the rest.

535
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,800
This is my world after all.

536
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,340
Answer me.

537
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,180
I can't.

538
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,180
I told you that you're going
to be unfortunate if I do.

539
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,180
I don't think...

540
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,380
I'm too happy now anyway.

541
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,010
I don't know when I'll die,
so I can't even sleep well.

542
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,010
You know that.

543
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,630
Is it okay for you to be locked up
here for the rest of your life?

544
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,880
For 10 to 20 years?

545
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,930
No.

546
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,970
Answer me. We don't have much time.

547
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,760
I don't know what will happen if I do.

548
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,260
Things already happened.

549
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,090
Look where we are.

550
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,220
Where do you live, Yeon-joo?

551
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,260
Seoul.

552
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,380
We're both in Seoul.

553
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,220
So what's different?

554
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,880
That's where I live,

555
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,590
and this is where you live.

556
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,970
Then how do you know all about me?

557
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,590
I'm not there.

558
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,760
You said you saw everything about me.

559
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,430
Where did you see about me?

560
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,970
A nude show would be better.

561
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,970
I told you I wouldn't get swayed by that.

562
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,930
Answer me.

563
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,590
-You will regret it.
-I won't regret it.

564
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,260
What do you mean by...

565
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,340
...the world I live in?

566
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,590
The world inside a webtoon.

567
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,130
What?

568
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,930
Do you mean you came out of a cartoon?

569
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:48,970
No.

570
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,630
Then?

571
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,630
This world is.

572
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,260
What do you mean?

573
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,430
This is a world inside a cartoon.

574
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,090
This is...

575
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,510
...a webtoon I read.

576
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,970
And you are...

577
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,760
...the main character of that webtoon.

578
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,630
To be continued

579
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,430
Myungsei University
Medical Centre Station

580
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,130
What? Where did she go?

581
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,220
Yeon-joo!

582
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,550
Yeon-joo! Gosh.

583
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,300
Goodness.

584
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,340
Yeon-joo...

585
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,340
No way! Were you really in jail?

586
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,510
Really?

587
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,760
Come on. You must be lying.

588
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,010
It can't be true.
It can't be true.

589
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,720
No, it can't be true. It can't be.

590
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,220
I must be crazy. Gosh.

591
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,840
Yeon-joo, here's something
you can change into.

592
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,550
It's only been 30 minutes.

593
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,840
You disappeared
as I was talking to you on the phone.

594
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,010
I went to the bus stop,

595
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,550
and got your wallet and bag from a woman.

596
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,550
-You only found these?
-Yes.

597
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,840
There must be something like a key.
She can't just go in.

598
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,680
There must be something.

599
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,630
I parked my car for a while
and Seon-mi called me.

600
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,340
-Hello?
-Soo-bong, did you see?

601
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,180
-See what?
-Mr Oh uploaded a new episode.

602
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,220
He did? Just now?

603
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,630
Yes. But the story looks
very strange.

604
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,260
It's too strange.

605
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,300
I think Mr Oh has lost his mind.

606
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,510
-Why? Did Chul die?
-It's not that.

607
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,800
You have to see it yourself.
It's very strange.

608
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,630
-It doesn't make any sense.
-All right.

609
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,220
All right. Bye.

610
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,470
My goodness.

611
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,380
"W" by Oh Seong-moo

612
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,090
Where are you, Yeon-joo?

613
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,760
What is this now?

614
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,050
Darn it!

615
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,470
Does she think she can do whatever
she wants since it's a cartoon?

616
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,510
You kissed me so you could disappear.
Yes.

617
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,470
Look at her. They're kissing again.

618
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,800
It's like her dream came true.
She must be so excited.

619
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,970
Maybe I shouldn't worry too much.

620
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,630
She's not an ordinary woman.

621
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,180
Let's see.

622
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,720
The police concluded
that she's likely instigated a murder.

623
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,840
What?

624
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,800
Is she...
What is this?

625
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,090
The police concluded
that she's likely instigated a murder.

626
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,050
Oh no, Yeon-joo.

627
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,590
Yeon-joo!

628
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,380
Yeon-joo!

629
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,380
Yeon-joo!

630
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,380
All that happened within 30 minutes.

631
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:36,260
You disappeared at 10 a.m.
and came back around 10:30 a.m.

632
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,720
In the webtoon,

633
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,680
you spent three days in the penthouse,
three days in the police station...

634
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,220
and one day in jail.

635
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,260
That means you spent a week there.

636
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,510
It doesn't make sense.

637
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:52,180
Soo-bong, I'm tired to death.
The detectives didn't let me sleep.

638
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,840
I remember each and every day.

639
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:00,090
I'm so tired.
I must have spent a week there.

640
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,340
How...

641
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,220
How is that possible?

642
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,680
Prison is no place for a person to stay.

643
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,010
-I couldn't bear a day, so...
-So?

644
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,590
Is that why you told Chul everything?
To get out of there?

645
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,550
What have I done?

646
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,840
What should I do now?

647
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,800
-I don't know that.
-What do I do?

648
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,260
I don't know.

649
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,720
It'll probably be okay.

650
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:33,010
Seoul Detention Centre

651
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,340
Open Corrections, Hopeful Future

652
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,220
There has been an escape attempt.
We'll shut down the exit for a while.

653
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,840
Hey, what on earth are you talking about?

654
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,380
She vanished right in front of me.

655
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,180
She just disappeared.

656
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,970
-What are you saying?
-It's true.

657
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,470
She vanished like smoke...

658
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,380
while she was talking over there.

659
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,130
My goodness.
What are you going to do now?

660
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,340
You better take responsibility.

661
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,880
Gosh.

662
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,840
What happened?

663
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:17,930
How did she escape?

664
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,930
-Hello?
-We have a situation.

665
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,300
What situation?

666
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,090
-Ms Yeon-joo...
-Don't talk about her to me.

667
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,880
I got fired because of her.

668
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,430
I'm not his personal assistant anymore.

669
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,380
What?

670
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,510
Why do you carry a fake business card?

671
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,380
Sir!

672
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:10,090
Oh Yeon-joo has escaped.

673
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,300
-What are you talking about?
-She escaped a little while ago.

674
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,090
Reporter Park called and told me.

675
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,340
She escaped during
President Kang's visit.

676
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,180
-How could she possibly escape?
-I don't know the details.

677
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,970
They're going to air it on the news.

678
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,130
We have breaking news.

679
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,130
President of JN Global,
Kang Chul was attacked last May.

680
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,800
The only suspect in the incident...

681
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,720
has escaped from
Seoul Detention Centre around 2 PM

682
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,800
What is this? Did she escape?

683
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,380
President Kang wouldn't have
helped her, right?

684
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,340
That'll be a big problem.

685
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:48,180
Details of the incident
hasn't been identified,

686
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,680
but it appears that Ms Oh escaped
from the visiting room,

687
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,380
where the victim, President Kang was
visiting her after his return abroad.

688
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:01,880
The police are blocking the road and
searching around the detention centre.

689
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,300
-Ms Oh was wearing...
-How is that possible?

690
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,840
How can a woman
escape from prison by herself?

691
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,840
They said Chul was visiting her.

692
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,260
Pardon?

693
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,800
Don't you understand what it means?

694
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:20,380
It means I finally have an opportunity
to round up that Chul punk.

695
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,380
That psychopathic murderer.

696
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,300
Dad!

697
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:34,630
He hasn't come back yet.

698
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:38,680
He must be knocked out drunk somewhere.

699
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,220
I've seen it many times.

700
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:44,970
Yeon-joo.

701
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,380
Let's just end it.

702
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,630
-What?
-Let's write...

703
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,590
"The end" at the end of the episode
and put it up again.

704
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,180
It will be the end of "W."

705
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,760
That way, you won't
get dragged inside again.

706
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,630
You're a fugitive over there.

707
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,970
If you go back in,
you'll get shot by the police...

708
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,050
or spend your life in jail
until you're an old lady.

709
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,590
What are you going to do then?

710
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,260
If we end it,

711
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,470
what happens to Chul?

712
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,220
What will happen to him?

713
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,380
You should worry about yourself,
not Chul.

714
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,050
How can you worry
about a cartoon character...

715
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,470
when we might end up in an asylum?

716
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,970
Anyhow, the editor will
make a fuss about this.

717
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,180
Let's pretend
Mr Oh changed it and sent it.

718
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,340
I don't think I can explain it to them.

719
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,590
We'll end it and Mr Oh will...

720
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,590
take care of the rest.

721
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,970
This is the best option we have.

722
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,970
Originality, Sincerity and Service

723
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:51,180
Yes.

724
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,630
We have to stay here until
things settle down.

725
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,760
Shut down Gates 3 and 4.

726
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,680
He's not talking.

727
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,590
This is...

728
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,090
...a world inside a cartoon.

729
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,510
Your change of emotions counts.

730
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,260
What kind of rule is that?
Why are my emotions important?

731
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,050
Because you're the main character!

732
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:17,340
So you're not sure
how I'm going to die this time.

733
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,800
When I'm here,
I don't know things either.

734
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,930
So I can't help you.

735
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:25,510
You can know from there, then?

736
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,260
Yes.

737
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,930
It might take some time.

738
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,260
Yes.

739
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,970
I am one of those people...

740
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,800
who want your life to be a happy ending.

741
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,680
-Keep searching.
-Yes, sir.

742
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,930
Search thoroughly. Move faster.

743
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,680
He wants to talk to you.

744
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,680
Chul. What's the matter?

745
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,010
-Who is it?
-Mr Son.

746
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,550
-Hello, Mr Son.
-What happened?

747
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,970
I heard she vanished
while you were with her.

748
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:18,090
Yes.

749
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,800
Was it just like you told me that day?

750
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,340
If it was,

751
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,930
she didn't escape,
but went to a different world.

752
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:28,970
I think so.

753
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,510
How is that...

754
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,510
How is that possible?

755
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,840
This is a huge accident.

756
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,300
You know Han Cheol-ho
is just waiting for his chance.

757
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,380
He'll definitely attack now.

758
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,970
I'm quite sure...

759
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,720
...he'll argue that you plotted the case.

760
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,630
I'm sure he will.

761
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,380
But Han Cheol-ho isn't the problem.

762
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:52,590
What?

763
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,180
He's not important.

764
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,590
The reason for my existence
is what's important.

765
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,680
Did you hear something
from Oh Yeon-joo?

766
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,300
I did.

767
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,340
What did she say?

768
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,840
A completely crazy story.

769
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,630
My first impression of her was right.

770
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:24,930
She's foolish and crazy.

771
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,380
She said something...

772
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,010
...completely crazy.

773
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,760
Why do you care about her nonsense, then?

774
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,680
After hearing what Yeon-joo said,

775
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,300
everything that's happened to me that
I couldn't understand makes sense now.

776
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,800
What?

777
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,300
All the incidents had no contexts,

778
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,550
but her story gives them a context.

779
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,630
It's a context that explains everything.

780
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,510
And what context is that?

781
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,090
It's something...

782
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,590
I've never even imagined.

783
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:16,090
So what is the context?

784
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,800
This world...

785
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,970
This world...

786
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,090
...is all fake.

787
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,050
Everything is fabricated.

788
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,550
Do-yoon.

789
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,800
Do-yoon.

790
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,800
To be continued

791
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:37,550
"The end. Due to personal reasons,
I'll end the story here."

792
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:40,220
"Thank you for your support."
That should be good, right?

793
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,800
Most fans will be against it,
but what else can we do?

794
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,430
What? What happened?

795
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,090
What? What's going on?

796
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,590
What's going on?

797
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,720
Goodness, what's going on here?

798
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:18,340
What's going on?

799
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:24,800
Son Hyeon-seok

800
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,800
When the main character realised
that it's fiction,

801
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,050
everything...

802
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,970
...in the webtoon world stopped.

803
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,470
Only Chul survived in the world
where time stopped.

804
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,720
As if...

805
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,880
it was punishing...

806
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,880
the one who became aware.

807
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,130
What's going on with this?

808
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,590
What on earth? Goodness.

809
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:24,380
What's going on?

810
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:27,180
Gosh, what's wrong with this?

811
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,220
Why is everything not working?

812
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,180
This is strange.

813
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,470
Something must have happened to Chul.

814
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,590
-What do you mean?
-Something bad...

815
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,340
...must've happened to him because of me.

816
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,300
Oh, no.

817
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:24,260
Someone claiming to be your fiancee
came to see you.

818
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,800
What is this?
Did I get dragged back in again?

819
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,430
I'm the one who came out.

820
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:32,130
I'm the one who came into your world.

821
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,180
I wanted to say goodbye.

822
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:37,090
You're just a fake. You're nothing.

823
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,220
You're a character I created.

824
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,630
Do you know what I had to go through?

825
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,970
That's fiction. It's my job.

826
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,970
I still remember every painful moment.

827
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,590
This must be a perfect ending for
someone looking for a murderer...

828
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,760
and became a murderer himself.
