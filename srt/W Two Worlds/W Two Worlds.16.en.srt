1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,430
W-Two Worlds

2
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,340
Final episode

3
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,770
Requesting for assistance.

4
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,400
Suspect is with someone.

5
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,110
Please confirm the vehicle.
The vehicle number is 28-M-4740.

6
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,770
It's 28-M-4740.

7
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,980
I was drawing Han Cheol-ho's video.
Let's give it to the police first.

8
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,860
We can hand it in via e-mail.

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,940
Let's report where
they're keeping Do-yoon as well.

10
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,770
-They can catch Cheol-ho there.
-We can't do that.

11
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,070
Why not?

12
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,900
With a happy ending like that,

13
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,650
your father will cease to exist.

14
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,150
My happy ending
is a sad ending to the killer.

15
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,900
The problem is that,
whatever ending we might have,

16
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,230
either your father or I...

17
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,520
won't be by your side.

18
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,770
We'll either die...

19
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,900
or disappear.

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,190
We need to make a decision...

21
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,860
on what kind of ending it'll be.

22
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,400
What ending should it be?

23
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,610
What are you doing?

24
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,520
Why are you taking off the rings?

25
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,230
What are you trying to do?

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,400
It's too cruel...

27
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,900
for a father to have his daughter
die to stay alive.

28
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,610
That can't happen.

29
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,610
I won't consider you as my family now.

30
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,150
You're free.
You're safe no matter how this ends.

31
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,980
You need to make a choice now.

32
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,320
What kind of ending will it be?

33
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,820
I will follow your decision.

34
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,520
Who said you can take me
out of your family register?

35
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,520
Why would you say such nonsense?

36
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,360
An ending where one of us
disappears is not an ending.

37
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,770
Why does it have to be that way?

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,730
We can...

39
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,900
all be together.

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,520
You'll live here forever?

41
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,110
The three of us...

42
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,270
can live together.

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,770
How can we live together?

44
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,860
I'll have to go to prison,
and so will your father.

45
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,190
Both your father and I
will stay in prison for life.

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,230
If you behave well,
they might reduce your term.

47
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,980
That doesn't mean we'll be happy here.

48
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,650
We will only see each other
in the prison visiting room.

49
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,270
What's wrong with that?

50
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,690
It's better than not being able
to see each other at all.

51
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,520
-Such normal ending is impossible.
-It's possible.

52
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,110
Dad.

53
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,110
You.

54
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,070
I need both of you beside me.
I can't think of any other option.

55
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,980
We can die of sickness or old age.

56
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,900
Let's just live like that.

57
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,400
Just like normal people.

58
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,900
We'll live a normal life like them.

59
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,230
You told me to decide.

60
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,190
That's my decision.

61
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,900
Draw a back door and a car.

62
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,360
Since you can't make a decision now,
we should leave this place first.

63
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,520
Remember what you told me back then?

64
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,400
You said your husband
never told you that he loved you.

65
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,980
I love you.

66
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,400
Jayu Motel

67
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,650
I have to get Do-yoon first.

68
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,320
Stay here for a while.

69
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,360
Sir, what happened?
The police are after you.

70
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,650
Why is Do-yoon here?

71
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,610
Wait here for a while.

72
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,980
Chul is here.

73
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,110
Okay.

74
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,900
Chul is here.

75
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,440
-What about the tablet?
-He wants to see this guy first.

76
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Okay.

77
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,270
Do-yoon! Do-yoon!

78
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,860
Do-yoon.

79
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,230
-Take him straight to the hospital.
-Yes, sir.

80
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,900
How about you, Mr Kang?

81
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,020
Where is the tablet?

82
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
I don't have it.

83
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,900
I'll give you this instead.

84
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,770
It has all kinds of videos
including one of you torturing me.

85
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,980
See for yourself.

86
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,520
I won't have you arrested right away.

87
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,150
But if you bother me again,
I won't let it pass.

88
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,480
I have a lot of copies.

89
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,520
Also know that catching me alone
won't really do anything.

90
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,110
And stop looking for the tablet...

91
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,020
unless you really want to
get a shot in your neck.

92
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,190
By the way,

93
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,520
I heard this ends when you die.

94
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,480
What?

95
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,940
What are you doing, sir?

96
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,610
While waiting for you,
I heard of something strange.

97
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,650
Two different worlds.

98
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,900
You should wait outside.

99
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,610
Pardon?

100
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,900
Can't you hear me? Wait outside.

101
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,400
Yes, sir.

102
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,230
Do-yoon seemed to have heard of
some nonsense from you.

103
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,900
He said you're the lead character
of a cartoon and I'm the villain.

104
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,900
That the tablet belongs to
the artist who drew it.

105
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,070
And that the cartoon
was drawn by Oh Seong-moo.

106
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,690
I thought he had lost his mind,

107
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,690
but it somehow makes sense.

108
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,230
Everything that happened here
a year ago...

109
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,520
...is very strange indeed.

110
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,980
Hey.

111
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,820
How do you think I'm feeling now?

112
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,520
The election doesn't matter to me now.

113
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,520
Not when there is another world.

114
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,520
I was curious.

115
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,610
You could appear and disappear at will.

116
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,070
Why couldn't you escape when
I was beating you up to death?

117
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,520
And why would you stay in the prison?

118
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,020
Why?

119
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,360
Why? Why is that?

120
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,360
Why, why, why?

121
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,190
I thought it was because
you didn't have the tablet,

122
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,400
but it was because
this is the final episode.

123
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,820
I dosed up Do-yoon
and he told me everything.

124
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,730
It was because this is the final episode.

125
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
So...

126
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,940
either the lead character or
the villain has to die for it to end.

127
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,650
I can go into that world
only after it ends.

128
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,190
Hey.

129
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,860
Chul.

130
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,690
I know one thing for sure.

131
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,770
There is another world.

132
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,860
I went there once thanks to you.

133
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,770
I need to check out that world
more thoroughly.

134
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,230
And apparently, you need to die
for me to do that.

135
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,230
Do-yoon wouldn't have
lied to me to kill you.

136
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,610
All right.

137
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,520
Okay.

138
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,520
I don't need you anymore.

139
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,650
I can find out the truth myself
once I go there.

140
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,020
Die! Die, you jerk.

141
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,070
Die!

142
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,190
Sir, what's going on in there?

143
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,520
Sir, what's going on?

144
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,110
-Here is the key.
-Give it to me.

145
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,480
Are you punks insane?

146
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,360
Why did you let him go in alone?

147
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,650
He told us to take you to the hospital.
I thought he only went in to talk.

148
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,820
Mr Kang's out.

149
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,770
Hurry up.

150
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,020
Stop him.

151
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Do-yoon

152
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,320
Hello?

153
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,860
Ms Yeon-joo?

154
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,610
Is that you, Do-yoon?
What happened? Did you get out?

155
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,610
Yes. I'm alive.

156
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,900
I'm relieved.

157
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,650
-Where is Chul?
-Where is Chul?

158
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,070
I thought you were with him.

159
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:57,610
No.

160
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,230
I saw him run away,
but I couldn't reach him in time.

161
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,020
Where did he go to?

162
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,400
I'm looking for him.

163
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,070
He certainly got out of there.

164
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,860
Please text me the address
where you're at.

165
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,320
I will send some guys to guard you.

166
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Okay.

167
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,730
The number you are calling
is not available.

168
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,940
Hello?

169
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,820
Can you...

170
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,980
pick me up?

171
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,940
Where are you?

172
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,320
My car ran out of fuel.

173
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,900
I can't go on.

174
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,320
Where are you now?
Why didn't you answer your phone?

175
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,320
I fell asleep for a second.

176
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,270
You fell asleep?

177
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,650
Where are you?

178
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,110
I'm not sure.

179
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,940
I'm in front of a bus stop.

180
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,860
Are you hurt?

181
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,520
A little bit.

182
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,230
Which bus stop is it?

183
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,820
Tell me the name of it.
I'll be right there.

184
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,110
I can't really see.

185
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,650
I'll call you back.

186
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,070
Hello?

187
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,110
Jayu Motel

188
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,480
He just called me.
I think he can't drive right now.

189
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,650
I don't know where he is yet.

190
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,520
When will the guards get here?

191
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,900
Please take care of my dad.

192
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,730
Daeship-ri

193
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,230
Chul

194
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,110
Hello?

195
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,110
I'm in Yangju.

196
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,690
It's Daeship-ri...

197
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,360
Station.

198
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,820
Hang in there. I'll be right there.

199
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,980
I think I'll get there first.

200
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
I can't take him to a hospital.
What should I do?

201
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,440
I'll call his doctor.

202
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,440
Send him right over.

203
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,070
Hello?

204
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,860
Why aren't you coming?

205
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,020
I'm on my way,
but it's farther than I thought.

206
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,900
I'm waiting for you.

207
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,980
I'm on my way. I'll be there soon.

208
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,480
I don't think...

209
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,730
the final episode would
end with us dying of old age.

210
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,230
Of course it wouldn't.

211
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,110
Who would like such a boring ending?

212
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,730
Please come now.

213
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,570
I miss you.

214
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,400
I'm on my way.

215
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,190
I'm on my way to you now.

216
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,900
Please stay strong.

217
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,900
Please be strong. Please.

218
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,520
Yeon-joo

219
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,900
Do you hear me?

220
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,190
Hello? Hello?

221
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,820
Hello?

222
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,110
Do you hear me?

223
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,730
Hello?

224
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,110
I'm here!

225
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,900
Are you okay?

226
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,900
Are you okay?

227
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,070
The end

228
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,770
Daeship-ri

229
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,270
Goodness.

230
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,980
What on earth?

231
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,980
How could no one answer the phone?

232
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,860
Goodness.

233
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Gosh.

234
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,610
It disappeared!

235
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,150
Jayu Motel

236
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,020
I heard this ends when you die.

237
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,770
I heard this ends when you die.

238
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,980
Darn it.

239
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,900
Yeon-joo.

240
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,610
Yeon-joo.

241
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,610
Yeon-joo, are you okay?

242
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,690
The end

243
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,730
The end

244
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,360
Hey, where's Yeon-joo?

245
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,360
-She's in the emergency room.
-Emergency room?

246
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,650
-Tell her to come see me after.
-Yeon-joo is being treated...

247
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,650
-in the emergency room.
-What?

248
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,520
-I heard she passed out.
-She passed out? Why?

249
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,610
Yeon-joo.

250
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,650
Why are you crying?

251
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,610
Did something happen to you?

252
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,320
Welcome.

253
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,480
Have you seen...

254
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,360
a man who looked like a patient?

255
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,230
-Like a patient?
-Yes.

256
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,190
It's this man.

257
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,820
I'm sure he was somewhere here.
Have you seen him around?

258
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,110
I haven't seen him.

259
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,900
Does he have dementia?

260
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,820
No, he's from a mental hospital.

261
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,690
He's not sane right now,

262
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,190
so he's probably lost.
We must find him.

263
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,400
Please help me. He must be
somewhere in this building.

264
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,360
Please help me look for him.

265
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,570
-He didn't come here.
-Could you please check?

266
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,610
Wait, I'm glad to see you
because I have a question for you.

267
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,820
Is that really the end of "W"?

268
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,520
Why did the lead character die
instead of the villain?

269
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,520
-I didn't want such a sad...
-Please stop!

270
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,520
Shut your mouth!

271
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,520
If you say one more word...

272
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,690
What was that?

273
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,770
Gosh.

274
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,900
Why does he go crazy
every time he sees me?

275
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,110
I feel hurt again.

276
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,320
-Yeon-joo.
-Where's Dad?

277
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,270
He isn't at the motel.

278
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,770
"W" has ended, so
Mr Oh should return like you, right?

279
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,480
But no one has seen him around.
I don't know what's going on.

280
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,820
What are you doing?
What's wrong, Yeon-joo?

281
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,020
Where are you going?

282
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,360
Yeon-joo.

283
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,520
Yeon-joo, I told you
the tablet is gone.

284
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,400
It disappeared as soon as the
cartoon ended. It's not real anyway.

285
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,900
It was a drawn replica.

286
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,980
Even if it's here,

287
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,820
it won't help.

288
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,360
You know it's finished
when it says it is.

289
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,770
It's really the end.

290
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,520
Dad?

291
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,900
Looking for a person

292
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,320
If you see this person,
please contact me.

293
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,440
Looking for a person

294
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,230
Hello.

295
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,110
If you see this this person,
please give us a call.

296
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,190
Thank you for your help.

297
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,730
Although Yeon-joo couldn't accept it,

298
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,110
after seven years of publication,

299
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,610
"W" ended in September of 2016.

300
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,110
Kang Chul Wins Gold in Men's 50m Pistol.

301
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,820
I strongly suggest for the maximum
sentence, the death penalty.

302
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,020
As the lead character, Chul was
given a tough life upon birth.

303
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,980
He refused the fate given by the writer.

304
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,110
He even refused
the limitation of his existence.

305
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,230
He dreamt of a happy ending as a human.

306
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,900
Are you okay?

307
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,070
But he couldn't escape his fate
as he was shot by the villain...

308
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,020
and ended up dying in front of
the woman he loved.

309
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,730
Several journalists came to
ask about the ending,

310
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,610
but the writer wasn't there
to give the answers.

311
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,900
Even after the cartoon ended,
Mr Oh didn't come back.

312
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,400
Most people didn't doubt the ending.

313
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,520
It was sad, but they considered it
as a plausible sad ending.

314
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,860
However...

315
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,440
The end

316
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,020
Nobody knew that it was not a sad ending.

317
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,610
What happened?

318
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,900
Sir.

319
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,940
Sir?

320
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,070
Sir!

321
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,110
What happened?
What happened here?

322
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,860
Are you hurt?

323
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,610
Do-yoon, we just arrived.

324
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,270
He looks very serious.

325
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,480
And I overheard them.

326
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,400
I think Mr Kang got shot.

327
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,900
He got shot?

328
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,270
Han Cheol-ho shot him.
We didn't know earlier.

329
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,360
He must've bled a lot.
What do we do?

330
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,860
Chul was shot by Han Cheol-ho?

331
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,520
Chul was shot?

332
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
Yes.

333
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,900
Where is Chul?

334
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,770
We don't know.
We're still looking for him.

335
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,110
That's Do-yoon, right?
Let me talk to him.

336
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,690
Come on.

337
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,070
You want me to untie you?

338
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,520
Untie me right now.

339
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,360
Ms Yeon-joo said to never untie you.

340
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,520
Please untie me.

341
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,940
No. If you need anything,
you can ask the guys.

342
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,940
You've heard of the truth.

343
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,610
If I know the location,
it's faster to help him with a tablet.

344
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,320
Untie me. Please untie me.

345
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,940
He's not normal.

346
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,230
He can suddenly become aggressive.
Don't let your guards down.

347
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,440
Okay, sir.

348
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,440
He ran away?

349
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,520
You idiots got fooled
by a man who's been shot?

350
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,900
Kill him on the spot.

351
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,520
You don't need to bring him here.
Just kill him as soon as you see him!

352
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,400
Sir, you can't do this.

353
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,520
Why create more problems?
How will you handle them?

354
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,900
You can just let the police handle it.

355
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,860
This is not the right time.

356
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,110
Do you know when the right time is?

357
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,730
I can die any moment.
What does it matter?

358
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,440
I could get killed any time.

359
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,520
That file Chul distributed is
enough to kill me tomorrow.

360
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,610
How will you stop him? How?

361
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,820
Get out. Get lost!

362
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,650
-Sir.
-What is it?

363
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,520
A man called Oh Seong-moo
is on the line.

364
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,610
Who?

365
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,520
He said you'd recognise his name.

366
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,820
Hello?

367
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
It's me.

368
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,230
-Oh Seong-moo?
-Yes.

369
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,730
I'm glad I caught you in your office.

370
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:55,900
You are Oh Seong-moo,
the one I saw at the hospital?

371
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,110
Yes. I'm the man who created you.

372
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,980
I created you.

373
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,360
As the villain.

374
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,770
What happened to you though?

375
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,820
You never used to get
blood on your hands.

376
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,980
Yet you fired a gun.

377
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,230
How are you here?

378
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,980
The other time, I had to go there...

379
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,110
Did you shoot Chul because
you wanted to find me?

380
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,070
I was here all along.

381
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,400
Since a year ago.

382
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,070
What's this?

383
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Do you also want to know
the meaning of your existence?

384
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,610
When you have a lot of things
you want to learn about,

385
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,230
you go crazy because
you can't satisfy the curiosity.

386
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,610
The other ones also did that.

387
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,190
That's why I ended up like this.

388
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,520
But...

389
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,860
you shouldn't.

390
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,650
You wanted to be a president.

391
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,900
What do you think will happen to
this world if you learn the truth?

392
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,610
You are a villain, too.

393
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,190
It's too dangerous.

394
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,400
You shall go with me.

395
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,520
I failed everything,

396
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,190
but I'll get rid of you before leaving.

397
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,650
No. No.

398
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,980
Spare me.

399
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,520
Is anyone...

400
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,440
I'm sorry to everyone.

401
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,650
I'm sorry to everyone.

402
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,320
What is this?

403
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,320
"The truth behind
Son Hyeon-seok's death"?

404
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,860
I got that, too.

405
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,360
-Hello?
-Did Yeon-joo...

406
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,270
go to Chul?

407
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,110
Yes.

408
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,110
Where are they? Tell me.

409
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,900
I want to see...

410
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,610
my daughter one last time.

411
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,610
We can't...

412
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,110
go together.

413
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,900
If you're happy,

414
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,070
I'm sad.

415
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,690
I'm here!

416
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,360
I love you,

417
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,150
my dear daughter.

418
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,570
Goodbye.

419
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,190
"W" ended...

420
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,110
not when Chul dies,
but when the villains are gone.

421
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,230
The readers couldn't see
the villains' end.

422
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,520
Contrary to his reason of existence,
the killer helped Chul to be happy.

423
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,650
Because of that paradox, his last
moment was edited out completely.

424
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,020
Isn't that him?

425
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,520
Chul!

426
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,650
-Sir.
-Chul!

427
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,230
Nobody knew that...

428
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,110
Chul didn't die.

429
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,650
It was just that the webtoon
ended before he was saved.

430
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,770
Chul.

431
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,940
Chul.

432
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,070
How are you feeling?

433
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,070
I thought you died!

434
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:46,860
Yeon-joo...

435
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,900
She's not here.

436
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,360
I only found her car.

437
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,900
That's when Chul realised...

438
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,110
his role as the lead character was over.

439
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,110
Well, I haven't checked on that.
I'd only just arrived in Seoul.

440
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,730
I'll check that for you now.

441
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,480
Okay.

442
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,900
The video file of Congressman Han
kidnapping and torturing Mr Kang,

443
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,900
the recorded call between him and
Han Sang-hoon, the killer who died,

444
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,860
and the recorded call of him...

445
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,360
inciting a gangster to murder Mr
Kang are spreading on the Internet.

446
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,320
The police announced that
they're tracking the source.

447
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:43,980
After Congressman Han's suicide
was reported on the news...

448
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,520
Did Han Cheol-ho die?

449
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,730
Hey, So-hee.

450
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,940
Are you okay?
I heard you were shot.

451
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,980
I almost died. They sent me here
right after I got better.

452
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:21,270
Your murder charge has been cleared.
Your sentence won't be long.

453
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,900
I'm sorry.

454
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,860
For what?

455
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,400
I suspected you and never called.

456
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,730
I would've suspected myself.
I pretended to be dead.

457
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,320
You suspecting me and not calling...

458
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,400
makes me glad.

459
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,320
What do you mean?

460
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:48,070
You proved that you can
have your life on your own.

461
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,900
I couldn't find Mr Oh Seong-moo.

462
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,320
I couldn't reach him after he called
and said he'd go see Ms Yeon-joo.

463
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,730
He left his car there.

464
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,900
-You couldn't find him?
-Not even a trace of him.

465
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,520
That's right.
He left a letter to you.

466
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,360
I'll give it to you with a book.

467
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,110
To Chul

468
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,520
To Chul.

469
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,730
I hoped you would let me go in peace,

470
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,230
but in the end,
I had to leave here myself.

471
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,230
I'm already dead.

472
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,770
My soul is terminally ill.

473
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,610
I can't be sure when I'll go crazy again.

474
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,650
I'm going to end my life here today.

475
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,360
You'll go out to the real world...

476
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,520
and I'll end my life here.

477
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,230
You'll become a human...

478
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,900
and I'll be left as a cartoon character.

479
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,190
You'll escape the setting that I've made.

480
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,900
I'll be stuck in the setting...

481
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,520
and die.

482
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,980
Isn't life funny?

483
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,610
Be happy.

484
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,610
Make Yeon-joo happy.

485
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,110
And...

486
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:50,940
if you meet Yeon-joo,

487
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,020
tell her I'm still alive...

488
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,900
so that she won't be sad.

489
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,320
Tell her that...

490
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,020
I'm happy in this world.

491
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,650
In the world of the cartoon I drew.

492
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,940
Chul spent two more years
in the prison...

493
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:56,770
to end the world of "W" in the right way.

494
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,190
Time passed slowly.

495
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:10,820
Are you going out?

496
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,520
-I'm going to see a friend.
-You should rest.

497
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:18,110
What happened to your dad?
It's been over a week now.

498
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,320
He will come back
if we wait a few more days.

499
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:51,770
Dad.

500
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,480
Hello?

501
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,320
Yes, this is Yeon-joo's phone.

502
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,820
Yeon-joo left her phone at home.

503
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:48,690
May I know who's calling?

504
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,770
You're awake.

505
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:40,820
How do you feel?

506
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,320
I told your mum to go back home.

507
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,520
I thought she'd ask me many questions,

508
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,230
but she didn't say much.

509
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,190
I couldn't tell her I was your husband.

510
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,110
I said I was your boyfriend.

511
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,520
By the way,

512
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:12,230
was the last place you saw Yeon-joo
at a bus station?

513
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,400
Yes.

514
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,070
Pardon me, but what do you do?

515
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,150
Right.

516
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:34,820
I was in a hurry,
so I gave her this business card,

517
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,320
but she didn't say much.

518
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,360
I spent two years in prison,

519
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,650
but it's only been a week here.

520
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,860
I was worried that the time
would pass at the same rate.

521
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:57,070
I was worried you'd die
of sadness in those two years.

522
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,650
You don't know how relieved I felt.

523
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,110
What about my dad?

524
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,520
Did you know...

525
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:26,980
that I'm three years older than you now?

526
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,360
You must treat me
like I'm older than you.

527
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,480
I spent three more years that were tough.

528
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,440
-Okay, Yeon-joo?
-Gosh.

529
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,650
Did it...

530
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,770
really end?

531
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,150
Yes.

532
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,070
It really...

533
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,320
ended, right?

534
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,230
It really ended.

535
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:34,820
Kang Chul's story in the cartoon
had a happy ending,

536
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:38,360
but the ending of
Chul and Yeon-joo's story...

537
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,440
is unclear yet.

538
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:41,820
However...

539
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:46,110
The two will no longer be
at the risk of death.

540
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:50,230
Though it may be boring and ordinary,
hopefully their story...

541
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:52,440
will continue for 50 years.

542
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,230
Just like other ordinary couples.

543
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,320
Thank you for watching "W".

544
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,940
Please look forward to "W Special 2".
