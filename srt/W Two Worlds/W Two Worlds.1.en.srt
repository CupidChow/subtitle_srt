1
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,540
W – Two Worlds

2
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,870
Shall we take a look at different
events of 2004 Athens Olympics?

3
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,290
-We have good news from Shooting.
-That's right.

4
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,040
The final game for the Men's
50m Pistol is currently going on

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,080
at the shooting centre.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,080
Unexpectedly, Kang Chul from Korea
is performing very well.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,160
-He's young, but doing very well.
-You're right.

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,290
He's only in Grade 11.

9
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,700
We expect him to overcome the pressure.

10
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,580
-And win a gold medal.
-That's right.

11
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,660
With hope for a gold medal, we take you
to the shooting centre right now.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,870
Here is the Markopoulo
Olympic Shooting Centre.

13
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,950
The final for the Men's
50m Pistol has already begun.

14
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,120
Kang Chul from Korea is attempting
to win the gold medal.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Although he was on 7th place
in the qualifier to the final,

16
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,290
he's currently in the lead with seven
shots already fired in the final game.

17
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,580
Kang Chul Line 3.

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,410
10.6.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,450
Ukraine, Ivan Asimov, Line 4.

20
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,450
9.9.

21
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,330
USA...

22
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,870
Honestly, we didn't expect Kang Chul
to be in the running for gold.

23
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,580
Those players next to him are 1st,
2nd and 3rd in the world rankings.

24
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,410
You're right. It's also his first time
as a member of the national team.

25
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,410
This is his very first
international debut.

26
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,330
The 17-year-old is doing such a good
job against the world champions.

27
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,040
We wonder if he can repeat

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,660
the historical moment by Yeo Gab-soon
in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.

29
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,290
He's been performing very well so far.

30
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,040
For the next competition shot, load.

31
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,240
Attention.

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,830
Three, two, one.

33
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,580
Start.

34
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,870
Okay, this is the 8th shooting.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,580
It's 10.2. He scored 10.2.

36
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,450
The world's number one,

37
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,450
-Asimov scored 9.5.
-Good job!

38
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,990
It seems that it's difficult
for Asimov to catch him up.

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,580
Yes, but Kang Chul
shouldn't celebrate yet.

40
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,620
-He must remain calm until the end.
-You're right.

41
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,660
Stay calm and focus.

42
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,370
It looks like his coach is also
signing him to remain calm.

43
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,540
He is Kang Yoon, Kang Chul's father
as well as his coach.

44
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,990
-Is that so?
-He taught his son for focus

45
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,490
and achieved this much
within three years.

46
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,330
He must be a genius,

47
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,580
-taking after his father's talent.
-Yes, I agree.

48
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,330
Now, it's Kang Chul's 9th shooting.

49
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,080
Attention.

50
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,160
Three, two, one.

51
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,740
Start.

52
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,700
Oh, gosh. What happened?

53
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,790
It missed the target a bit too much.

54
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,620
He scored 7.9.

55
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,200
He made a critical mistake
on the 9th shooting.

56
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,080
Asimov from Ukraine scored 10.2.

57
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,040
He scored 10.2.

58
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,950
-If this is the case...
-Asimov is in the lead by 0.2.

59
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,240
Yes, right.

60
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,120
Asimov's total score is 653.4,
while Chul's total score is 653.2.

61
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,200
The gold medallist will be decided
by the last shooting.

62
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,950
The current score difference
between them is only 0.2.

63
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,370
Asimov's long experience seems
to be paying off.

64
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,120
Could Kang Chul's lack of experience
hinder his success this time?

65
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,450
You may be right. This is
his first international game.

66
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,580
Focus. It's the last chance.

67
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,790
-But he's good enough to handle it.
-That's right.

68
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,120
-He should focus until the end.
-That's right.

69
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,790
For the next competition shot, load.

70
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,700
Attention.

71
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,450
Three, two, one.

72
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,990
Start.

73
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,540
It's a thrilling moment.

74
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,830
This is the last, the 10th shooting.

75
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,700
It's 10.4.
Asimov has achieved...

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,910
...a score of 10.4.

77
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,870
Asimov is indeed a very skilled player.

78
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,240
This means that for the gold medal,

79
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,990
Kang Chul must acquire
a score of over 10.7.

80
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,870
Kang Chul is still...

81
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,620
...just aiming at the target.

82
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,790
He needs to shoot within the limit
of 75 seconds.

83
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,410
He looks really nervous.

84
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,290
-He needs to empty his mind.
-Chul. Shoot.

85
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,410
Shoot it at once.

86
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,660
Honestly, it's already a huge achievement

87
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,370
-for him to come all this way.
-That's right.

88
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,870
All the other players already
finished shooting,

89
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,740
but Kang Chul hasn't fired
his pistol yet.

90
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,830
He needs to shoot now.

91
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,790
It's over 55 seconds now.

92
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,040
He looks very anxious.

93
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,870
He just needs to shoot now.

94
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,660
-He should at least get the bronze.
-That's right.

95
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,330
There are only five seconds left.

96
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,660
In five, four,

97
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,700
-three...
-He must fire now!

98
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,990
Two and one.

99
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,990
He's fired it.

100
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,660
He fired with a second left on the clock.

101
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,120
The result is...

102
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,990
-It's 10.9!
-It's 10.9!

103
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,540
-Kang Chul scored 10.9!
-The game was turned around!

104
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,660
You made it!

105
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,040
The game was turned around!
He wins the gold medal!

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,200
You won the gold. Good job.

107
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,240
-He wins the gold medal!
-It's awesome!

108
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,620
Isn't he just 17 years old?

109
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,950
Normally, players tend to lose
their calm under great pressure,

110
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,490
but he turned the game around.

111
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,700
It's the gold medal. You did it!

112
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,790
With just one second left,

113
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,290
he hit the target with great accuracy.

114
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,990
A new star has been born today.

115
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,740
Kang Chul wins gold for Men's 50m Pistol

116
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,790
He did an excellent job.

117
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,540
Kang Chul wins gold for Men's 50m Pistol

118
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,660
Now, he is passing the ball

119
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,490
further inside.

120
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,740
-It's working now.
-Okay.

121
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,290
-Then again, he's kicking.
-This is a chance.

122
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,490
Go. Pass.

123
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,370
-Kick it over there.
-Go.

124
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,120
-Go ahead.
-Kick it.

125
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,580
-In between them.
-Over there.

126
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,790
-No, not there.
-Oh, no.

127
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,240
-Kick it to that side.
-Oh, no.

128
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,830
-It's going up.
-Do it!

129
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,450
-To that side.
-Oh, gosh.

130
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,790
Shoot!

131
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,410
-Oh, no.
-What was that?

132
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,620
Is that you, Chul?
Why are you so late?

133
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,870
Where have you been?
You missed out this important match.

134
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,120
It's nearly over now.

135
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,040
He is kicking the ball further inside.

136
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,370
Pass the ball in between them.

137
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,490
Let's do it. Go.

138
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,240
-Do it!
-They have just missed

139
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,700
the critical chance to goal again.

140
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,370
-Honey.
-Shoot the ball!

141
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,740
-Go ahead and make a goal.
-The defence isn't there.

142
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,990
-Do it!
-Just one more goal.

143
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,200
I hope they can pull themselves together

144
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,790
and push hard to make just one more goal.

145
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,450
Here he comes. Goal!

146
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,410
-Gosh!
-Please.

147
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,700
-Oh, no.
-Please!

148
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,620
-Shoot!
-Oh, no.

149
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,330
-Do it!
-Shoot it!

150
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,580
This is going great.

151
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,330
There goes Ahn Jung-hwan.

152
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,240
He shoots it! It's a goal!

153
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,620
Ahn Jung-hwan!

154
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,160
Today's first news. Two days ago,
we delivered the news that...

155
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,160
...an entire family in Sangdo-dong
was shot and murdered.

156
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,490
The police named Athens Olympics
gold medallist, Kang Chul,

157
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,990
who is also a member of the family
as prime suspect.

158
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,540
Reporter Park.

159
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,040
Yes. I am at Seoul Dongjak
Police Station.

160
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,580
A while ago, former national athlete,
Kang Chul was arrested for parricide.

161
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,330
Kang Chul arrested
on suspicions of parricide

162
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,950
National shooting team's coach,
Kang Yoon, his wife Yoon Mi-ho,

163
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,620
their daughter Soo-yeon
and son Joon-seok,

164
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,830
were found shot to death in their
living room on the morning of 15th.

165
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,120
While investigating Kang Chul,
who was not home on that day,

166
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,740
police found many doubtful points
regarding his whereabouts that day.

167
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,450
Go, Korea!

168
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,540
Oh, Korea the winner

169
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,990
Oh, Korea the winner

170
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,490
Moreover, the pistol used to kill them
was found...

171
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,870
...in a trash 500m from the crime scene.

172
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,290
This pistol used in the crime...

173
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,290
...is 5.56mm calibre
and made in Swiss.

174
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,490
On it, we found the victims' bloodstain
and Kang Chul's fingerprints.

175
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,040
Police confirmed that the pistol
used in the crime...

176
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,200
...is the same pistol used by Kang Chul
in the Olympics.

177
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,160
Yes. It is very shocking news indeed.

178
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,490
Reporter Kim.

179
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,450
There are many citizens
who still remember

180
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,830
the touching moment
during Athens Olympics.

181
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,490
The scene where he ran to his father
and hugged him is still vivid.

182
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,620
If Kang Chul really murdered them,

183
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,490
what could be the motif of his crime?

184
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,450
His motif is still unclear.

185
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,950
But according to the testimonies,

186
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,330
he had been having troubles
with his father

187
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,790
after he quit being a shooting player
and decided to study computer science.

188
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,080
Well, that still doesn't fully explain

189
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,080
why a famous Olympic athlete
would commit parricide.

190
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,330
That's right.

191
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,120
Because of that,
there's strong public protest

192
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,040
against the prosecution's hasty arrest.

193
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,740
Two people saw you at the backdoor.

194
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,990
How would you explain that?

195
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,040
You had a fight with your father
a week before the incident.

196
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,040
Then you told your friend while drinking

197
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,200
that you find him annoying
and you wish him gone, correct?

198
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,120
No, I didn't.

199
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,620
Is that right?

200
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,120
I understand you wanted
to live by yourself.

201
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,660
Yes.

202
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,700
You must have.

203
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,870
Didn't you?

204
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,700
Even so,

205
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,450
you can't shoot your own father.

206
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,290
You shot your mother
who tried to stop you.

207
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,990
You lost control
and shot everyone to death.

208
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,040
What? Were you too scared to die
after you killed them?

209
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,330
You ran away, came back and cried
in front of your parents' picture.

210
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,740
Do you know what people call
someone like you?

211
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,410
A waste of space.

212
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,160
You should be expelled
from the society permanently.

213
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,120
And that is my job.

214
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,290
Do you understand me?

215
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,410
Chul.

216
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,660
The prosecutor in charge, Han Cheol-ho
is a man with big ambition.

217
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,580
He's hoping to be a politician.

218
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,870
He's trying to score big
with your case since you're famous.

219
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,990
This is bad.

220
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,040
Also,

221
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,160
we had the funeral because
we couldn't postpone it any longer.

222
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,990
We buried everyone in a sunny field.

223
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,290
Don't worry.

224
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,030
Be strong.

225
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,420
We're doing everything we can.
Hang in there.

226
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,030
Considering the time and means
of the crime,

227
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,110
it's hard to say
it was a crime of impulse.

228
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,700
Murdering one's own family
under a carefully designed plan is...

229
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,400
...a terrible and shocking crime
that breaks moral laws.

230
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,360
Moreover, the accused
is a renowned athlete.

231
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,070
As an icon for teenagers,

232
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,320
this incident is too shocking
and incomparable in its severity.

233
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,860
As to alert the society to the danger,

234
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,070
I strongly request...

235
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,450
the court give Kang Chul
the maximum penalty allowed by law,

236
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,960
the death penalty.

237
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,440
-Well said.
-Hang that rascal!

238
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,530
You terrible human!

239
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,740
Die!

240
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,490
Punish him!

241
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Chul.

242
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,530
You crazy jerk.

243
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,320
How is this your conclusion?

244
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,610
How is this your conclusion?

245
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,380
You jerk!

246
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,900
Myungsei University Medical Centre

247
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,430
Hey, answer your phone.

248
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,740
Hey.

249
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,240
Seok-beom, it's your phone.

250
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,200
Gosh.

251
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,570
I need to sleep!

252
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,820
Crazy Dog

253
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,860
Hey. It's Crazy Dog.

254
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,360
You're dead meat.
Your phone rang more than 10 times.

255
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,490
Yes, Dr Park.
This is Seok-beom.

256
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,700
-Hey!
-Yes, sir.

257
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,280
-Answer your phone, you idiot!
-No, it's...

258
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,570
-Where is Yeon-joo?
-Yeon-joo?

259
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,900
She's right next to me.

260
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,320
I'm not sure why she wouldn't
answer her stupid phone.

261
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,610
-Yes, sir. Okay.
-Ouch!

262
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,490
Goodness!

263
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,070
He's looking for you.

264
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,490
My goodness.

265
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,700
10 Missed Calls from Crazy Dog

266
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,740
Hey, why is my phone on silent mode?

267
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,360
He will most likely kill you for not
answering his calls for 10 times.

268
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,320
-Why is he looking for me?
-I don't know that.

269
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,020
-Good luck.
-What should I do?

270
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,740
-Hello.
-Hello.

271
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,280
-Oh, my.
-Yes?

272
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,570
-You have drool on your face.
-What?

273
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,860
-Where is Dr Park?
-What?

274
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,070
-Dr Park!
-I don't know. Wait, your drool.

275
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,530
Oh no, what should I do?

276
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,820
He's not going to kill me, is he?

277
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,150
Gosh, please.

278
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,780
-Where is Dr Park?
-He's not here.

279
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,860
-Have you seen Dr Park?
-He's not down here.

280
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,780
Aren't there any cardiac patients?

281
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,450
No, there aren't.

282
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,610
What is it, then?

283
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,200
Dr Park, it's Oh Yeon-joo.

284
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,070
Come in.

285
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,280
Do you realise how long
it took you to come?

286
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,780
-Are you being serious here?
-I'm sorry.

287
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,150
I didn't know you're here.

288
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,570
You didn't even answer your phone.
Are you looking down on me now?

289
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,450
-Do you think you can ignore my calls?
-I'm sorry.

290
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,110
It will never happen again.
I'm so sorry.

291
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,490
Is your father Oh Seong-moo,
the webtoon artist?

292
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,700
-Pardon?
-They say you're his daughter.

293
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,030
I didn't know that.

294
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,820
I am his daughter.

295
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,070
-Really?
-Yes.

296
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,740
-That doesn't make sense.
-Pardon?

297
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,610
Your father is the great Oh Seong-moo.
Yet how are you like this?

298
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,360
Gosh, Yeon-joo.

299
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,070
I'm sorry that I am not good enough.

300
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,780
Do you live with your parents?

301
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,200
No, I live with my mother.

302
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
-Where's your father?
-My parents got divorced.

303
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,700
Is that right? So you don't
see your father often?

304
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,570
I see him from time to time.

305
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,400
By the way, why do you keep
asking me about these things?

306
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,280
-I really...
-Give me some spoilers.

307
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,820
-What?
-I...

308
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,860
I'm really into this these days.

309
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,570
Your father's cartoon.

310
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,200
I enjoy it so much these days.

311
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,030
Of course, I knew it was a hit,

312
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,610
but I don't like reading webtoons,
so I didn't read it.

313
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,400
But I heard it's ending this week,

314
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,360
so I rushed to a bookstore

315
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,450
and bought all 33 books.
Look at this.

316
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,860
It was so tough.

317
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,400
I stayed up two whole nights
reading these.

318
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,990
Why is it so fun?

319
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,530
Did you call me

320
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,780
-because of this?
-You know what?

321
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,780
I love the main character here.

322
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,030
Kang Chul is very tenacious.

323
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,170
I am a man, but even I think he's great.

324
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,030
I think he's great, too.

325
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,360
-Are you his fan, too?
-Of course I am.

326
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,820
Who wouldn't like Kang Chul?

327
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,860
He's handsome, talented
and well-mannered.

328
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,030
And his eyes are very sexy.

329
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,450
Sexy?

330
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,490
I am sorry. I went over the line.

331
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,820
Gosh.

332
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,610
Give me a high-five.

333
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,360
I'm so glad to meet
another Kang Chul's fan!

334
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,030
I didn't know you were his fan!

335
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,860
Since when did you like W?
You should've told me.

336
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,200
You should've told me
that he was your father.

337
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,240
-My dad will be thrilled.
-Gosh.

338
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,030
Dr Park, please sign here.

339
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,320
By the way, who is the real murderer?

340
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,950
I am not sure about that either.

341
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,400
It's ending this week,
but it still hasn't been revealed.

342
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,530
Haven't you heard anything
from your father?

343
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,200
My father never tells me about the story.

344
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,700
-But you're his daughter.
-Not even to me.

345
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,030
Just bring me a spoiler.

346
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,900
I know her father. He's very strict.

347
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,320
Yes, he is.

348
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,280
You've never opened up a chest
in a surgery, have you?

349
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,150
I will let you try it.

350
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,820
-Really?
-Find out who the murderer is.

351
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,110
But my father will never tell me.

352
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,570
-You can close it, too.
-I will go get it right now!

353
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,650
If you lie because you want
to open up a chest, I'll kill you.

354
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,950
Don't worry.

355
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,360
Don't worry.

356
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,530
-Dr Park.
-Yes.

357
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,450
-I don't think it's fair.
-What is?

358
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,450
Even the senior colleagues
haven't opened up a chest.

359
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,700
Is that right?

360
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,950
If you feel bad, you should
have a cartoonist father, too.

361
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,450
Wicked!

362
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,990
If I knew earlier that
he was into cartoons,

363
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,610
my life would've been easier.

364
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,820
Well, I know it now.

365
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,650
Let's see.

366
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,070
Dad

367
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,240
No.

368
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,240
I'll just get into trouble. Definitely.

369
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,730
Park Soo-bong

370
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,110
-Hello? Yeon-joo.
-Is it Yeon-joo?

371
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,030
Soo-bong, it's been a while.

372
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,070
-Yeon-joo, the thing is...
-You must be really busy.

373
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,360
I know that today's the last day
and you must be hectic.

374
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,950
But I have a favour to ask you.
My life really depends on it.

375
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,820
-So don't tell Dad.
-Yeon-joo!

376
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,860
I was going to call you.
Go sit down.

377
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,250
-We're in trouble.
-What do you mean?

378
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,860
He disappeared.

379
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,650
What?

380
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,820
I mean...

381
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,490
He's been out of touch since last night.

382
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,990
It's not a big deal.

383
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,570
He must be somewhere
drinking with his friends.

384
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,030
No. I've called all the bars
and nobody knows where he is.

385
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,490
He left his phone, too.

386
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,040
He left his phone?

387
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,900
He left his wallet and car key.
He just disappeared.

388
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,320
Where did he go, then?

389
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,650
It's supposed to be done by 4 PM,
yet he hasn't given us any directions.

390
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,200
We don't know what to do.
He's never missed a deadline.

391
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,860
What do we do?

392
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,240
Yeon-joo!

393
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,530
-You surprised me.
-You're here.

394
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,950
Hello, everyone. Any news from Dad?

395
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,280
He's not back yet.

396
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,950
What?

397
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,030
You haven't talked to him?

398
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,400
I've been too busy.
It's been a while since we talked.

399
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,570
I should tell the editors.
I haven't even mentioned it.

400
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,740
Let's wait for him a little more.
We still have time.

401
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,150
You know what's really strange?

402
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,860
We worked here all day yesterday
and he never came out of this room.

403
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,650
Do you want me to make you some coffee?

404
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,280
Yes. At 10 PM.

405
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,150
Okay.

406
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,700
We were outside of his room all night.

407
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,400
But...

408
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,360
Your coffee is...

409
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,150
Mr Oh?

410
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,490
I went into his room at exactly 10 PM.

411
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,240
And he wasn't there.
Nobody saw him leaving.

412
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,360
-Go out and look for him.
-Okay.

413
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,150
We were afraid that he fell down,
so we looked everywhere.

414
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,860
Mr Oh.

415
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,240
Where did he go?

416
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,030
But...

417
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,240
...there was no trace of him.
Isn't that strange?

418
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,650
-Isn't that strange?
-It is. It's very strange.

419
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,400
Should I call the police?

420
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,320
It hasn't even been 24 hours.
Let's wait a little more.

421
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,650
Well, he might have gotten frustrated

422
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,700
and stepped outside for some air.

423
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,150
At night without any notice?
With no money or mobile phone?

424
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,740
He's a human, too.

425
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,360
He must feel sad to say goodbye
to the character

426
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,900
he's been drawing for 10 years.

427
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,820
Who? Mr Oh?

428
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,360
He wasn't sad at all.

429
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,530
He said he was sick of him
and that he wanted to kill him off.

430
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,610
Kill him? Kill who?

431
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,950
Kang Chul.

432
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,610
He said he's going to kill Kang Chul
on the last scene.

433
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,240
-He wouldn't kill Kang Chul!
-Gosh!

434
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,700
I saw it.

435
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,780
Wait for a while.
Just you wait.

436
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,360
Come here. I shouldn't, but
I'll show it to you. Don't tell anyone.

437
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,860
-What's this?
-Who else? It's Kang Chul.

438
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,030
-Look. He's dead.
-Why?

439
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,530
-Why would you kill Kang Chul?
-I didn't kill him.

440
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,450
Why would he kill Kang Chul?
It doesn't make sense.

441
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,400
-Is he really dead?
-Look at all that blood.

442
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,740
How can someone live after
bleeding this much? You're a doctor.

443
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,030
We were all against it.

444
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,030
I was never against his idea,

445
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,200
but this time,
I was absolutely against it.

446
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,030
Seon-mi even cried.
But Mr Oh was so stubborn about this.

447
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,450
Gosh.

448
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,200
He was so determined to kill him.

449
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,070
And he wanted to kill him brutally.
He said that it's his life dream.

450
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,030
-No way.
-Gosh.

451
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,240
If this goes up online,
people will go mad.

452
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,740
Everyone is expecting
his dramatic revenge at the end,

453
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,860
but he ends up dying in vain.

454
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,780
Is this the criminal? Who is this?

455
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,110
I don't know. He didn't tell me.

456
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,990
He disappeared after drawing until here.

457
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,860
Maybe he couldn't make up
his mind about the ending.

458
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,320
-Maybe he went to rethink about it.
-No, that can't be it.

459
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,030
That can't be the case.

460
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,450
He was so determined about it.

461
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,280
I swear he was smiling.

462
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,570
He looked really happy about it.

463
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,740
Why?

464
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,820
Why would he feel happy
drawing the main character's death?

465
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,570
How could I know?
How can I know his mind?

466
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,400
Could it be...

467
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,820
...that a psychotic fan happened to hear
about the ending from somewhere

468
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,360
and kidnapped Dad?

469
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,110
-Like in the movie "Misery?"
-Yes!

470
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,200
-There's a fanatic in the movie.
-I watched "Misery" myself, too.

471
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,450
Then...

472
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,200
-Then...
-We should report to the police.

473
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,530
-I have a bad feeling about this.
-I will do it.

474
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,820
I'll call the police right now.

475
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,950
Seon-mi! Yoon-hee!
Bring my mobile phone.

476
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,820
-My mobile phone, quickly.
-What's up, Soo-bong?

477
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,450
-Don't ask and get me my phone!
-What should I do if it's true?

478
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,230
Secrets of his family's death,
unexpected incidents and the ending

479
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,510
Problems of his family, the suspect
and Han Cheol-ho

480
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,420
Rather than being eaten up by him,

481
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,390
I will eat him up instead.

482
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,360
"Rather than being eaten up by him,"

483
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,700
"I will eat him up instead."

484
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,280
What is this?

485
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,740
Where am I?

486
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,990
Why am I here?

487
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,570
Oh, my goodness.

488
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,110
Excuse me? Hello.
Please wake up!

489
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,820
Can you hear me?

490
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,110
Why isn't it working?

491
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,820
Gosh!

492
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,360
Sir? Hang in there a little longer!

493
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,360
What is going on here?

494
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,030
-Two main dishes to go out.
-Excuse me.

495
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:44,450
Please call the ambulance.
There is someone dying on the rooftop.

496
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,240
Can't you hear me?
A man is dying after being stabbed.

497
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,780
He won't make it for long
because he has lost a lot of blood.

498
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,070
Tell them to hurry up.

499
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,320
Hurry up!

500
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,450
-What's going on?
-You go and have a look.

501
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,900
Call the manager.

502
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,860
What is this?

503
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,280
-Is he seriously hurt? Who is he?
-I don't know him.

504
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,820
Shine some light here.
Is the ambulance coming?

505
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,860
-Did you call the ambulance?
-I did.

506
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,400
There's a surgeons' conference downstairs.

507
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,950
-They are coming up now.
-A conference?

508
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,570
Where is this place?

509
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,700
-Pardon?
-What building is this?

510
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,700
This is a hotel.

511
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,820
-Seoul Plaza Hotel.
-It's a hotel?

512
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,570
By the way,
do you know what you are doing?

513
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,820
Let's just wait until the doctors arrive.

514
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,650
I'm a doctor.

515
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,950
Though I'm not particularly talented.

516
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,540
Oh, gosh. What's with him?

517
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,150
-I think this is pneumothorax.
-What?

518
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,200
Is it a pneumothorax? Yes, it is.

519
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,860
Yes, it is.
Then I need to make a puncture.

520
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,140
I need to puncture it, but I don't
have anything to do it with.

521
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,400
No, I can't. It's too dangerous.
I don't know enough about it.

522
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,150
Isn't he going to die?

523
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,860
If I make a hasty mistake and he dies,
I'll be held responsible.

524
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,450
I don't know.
Doctors in the dramas just do it.

525
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:45,110
-They just do it, don't they?
-Are you really a doctor?

526
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,200
Don't do anything
if you aren't confident.

527
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,490
I'm always not confident
because I'm not talented.

528
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,780
But how can I just let him die?

529
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,490
Did he die?

530
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,030
Did he die?

531
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,570
There's a dead man here!

532
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,990
-Is he the one?
-He's dead!

533
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,490
-What's going on?
-What happened?

534
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,030
-What happened?
-Is he dead?

535
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,820
Move aside, please.

536
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,860
How's the patient's condition?

537
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,360
His pneumothorax is taken care of
and the haemorrhage is under control.

538
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,240
-Move him quickly to the hospital.
-Okay.

539
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,300
-Move quickly.
-He will survive.

540
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,030
Crazy Dog should've seen me then.

541
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,030
He should have witnessed
how Oh Yeon-joo did it successfully.

542
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,810
Does this mean
that I'm great at real cases?

543
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,320
Am I a natural-born doctor?

544
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,360
-Thank you.
-Hello.

545
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,400
I'm the manager of this hotel,
Park Ho-young.

546
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,030
I see. Hello.

547
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,150
They say he might have died
if the treatment had been late.

548
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,570
It would be terrible
if a murder had been committed here.

549
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,700
It's all thanks to you.
Thank you so much.

550
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,030
Don't mention it.

551
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,400
I just carried out my duty
as a medical doctor.

552
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,030
What amazing coincidence
that a doctor happened to find him.

553
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,900
He is extremely lucky.

554
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,990
By the way, I guess you need to give
testimony when the police arrive.

555
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,650
Sure, I will.

556
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,900
-May I ask your name?
-I am...

557
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,990
-It's a bit crumpled.
-It's okay.

558
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,900
I'm Oh Yeon-joo from
Myungsei University Medical Centre.

559
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,200
-Are you staying at our hotel?
-No, I'm not.

560
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,860
Then what brought you to the rooftop?

561
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,650
Pardon me?

562
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,990
Doctor?

563
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,740
I asked how you came up here.

564
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,740
-Yes. But the thing is, I...
-Sir!

565
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,320
That's President Kang Chul.

566
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,400
-What?
-That's President Kang Chul.

567
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,570
I didn't recognise him
because of all the blood.

568
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,900
What should we do?

569
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,360
What do you mean it's Kang Chul?

570
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,530
What the...

571
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,650
My gosh.

572
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,150
What on earth happened?

573
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,360
-Call the secretary's office.
-Pardon?

574
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,030
-Hurry up!
-Yes, sir.

575
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,400
-President Kang, are you okay?
-What is going on?

576
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,150
Who is Kang Chul?

577
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,110
Kang Chul is Dad's webtoon's lead character.

578
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,530
Maybe he's a celebrity.

579
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,030
Right.
There is a singer named Kang Chul.

580
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,450
Wait a second. That's Kang-ta.

581
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,360
-No, that doesn't make any sense.
-No. Don't try to speak!

582
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,650
We've called the company.

583
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,360
I'm so sorry.
We should've escorted you.

584
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,610
We tried our best to guard you.

585
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,030
Can't you hurry up? Be careful.

586
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:55,360
President, don't worry about a thing.
Just try to be calm.

587
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,320
Be careful.

588
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,360
Don't worry about a thing.

589
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,240
Hurry up, please.

590
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,110
We'll take care of everything.

591
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,650
Gently. Please be careful.

592
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,860
Hey, watch out.

593
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,840
What is that?

594
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,780
To be continued

595
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,280
What is happening?

596
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,320
What is that now?

597
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,120
To be continued

598
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,400
What if...

599
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,990
-What are you doing, Yeon-joo?
-My gosh. Hey.

600
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,780
-Goodness.
-Why are you so startled?

601
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,200
What...
What happened to me?

602
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,570
What do you mean?

603
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,030
Didn't I disappear for a long time?

604
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,740
You disappeared? When?

605
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,570
I mean I was in the room by myself
and you went out to call the police.

606
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,610
Yeon-joo.

607
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,860
I didn't call the police.

608
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,490
Mr Oh is...

609
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,990
...just fine!

610
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,320
What?

611
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,030
He met the deadline.

612
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,030
I don't know where he is,
but he sent the cartoon just now.

613
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,570
He also kept Chul alive.

614
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,400
You were right.

615
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,900
He only went out to clear his head

616
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,610
because it was hard to decide
whether he should kill Chul or not.

617
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,490
I was a fool to call you.

618
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,320
-He really sent it. I'll show you.
-Where is he?

619
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,950
I haven't heard from him, but he'll
be here soon since he finished it.

620
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,950
Come out now. Guys!

621
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,860
Yeon-joo.

622
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,450
Gosh, Yeon-joo. Hurry up.

623
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,150
Hurry out.

624
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,610
Gosh. Come on.

625
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,400
Have a seat.

626
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,490
Go ahead.

627
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,650
Yeon-joo.

628
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,610
Our Chul is still alive! Cheers.

629
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,360
This isn't the final episode either.
I guess he will run it a bit longer.

630
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,950
Isn't that great?

631
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:24,700
-Gosh. I suddenly feel...
-Don't you feel hungry?

632
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,570
Let's order jjajangmyeon.
Shall we have tangsuyuk, too?

633
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,200
You're unbelievable.
Just eat this. Goodness.

634
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,650
Collapse

635
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,490
Approaching

636
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,990
Excuse me? Please wake up.
Can you hear me?

637
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,070
Excuse me? Please wake up.
Can you hear me?

638
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,650
Please call the ambulance.

639
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:04,060
Please call the ambulance.
There is someone dying on the rooftop.

640
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,400
Running up

641
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:12,950
Oh, gosh.

642
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,200
Flinch

643
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,400
What is this?

644
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,070
Is he seriously hurt? Who is he?

645
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,500
Press

646
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,740
Reach out

647
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,820
Raising

648
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,240
Stab

649
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,450
I can't believe this.

650
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,950
He drew a new character.
It's a female doctor.

651
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,570
She has the same name as you.

652
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,610
Bustling

653
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,240
Lifting

654
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,110
This can't be true.

655
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,990
This is...

656
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,240
This is me.

657
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,110
The lead character is Kang Chul.

658
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:39,200
He was born in Seoul in 1987.

659
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:46,780
He is a co-representative
of an e-commerce company, JN Global.

660
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,860
JN Global's aggregate market price
is 1.5 billion dollars.

661
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,200
He's a multimillionaire whose assets
are worth 800 million dollars.

662
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,700
The story begins 12 years ago

663
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:06,780
when the young Kang Chul wins
a gold medal in the Olympics.

664
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,570
-It's 10.9 points!
-It's 10.9!

665
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,280
Handsome, talented and hard-working,

666
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,150
he becomes a national star.

667
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,200
-He won a gold medal!
-Kang Chul!

668
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:27,450
But his entire family is murdered
and his life spirals into a bottomless pit.

669
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:32,040
-He is arrested as the prime suspect.
-You shot everyone to death.

670
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:38,400
Problem rises as no other suspects
except for Chul appear.

671
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,870
I strongly request that he be given
the death penalty.

672
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:45,570
You crazy jerk.

673
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,700
How is this your conclusion?

674
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,360
Chul is sentenced to death
at the first trial

675
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:07,030
and life imprisonment
at the second trial.

676
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:11,490
Eventually, the Supreme Court finds him
not guilty due to lack of evidence.

677
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,900
We acquit him of murder.

678
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,010
However, his hardship doesn't end
despite avoiding the death penalty.

679
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,320
Chul comes home after
a year of imprisonment.

680
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,950
But he cannot accept the reality
where his family isn't around anymore.

681
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,280
Isn't he the one?

682
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,820
It's 4 dollars.

683
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,360
He's so thick-skinned.

684
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,490
-Isn't he Kang Chul?
-No way.

685
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,900
I think it's him.

686
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:39,860
-No way.
-Come here.

687
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,360
It's Kang Chul.

688
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,360
He cannot stand how people
still look at him with contempt,

689
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:47,700
thinking that he's the murderer.

690
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,400
After a year of living as an outcast,

691
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:15,490
he decides to take his own life.

692
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:29,280
In his short life, he's never imagined
he would end his life like this.

693
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,820
He feels mad

694
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,860
and also empty.

695
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,400
In that last moment,

696
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,360
one thought suddenly came to his mind.

697
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,030
Turnabout victory.

698
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:42,490
Kang Chul chooses to fight
instead of killing himself.

699
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:47,450
He cannot get his life back
until he catches the real murderer.

700
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:53,280
Thus, he vows to catch the murderer.

701
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,110
He vows to catch him before he dies.

702
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:45,360
The hospital stated that Mr Kang Chul
underwent two surgeries

703
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:47,780
and is now in a stable condition.

704
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:52,860
The hospital is crowded
with citizens worried about him.

705
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:56,400
The police are looking
into the suspect who attacked him.

706
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:00,070
However, they don't have
any clear evidence yet.

707
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,030
According to the hotel manager's testimony,

708
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:04,740
the witness claimed to be a doctor.

709
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,860
But her identity hasn't been confirmed.

710
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,610
Police announced that they will
do their best to find the witness

711
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,570
and arrest the suspect.

712
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,240
-Did you find her?
-No.

713
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,240
They searched the entire area,
but she's still missing.

714
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,530
Even the surveillance cameras
didn't get anything.

715
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,070
-No records?
-No.

716
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,070
That woman is a little strange.

717
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,240
She told the manager she'd testify.

718
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,070
Ms Oh Yeon-joo?

719
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,740
What? She's not here.

720
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,570
Where did she go?

721
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,740
She was gone when the police arrived.

722
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:43,450
She claimed to be a doctor from
Myungsei University Medical Centre.

723
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:44,990
Where is that?

724
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,570
There is no such hospital in Korea.

725
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,820
So she was pretending to be a doctor.

726
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,280
Look at this.

727
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,500
Cardiothoracic surgery resident,
Oh Yeon-joo

728
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,530
"Cardiothoracic surgery resident,
Oh Yeon-joo."

729
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:03,740
She even made a business card.

730
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,360
But the mobile number
and the e-mail address are fake.

731
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:10,740
The police are suspecting
this woman as the accomplice.

732
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,090
I don't think that's right.

733
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:19,820
No, she's not.

734
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,740
How do you know?
You don't remember anything.

735
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,780
My instinct says so.

736
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,700
Anyway, we have to find her.

737
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:34,000
I think this girl holds
the key to my life.

738
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,610
The key to your life?

739
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,200
My goodness, that's just too cheesy.

740
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,320
Look for her.

741
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,650
They're making an identikit picture.

742
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,320
According to the paramedics,

743
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,200
she's quite beautiful.

744
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,400
-No, she's not at all.
-They said she is beautiful.

745
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,570
If she's beautiful,
everyone is beautiful.

746
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:02,990
Yet she's the key to your life?

747
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:05,240
I didn't say that because
she's beautiful.

748
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,530
I thought you fell in love
at first sight.

749
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,400
What do you think of me?

750
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,860
The playboy of the century.

751
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:15,780
Have you seen a secretary
who says such a rude thing to her boss?

752
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,450
Have you seen one?

753
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,570
-No.
-Right.

754
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,390
Then how can a strange girl
become the key to your life?

755
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,070
My reason to exist.

756
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,860
I think she has the key to find
the reason of my existence.

757
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,450
Do you understand now?

758
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,400
This is frustrating.

759
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,240
I can tell you the reason
of your existence, too.

760
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,200
Listen. It's simple.

761
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,320
Your parents loved each other,
and a sperm and an egg...

762
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,110
Don't make her sketch beautiful.

763
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,950
I won't be able to find her, then.

764
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,570
And speak casually
only when we are alone.

765
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:51,530
Okay.

766
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:55,950
Okay, sir.

767
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:57,990
I will tell the police
exactly what you said.

768
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:00,450
The woman who's the key of your life...

769
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,070
...is not beautiful at all.

770
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:15,780
She just sulked again, didn't she?

771
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,400
Calling her the key of your life
is a little too much.

772
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,150
She must be very beautiful.

773
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,490
She's not beautiful.

774
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,200
Oh, seriously.

775
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,820
Oh Yeon-joo.

776
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,210
Cardiothoracic surgery resident,
Oh Yeon-joo

777
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:36,900
Oh Yeon-joo.

778
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,110
Where are you right now?

779
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,220
Oh Yeon-joo.
Where are you right now?

780
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,450
Where is she?

781
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,740
There you are.

782
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:01,240
I understand that your father
loves you very much.

783
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,650
I understand.

784
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:05,860
But how can he make
you a cartoon character?

785
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:08,320
How can a reader like me read it?

786
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:11,650
-Did you see it? Look.
-Gosh!

787
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,240
Did you see this?

788
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,030
Look. "Cardiothoracic surgery of
Myungsei University Medical Centre."

789
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,740
He's making it so obvious
that she's his daughter.

790
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:23,990
How can I concentrate when a scammer
like you save Kang Chul?

791
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,280
And what? Oh Yeon-joo is beautiful?

792
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,150
This is crazy.

793
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,780
At that very moment,

794
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,490
I realised that I have
an aggressive side in me.

795
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:36,900
I realised that I can wish
to kill people instead of saving them.

796
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,280
Dr Park, let's talk later.

797
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,650
This is not what I wanted.

798
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,280
You asked your father to do this,
didn't you?

799
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,700
Instead of bringing me a spoiler,

800
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,150
you ruined a great work
by putting you in the story!

801
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,070
-Can you please step out?
-What did you say?

802
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,110
-This is not a good time.
-What are you doing?

803
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,280
-Please go out.
-Are you mad?

804
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,240
-Please.
-Are you touching me?

805
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,650
-You're touching and pushing me.
-Please get out!

806
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,360
You startled me!

807
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:08,400
What happened, Dr Park?

808
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:10,110
Did you see that?

809
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,030
She's making me go crazy.

810
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,360
Come out!

811
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,860
What happened?

812
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,780
What's happening? Think, Yeon-joo.

813
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,610
Get your senses back!

814
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,570
-Hello, Yeon-joo?
-Soo-bong.

815
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,610
You saw it, right?
Kang Chul is looking for me.

816
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,700
This is absurd.
He is looking for me.

817
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,820
That's right.
He is looking for you.

818
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,610
He has my business card
and is trying to find me.

819
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,820
That's the business card I gave to...

820
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,900
...the manager at the hotel.
It's my actual business card.

821
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:58,320
It says, "Myungsei University
Medical Centre, Oh Yeon-joo."

822
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,030
That's right. "Myungsei University
Medical Centre, Oh Yeon-joo."

823
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:05,030
This storyline looks
a bit strange to me, too.

824
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,070
He's suddenly focusing on a new character.

825
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:11,450
Where can he be drawing this?
I can't still reach him.

826
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:14,450
He's not the one drawing this.

827
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,360
Who else, then?

828
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:19,530
It's taken a life of its own
when Kang Chul survived.

829
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:25,150
Listen. He was supposed to die,
but he didn't.

830
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,570
So now, it's making its own story.

831
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,030
What on earth are you talking about?

832
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,950
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

833
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,820
I know. I don't understand
what I'm saying either.

834
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,450
I sound like a crazy person.

835
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:41,240
Kang Chul is alive.
He's alive and looking for me.

836
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:45,030
A different world exists in W.
The world where Kang Chul lives.

837
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,740
Yeon-joo, calm yourself.

838
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:51,700
-I don't get what you're...
-I know I'm right!

839
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:56,900
Goodness.

840
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,450
Oh Yeon-joo.
Where are you right now?

841
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:13,950
Why are you looking for me?
What do you want from me?

842
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,700
Oh Yeon-joo.
Where are you right now?

843
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,990
Why?

844
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,280
How am I the key to your life?

845
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:27,450
Oh Yeon-joo.
Where are you right now?

846
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,700
W – Two Worlds

847
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,400
You know about this, don't you?

848
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:15,700
You didn't draw the scene
where I save Chul, did you?

849
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:17,990
He's a monster.

850
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:19,860
That's why I decided to judge him.

851
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:21,240
Do a research on poison.

852
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,740
Are you trying to kill Chul again?

853
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:26,860
No, that's murder!

854
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:29,450
We finally meet, Yeon-joo.

855
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,740
This is getting interesting.
I'll see you again.

856
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:35,030
-Yeon-joo.
-Did you get well already?

857
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:37,990
What do you mean already?
I was sick in bed for two months.

858
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,740
Did he say it's been two months?

859
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:40,990
This is a serial webtoon.

860
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,900
Does that mean there should be
something to end the episode?

861
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,490
An incident! What kind of incident?

862
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,320
I was right about her.

863
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,700
She's eccentric

864
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,400
and crazy.

865
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:54,280
I finally found it.
The key to my life.

866
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:56,280
The editor said they already
received the copy.

867
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,950
-What is this?
-Take it down now!

868
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:02,770
That's why I have to take his life right now.
