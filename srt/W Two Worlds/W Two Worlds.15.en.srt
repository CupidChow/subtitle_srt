1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,430
W-Two Worlds

2
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,640
Kang Chul kills Han Sang-hoon
who shot Oh Yeon-joo,

3
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,850
but she ends up dying.

4
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,680
Let go!

5
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,730
I shot Yeon-joo.

6
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,680
We can save her with your drawing.

7
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,680
Just before Yeon-joo dies,

8
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,520
Chul sends Yeon-joo
to the world of "W".

9
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
To be continued

10
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,060
Using the tablet
in Han Cheol-ho's possession,

11
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,640
Chul tries to save Yeon-joo
who became a cartoon character.

12
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,850
I summon Han Cheol-ho
to the real world.

13
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,220
Hey!

14
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,220
He summons Cheol-ho
to the real world,

15
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,560
gets the tablet back
and saves Yeon-joo.

16
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,270
But as the final episode of "W" begins,

17
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,560
the three of them are summoned
into the world of "W".

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,470
Episode 15

19
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,470
You weren't there for sure.

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,600
But you suddenly appeared
and collapsed on the floor.

21
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,470
I don't understand what happened.

22
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,890
And Chul...

23
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,640
...ran away.

24
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,890
-What?
-I don't really get them.

25
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,810
They said he just disappeared.

26
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,560
Hey, hold on.

27
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,100
Shouldn't we call the ambulance?
Tell the boss.

28
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,430
Okay.

29
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,100
-Taxi.
-What?

30
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,980
Call me a taxi.

31
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,270
I need to go to a hotel.

32
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,470
You should go to the hospital now.

33
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,350
Boss, he doesn't want me
to call the ambulance.

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,890
Shouldn't we report him?

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,560
What?

36
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,140
Where is he?

37
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,980
Taxi.

38
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,560
Is the taxi here?

39
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,680
Final episode

40
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,180
Look who's here!

41
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,470
I thought I'd never see you again.

42
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,350
"W" by Oh Seong-moo,
Episode 398

43
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,060
Yeon-joo!

44
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,060
-Where are you going, sir?
-Miracle Hotel.

45
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,270
Get in.

46
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,730
Final episode

47
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,730
Final episode

48
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,520
May I help you?

49
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,060
What date is today?

50
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,730
-It's August 15th.
-It's August?

51
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,060
-It used to be September.
-Sorry?

52
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,850
No way.

53
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,220
Is it 2017?

54
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,060
Yes.

55
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,640
Excuse me.

56
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,180
-You are Yoon So-hee.
-Yes.

57
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,350
-Who are you?
-Can we talk for a while?

58
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,600
-You go ahead.
-Okay, see you.

59
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,890
You look familiar.

60
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,470
Who are you?

61
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,560
I am Oh Yeon-joo.

62
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,310
Aren't you that girl? You were
with Mr Kang when he was on the run.

63
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,140
I will contact Mr Kang's office.

64
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,850
They were looking for you,
so they will probably help you.

65
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,980
I don't work there anymore.

66
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,640
-Why not?
-I quit last year.

67
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,310
Please hold. The number changed.

68
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,850
What is...

69
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,930
Mr Kang doing right now?

70
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,810
You haven't heard?

71
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,680
I was abroad for a year.

72
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,100
The police caught him last September.

73
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,850
Hello, Boss.

74
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,560
He looked like he'd really die soon,
so I left him alone.

75
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,430
-Leave him in front of a hospital.
-We're releasing him?

76
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,270
If he's still not confessing it,
there must be nothing to confess.

77
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,180
The fact that he fabricated his death
should be known for me to benefit.

78
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,180
Lunatic punk.

79
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,560
Emergency Medical Centre

80
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,060
Bring a stretcher out.

81
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,220
He was dumped at a hospital
and got arrested right away.

82
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,810
It was discovered that
he faked his death.

83
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,680
Ever since then,
he's been staying in jail.

84
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,930
He's been in jail for a year?

85
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,310
He was charged with murder.

86
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,100
Murder, escaping authorities,
fabricating evidences...

87
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,430
and forging official documents.

88
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,180
Court

89
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,640
The verdict will be given tomorrow
in the Court of Appeals.

90
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,220
It will be at Seoul High Court.

91
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,770
You can go there tomorrow
if you want to meet him.

92
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,680
Aren't you going, Ms Yoon?

93
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,350
I'm on my way to the airport now.
I'm going to the US.

94
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,470
I sincerely hope
everything will turn out well.

95
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,220
Please say hi to him for me.

96
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,470
Court

97
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,850
In the first trial held in March,
he received a death sentence.

98
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,100
Verdict for the appeal
will be given today.

99
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
I will summarise the facts.

100
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,180
Before the crimes were committed,
the defendant looked for ways...

101
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,270
to kill the victim and flee.

102
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,220
After the crime,

103
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,810
he took the victim's phone as planned,

104
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,640
threatened the police with a gun...

105
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,270
and ran away using his own car.

106
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,850
The majority of things he bought
during the flight...

107
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,520
-was for his survival.
-Ms Yeon-joo!

108
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,270
Defendant.

109
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,060
Are you listening?

110
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,600
The brutality and cruelness of
the crimes you have committed...

111
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,980
-are against healthy social...
-What happened?

112
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,770
Did you really come back to life?

113
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,810
You suddenly opened your eyes
and disappeared back then.

114
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,770
I was dumbfounded.

115
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,730
It is a crime against humanity.

116
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,850
His relationship with the victim,

117
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,220
his motive, the means,
the result of the crime,

118
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,220
the circumstances after the crime...

119
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,100
and everything else on the report show...

120
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,220
that the original verdict...

121
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,730
to sentence him to death
is a reasonable judgement.

122
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,560
We dismiss the appeal.

123
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,890
You can't go in.

124
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,850
I'm sorry. Please give us a moment.

125
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,350
What took you so long?

126
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,930
I came right away, but a year has passed.

127
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,890
Right away?

128
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,270
I came here right after I woke up.

129
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,430
That's unfair.

130
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,220
I've been worried sick by myself
for a year.

131
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,430
"Why won't she come? Do-yoon says
he saw her opening her eyes."

132
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,470
"Did she change her mind
and start seeing someone else?"

133
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,180
I kept thinking things like that.

134
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,770
"Did she see the cartoon
and decide not to come..."

135
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,470
"because I'm on death row?"

136
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,350
You married a millionaire,
but he became penniless...

137
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,350
and is even a condemned criminal now.

138
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,980
I understand how you must feel.

139
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
How can you be joking right now?

140
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,600
You need to go.

141
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,350
Just a moment, please.
I haven't seen my wife for a year.

142
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,680
Just a moment more.

143
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,560
Why didn't you go out to the real world?

144
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,220
I couldn't.

145
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,180
I am...

146
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,890
...going back.

147
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,180
I am...

148
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,730
...going back.

149
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,220
Emergency Medical Centre

150
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,430
I tried to go back for the whole year.

151
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,680
I couldn't. I can't get out of here.

152
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,180
Why all of a sudden?

153
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,060
Maybe because this is the final episode.

154
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,270
You should go now.

155
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,600
You know what?

156
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,770
This is the final episode of "W".

157
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,430
You should come with me.

158
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,220
The trials aren't over yet.

159
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,770
We should keep ourselves together
for the next one.

160
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,220
He said...

161
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,470
that's when...

162
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,980
he had this thought.

163
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,310
He was so tired,

164
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,850
he just wanted "W" to end.

165
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,810
He thought...

166
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,350
he wanted to quit
being this cartoon's lead character.

167
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,350
And that's when...

168
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,220
Final episode

169
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,810
...the final episode really begun.

170
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,730
Until this final episode ends,

171
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,980
we can't get out of here.

172
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,850
We'll only be free...

173
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,980
once it ends.

174
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,730
Whether it's a happy ending...

175
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,810
or a sad ending.

176
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,980
Let's go to the penthouse.

177
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,850
Chul said you'd be back
and told me to keep it vacant.

178
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,270
Are you telling me to stay alone
in that big place? No way.

179
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,810
All I need is just a room.

180
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,350
That makes us hard to guard you.

181
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,060
Just stay in the penthouse.

182
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,430
Hello?

183
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,640
We're on our way now.

184
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,220
What?

185
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,770
Mr Kang did what?

186
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,270
Gosh, Soo-min.
You're great at drawing.

187
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,060
Soo-min, who is this?

188
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,100
-It's you.
-Oh, my. Is this me?

189
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,770
You drew me so handsomely.

190
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,350
Gosh, Soo-min. You're adorable.

191
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,730
Am I really this handsome?

192
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,930
Mr Han, please look here.

193
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,770
After winning Changmin Party's election
to be presidential candidate,

194
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,560
Mr Han Cheol-ho started his campaign...

195
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,600
by visiting a kindergarten and
spending time with the children today.

196
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,310
The trust that he gained from
the citizens is expected...

197
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,220
to positively affect the election
for him.

198
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,930
How beautiful.

199
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,730
Kids these days are so tiresome.

200
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,430
Don't their parents discipline them
at home?

201
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,930
How did it go?
Did he get a death penalty?

202
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,310
What? He escaped?

203
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,640
How could he run away?

204
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,600
He removed the handcuffs and had a gun.

205
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,470
Just how did he remove the handcuffs?
He's such a punk.

206
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,310
I'm not even surprised anymore.
Trouble is his middle name after all.

207
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,470
We should go back to the court.

208
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,680
Please drop me off somewhere.

209
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,560
Going with you may be more dangerous.

210
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,350
If he calls you, tell him that I'm here.

211
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,270
Let me ask you one thing.

212
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,100
Chul told me,

213
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
but I couldn't believe it.

214
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,350
He said there is another world
just like this one.

215
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,220
And that you are from that world.

216
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,180
Is this true?

217
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Yes.

218
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,430
I see.

219
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,350
He removed the handcuffs
and ran away with a gun.

220
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,600
He didn't take it from the officers.

221
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,930
By the way, sir,
you know Oh Yeon-joo, right?

222
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,470
She showed up.

223
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,600
I know for sure that Chul's wife died
in the penthouse back then.

224
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,430
I'm sure of it.

225
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,270
But she's with Chul's friend right now.

226
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,100
Chul disappeared...

227
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,350
and Yeon-joo showed up alive and well.

228
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,600
Does that mean Chul has the tablet now?

229
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,310
Pentotal Sodium

230
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,890
Now you know how to be
the heroine of a thriller.

231
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,600
What took you so long?
I thought you got caught.

232
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,850
-I had to meet someone.
-What's wrong with you?

233
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,350
Why did you run away?

234
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,270
How can it be a happy ending
if you keep committing crimes?

235
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,980
How many criminal records
do you have now?

236
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,600
The happy ending we planned
already failed when I got caught,

237
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,220
which makes us unable to
punish Han Cheol-ho by law.

238
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,470
So what do we do now?

239
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,100
We should plan another happy ending.

240
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Wait.

241
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,470
Let me see your face.

242
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,060
What?

243
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,060
It's not the face I remember.

244
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,220
Excuse me?

245
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,220
Maybe I forgot because it's been so long.

246
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,430
You were so beautiful in my imagination
during my time in prison.

247
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,100
I was wrong.
You're just a little pretty.

248
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,640
You...

249
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,730
have aged a bit.

250
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,890
You look old now
after ageing a year by yourself.

251
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,470
I'm serious.

252
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,350
That hurts.

253
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,730
Talk to me politely, then.

254
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,470
-What?
-I'm a year older than you.

255
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,220
Go ahead and try it.

256
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,100
-Goodness.
-"Goodness"?

257
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,600
You're very rude.

258
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,640
-What happened to you?
-What?

259
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,730
Dad drew the gun
and handcuffs, didn't he?

260
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,180
That's right.
He also drew this car and my clothes.

261
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,560
What is he thinking?

262
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,310
Why did he want you to run away?

263
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,100
Let's go to see your father.

264
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,180
-What?
-He also got dragged in here...

265
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,640
a year ago.

266
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,350
39-5 Jinmyeok-ri, Gwangchon-eup,
Paju, Gyeonggi-do

267
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,220
Kim Jong-soo

268
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,220
Hello?

269
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
Mr...

270
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,220
Mr Oh?

271
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,980
You're here.

272
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,560
What happened?

273
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,730
Why are you here?

274
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,680
How long have you been here?

275
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,220
A year.

276
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,430
It's been a year since I got
dragged into this world.

277
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,600
Who tied you up?

278
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,930
I did.

279
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,430
I tied myself up.

280
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,640
Why?

281
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,850
I didn't...

282
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,220
...see Yeon-joo.

283
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,560
I couldn't even check...

284
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,180
if Yeon-joo is alive
before coming in here.

285
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,430
She's alive.

286
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,060
She's alive.
I was with her just now.

287
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,730
She's alive?

288
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,470
Is she really alive?

289
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,140
She is. She's healthy.

290
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,100
I didn't come with her as precaution.

291
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,810
She's alive?

292
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,520
I thought she died.

293
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,980
I didn't know.

294
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,890
I was just stuck in here.

295
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,470
What happened to you?

296
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,350
Why didn't you call?
You should've called my company.

297
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,600
Why is that tablet here?

298
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,520
I was locked up.

299
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,020
Where to, sir?

300
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,980
Seoul Prime Hotel, please.

301
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,520
Okay.

302
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,060
By the way, you look so much like him.

303
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,770
No offence, but you look like
Han Sang-hoon.

304
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,810
You know, the criminal who died?

305
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,430
My goodness.

306
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,350
Help me!

307
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,310
Help me!

308
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,930
-What happened?
-That man tried to kill me.

309
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,770
He suddenly strangled me.

310
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,470
Your name and phone number, please.

311
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,270
-I'm Oh Seong-moo.
-Oh Seong-moo.

312
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,770
What's your phone number?

313
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,600
-Kang Chul.
-Did you say Kang Chul?

314
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,470
-Please let me call him.
-Are you talking about...

315
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,600
the late President Kang Chul?

316
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,850
Do they think he died?

317
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,060
Sir, don't you have a family?

318
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,810
-What?
-Give it to me, you punk.

319
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,220
You don't even know how to shoot.
Let me shoot that.

320
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,890
-Grab him.
-Give it to me.

321
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,770
Hey! Get off me.

322
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,220
Get off me, punks!
I'll kill you all.

323
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,680
Do you know who I am?

324
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,310
I'm Han Sang-hoon, you jerks!

325
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,640
Let go of me!

326
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,850
Get off me. Let me go!

327
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,270
They sent me...

328
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,220
You jerks!

329
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,180
...to a mental hospital
as I have no family here.

330
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,640
Do you know what happened to
my dear Yeon-joo?

331
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,770
I killed my Yeon-joo.

332
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,270
Please save her.

333
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,100
She must be alive. Don't worry.

334
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,560
She's alive?

335
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,060
Of course she is.

336
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,220
-Why is she alive?
-What are you doing?

337
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,810
I killed her. Why is she alive?

338
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,100
-I put a hole in her head.
-Is anybody out there? Help!

339
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,470
-It's my purpose to kill her.
-Let me go! Help me!

340
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,220
Oh Yeon-joo! I'll kill her.

341
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,730
I'll kill her.

342
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,890
I'll kill Oh Yeon-joo.

343
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,560
I'll kill her.

344
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,430
Untie this.

345
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,730
Hey! Untie this, you punks.

346
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,270
Can't you hear me? Untie this!

347
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,430
Yeon-joo.

348
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,060
Yeon-joo.

349
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,680
The killer died, so he got his body back.

350
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,850
But the killer's memories remained.

351
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,350
And it became worse here.

352
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,180
He can't bear it because
he remembers things from both worlds.

353
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,890
He's in a terrible shape.

354
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,100
I'm telling you this because
I'm afraid you'll be shocked.

355
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,060
What happened?

356
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,810
-Wake up! Are you okay?
-Where did the patient go?

357
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,470
He escaped from the mental hospital
this morning.

358
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,470
He went to find the tablet.

359
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,850
Mr Oh, I will go find Chul.

360
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,980
Okay.

361
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,680
What are you drawing?

362
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,180
I can't help feeling anxious.

363
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,890
Okay.

364
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,890
He was worried it was a replica.

365
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,600
He was afraid that it might be
disposable or that it'll disappear.

366
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,430
So he drew one more
and hid it in the cartoon.

367
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,220
Just like the killer had done.

368
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,600
It took a year to come and get that.

369
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,430
When he got out, he saw the news
about it being the day of my trial...

370
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,350
and got the handcuffs off me.

371
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,220
Where...

372
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,850
...is he now?

373
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,680
He's in his hideout.

374
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,680
In one of the previous episodes,
he drew his studio owner-less...

375
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,520
as a hideout.

376
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,770
Dad.

377
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,060
Dad.

378
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,470
Dad.

379
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,640
Dad!

380
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,100
Why did you tie him?

381
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,270
He asked me to tie him.

382
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,770
He said he couldn't control himself.

383
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,180
Dad.

384
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,850
Dad.

385
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,600
Dad.

386
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,560
Who is it?

387
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,430
Are you Yeon-joo?

388
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,470
It's me, Dad.

389
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,060
-You're alive?
-I am alive.

390
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,770
You were alive?

391
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,560
I am alive, Dad. I'm fine.

392
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,980
What happened to you, Dad?

393
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,310
What should we do with you, Dad?

394
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,350
How can you say that?

395
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,600
I can't do it.

396
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,600
Do as I say.

397
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,680
I can't.

398
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,350
Please do as I say.

399
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,470
That can never happen.

400
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,470
I will pretend I didn't hear it.

401
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,600
How is he?

402
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,180
He seems better.

403
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,560
I cooked some porridge.
Can you eat, Dad?

404
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,220
He fell asleep.

405
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,100
Have a seat. I will prepare dinner.

406
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,310
Dinner?

407
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,890
We should eat.
We didn't even have lunch.

408
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,730
Let's eat.

409
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,600
This is surprising.

410
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,350
-What is?
-I'd never had your food before.

411
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,680
It's pretty good.

412
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,060
-Really?
-Yes.

413
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,470
Considering that you are a busy doctor,
this is really good.

414
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,310
You don't mean it, do you?

415
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,270
You're just trying to make me
feel better.

416
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,310
It's half and half.

417
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,930
Gosh.

418
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,270
-Do more.
-Do what?

419
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,220
Either compliment me or comfort me.

420
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,930
It's nice to hear it
from a particular person like you.

421
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,220
Okay, a compliment.

422
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,180
Is there nothing to compliment me on?

423
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,680
I am thinking.

424
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,060
Your hair is long.

425
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,180
Your skin is fair.

426
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,470
Is that a compliment?

427
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,600
You are pretty tall.

428
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,810
Is your nose high?

429
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,980
Those are not compliments.
You're describing facts.

430
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,220
Your ears are at the right place.

431
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,770
Gosh, this is no easy task.

432
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,020
Gosh.

433
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,220
So be polite to me,
then I will praise you.

434
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,220
Are you so proud
that you're a year older than me?

435
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,180
Yes, I'm very proud of myself.

436
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,680
Why do I feel so proud?

437
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,220
I am 31 years old, Yeon-joo.
You are only 30.

438
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,430
Do you understand?

439
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,770
It's nice to see you smile.

440
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,180
It's been a year.
Please smile more often.

441
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,350
What did you talk about with Dad earlier?

442
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,430
I mean when I was cooking.

443
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,680
I have nothing to say.

444
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,560
You don't want to tell me?

445
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,730
I'll do the dishes after we eat.

446
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,220
Anyhow,

447
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,100
you and I...

448
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,220
can't go together.

449
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:43,850
What?

450
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,350
If you have a happy ending,

451
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,100
I will have a sad ending.

452
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,980
And if mine is happy, yours will be sad.

453
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,600
Look at my hand.

454
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,640
It looks fine, doesn't it?

455
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,180
Do you know why it looks so fine?

456
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,980
I killed a person.

457
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,810
This morning.

458
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:33,060
I killed a nurse and escaped.

459
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,600
That's why it looks okay.

460
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,430
Do you get it now?

461
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,640
Now...

462
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,770
I can't go back to who I was before.

463
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:52,350
I cease to exist
when I stop doing bad things.

464
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,140
Even if I go back,

465
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,560
I can't live.

466
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,310
I am too sinful.

467
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,100
I killed tens of people with these hands.

468
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,180
Even when I didn't remember things,

469
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,680
I still killed her with my hands.

470
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,680
This morning.

471
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,310
I won't...

472
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,310
leave this world.

473
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,560
I can't get out.

474
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,980
How can I...

475
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,600
live the rest of my life...

476
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,310
looking at Yeon-joo's face?

477
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:03,640
My life is already over.

478
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,680
It ended a year ago.

479
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,020
Before it ends with a happy ending,

480
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,730
please let me die here.

481
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,140
I beg you.

482
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,640
Please...

483
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,930
bury me in the cartoon.

484
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,810
Why would you say that?

485
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,850
I can't do it.

486
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,730
Do as I say.

487
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:51,930
I can't.

488
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,600
Just do as I say.

489
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,180
Hello, sir.

490
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,770
Where is Chul?

491
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,180
It seems like he really doesn't know.
He doesn't react to any of the drugs.

492
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,470
Where is Yeon-joo?

493
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,180
Bring the phone.

494
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,430
How do you contact Chul?

495
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,100
Chul, don't we still have
things to talk about?

496
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,980
Call Seo Do-yoon. Right away.

497
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,220
-Are you going somewhere?
-I need to make a phone call.

498
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,220
It's dangerous if my location
is tracked. Keep the door locked.

499
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,890
-Hello?
-Do-yoon?

500
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,220
Where are you?

501
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,060
Hello?

502
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,560
It's been a long time.

503
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,560
What are you doing?

504
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,470
Aren't you a presidential candidate?

505
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,850
You're just a gangster who's holding
an innocent citizen captive.

506
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,600
Is Korea mad or what?

507
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,890
It's true that Korea is mad.

508
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,430
A death-row convict was able to
escape easily from the court.

509
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,850
So I got myself a hostage
in order to live.

510
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,980
I was afraid you might
inject something into my neck.

511
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,560
It's obvious that
you're going to take revenge on me.

512
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,980
I had to live, but there was no way.

513
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,310
Hey, Chul.

514
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,430
Don't do anything stupid.

515
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,020
If you do something to me,
your friend will die immediately.

516
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,100
Darn it!

517
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,680
I shouldn't have given you
to the police a year ago.

518
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,470
I let you live because I thought
you really didn't have anything.

519
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,640
So you've been keeping that thing?

520
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,310
Come here.

521
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,430
You remember where we last met, right?

522
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,980
We still have things to talk about.

523
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,270
You didn't give me any answer last time.

524
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,730
We have to start talking again.

525
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,470
About Yeon-joo, you
and Han Sang-hoon.

526
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,850
No.

527
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,730
Was his name Oh Seong-moo?

528
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,640
And that thing.

529
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,270
I'm curious about so many things.

530
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,430
Meet me at 11 PM. You have an hour.
Bring the tablet, too.

531
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:29,600
If you are late by even a minute,
you know what happens.

532
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,980
Have you seen a person like this?

533
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:45,850
He's in his 60s and was last seen
walking around in hospital gown.

534
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,220
You've never seen him?

535
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:49,220
He killed a person and escaped
from a mental hospital.

536
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,850
A nearby CCTV got him.

537
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,430
-He murdered someone?
-Yes.

538
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,980
He's dangerous. So make sure
to call us when you spot him.

539
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,430
What are you doing?

540
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,180
You're up.

541
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,270
What are you doing?

542
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,890
I'm going to draw a little
before he comes back.

543
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,930
What are you drawing?

544
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,430
I want to get out of here soon.

545
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,470
This is horrible, Dad.

546
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,730
I have to try everything
to get out of here.

547
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:52,600
There was a scene where
Cheol-ho was torturing Chul.

548
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,270
All right.

549
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:57,470
This is payback for being
such an annoyance in the past 10 years.

550
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,350
I'll draw a CCTV screen
on top of that scene.

551
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,980
I think things will be easier
if we give the video to the police.

552
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,470
We have to put Cheol-ho
behind bars first...

553
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,890
for us to have a happy ending.

554
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,350
Why are you still alive?

555
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,980
Why are you still alive?
I definitely shot you.

556
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,850
Die! Die!

557
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,270
Dad!

558
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,220
Mr Oh!

559
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,350
Mr Oh. Mr Oh!

560
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,640
Are you all right?

561
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,100
What have I done?

562
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,220
You haven't done anything.

563
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,770
What happened to your neck?

564
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,730
What did I do to you?

565
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,640
It's nothing.

566
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,640
I told you.

567
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:15,980
I'm a monster.

568
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,180
Please do as I say.

569
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:22,890
Please.

570
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,980
Dad, your hands...

571
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,470
What's wrong?

572
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:01,060
What's wrong with your hand?

573
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,180
You said you were okay
when you were in jail.

574
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:07,270
I escaped without paying for my sin,

575
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,270
and now I'm just letting my friend die.

576
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,890
Who is dying?

577
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,310
Cheol-ho kidnapped Do-yoon.

578
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,770
He's threatening me
to bring him the tablet.

579
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,640
I only have about 40 minutes left.

580
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,980
Also...

581
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,100
your father...

582
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,220
killed someone.

583
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,100
What did you say?

584
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,100
The police are on their way here.

585
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,270
They will find this house soon.

586
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,310
Have you seen this person?

587
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,560
Him? I saw him this morning
in a hospital gown.

588
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,060
Where did he go?

589
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,060
He went into that house.

590
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:04,520
I was drawing Han Cheol-ho's video.
Let's give it to the police first.

591
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,430
We can hand it in via e-mail.

592
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:10,270
Let's report where
they're keeping Do-yoon as well.

593
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:13,270
-They can catch Cheol-ho there.
-We can't do that.

594
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,560
Why not?

595
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,470
With a happy ending like that,

596
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,220
your father will cease to exist.

597
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:25,850
My happy ending is
a sad ending to the killer.

598
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:30,270
The problem is that,
whatever ending we might have,

599
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,980
either your father or I...

600
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:35,020
won't be by your side.

601
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,310
We'll either die...

602
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,390
or disappear.

603
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,600
Requesting for assistance.

604
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,470
Suspect is with someone.

605
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:57,770
Please confirm the vehicle.
The vehicle number is 28-M-4740.

606
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,270
It's 28-M-4740.

607
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:01,600
Go on.

608
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,640
Keep talking.

609
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:09,930
There are two different worlds?

610
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,470
You said another world exists.

611
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,600
That Yeon-joo is from that world.

612
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,310
That's what I heard.

613
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,220
So the place where
I saw Oh Seong-moo...

614
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,430
Darn it.

615
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,980
It's the tablet, isn't it?

616
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,810
So that was the other world.

617
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,560
I see.

618
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:39,980
All right, now I can understand.

619
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,680
I couldn't understand it before.

620
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,430
So? What's the difference between
this world and that world?

621
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,730
-Give me the report.
-This car has the same plate number...

622
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:12,430
as the car Kang Chul ran away in.
I think they're in there together.

623
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,640
What does he have to do with
a lunatic murderer?

624
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,350
We don't know that yet.

625
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,730
We're waiting for backup
since he might have a weapon.

626
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:54,980
Did I get it all?

627
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:06,060
Can we talk?

628
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:17,470
What is this?

629
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,350
There is no door.

630
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,140
There are no windows either.

631
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:22,560
What is this?

632
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,100
What now?

633
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:29,980
We can't hold out for long.

634
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,060
They'll break the wall and come in.

635
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,980
We only have 30 minutes
to save Do-yoon.

636
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,350
We need to make a decision...

637
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,980
on what kind of ending it'll be.

638
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,180
How?

639
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:58,980
What ending should it be?

640
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,810
What is this?

641
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:24,980
What are you doing?

642
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,180
Why are you taking off the rings?

643
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:32,890
What are you trying to do?

644
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,060
It's too cruel...

645
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:42,730
for a daughter to see her father die
to avoid extinction.

646
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,770
That can't happen.

647
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:50,100
I won't consider you as my family now.

648
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,560
You're free.

649
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,430
You're safe no matter how this ends.

650
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,180
You need to make a choice now.

651
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,350
What kind of ending will it be?

652
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,930
I will follow your decision.

653
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,060
Myungsei University Medical Centre

654
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,930
Why are you telling me to do it?
Do it yourself.

655
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,600
I'm so tired. I have dark circles
covering my whole face.

656
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,930
I said I don't know.

657
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,310
Just do whatever you want.

658
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:54,060
What was that about?

659
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:56,470
Gosh.

660
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:58,850
-That's right.
-What?

661
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,810
You're a fan of "W", right?

662
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:05,180
It's a webtoon, right?
I heard it ended.

663
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,430
-When?
-This morning.

664
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,520
Really?

665
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,680
-But...
-What?

666
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:10,680
The ending is...

667
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:13,430
Hey, no spoilers!
I'm going to see it myself.

668
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,890
-Don't say a word.
-I just...

669
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,270
Be quiet. Don't say it.

670
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,350
-No. That's...
-Hey.

671
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,680
I can't hear you.
I can't hear anything.

672
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:24,060
You'll be surprised to see how it ends.

673
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,350
Gosh. That jerk tried to spoil
the final episode.

674
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,930
The final episode.

675
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,220
All right.

676
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:41,890
I once hated it, but I should be
respectful for the final episode.

677
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,730
"W", let's go!

678
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,350
"W" by Oh Seong-moo
Final episode

679
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:07,980
"W" by Oh Seong-moo,
Final episode

680
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:12,140
Final episode

681
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,730
W-Two Worlds

682
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:38,350
I need both you and my dad by my side.

683
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,220
I can't imagine anything else.

684
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,140
I love you.

685
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:47,220
While I was waiting for you,
I heard something strange...

686
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,470
about two different worlds.

687
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,060
You must die for this to end, right?

688
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,770
We can all go back together.
