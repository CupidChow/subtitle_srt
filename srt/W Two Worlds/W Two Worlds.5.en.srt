1
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,480
W–Two Worlds

2
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,160
Chul's entire family is murdered

3
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,580
and Chul is falsely charged for it.

4
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,950
But eventually, he is declared innocent.

5
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,410
After 10 years,

6
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,830
he becomes a multi-millionaire
with assets worth 800 million dollars.

7
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,660
He founds W Broadcasting Station
to find his family's killer.

8
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,830
One day, he is attacked
by an unidentified man

9
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,870
and a woman showed up suddenly
to save his life.

10
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,160
Oh Yeon-joo,

11
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,620
where are you?

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,120
The woman disappears
after leaving her business card.

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,330
-Please let me in.
-No, you are not allowed.

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,450
Every time Chul's life is in danger,

15
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,160
-Yeon-joo shows up and saves him.
-Are you okay?

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,000
What do you mean by the world I live in?

17
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,040
The world inside a webtoon.

18
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,540
You are the main character
of that webtoon.

19
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,870
Chul realises that he is
just a character in a webtoon.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,250
And in that moment,

21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,790
Chul's world comes to a standstill.

22
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,580
What's going on with this?

23
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,660
Chul steps into the real world.

24
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,000
Will Chul be able to find out
who killed his family?

25
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,950
-Hey, are you crazy?
-Do you wish to die?

26
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,120
Watch where you're going!

27
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,620
-That jerk!
-What is he doing?

28
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,580
-Goodness.
-What's wrong with him?

29
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,410
-What are you doing?
-Get off the road!

30
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,120
Episode 5

31
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,120
Kang Chul, the main character

32
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,540
Yoon So-hee, Chul's friend
and personal assistant

33
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,370
Seo Do-yoon, Chul's bodyguard

34
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,500
He needs to shoot
within the 75-seconds limit.

35
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,160
-He looks really nervous.
-He needs to empty his mind.

36
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,410
-Three, two, one
-He must fire now!

37
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,790
-It's 10.9!
-It's 10.9!

38
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,250
-He scored 10.9!
-It's 10.9!

39
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,370
-Kang Chul scored 10.9!
-He turned the game around!

40
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,370
I'm home.

41
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,080
Mum?

42
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,000
Dad...

43
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,750
We already found the evidence.
You can't stay silent forever.

44
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,290
People with early success
always cause problems.

45
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,950
Tell me. Did you learn shooting
to kill your family?

46
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,580
What are you looking at?
You sick psychopath!

47
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,120
I strongly request that
he is given the death penalty.

48
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,290
You crazy jerk!

49
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,830
How is that your conclusion?

50
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,950
Former prosecutor, Han Cheol-ho

51
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,910
Former prosecutor, Han Cheol-ho
entered politics as of today

52
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,750
as he joined Changmin Party.

53
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,330
"Rebuild the social justice system
that has collapsed."

54
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,910
That is the mission
the nation has given me.

55
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,410
And I will fulfil my duty

56
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,120
for the sake of the nation.

57
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,330
-What? What are you talking about?
-Please take a look.

58
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,950
Congressman Han Cheol-ho

59
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,950
Kang Chul is the co-representative.

60
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,700
I expected him to be an alcoholic
who end up dead in some alley.

61
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,660
It looks like he continued his study
after dropping out of school.

62
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,200
He's been hiding his name
to avoid the press.

63
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,290
We confirmed that it's him after
the company was listed in share market.

64
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,580
What a crazy world!

65
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,750
He's a parricide who should be
stuck in prison forever,

66
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,750
but he's now a company representative.

67
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,540
Go.

68
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,000
Do-yoon.

69
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,410
Why do you want to learn it from me?

70
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,000
I heard you are the best.

71
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,700
-I like people who are the best.
-But why?

72
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,910
With your riches, you can hire
a bunch of bodyguards.

73
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,830
Money can't always protect you.

74
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,250
Besides, it looks like I'll be
surrounded by enemies from now on.

75
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,660
Let's do it.

76
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,750
Do I put these on?

77
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,250
-One, two.
-One, two.

78
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,750
-Good, again. One, two.
-One, two.

79
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,080
Dodge. Dodge again.

80
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,290
Dodge.

81
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,120
Go. That's right.

82
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,330
Go lower. Good.

83
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,620
You can do it. Go again.

84
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,700
-Go!
-Good.

85
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,200
That was good.

86
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,750
-You jerk!
-How dare you!

87
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,910
Come here, you punk!

88
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,410
Clean Computer Art Academy

89
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,500
-Hey!
-You punk.

90
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,950
Last night, gang leader
and wanted criminal, Park Eun-hyung

91
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,370
was arrested by the police.

92
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,950
It was revealed that the criminal
had evaded police arrest,

93
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,580
but was caught by Mr Kang Chul,
the representative of JN Global.

94
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,290
This is a video of the scene
taken by citizens.

95
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,120
Footage of President Kang Chul's
meritorious deed

96
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,950
He's just putting on a show!

97
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,830
Even so,

98
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,950
people are praising him.

99
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,700
Kang Chul is solving cases that
even the police have given up on.

100
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,370
Furthermore,

101
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,450
he's supporting the victims
with the lawsuit costs.

102
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,790
Sir, he's basically buying
the press with money.

103
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,540
He's the real criminal.
There's no doubt about it.

104
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,580
-That's why I prosecuted him.
-Mr Han.

105
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,950
You shouldn't get upset. Stay calm.

106
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,620
As Chul's popularity grows,
your support rate is dropping.

107
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,950
They are inversely related.

108
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,620
In the last two years,
the number of people who believe

109
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,450
you conducted a poorly investigated
witch-hunt against Chul

110
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,950
has increased by over 80 percent.

111
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,450
This is no time to get upset.
You must establish countermeasures.

112
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,750
You're the face of our party.

113
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,580
You should consider

114
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,040
what will happen to us

115
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,910
if Chul finds the true criminal.

116
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,950
How can he find the true criminal?

117
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,700
Kang Chul is the culprit.

118
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,330
Excuse me, sir.

119
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,370
Are you all right?

120
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,410
Business hours are already over.

121
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,410
We have to close the store.

122
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,370
Do many people

123
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,290
buy this book?

124
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,660
Pardon?

125
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,290
Is this book popular?

126
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,660
Of course. It's been
a bestseller for over five years now.

127
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,950
I see.

128
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,080
That's funny.

129
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,250
I'll bag them for you.
Please wait a moment.

130
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,330
That's not necessary.

131
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,160
I already know the story.

132
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,750
If I hear it one more time,
I might get swayed.

133
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,330
Park Soo-bong

134
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,660
Hello? What happened?

135
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,950
I called someone to fix it,
but he said there's no problem.

136
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,620
There's no problem
with the server either.

137
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,790
Is everything okay with you?

138
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,120
I'm at the hospital.

139
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,290
I just left the workroom.
I'm too scared to be there alone.

140
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,790
It felt like it was haunted.
I'll go back once Mr Oh returns.

141
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,950
All right, you do that.

142
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,950
Dr Oh, you have room three.

143
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,330
Okay.

144
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,450
Yeon-joo.

145
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,370
Did you...

146
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,410
Did you somehow get engaged?

147
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,830
Engaged?

148
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,660
Where did you hear from?

149
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,370
Someone claiming to be your fiance
came to see you.

150
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,870
My fiance? Who?

151
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,040
He didn't give his name. He just said
you'd know him as your fiance.

152
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,040
He must be confusing me
with someone else.

153
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,450
He's not your fiance, right?

154
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,660
How could I be engaged
when I'm not seeing anyone?

155
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,580
Right, that's true.

156
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,160
Is he drunk?

157
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,910
Anyway, good luck.

158
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,160
Operating Room

159
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,250
I think you might be mistaken.

160
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,750
I think you're looking
for the wrong person.

161
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,580
Seok-beom.

162
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,290
Is she the one?

163
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,160
Yes.

164
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,870
Have you been well?

165
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,160
I wondered what happened
to you after the jailbreak.

166
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,790
You look great.

167
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,040
How...

168
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,910
Did I get pulled in again?

169
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,000
It can't be. This is definitely
the hospital where I work.

170
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,580
Even Seok-beom is here.

171
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,620
I came here.

172
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,200
I came out

173
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,580
into your world.

174
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,330
How?

175
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,370
How did you come here?

176
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,540
The world I live in stopped.

177
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,250
What?

178
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,950
Everything stopped.

179
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,660
Except me.

180
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,160
That's why I escaped
and left everything behind.

181
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,330
I don't know why
I'm the only one to survive.

182
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,830
Maybe because
I'm the main character as you said.

183
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,700
Maybe it's a privilege
the main character gets.

184
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,750
I read all 33 volumes of "W"
with all the money I had.

185
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,290
Now I'm convinced

186
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,450
as to how well you knew me.

187
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,330
You must have been a fan.

188
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,250
You watched me for seven years after all.

189
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,950
Do you know

190
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,370
how much I'm regretting now?

191
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,950
I should have listened to you back then.

192
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,620
Answer me.

193
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,450
I can't.

194
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,330
I told you that
you're going to be unfortunate if I do.

195
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,620
I didn't imagine

196
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,290
the truth would be like this.

197
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,700
I should have listened to you.

198
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,580
I understand now

199
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,080
that you didn't say anything for my sake.

200
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,290
I came here

201
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,950
because I wanted to say goodbye.

202
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,040
Thank you so much for considering me

203
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,370
the best you could.

204
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,540
You're a good person.

205
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,160
And you are definitely a good doctor.

206
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,950
Dr Oh, Professor Park is here.

207
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,370
I'll be right there.

208
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,450
You're busy. Go back in.

209
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,040
Are you going somewhere?

210
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,080
Where do you want to go?
Just wait here for me.

211
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,950
It's not a big operation,
so it'll be over soon, okay?

212
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,080
Don't do anything and just stay here.

213
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,370
Think of me as your guardian
and wait for me.

214
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,700
Are you trying to act like me?

215
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,950
It's because you don't have anything.

216
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,750
You don't have money,
a place to stay or even an ID.

217
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,700
I know well how lost you may feel.

218
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,290
And I'm really a doctor in this world.

219
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,620
Sure, I can't compare myself to you,
but I have money and a place to stay.

220
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,830
Just trust me and wait

221
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,790
until I come out.

222
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,450
Don't go anywhere.
Just stay here.

223
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,290
All right?

224
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,540
Please do as I say.

225
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,620
It won't take long.
I'll finish in 40 minutes.

226
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,410
Why did you do that?

227
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,450
After I finished reading all the books,

228
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,950
I'm 99 times unhappier than before.

229
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,910
But one good thing came out of it.

230
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,080
I always felt that
I was at a disadvantage,

231
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,660
but I read everything
that was on your mind.

232
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,790
You'd better not be coy.

233
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,580
Wait here.

234
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,660
If something happens while I'm gone,

235
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,620
look for Dr Kang Seok-beom
of cardiothoracic surgery.

236
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,200
He'll help you if you say
you're my friend. Okay?

237
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,410
The guy from a while ago?

238
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,540
He acted sassy when I told him
I was your fiance.

239
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,540
He's not your boyfriend, is he?

240
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,750
I told you I don't have a boyfriend.

241
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,950
Sorry I'm late.

242
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,700
The name "Oh Yeon-joo" is problematic.
Everything with that name is doomed.

243
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,250
Look at "W" for instance.

244
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,200
Ever since that Oh Yeon-joo
character appeared,

245
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,950
the cartoon has been going downhill.

246
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,790
It's not just going downhill.
It's going down the Himalayas.

247
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,950
And the other Oh Yeon-joo
is about to ruin

248
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,330
the great Myungsei's
cardiothoracic surgery department.

249
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,120
You're doomed.
See you after the surgery.

250
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,950
Okay.

251
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,410
Surgery: 15 minutes
Anaesthesia: 24 minutes

252
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,620
Oh Seong-moo

253
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,830
"W" by Oh Seong-moo

254
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,450
Kang Chul's penthouse bedroom

255
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,580
Kang Chul's penthouse bathroom

256
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,700
Seo Do-yoon

257
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,450
Yoon So-hee

258
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,450
Kang Chul

259
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,750
Hey! Are you all right?

260
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,950
Can you hear me?

261
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,200
-Please let me in.
-No, you are not allowed.

262
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,790
Oh, no. Please.

263
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,370
Are you all right?

264
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,000
I am one of those people

265
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,700
who wants your life to be a happy ending.

266
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,330
I'm your fan. I swear.

267
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,870
In operation

268
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,830
Good work, everybody.

269
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,540
-Good work.
-Good work.

270
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,160
-Where are you going?
-Pardon?

271
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,120
Did you forget that
I was going to end you?

272
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,580
-I didn't forget.
-So where are you going? Come here.

273
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,040
Right now? There's someone
waiting for me outside.

274
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,000
Assume position in one, two

275
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,950
Hey, you've...

276
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,950
...always been bad and thoughtless,

277
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,700
but when I thought about it,
you started getting so smart with me

278
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,120
precisely after I said
I was a fan of "W."

279
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,000
That's when you started
to get really smart with me.

280
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,830
How dare you use your father
to your advantage?

281
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,040
It's not like that.

282
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,870
What do you mean it's not like that?

283
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,540
And since it's out,
I'll get this off my chest, too.

284
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,910
I'm so stressed these days
because of "W."

285
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,620
What's up with your father?

286
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,790
Why is there romance when they
should be busy looking for the killer?

287
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,290
What's going on?
It's like he's forgotten the genre!

288
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,750
That can happen, can't it?

289
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:31,120
-What did you just say?
-How can people work all the time?

290
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,330
I think that's more unrealistic.

291
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,000
Even a hero can fall in love.

292
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,040
No matter how important his revenge is,

293
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,540
there must be a moment
when he's blinded with love.

294
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,330
Chul is a human, too.

295
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,750
Are you upset because
I insulted your father?

296
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,500
-No, Doctor.
-Besides, that's no love.

297
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,160
They are just flirting.

298
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,750
Chul and that girl with your name
are just flirting.

299
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,120
It could be love, too.

300
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,160
-Why are you so sure it's not love?
-What?

301
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,750
How can you think of that as just
flirting? I didn't see it that way.

302
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,080
Hey. What have they done?

303
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,200
Chul never said anything to her.
Has he ever told her that he loves her?

304
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,950
Do you have to say it out loud?

305
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,120
How would she know otherwise?

306
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,790
How would she know?

307
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,290
I know how,

308
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,200
but I won't tell you.

309
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,840
Wait! Spoiler alert!

310
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,200
She must've heard something.

311
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,750
Is that right? Don't tell me

312
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,450
that girl will end up with Chul.

313
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,410
No, no. Stop it!

314
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,040
I can never understand it.
That craziness can never happen!

315
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,950
Why is that crazy?

316
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,450
-It can happen, too.
-Does it make sense?

317
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,870
It's natural for him
to marry Yoon So-hee.

318
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,950
Why? Why does he have
to marry Yoon So-hee?

319
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,870
They've been friends for
almost 10 years since high school.

320
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:53,080
-It's obvious they should marry.
-No, it's not obvious.

321
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,450
Do you have to get married
when you stay together?

322
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,120
Why do you think
Chul likes So-hee?

323
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,370
Okay, I see. It's obvious that
So-hee has a big crush on Chul.

324
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,450
It was mentioned many times.

325
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,330
But there's never a scene

326
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,620
suggesting that Chul likes So-hee.

327
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,580
I remember everything.

328
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,950
Do I have to vocalise it?

329
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Even without those words,
we'd arrive at the same conclusion.

330
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,500
It's obvious by looking at them.

331
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,620
"So-hee, I didn't realise it until now,
but the person I truly love is you."

332
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,370
He confesses his love,
they kiss and that's the end.

333
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,200
-It's like a formula!
-There's no formula in human feelings!

334
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:31,120
Why do you judge Chul however you want?

335
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,500
You don't even know him well.

336
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,620
Chul likes me.

337
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,370
That is a fact.

338
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,080
Doctor.

339
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,950
Chul likes you?

340
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,040
No.

341
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,580
I mean the character with my name.

342
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,200
You have the same mental age
as my daughter.

343
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,830
My daughter in junior high
acts just like you. She's a groupie.

344
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,620
Should I introduce you to her?
Would you like to meet her?

345
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,160
No, thank you.

346
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,410
Why not? You would share
a deep friendship.

347
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,950
Doctor, I'm so sorry, but I have
something very urgent to attend to.

348
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,580
Can you scold me later?

349
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,790
I'm not scolding you.
You're the one who raised your voice.

350
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,040
I'm sorry, Doctor.

351
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,120
Yeon-joo, where are you going?
Yeon-joo!

352
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,000
Where did he go?
I told him to stay here.

353
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,870
I understand now...

354
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,330
...that you didn't say
anything for my sake.

355
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,450
I came here

356
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,200
because I wanted to say goodbye.

357
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,790
Dad

358
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,870
The number you have dialled
is not available at this moment.

359
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,330
Dad, where are you?

360
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,660
Dad, where are you?

361
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,120
Park Soo-bong

362
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,500
Sir, where are you?

363
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,750
It looks like Yeon-joo got dragged
into the webtoon again.

364
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,250
This is Editor Park.

365
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,950
Is the one you sent me this morning
the final draft?

366
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,830
The content seems a little strange.

367
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,950
Since you're not responding, I posted it.

368
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,160
Park Soo-bong

369
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,540
Sir, have you read the new episode?

370
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,160
Yeon-joo is safe,
but I can't deal with the story.

371
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,200
Please call me.

372
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,540
Yeon-joo

373
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,950
Dad, where are you?

374
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,830
Yeon-joo

375
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,450
Mr Oh Seong-moo?

376
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,540
Hello, Dad? Where are you?

377
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,160
Hello?

378
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,000
It was you.

379
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,450
I had a feeling it was you.

380
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,290
We've met several times now.

381
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,000
You remember it, right?

382
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,290
Please come.

383
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,540
We have a lot to talk about.

384
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,580
How...

385
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
How did I come to this world?

386
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,040
You should explain that to me.

387
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,790
I thought you created me.

388
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,750
Come here.

389
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,450
Have a seat.

390
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,950
Dad! Dad!

391
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,410
Get up.

392
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,870
Be grateful to your daughter.

393
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,450
I'm going easy on you
because of Yeon-joo.

394
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,160
While you fought hard to kill me,

395
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,790
your daughter tried to save me.

396
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,790
Hello?

397
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,040
Soo-bong, where are you?

398
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,950
I'm at an Internet cafe,
just killing time.

399
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,910
Hurry over to Dad's studio.
I think something bad is happening.

400
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,410
Something bad?

401
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,250
Chul went to Dad.

402
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,410
What? What are you talking about?

403
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,120
Chul is here.

404
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,080
He is with Dad right now.

405
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,620
What are you...

406
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,290
Chul is here?

407
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,700
Run to Dad's studio now!

408
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,660
Go and tell Chul to wait.
Tell him I'll be right there.

409
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,660
Tell him to wait and do nothing
because I need to talk to him. Okay?

410
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,410
Hello, Yeon-joo? That's Yeon-joo?

411
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,950
Did she say Chul is here?

412
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,910
How did he come?

413
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,910
Sir, please shut down computer No. 35.

414
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,120
You're bleeding.

415
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,750
I guess you're not immortal
in this world.

416
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,160
You're an ordinary human.

417
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,410
You get hurt and bleed.

418
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,790
This is how it's supposed to be.

419
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,450
It's fair this way.

420
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,950
It's so unfair that I was the only one
who bled and got hurt.

421
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,830
Yeon-joo wasn't the first person
I grabbed after being stabbed.

422
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,000
It was you.

423
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,250
Help me. Please help me.

424
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,040
Please call an ambulance.

425
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,830
Let's stop.

426
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,120
Let's stop this now.

427
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,200
The stabber didn't fatally injure me.
It was you.

428
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,120
Then your daughter appeared and saved me.

429
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,160
Nobody knew

430
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,290
there were two people who stabbed me.

431
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,290
I kept quiet as I had no evidence,
but I knew it intuitively.

432
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,290
The person who wanted to kill me
without rhyme or reason...

433
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,750
...was you.

434
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,870
I didn't even know who you were then.

435
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:49,290
You must have created me here.

436
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,200
With your pen in hand,

437
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,040
you thought of ways to kill me here.

438
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,660
Now that you have money, honour
and success, you don't need me.

439
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,620
You created me and made me suffer.

440
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,080
You became successful by making
my life a roller coaster ride.

441
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,750
Then you wanted to kill me,
so you stabbed me,

442
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,950
inject me with poison
and hit me with a truck.

443
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,790
Even before all that,
you stabbed me yourself.

444
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,910
I asked for mercy,
but you stabbed me coldly and cruelly.

445
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,000
While I was waiting,
I did a research on you.

446
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,910
You're so popular

447
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,950
that you're all over the Internet.

448
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,950
-Stop drinking.
-I don't want to drink either.

449
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,580
I'm only drinking
because I'm suffering so much.

450
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,160
-You drink because you suffer?
-Yes.

451
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,540
Then I should drink a lot more than you.

452
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,200
-Go ahead and drink. Drink.
-I'm sick of this.

453
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm sick of it all, too.

454
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,870
Please stop now.

455
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,410
Oh Seong-moo was an incompetent
head of the family.

456
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:58,870
He was a webtoon artist
who had never succeeded even once.

457
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,120
You couldn't live without alcohol
and had no will.

458
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,950
You felt inferior
like a loser all the time.

459
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,500
On top of that, you were old.

460
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,790
That's why you created me.

461
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,870
Someone young, successful,
wealthy and popular.

462
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,620
Someone with a strong will.

463
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,410
A man who is the complete opposite of you.

464
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,500
That's why you named me Kang Chul.

465
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,450
It was written in an article.

466
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,790
You wanted to live vicariously
through me to escape reality.

467
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,580
However, it didn't last long

468
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,120
because your wife finally left you.

469
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,410
You immediately fell into depression.

470
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,330
You've always been like that.

471
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,580
You're full of inferiority complex,
lack confidence and give up easily.

472
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,120
That's why you killed me

473
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,040
unlike your original plan.

474
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,790
You made me commit suicide
because you weren't brave enough to do so.

475
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,660
The only thing you could control

476
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,040
in this world was me.

477
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,200
That's when things started going wrong.

478
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,950
And I kept having the same nightmare.

479
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,660
A nightmare of drowning in Han River.

480
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,080
I wondered what it was.

481
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,950
I guess I was really dead

482
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:10,330
before you changed your mind
and saved me.

483
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:11,950
I didn't save you.

484
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,750
You resisted death.

485
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,120
I actually...

486
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,580
...killed you there, but you resisted.

487
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,790
You pleaded me to save you.

488
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,540
That's why I saved you
because I felt pity.

489
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,200
I was fond of you then.

490
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,620
And that was the problem.

491
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,790
From then on, you became a monster

492
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,450
like you are now.

493
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,330
You're right. I gave you everything.

494
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:50,500
I gave you everything
that I wanted to have,

495
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,410
but what happened?

496
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:56,450
You tried to learn about this world
with the brain I created.

497
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,500
It makes no sense.
You're only a cartoon character.

498
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,080
You're not even human,

499
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,200
but you kept giving me a hard time.

500
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,410
And now, you're even here.

501
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,330
Sometimes, the pen
moves on its own without my will.

502
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,830
When I wake up in the morning,

503
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:16,830
I find a completely different drawing.

504
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:20,620
At first, I went to a psychiatrist
because I thought I'd lost my mind.

505
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:25,370
Do you think I've lost my mind?

506
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:29,160
No, it's because you're always drunk.

507
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,950
You're not a child anymore.

508
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,620
I talked to my friends about it,
but nobody believed me.

509
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:00,040
I tried to run away
because I was so scared,

510
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,370
but I couldn't.

511
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,750
Because of Yeon-joo.

512
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,370
Dad.

513
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:30,660
I have...

514
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:35,370
...done nothing for her
while she was growing up.

515
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,790
Yeon-joo, come here.

516
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,500
I'm sorry.

517
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,750
I told myself to keep working

518
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,370
because people liked my work

519
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,160
and it helped me earn a living.

520
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,500
If I earn a little more,

521
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:24,080
I could open up a hospital for her
and help her live a life without worry.

522
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,750
Do you think you're
the only one with a nightmare?

523
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,120
Every night, I had a nightmare!

524
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:41,160
A nightmare that you'd come
to me like this.

525
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:45,330
It was extremely difficult
to continue until now,

526
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
but I persevered because
I knew it would end soon.

527
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,080
That was my light and hope,

528
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,160
that I won't have to draw you anymore
once I finish.

529
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,950
Yet you didn't die!
You pulled me into your world.

530
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,410
You even pulled Yeon-joo in,
which was why I stabbed you.

531
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,290
I didn't think
this curse would end otherwise.

532
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,250
You're just an illusion.

533
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:14,160
You're nothing but a character I created.

534
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,000
So why do you show yourself

535
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,330
and pretend you're human?

536
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:24,040
Why are you continuing the story
and getting my daughter involved?

537
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,390
You're just a character, understand?

538
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,630
You're just something I created!

539
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:35,830
You want to shoot me?

540
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,120
Go ahead.

541
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,330
Do you think you can shoot me?

542
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:44,080
No, you can never shoot me.

543
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,580
Do you know why?

544
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,330
It's because I made you that way.

545
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,830
I made you a righteous man.

546
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,910
A conscientious man
who abides by the law.

547
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:03,200
Even when you take a revenge,
it has to be lawful.

548
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,500
That's why you became a hero
and people like you.

549
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:13,580
You're a guy who can't shoot
a helpless and unarmed old man

550
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,540
just because you're upset.

551
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,620
You're that kind of character.

552
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,580
That's your set-up.

553
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:28,540
Do you think you're here on your will?

554
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,370
Of your own free will?

555
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,830
No. This is all part of the set-up.

556
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,450
I made you into a person
with unusually strong will.

557
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:42,040
You have the will to endure
and get through any hardships.

558
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:47,790
Unfortunately,
the set-up is over the line.

559
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,200
I gave you such strong will

560
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:54,660
that you can even refuse to die
despite not understanding it.

561
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,250
However,

562
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,790
even that will is my creation.

563
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:05,370
You've never derailed
from the set-up I gave you.

564
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,450
Shoot me if you want to.

565
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,950
Dad, no.

566
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,540
Please don't say anything anymore.

567
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,250
Can you shoot me?

568
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,790
Shoot me!

569
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,500
Sit and draw the ending
you originally planned.

570
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:13,330
Your original plan was not
to make me commit suicide.

571
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:16,500
Everything went wrong
after I refused that.

572
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,790
But if you follow the original plot,
I'll understand.

573
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,160
Then everything will
go back to their original places.

574
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,250
Don't you think so?

575
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,040
My friends are still there.

576
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:33,330
Do-yoon?

577
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,290
They're neither dead nor living.

578
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,830
I can't leave them
so miserably like that.

579
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,620
That happened only because
you popped out of the webtoon.

580
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,500
Stop looking for reasons
and look for solution.

581
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,620
Just draw. Then everything
will go back to normal.

582
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,950
I don't know anything.

583
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,830
-What do you mean?
-There's nothing I can do.

584
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,950
I can't even end it the way I want.

585
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:06,120
The story continues only when you accept it.

586
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,870
You know what kind of ending I'd accept.

587
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:10,450
It's simple.

588
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,330
Catch the true criminal
and make him pay for what he's done.

589
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,410
And I want to live a normal life.
That's all.

590
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,700
Just tell me who the true criminal is.

591
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:22,410
As you said, my will to
find the suspect is so strong

592
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,750
that I came here instead of dying.

593
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,750
Draw the true criminal's face

594
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,790
so that I can remember it.

595
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,790
Draw it.

596
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,870
I don't have it.

597
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,750
What?

598
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,450
There is no true criminal.

599
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,450
It was just a set-up
from the start.

600
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,790
It was a set-up to make
the main character stronger.

601
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,830
Mum?

602
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,330
It's a common set-up
for a hero cartoon.

603
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,290
He has a shocking trauma from his youth.

604
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:27,540
Oh, let's go, Korea!

605
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,910
I don't even know who the criminal is.

606
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,620
Are you...

607
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,370
...serious right now?

608
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,540
You can only become a hero
if things don't get solved.

609
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:50,500
If you catch the criminal,
the story will simply end there.

610
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:55,330
If you're happy, why would
you bother to go through all that?

611
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,120
That's why there's no clue.

612
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,580
It never existed.

613
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,500
You don't know?

614
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,580
There's no criminal?

615
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,330
You killed my entire family.

616
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,950
You falsely accused me
and put me in jail, yet you don't know?

617
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:32,950
They died before my eyes.

618
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,620
They died miserably in front of me.

619
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,200
My parents and my little siblings.

620
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:43,700
I saw the scene with my eyes,
and you say there's no shooter?

621
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:49,580
Sir, please hurry up. Hurry.

622
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,000
I see.

623
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,450
That's why...

624
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,120
...you tried to kill me.

625
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:03,290
There could never be a happy ending.

626
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,370
If this never happened,

627
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,410
you would've continued to draw this
and enjoyed your success.

628
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:11,700
Meanwhile, I'd be suffering
from insomnia every night

629
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:14,910
and get hurt every day
chasing a suspect I can never catch.

630
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:18,000
I would go through endless pain
and repeat the same things.

631
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:22,620
Do you have...

632
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:25,950
...any idea what I went through?

633
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,950
You wouldn't be able to
understand any of it,

634
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,750
but I went through it countless times.

635
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:40,870
You drew like an absolute being
with those petty fingers of yours.

636
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,660
You took no responsibility.

637
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,200
While I remember every pain.

638
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,000
That's how fiction is.

639
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:55,950
It's my job as a webtoon artist.

640
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,620
No.

641
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
You're not just a webtoon artist.

642
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:08,830
You saw me alive and breathing,
but you tried to kill me anyway.

643
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,080
That's your essence.

644
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,790
You're a brutal and abusive man.

645
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:17,540
It didn't show because you were
holding a pen instead of a knife.

646
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,160
Essentially, you are just rubbish.

647
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:26,700
It's like you've already
committed a murder.

648
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,660
No! No!

649
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,500
No! No, please!

650
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,700
Sir!

651
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,290
Sir!

652
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,370
Sir!

653
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:26,000
Think of a solution.

654
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:29,750
Do whatever it takes.

655
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,830
Figure it out before I come back.

656
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:43,500
Consider yourself lucky.

657
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,000
It's not that I'm lucky.

658
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,500
You couldn't shoot me.

659
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,620
That's your set-up.

660
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:14,750
W–Two Worlds

661
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:17,330
Why did you save Chul then?
You should've let him die.

662
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:20,870
This happened because
you saved him that night.

663
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,660
This must be a perfect ending for
someone looking for a murderer

664
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,950
and became a murderer himself.

665
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,620
If it says "The end" in the webtoon,
what happens next?

666
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,870
I'm not sure what the end is.

667
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,790
Please save Chul. Please save him.

668
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:37,540
He can still be saved.
