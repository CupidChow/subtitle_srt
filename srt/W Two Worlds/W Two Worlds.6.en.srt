1
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,070
W-Two Worlds

2
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,230
With sales totalling 10 million copies,

3
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,230
"W" is Korea's best webtoon series.

4
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,060
Cartoonist of the popular "W",
Oh Seong-moo

5
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,430
is afraid of his webtoon's protagonist,
Chul, who came to life.

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,730
Who are you?

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,230
So he tries to kill Chul.

8
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,730
-Do some research on poison.
-Chul drags Oh Seong-moo's daughter

9
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,270
into the webtoon world,

10
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,560
where Oh Yeon-joo
ends up saving Chul.

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,390
-Why are my feelings important?
-You are the main character!

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,520
Kang Chul, the main character

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,430
Through Yeon-joo, Chul finds out that
he's a protagonist in a cartoon world.

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,150
Will Chul be able to find out
who killed his family?

15
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,100
Chul comes out into
Yeon-joo's world of reality.

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,980
Mr Oh Seong-moo?

17
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,020
He goes to Seong-moo.

18
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,600
-There is no true criminal.
-Are you serious right now?

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,310
-That's how fiction is.
-Think of a solution.

20
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,310
You are just an illusion.

21
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,230
You're nothing but a character I created.

22
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,560
Why are you continuing the story
and getting my daughter get involved?

23
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,930
You're just a character, understand?

24
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,020
You're just something I created!

25
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,980
If you call an ambulance right away,
he might live if he's lucky.

26
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,230
Mr Oh?

27
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,390
Mr Oh.

28
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,020
Miss! Miss!

29
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,060
Police

30
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,560
What did you do?

31
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,270
Miss! Stop!

32
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,480
I'm here at the scene.

33
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,480
There's been a shooting incident.

34
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,060
-Mr Oh.
-The victim is injured badly.

35
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,310
-Dad!
-Mr Oh.

36
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,430
Dad!

37
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,140
Dad!

38
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,680
Gosh, look at this mess.

39
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,770
-Soo-yeong, pick up the phone.
-Okay.

40
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,390
Yes, hello?

41
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,100
This is Soo-seon's phone.

42
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,390
What?

43
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,350
What? Okay, thank you.

44
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,350
Who was it?

45
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,140
It was a guy named Soo-bong,
who works for Seong-moo.

46
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,310
Why would he call me?

47
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,980
He says Seong-moo
is in a critical condition.

48
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,230
They're taking him
to Yeon-joo's hospital.

49
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,020
Why?

50
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,980
He got shot.

51
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,390
We found him awake
with a gunshot wound on his chest.

52
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,560
His daughter is a doctor, so
we're moving him to her hospital.

53
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,480
Dad, we're almost there.
Please hang on just a little more.

54
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,350
You'll be fine. It's nothing serious.
Don't be afraid.

55
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,020
There's no pulse
or blood pressure reading.

56
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,770
Electrocardiogram shows that
he's in ventricular fibrillation.

57
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,980
No. Massage his heart!

58
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,020
-How far is the hospital?
-We are two kilometres away.

59
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,850
Move!

60
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,770
Please.

61
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,230
Please.

62
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,020
Yeon-joo, what's going on?

63
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,850
Please move him
to the trauma room. Hurry!

64
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,890
-What happened?
-Doctor.

65
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,480
When he got here,
they already did a CPR on him.

66
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,310
The chest X-ray shows
massive hemothorax on the left side.

67
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,480
I inserted a chest tube.
More than one litre of blood was lost,

68
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,100
and the bleeding isn't stopping.

69
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,480
I gave him a lot of fluid,
and his pulse returned to normal.

70
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,850
But echo showed that

71
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,100
the bullet got stuck on
the left ventricle apex.

72
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,560
Book an operating room

73
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,980
and get the cardiothoracic
surgery team ready.

74
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,230
Go freeze the patient.

75
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,730
Move it!

76
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,520
Yeon-joo, leave the room.

77
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,770
I'm staying.

78
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,890
You'll only put massive pressure on me.
Don't you trust me?

79
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
-Watch his vitals carefully.
-Okay.

80
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,980
We'll perform a sternotomy first,

81
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,680
and we will do a repair
after checking the wound.

82
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,020
If we can't, we'll start pumping
blood to the heart.

83
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,230
Let's begin. Scalpel.

84
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,850
You're still here.

85
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,520
Main Operating Room

86
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,930
Chul was there.

87
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,680
I saw him. It was definitely Chul.

88
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,350
He was holding a gun.

89
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,930
Where did he go?

90
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,980
I don't know.

91
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,140
It was too hectic.

92
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,980
The police asked if I had seen
the shooter, but I couldn't answer.

93
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,980
I didn't know what to say.

94
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,640
So that's why he was like that.

95
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,180
There was a reason
why Mr Oh wanted to kill Chul.

96
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,310
He knew from the start this would happen.

97
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,930
Why...

98
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,180
Why did you save Chul that time?
You should've let him die.

99
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,480
This happened because you saved him.

100
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,890
That's why this happened.

101
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,600
He's just a cartoon character.

102
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,520
Yeon-joo!

103
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,180
Yeon-joo.

104
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,230
Fortunately, the bullet is still in here.

105
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,770
Get me the 3-0 prolene suture, please.

106
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,730
The hospital is already closed.
If you're a patient, please

107
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,730
To Yeon-joo

108
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,100
Please give this to her.

109
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,020
Who?

110
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,640
Dr Oh Yeon-joo of
of cardiothoracic surgery.

111
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,930
Okay.

112
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,890
Good afternoon.
We have breaking news.

113
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,350
Popular webtoon artist of "W,"

114
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,680
Oh Seong-moo is currently in critical
state after being shot last night.

115
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,430
After being shot by an unidentified man
at around 11 PM,

116
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,640
he was immediately brought to hospital,
where he had an operation.

117
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,770
According to the police, he has yet
to regain consciousness.

118
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,680
Mr Oh Seong-moo
is a star webtoon artist,

119
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,020
whose most famous work, "W,"
was first published in 2007.

120
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,100
Hey, shouldn't we call Mr Oh's daughter?

121
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,140
We can't talk to her about that
at a time like this.

122
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,430
-He's in a critical state.
-That's why we should tell her.

123
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,600
This can be evidence.

124
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,020
This is too strange.

125
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,020
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

126
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,180
He's a monster.

127
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,230
I didn't know about it at first,

128
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,680
but I've created a monster.

129
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,350
So I decided to take matters
into my own hands.

130
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
It was my mistake to create him.

131
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,730
How can I let him be
when he is going to eat me up?

132
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,180
You should go get some rest.
I'll stay with him.

133
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,100
Where's my mum?

134
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,600
She just went home with her sister.

135
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,850
I got them a taxi.

136
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,560
That's good.

137
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,640
Thank you.

138
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,640
Go and rest now.

139
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,520
The on-call room is empty.

140
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,520
Intensive Care Unit

141
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,270
-Hello?
-Yeon-joo, this is Editor Park.

142
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,020
We met earlier at the hospital.

143
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,520
Oh, hello.

144
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,020
How is Mr Oh?

145
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,350
He's still critical,
but he didn't get worse.

146
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,640
I see.

147
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,520
Look, I'm not sure if I should
talk about this at a time like this,

148
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,180
but I need to check something.

149
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,520
What is it?

150
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,520
It's about "W."

151
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,730
A new episode has been sent in
and we were wondering who sent it.

152
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,640
I'm sure it wasn't Mr Oh who did it,

153
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,730
but it does look like his drawing.
So who sent it?

154
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,980
Is there any chance
Mr Oh finished it beforehand?

155
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,640
-The content seemed a little strange.
-When was it sent?

156
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,060
Early this morning.

157
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,680
We only saw it a while ago.

158
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,930
We haven't uploaded it online yet.

159
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,230
I thought we should check first.
This may cause an issue.

160
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,980
May I see it?

161
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,730
The new episode of "W"

162
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,060

"W" by Oh Seong-moo

165
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,230
Kang Chul,
the generation's defender of justice

166
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,430
Will Chul be able to find out
who killed his family?

167
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,560
Kang Chul,
the generation's defender of justice

168
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:48,100
To Yeon-joo

169
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,180
To Yeon-joo

170
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,310
Yeon-joo.

171
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,180
What is it?

172
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,180
-Is Dad...
-No. It's not that.

173
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,020
It's this.

174
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,930
I should've given it to you earlier.
I didn't know you were in here.

175
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,890
Someone left it for you.

176
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,890
I'll put this here.

177
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,810
Who...

178
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,350
...is this from?

179
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,230
I'm not sure.
It came when I wasn't here.

180
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,770
To Yeon-joo

181
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,100
To Yeon-joo

182
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,930
To Yeon-joo

183
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,430
This must be a perfect ending for
someone looking for a murderer

184
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,430
and became a murderer himself.

185
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,850
To Yeon-joo

186
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,310
This must be a perfect ending for
someone looking for a murderer

187
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,680
and became a murderer himself.

188
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,770
Life is sometimes

189
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,520
The end

190
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,480
The end

191
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,560
Hello, can anyone come in here?

192
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,020
He opened his eyes!

193
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,480
Hello? The patient opened his eyes.

194
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,180
Nurse!

195
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,310
There are 10 surveillance cameras
in the vicinity of the house,

196
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,390
but not even one of them
recorded anything at all.

197
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,930
He should be caught on camera
if he went inside,

198
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,230
but there was nothing.

199
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,390
We haven't found the gun either.

200
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,230
What's very strange is that

201
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,060
The bullet extracted
during surgery disappeared.

202
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,770
Someone must have stolen it.

203
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,480
Is there anyone you suspect
in the hospital?

204
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,100
I'm not sure.

205
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,770
This case is quite strange.

206
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,560
Since your father woke up,
it'll be revealed soon.

207
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,850
He's the most definite witness.

208
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,520
Hello? Did you look into it?

209
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,520
Dad, can you hear me?

210
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,980
There's something you should know.

211
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,520
Kang Chul...

212
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,480
Kang Chul killed himself.

213
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,770
The scene where he shoots you
and drowns in Han River

214
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,230
including all the conversations
appeared in the webtoon.

215
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,930
The editors saw it already.

216
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,890
They'll report it to the police soon.

217
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,350
We should try to cover up
what happened together.

218
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,270
If we can't explain
the webtoon's content,

219
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,930
the situation will get more complicated,

220
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,930
so Yeon-joo and I had a discussion.

221
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,560
The police concluded that the attack
on webtoon artist, Oh Seong-moo,

222
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,100
was actually his attempt
to commit suicide.

223
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,390
While drawing the last episodes
of his webtoon,

224
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,140
Oh Seong-moo was suffering from
extreme stress and depression.

225
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,310
On the day of the incident,

226
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,640
intoxicated and unable to decide
on the webtoon's ending,

227
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,600
he thus made an extreme decision.

228
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,890
The ending of Oh Seong-moo's
popular webtoon, "W,"

229
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,930
was revealed this morning.

230
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,430
The ending was unexpected

231
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,430
and completely different
from what people hoped for.

232
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,020
-Many were shocked and angry.
-What is this?

233
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,350
It ends with the main character,
Kang Chul

234
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:12,310
killing the artist who created him
and drowning himself in Han River.

235
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,390
Many people posted complaints
and called to protest,

236
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,640
causing the site to crash temporarily.

237
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,390
Avid readers are extremely disappointed

238
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,270
and pressuring the artist
to change the ending.

239
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,260
They have started a petition
to bring Kang Chul back to life.

240
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,680
Dr Park, could you sign here?

241
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,430
-Are you busy tonight?
-Yes.

242
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,270
Then let's go have a drink.

243
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,850
-Pardon?
-This webtoon is driving me nuts.

244
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,480
Let's go.

245
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:54,890
Okay.

246
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,600
I heard Mr Oh was discharged
from the hospital.

247
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,350
He's back home because
he detested being in the hospital.

248
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,390
He should still get treatment
at the hospital.

249
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,930
I'm taking time off work
to take care of him.

250
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,270
I see.

251
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,560
-It must be difficult for you.
-It's all right.

252
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,390
It's fine since I haven't been
with Dad in a while anyway.

253
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,060
I see, of course.

254
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,480
Did you hear?

255
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,640
People are still angry
even though it's been a month.

256
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,390
They want Kang Chul revived.

257
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,890
Did you hear about the petition
that's going on?

258
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,640
Really?

259
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,600
I don't go online much these days.

260
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,060
I see.

261
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,350
Actually, Producer Seo
is going through a hard time now.

262
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,730
-The movie is the biggest problem.
-We're in serious trouble.

263
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,520
There's not much excitement anymore.

264
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,560
No one's interested in watching
the movie version

265
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,480
since they know Chul dies anyway.

266
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,770
Since Mr Oh's been discharged
from the hospital,

267
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,230
we thought he might have
changed his mind.

268
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,390
No.

269
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,060
-Does he want to change the ending?
-He wants to retire.

270
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,730
He's quite old,

271
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,230
and he's worked hard until now.

272
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,640
Please understand him.

273
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,730
I certainly understand him.

274
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,890
He must have been very stressed out,

275
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,020
but I'm just asking for
a few more scenes.

276
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,890
-If he draws a couple more
-He won't.

277
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,600
He won't draw again. He can't.

278
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,520
He's gone through a lot more
difficulties than you can imagine,

279
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,640
so I can't persuade him.

280
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,390
I'm very sorry.

281
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,310
Yeon-joo, I'm very disappointed
to be honest.

282
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,180
The main character's death

283
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,430
isn't cool or touching at all.
How could he

284
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,680
have such an unfortunate death?

285
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,560
It's just a cartoon.

286
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,230
Pardon?

287
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,730
He's just a main character in a webtoon.

288
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,980
Don't get too emotional
over a mere webtoon.

289
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,980
You'll forget it soon.

290
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,180
Dad, I'm home.

291
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,350
Yes. I'm in the bathroom.

292
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,890
I was with Editor Park just now.

293
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,100
What did he say?

294
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,020
He finds it hard to give up
especially because of the movie.

295
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:13,020
I turned down his offer.
He will give up now.

296
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,060
That's good.

297
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,560
Yeon-joo

298
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,180
Yeon-joo.

299
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,020
Are you here to pick up your things?
I haven't finished packing them yet.

300
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,100
That's not it. Come here.

301
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,140
I got a call from the police.

302
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,640
They said they found a drowned body
a few days ago,

303
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,810
and it looks like it's been about
a month since the person died.

304
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,350
They only found it now because
it was entangled in seaweeds.

305
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,100
The time of death is close,
and they found it

306
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,140
near Han River Bridge.

307
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,770
The description of his look is also

308
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,180
I think it's Chul.

309
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,020
Yeon-joo!

310
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,600
-Yes?
-What are you doing? We should go.

311
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,390
-Okay.
-They're cremating him soon.

312
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,140
Hurry up. Come on.

313
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,930
-Okay.
-We'll be stuck in traffic. Hurry.

314
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,850
What if it's really Chul?

315
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,230
I asked them to call me
if they found anything,

316
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,180
but even if it's Chul,
we can't really take over his body.

317
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,680
What would we say
if they ask us who it is?

318
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,350
We should leave it as unidentified body.

319
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,430
We can't bury him or not bury him.

320
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,680
That's...

321
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,560
-You said you're a friend of Mr Park?
-What?

322
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,060
Yes. I am his friend.

323
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,520
Please come this way.

324
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,770
Since it's summer and has been a while,
it's severely decomposed.

325
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,930
It may be hard to see.

326
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,810
This may be too shocking,
so you can just check the document.

327
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,100
I'm a doctor.

328
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,140
I'll be fine. Please show me.

329
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,730
I see. Okay.

330
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,680
Please check his clothes.
Is this what he was wearing?

331
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,020
It's not him.

332
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,310
This person is wearing a ring.
It's not him.

333
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,810
Are you sure he wasn't wearing a ring
on the day he disappeared?

334
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,640
This is not the person we're looking for.

335
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,180
I'm sure it's not.

336
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,560
Here you go.

337
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,600
What about you?
Not eating?

338
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,600
I don't have an appetite.
I'll eat later if I get hungry.

339
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,770
You should eat meals regularly.

340
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,350
You really should.

341
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,350
I know.

342
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,520
It's become a habit since
I started working at the hospital.

343
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,270
Where did you and Soo-bong go
this afternoon?

344
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,430
I think you lied about
going grocery shopping.

345
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,850
The police called
and said they found a drowned body.

346
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,770
But it wasn't him.

347
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,930
Why can't we find him?

348
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,270
It's been over a month now.

349
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:37,480
I think he went back into
the webtoon as he died.

350
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,390
Don't you think so?

351
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,270
He's from the webtoon.
He must have gone back.

352
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,430
I wonder.

353
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,680
I'm not sure either.

354
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,270
I want to ask you something, Dad.

355
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:57,060
If it says "The end" in the webtoon,

356
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
what happens next?

357
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,270
Does the world inside it
end just like that?

358
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,430
Or do they continue their lives
inside it?

359
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,350
The ending is always the same
in fairy tales.

360
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,930
"And they lived happily ever after."

361
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,310
Do you think they really lived
a happy life until they died?

362
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:31,020
Or do they stop existing
on the last page of the book?

363
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,270
Yeon-joo.

364
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,350
Do you want me to draw something

365
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,310
and bring Chul back to life
like everyone else?

366
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,270
No. I didn't mean that.

367
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,560
You don't have any
reason to do that, Dad.

368
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,060
I have reasons why I can't do it
and reasons why I won't.

369
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,850
The police came to see me last week.

370
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,640
You were not home then.

371
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,560
Put it here.

372
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,770
We found it on the rooftop of a motel
and kept it as evidence,

373
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,390
but the investigation is closed now.

374
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,980
We brought it here
because you might need it.

375
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,850
They brought my tablet computer
that I left at the motel.

376
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,180
Die!

377
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,060
It seems the police went to the motel
and kept it as evidence.

378
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,350
They brought it back since
the investigation is over.

379
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,020
Is that so?

380
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,270
I didn't know that.

381
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,140
When I got it back,

382
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,930
I thought about
bringing him back to life.

383
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,480
He didn't shoot me right

384
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,560
despite never missing his target
even by an inch.

385
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,480
He couldn't kill me on the spot.

386
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,480
No. I should say he didn't.

387
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,810
I know Chul better than anyone else.

388
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,230
The end

389
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,640
Since he gave me a chance to live,

390
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,020
I thought I should do the same for him.

391
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,180
The end

392
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,430
But...

393
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,930
The end

394
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,310
...I couldn't change it.

395
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,020
So I gave up.

396
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,430
Why couldn't you change it?

397
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,520
I'm not sure.

398
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,520
He and I both betrayed each other.

399
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,020
Maybe we can't turn things back again.

400
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,270
That's what I think.

401
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,350
I don't think
my drawing will work anymore.

402
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,850
I see.

403
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,310
That's the reason why I can't draw it.

404
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,520
And I won't draw it

405
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,640
because of you.

406
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,640
Do you know why you kept
getting dragged back into that world?

407
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,020
No.

408
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,930
I think I know now.

409
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:49,600
I realised it when I saw that
he left his will to you.

410
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,020
You became one of
the main characters of the webtoon.

411
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,350
In other words, you became a heroine.

412
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,640
That's why I should end it here.

413
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,810
You're a real person.

414
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,680
You're my daughter

415
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,020
and your mum's daughter.

416
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,810
Don't you think so?

417
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,230
Yes.

418
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,850
So let's leave the ending of "W" at that.

419
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,020
But...

420
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,060
...what is the end really like?

421
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,100
Did So-hee find his body

422
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,600
and have a proper funeral for him or...

423
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,600
...is he still floating in the cold water?

424
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,310
Will he...

425
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,520
...drift endlessly,

426
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,520
forever alone?

427
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,890
We still have time.
Let's get some coffee.

428
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,270
Just get some inside.
The queue will be long.

429
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,600
Let's do that, then.

430
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,430
We've arrived at the airport
and about to go in now.

431
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,480
Take care of yourself.

432
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,640
Call me as soon as you arrive.

433
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,140
The flight takes about 12 hours, right?

434
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,770
Right! Dad, don't drink.

435
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,980
You must never drink. Okay?

436
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,270
Not even one sip. I'm going
to call your friend and check.

437
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,180
And don't forget to take your meds.

438
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,730
Take care. Make sure to call me.

439
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,430
Okay.

440
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,980
-Dr Park!
-Is your father going somewhere?

441
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,480
He's going to New Zealand.

442
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,100
He's already going on
a long-distance trip? That's not good.

443
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,890
I couldn't stop him.

444
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,560
Plus, he's not going there to travel.
He's there to rest.

445
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,980
-His friend lives there.
-I see.

446
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,390
-You managed to wash your hair.
-Pardon?

447
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,680
What are you wearing today?

448
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,140
What are you doing?

449
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,100
Let's go. I'm taking you out.

450
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,230
Take me out? But I'm okay.

451
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,060
-I'm not hungry at all.
-Meet me at the lobby in five.

452
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,390
Put on some lipstick and wear perfume.

453
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,930
What's wrong with him now?

454
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,680
Dr Park, this is not cool.
You didn't even warn me.

455
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,100
-How can I go on a blind date now?
-You're a substitute.

456
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,020
Substitutes should be ready all the time.

457
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,890
But I don't want to be a substitute.

458
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,310
You don't have a boyfriend.

459
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,100
I checked and it seems
nobody has a boyfriend.

460
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,350
But you're the only one who's washed
her hair. That's why you're the sub.

461
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,230
-Consider yourself lucky.
-I shouldn't have washed my hair.

462
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,600
Why did I wash my hair?
I never wash my hair.

463
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,730
Stop the nonsense and sit!

464
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,230
Okay.

465
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,140
How long has it been since
you've been on a blind date?

466
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,060
-A blind date?
-Yes.

467
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,020
-Was it six months?
-Goodness.

468
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:54,520
Your father felt so bad for you

469
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,980
that he put a lot of romance
at the end of his work.

470
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,600
Isn't that it? He wanted to
give you vicarious satisfaction.

471
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,100
He probably did.

472
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,980
He's here.

473
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,560
Isn't he handsome?

474
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,770
-Handsome?
-He's so manly.

475
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,140
Dr Park, this is...

476
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,520
He graduated law school top of his class.

477
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,100
Besides, nobody can be tall, handsome
and smart at the same time.

478
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,520
At least he's really smart.

479
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,810
There might be a man
who fulfils all three criteria.

480
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,480
Do you mean me?

481
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,060
-Doctor.
-Here.

482
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,480
-Have a seat. Yes.
-Have you been well?

483
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,350
This is Ms Oh Yeon-joo,
a cardiothoracic surgery resident.

484
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,560
You can introduce yourself.

485
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,180
Hello. My name is Kim Poong-oh.

486
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,180
Hello.

487
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,810
You're totally my type.

488
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,520
Sorry.

489
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,980
Your standards are so low,

490
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,810
it's easy for me to find a girl
to introduce you.

491
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,020
He's humble, too!

492
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,230
-Am I?
-Of course.

493
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,930
You must be happy.

494
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,850
I've never seen her smiling so brightly.

495
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,390
Kang Seok-beom

496
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,180
Was washing your hair
a jackpot or a bust?

497
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,480
I'll use the ladies room.

498
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,480
Be careful.

499
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,480
-She's really beautiful.
-Is she all right?

500
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,810
-I think she's really into you.
-You think so?

501
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,730
I felt it a little, too.

502
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,890
-I lost the lottery.
-I knew it.

503
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,020
Crazy Dog must've really gone crazy.

504
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,180
I suddenly came to my senses.

505
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,850
I'll use this blind date
as a starting point

506
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:09,270
and work really hard from now on.
I'm burning with desire right now.

507
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,890
Yes. I haven't been
on a date for a long time.

508
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,730
Yes. You've been too busy
being a good daughter.

509
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,640
I'll work until the moment
I lose the lottery.

510
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:22,230
Hey, you have work to do, too.

511
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:25,480
You have to set me up with
one person a week for a month.

512
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,810
Am I indebted to you?

513
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,560
How can I set you up with
one person a week? I'm too busy.

514
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,100
-Hello?
-Hello?

515
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,480
Hello?

516
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,850
What's up with the signal? Hello?

517
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,230
I read it, too.

518
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,180
So that Oh Yeon-joo is

519
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:09,230
It's his daughter.
He used his daughter's name.

520
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,350
His daughter? That's amazing.

521
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,180
He got lucky.
He was never going to be saved.

522
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,640
But he was lucky enough
to meet the greatest doctor.

523
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,180
If it weren't for me What is this?

524
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,230
What's up with your hair?

525
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,930
Please lend me your phone.

526
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,890
-What happened to you?
-Please lend me your phone.

527
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,810
You can use my phone.

528
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,350
Did you get doused with water?
Did the water pipe explode?

529
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,770
To be continued

530
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,480
Thank you.

531
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:58,640
-Hey! Where are you going?
-Bye.

532
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,310
Soo-bong.

533
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,430
Draw the eyes a little bigger.

534
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,020
Ma'am.

535
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,730
If the eyes get any bigger,
they'll take over half the face.

536
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:25,560
-It's better to make the nose big
-Be quiet.

537
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:28,390
You haven't adjusted to my style yet.

538
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:33,140
Characters in my work
should have eyes as big as these.

539
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:38,560
They cannot escape
from the world of emotions.

540
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,730
Keep drawing.

541
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,390
Still, isn't it better to
make the nose bigger?

542
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:47,930
I'll get the door.
Make the eyes this big.

543
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,350
Expand them.

544
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:50,730
Who is it?

545
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,430
She's lost her mind.

546
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,640
-Hello.
-Is Soo-bong here?

547
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,020
Who are you? Goodness.

548
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,850
What happened to you?

549
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,600
-Is it raining outside?
-Let's talk.

550
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,520
Wait. Let me ask
I'll be right back.

551
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:12,180
What's going on?
Could you let go of my arm first?

552
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,230
What brings you here?

553
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,100
Did you find his dead body?

554
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,640
No. Please save Kang Chul.

555
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,390
-What?
-Please save him.

556
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,060
I think it's possible.

557
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,350
What do you mean? Isn't it over?

558
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,270
Time didn't pass. It stopped.

559
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,480
"The end" meant that the time
stopped in the last scene.

560
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,230
He's still in the river right now
suspended in time.

561
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:39,730
-How do you know?
-I saw him.

562
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:43,020
I saw him in the water a moment ago.

563
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:51,230
So you went in the water.

564
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:56,180
Yes, I saw it just now.

565
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,640
I don't know.

566
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,810
I couldn't get a hold of Mr Oh.

567
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,770
So you're saying the editors
didn't change it?

568
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,980
I don't know.
I'm not in charge of it either.

569
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:10,310
Editor Park is on vacation,
but people keep calling

570
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:11,930
and posting messages.

571
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,310
What do I do?

572
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,100
Is the webtoon continuing?
Did I read it wrong?

573
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,100
-That's awesome.
-I look forward to what's next.

574
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,730
I don't want any more extreme endings.

575
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:24,680
Did the artist come back to senses?
Bring Kang Chul back to life.

576
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:26,270
You must have gotten better, Mr Oh.

577
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:30,100
I believed in you despite
what others said. You can do it.

578
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:35,560
That's not possible
because Mr Oh went to New Zealand.

579
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,890
I'll call him in the morning since
he'll arrive then.

580
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,600
I haven't called him yet.

581
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,890
Okay.

582
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,310
I fixed the computer Dad used.

583
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:47,350
Can you use it to draw?

584
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,020
Are you sure Mr Oh didn't do it?

585
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,930
He's on a plane right now,
so how could he?

586
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,310
He said he couldn't fix it either.

587
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:56,680
Are you saying "The end" changed to

588
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:59,980
"To be continued" by itself? Why?

589
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,520
I have no idea.

590
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,310
I can't understand this.
The story is over.

591
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,180
He doesn't get killed without context.
He kills himself willingly,

592
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,020
so why won't it end?

593
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:16,270
There must be a reason why
the webtoon can't end yet.

594
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,060
A reason why it can't end?
What is it?

595
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,350
Wait a minute.

596
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,350
There's someone over there.

597
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,350
What are you talking about?

598
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,850
Isn't he going to jump off?

599
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,730
No way.

600
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,390
-Let's go over there.
-Okay.

601
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,520
Excuse me, sir.

602
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,560
Why are you standing there?
It's dangerous.

603
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,020
Excuse me, sir.

604
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,640
What's the reason?

605
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:05,100
-I'm asking what the reason is.
-Soo-bong.

606
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,140
The reason isn't important right now.
Saving Kang Chul is.

607
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:12,230
This means we must
save the main character.

608
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,600
He can't save himself,
so the webtoon can't continue.

609
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,060
He doesn't want to
come back to life either.

610
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:20,770
-That's why we have to save him.
-What's with you?

611
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,060
Time didn't pass.

612
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:26,520
It stopped at the last moment,

613
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,140
so anything is possible. Look.

614
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,060
That's right.

615
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:33,680
We should draw a police boat
in the first scene.

616
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:37,560
A police boat happens to pass by
Han River Bridge then.

617
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:41,430
Draw a diver on the boat as well.

618
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,600
If the diver jumps right in,
he can be rescued.

619
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,270
His death isn't confirmed.
We only see him in the water,

620
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,850
so we can wake him up.

621
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,730
We can assume that he hasn't died yet.

622
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:56,020
Wait a minute.
Just a moment.

623
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,310
You're not telling me
to draw it, are you?

624
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,930
-You're the only one who can draw.
-No, I can't.

625
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,600
I don't think it'll work.

626
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,520
I mean I can't do it.

627
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,100
It's Mr Oh's work.

628
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,140
I can make it look similar,
but it won't be the same.

629
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,230
I've told you many times
that there's a difference,

630
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:16,480
-so talk to Mr Oh when he comes back.
-He won't do it.

631
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:19,520
He won't ever draw it because of me.

632
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,180
He's afraid I'll get dragged in again.

633
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:27,390
That's right! You just came back
from being in Han River, didn't you?

634
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,770
I shouldn't draw you again.

635
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:32,270
-You even escaped from jail last time.
-That's not the issue right now.

636
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:33,930
Can't you understand me?

637
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,890
There's nothing else more important
than saving Chul right now.

638
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,390
Sure.

639
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:45,810
It's true that Chul shot Dad,

640
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,180
and it can't be forgiven.

641
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:51,020
It's true that this cursed webtoon
should be over,

642
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:54,060
and it's also true that
I shouldn't get dragged in again,

643
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:56,310
but Dad is still alive.

644
00:54:56,810 --> 00:55:00,100
He got much better
and is on a trip with his friends.

645
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,770
You and I are both fine
as if nothing happened.

646
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:05,980
And the readers?

647
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,180
They'll only be temporarily upset.

648
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,230
He's just a webtoon character after all.

649
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,680
However, only Chul...

650
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:16,890
...has been blaming himself of being
a murderer in that cold river

651
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,350
for over two months already.

652
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,140
Isn't that cruel?

653
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,100
And...

654
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,600
...what about me?

655
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,600
I think all of this happened
because of me.

656
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,560
Yeon-joo...

657
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,680
I'm asking you to save him first.

658
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,390
I beg you.

659
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:59,390
Goodness.

660
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:06,180
Yeon-joo, I don't think it will work
even if I draw it. I'm not Mr Oh.

661
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:08,390
You worked with him for three years.

662
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,270
This is Dad's tablet computer,

663
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:14,770
where everything first started.

664
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,770
Fine! I'll try it. I'll try.

665
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:32,140
I'll try it. My goodness.

666
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,810
Wait a second.

667
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,350
Gosh, my eyes hurt.

668
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,430
Why isn't it working?

669
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,730
This is not working!

670
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,100
It's been an hour since I finished
drawing, but nothing happened.

671
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,100
If it's working, something should change

672
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,480
like the next scene
drawing itself or something.

673
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:17,640
I told you I couldn't do it.

674
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,350
This isn't my work.
I was only his assistant.

675
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,640
If it was possible by
having anyone draw it,

676
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,770
any fan would bring him alive already.

677
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,060
Just ask Mr Oh to do it
when he comes back.

678
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:34,180
Dad won't do it especially
after finding out what happened today.

679
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:36,100
Yeon-joo. Please.

680
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:40,600
There's no other way
than having Mr Oh draw it.

681
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:44,730
I'm getting exhausted.

682
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:47,480
Is there any food?

683
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,520
I'm hungry.

684
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,100
Dad won't ever do it.

685
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:03,640
I'm cooking some ramyeon.
Do you want some?

686
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,640
She doesn't even answer me

687
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,930
after making me do all the work.

688
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:12,100
Why did Mr Oh leave...

689
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:24,060
-I don't want ramyeon.
-Forget the ramyeon.

690
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,680
Do you remember?

691
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:32,980
I think I heard it
a long time ago from Mr Oh.

692
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,310
Something about "W."

693
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:37,020
Did you...

694
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,520
Someone's in here!

695
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,640
The one who broke out is here!

696
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,600
Over here!

697
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:10,930
Life is sometimes

698
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,230
-Someone jumped off.
-He fell in the water.

699
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:17,310
-Hurry and rescue him.
-Okay.

700
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,180
Freeze! Don't move!

701
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:31,890
The end.

702
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:35,100
To be continued.

703
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,430
W-Two Worlds

704
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:49,020
I brought you back to life.

705
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,890
From now on, let's think of this
as a sequel we're making together.

706
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:55,140
Who are you to decide
what to do with my life?

707
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:57,020
Because I love you.

708
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:00,180
Married? Are you saying
we're married already?

709
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,100
I'm giving up on
finding the true criminal.

710
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:04,770
The criminal is looking for me.

711
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:07,810
This isn't the sequel I was hoping for.

712
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:11,560
I was afraid I'd never be able
to see you again.
