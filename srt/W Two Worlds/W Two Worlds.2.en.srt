1
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,830
W – Two Worlds

2
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,150
Korea's best webtoon
with a sale of 10 million copies.

3
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,510
It's "W."

4
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,810
The lead character, Kang Chul
is an Olympic gold medallist in Shooting.

5
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,030
Kang Chul wins gold
for Men's 50m Pistol

6
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,550
His entire family
is mysteriously murdered.

7
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,830
I strongly urge that Kang Chul
be given the maximum penalty.

8
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,670
Chul is sentenced to death for parricide,

9
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,950
but he's eventually declared innocent.

10
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,430
Having fallen into the bottomless pit,
he decides to kill himself.

11
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,910
In that very moment,

12
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,870
he decided to choose life instead.

13
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,310
Chul becomes a multimillionaire
with wealth grossing 800 million dollars.

14
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,590
While looking for his family's real murderer,

15
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,430
he gets a suspicious call.

16
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,790
-Mr Oh disappeared.
-What?

17
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,510
Meanwhile, the artist of famous
webtoon "W", Oh Seong-moo disappears.

18
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,920
Then his daughter, Oh Yeon-joo
gets dragged by someone

19
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,470
and ends up saving Chul's life.

20
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,550
To Chul, Yeon-joo is a mysterious woman
who disappeared after saving him.

21
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,210
What is that now?

22
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,910
Oh Yeon-joo. Where are you right now?

23
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,830
He starts looking for her.

24
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,560
Kang Chul is alive.
He's alive and looking for me.

25
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,270
A different world exists in "W."
The world where Kang Chul lives.

26
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,550
Episode 2

27
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,990
Oh, dear.

28
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,670
I'm here.

29
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,950
It's pouring outside.

30
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,950
They said it will rain all night.

31
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,180
Yeon-joo, let's eat.

32
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,690
This is seriously good.

33
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,050
Yeon-joo

34
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,870
Geez, seriously.

35
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,890
-Hello?
-Soo-bong, I think...

36
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,840
Why do you think so much?
Stop thinking now.

37
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,770
Dad didn't run away from home.
He got kidnapped.

38
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,810
By who?

39
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,350
Dad was drawing that night...

40
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,230
and got dragged into the webtoon
just like me!

41
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,670
Dad is still stuck in there!

42
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,230
I don't know who kidnapped him,
but that's why he's out of reach.

43
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,670
No matter how much
we wait for him, he won't...

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,230
Please, Yeon-joo.

45
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,350
Stop already. How can Mr Oh
get dragged into the webtoon?

46
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,920
You're being ridiculous.

47
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,690
You said you don't understand
how Dad got out of the room!

48
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,200
Even so, how can you think
he got dragged into the webtoon?

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,520
That's completely rubbish.

50
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,840
We drew everything.

51
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,160
I drew each background with my own hands.

52
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,240
They are just pictures.
What can exist in the pictures?

53
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,000
And I know he drew them.

54
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,240
Do you think I can't even
recognise his drawing?

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,000
He's the only one who can
draw the characters.

56
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,640
No one can draw
the characters like he does.

57
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,610
And I know him better than you!

58
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,560
Yeon-joo?

59
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,090
Are you there?

60
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,980
Now I know
how Galileo Galilei must've felt.

61
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,500
Galilei? What?

62
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,990
He coined the phrase,
"And yet it moves."

63
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,480
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

64
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,760
Jang-geum said it, too.

65
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,160
"I said it tastes like persimmon
because it tastes like persimmon."

66
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Mr Oh?

67
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,560
-Mr Oh!
-Mr Oh.

68
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,080
-Where are you going?
-I'm leaving.

69
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,960
You should eat first. You said
you have to be there until 7 AM.

70
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm late. I got an emergency call.

71
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,480
-I'm going. Bye.
-Yeon-joo.

72
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,170
Yeon-joo! Yeon-joo!

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,720
My goodness.

74
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,160
She's so busy, it's like she's my boss
rather than my daughter.

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,680
Gosh.

76
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,520
When will she finish her residency,
open her hospital and pay us back?

77
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,200
Maybe you should've just
let her major in art.

78
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,320
We shouldn't have sent her
to medical school.

79
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,720
By the way,
Seong-moo is a hot star now!

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,240
I heard he gets royalties
worth millions of dollars!

81
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,280
You should've been more patient
and not divorced him.

82
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,200
If you had endured for a while more,

83
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,600
your later years would be so good
and you'd be living a comfortable life.

84
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,900
-Just eat.
-Okay.

85
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,680
-You're here.
-Where's Dad?

86
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,000
He's in the room.

87
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,680
Yeon-joo.

88
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,280
I told you.
Stop having wild fantasies.

89
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,440
Where has he been all along?

90
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,280
By the way, he lost a little weight.

91
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,840
Dad.

92
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,640
Dad?

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,240
I'm here.

94
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,480
Hey. You're here, Yeon-joo.

95
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,920
What happened?
I was worried about you.

96
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,520
Where have you been?
Why were you out of reach?

97
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,960
I went around for a bit.

98
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,640
Where did you go?

99
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,200
Different places.

100
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,160
How about you?

101
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,560
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

102
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,990
I'm...

103
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,710
...not hurt.

104
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,270
-Why do you ask?
-Never mind.

105
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,750
It's good as long as you're fine.

106
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,270
By the way, Dad.

107
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,150
-It's about "W."
-Yes?

108
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,870
I heard from Soo-bong.

109
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,150
I heard you've been saying
strange things.

110
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,510
I needed to come up
with a new female character.

111
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,070
I couldn't think of any,
so I just made it in your liking.

112
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,750
It's easier, too.
Is that strange?

113
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,310
Did you really draw that, Dad?

114
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,640
Did you really draw
the last two episodes?

115
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,230
Who else would draw them?

116
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,750
Actually...

117
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,890
If it wasn't me,

118
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,910
who would it be, then?

119
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,070
What are you trying to say?

120
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,310
It's nothing.

121
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,230
It's nothing.

122
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,070
Aren't you supposed
to be at the hospital?

123
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,420
Why did you come here?
You should go.

124
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,190
Okay.

125
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,150
I have to start working again.

126
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,470
-You should rest for a while.
-I'm tired.

127
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,910
I'm so tired of it

128
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,470
that I want to finish it quickly
and rest.

129
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,830
Let's meet again when I feel better.

130
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,870
Okay.

131
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,190
How's your mum? Is she well?

132
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,430
She's always the same.

133
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,270
Say hi to her for me.

134
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,150
See yourself out.

135
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,630
Okay.

136
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,030
Cheer up, Dad.

137
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,830
My professor is your fan, too.

138
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,350
I'll get going.

139
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,310
Yeon-joo, would you like
to have breakfast with us?

140
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,070
I have to go to work.

141
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,310
Soo-bong.

142
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,310
Did my dad say anything
about where he was?

143
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,430
No, he didn't.

144
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,390
What about how he got out
of the room unnoticed?

145
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,510
He said he'll start drawing right away,
so we'll be working all night.

146
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,510
Thank you. I'll get going now.

147
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,870
-Okay.
-See you, Yeon-joo.

148
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,110
-Bye.
-Can't you stay and eat?

149
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,670
-Bye, Yeon-joo.
-Bye.

150
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,350
-I'll see you soon.
-Take care.

151
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,270
Be careful. It's raining.

152
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,590
Use an umbrella.

153
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,590
Soo-bong.

154
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,510
Yes, sir.

155
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,830
Yes, sir?

156
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,270
Do a research on poison.

157
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,710
Poison, sir?

158
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,910
Those that can be easily found
in hospitals.

159
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,630
Okay.

160
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,910
Myungsei University Medical Centre

161
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,230
The rain is making me crave
a cup of coffee.

162
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,310
Not this cheap one, but a good one.

163
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,710
I want some cake.

164
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,270
Cafe Bonjour has the best tiramisu.

165
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,390
Bonjour sounds great.

166
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,750
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
The loser goes to pick up some food.

167
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,790
Forget it. I'll go.

168
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,790
Yeon-joo, what can I get you?

169
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,790
Being nice isn't something we do.
What's wrong with you?

170
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,550
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

171
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,390
-Yeon-joo, you lost.
-You lost.

172
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,590
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

173
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,070
-Hey.
-Gosh.

174
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,870
-Go.
-Go where?

175
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,230
You're acting strange recently.

176
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,950
Gosh, you startled me.
Did someone page me?

177
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,190
We played a game and you lost.
Go buy some food at Bonjour.

178
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,630
Soo-bong, are you busy?

179
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,510
Soo-bong, are you busy?

180
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,750
I can still talk.

181
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,990
Hello, Yeon-joo?

182
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,950
Is Dad still working?

183
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,150
Yes.

184
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,030
What is this week's episode about?

185
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,070
I think he is going to...

186
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,310
...kill Chul again.

187
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,270
What?

188
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,630
Hello?

189
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,270
Yes.

190
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,190
No one's in his room
except for his bodyguard.

191
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,950
You want me to do it now?

192
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,390
Potassium
Handle with care

193
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,670
He's working on it right now.

194
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,550
He's drawing a scene where someone
tells a nurse to inject drug into Chul.

195
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,070
Who is telling the nurse?

196
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,430
I don't know.
He orders it through the phone.

197
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,870
How?

198
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,430
Instead of administering antibiotics,

199
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,020
she'll inject potassium into him.

200
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,190
Potassium?

201
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,430
She'll stop his heart
by injecting it into his IV?

202
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,420
Yes. I looked it up
and it seemed like the easiest way.

203
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,870
Potassium
Handle with care

204
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,870
Your three cups of latte
and three pieces of tiramisu are ready.

205
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,630
Thank you.

206
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,150
I should stop thinking about it.

207
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,790
Dad is home and fine.

208
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,550
It's just a cartoon.

209
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,830
He's just a cartoon character.
It's fine even if he dies.

210
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,630
Goodness.

211
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,270
Hello?

212
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,200
Dad, are you working?

213
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,450
Yes. What is it?

214
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,550
I'm so sorry to bother you.

215
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,920
Are you going to kill Chul?

216
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,540
Why? Why do you have to kill him?

217
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,670
You're meddling in my work now?

218
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,390
I just feel bad.

219
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,870
Why does he have to die
when he did nothing wrong?

220
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,430
That's unfair. He needed to find
the person who killed his family.

221
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,190
It has been his goal for 10 years.

222
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,110
He didn't catch the criminal
nor take his revenge.

223
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,610
Why does he have to die?
He's the main character.

224
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,410
Who says the main character always
succeed in revenge before he dies?

225
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,340
I make the story.

226
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,910
Still, that's not fair, Dad.

227
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,550
Saving him would be meaningless
if you kill him again.

228
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,390
He barely avoided death.

229
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,630
If you kill him again
after only two episodes,

230
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,770
the readers would think it's absurd.

231
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,120
So why did you do something unnecessary?

232
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,310
Dad?

233
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,700
What do you mean by that?

234
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,150
You just said I did something unnecessary.

235
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,350
It's nothing.

236
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,910
By "something unnecessary,"

237
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,140
you mean saving Chul, right?

238
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,870
What on earth are you talking about?

239
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,150
You know about this too, don't you?

240
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,130
You know that I saved Chul's life.
You didn't draw that scene, did you?

241
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,120
Are you out of your mind?

242
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,870
If I'm wrong, please explain.

243
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,510
How did you know
what I was wearing that day?

244
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,270
The character looked exactly like me
from head to toe.

245
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,170
I never wore those clothes before.

246
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,830
You saw him too, didn't you?

247
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,860
Chul is an actual living person.

248
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,630
I saw him.

249
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,670
His blood was hot
and his heart was beating.

250
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,390
The way he looked at me
is still vivid in my mind.

251
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,370
I saw him with my own eyes.
But how? How can he be real?

252
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,590
It doesn't make any sense.
How is he a real person?

253
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,070
That's why.

254
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,350
That's why I have to take his life
right now.

255
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,990
You can't! That's murder!

256
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,150
What did you just say? Murder?

257
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,430
I don't know what is happening,
but he is alive.

258
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,750
If you kill someone who's alive,
that's murder, Dad!

259
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,760
Dad, we have to talk.
I'll come over now. Hello?

260
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,430
The number you have dialled
is not available...

261
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,710
-Hello?
-The tax deducted from...

262
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,390
What's wrong with my phone?

263
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,710
-Gosh.
-They won't get their money back.

264
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,550
The economy hasn't recovered yet.

265
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,350
They decided to keep deducting taxes

266
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,990
since the economy may stagnate even more.

267
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,310
It's been 10 days
since President Kang Chul was attacked.

268
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,710
The police are having difficulties
with the investigation

269
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,790
as no evidence are found yet.

270
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,910
They're looking for a female doctor,
who was the only witness around.

271
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,470
The doctor is believed to be
in her late 20s to early 30s.

272
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,110
That's the only information
the police have so far.

273
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,190
Meanwhile, Hankuk Sungjin Hospital
revealed that

274
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,510
President Kang's surgery
was a success

275
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,390
-and he's showing a fast recovery.
-Kang Chul.

276
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,390
Myungsei University Medical Centre

277
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,110
Can I use a picture
of Myungsei University Medical Centre

278
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,390
for Hankuk Sungjin Hospital?

279
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,950
Yes, sure.

280
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,310
Okay.

281
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,230
Hankuk Sungjin Hospital

282
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,270
Wait!

283
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,830
Please take me
to Hankuk Sungjin Hospital.

284
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,590
-What?
-How long does it take? Is it far?

285
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,630
What are you talking about?
Hankuk Sungjin Hospital is right there.

286
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,570
No, it's not. That's Myungsei
University Medical Centre.

287
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,040
Hankuk Sungjin Hospital

288
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,790
This is our hospital.

289
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,190
How can it be this similar?

290
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,470
I'll administer some antibiotics.

291
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,230
-Where is So-hee?
-She's talking to the employees.

292
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,230
Isn't President Kang hospitalised here?
Which room is he in?

293
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,700
Oh Yeon-joo

294
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,550
I'm sorry. I cannot tell you
for security reasons.

295
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,430
This is an urgent matter.

296
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,990
Hankuk Sungjin Hospital
Centre of Excellence for five years

297
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,270
Myungsei University Medical Centre

298
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,200
That's right. This hospital has exactly
the same structure as ours.

299
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,070
-Didn't you take a week off?
-I couldn't.

300
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,070
It's better not to take it.

301
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,630
-Please let me in.
-No, you are not allowed.

302
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,510
Oh, no. Please. Stop it.

303
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,430
Are you okay?

304
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,950
Are you okay?

305
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,470
-What is the problem?
-I'm asking if you are okay.

306
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,510
-What is the problem?
-This isn't antibiotics.

307
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,590
It's potassium.
It causes a heart attack.

308
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,830
Mr Seo, what's wrong?

309
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,390
Who is the nurse in charge?
Call security and lock the ward down.

310
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,510
Yes, sir.

311
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,550
When did she administer the shot?

312
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,670
Just before you came in.

313
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,710
Then it's okay.
There shouldn't be a problem.

314
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,830
How did you know about this?

315
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,070
Sorry?

316
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,030
I was just passing by.
It was just by chance.

317
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,350
The nurse looked suspicious.

318
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,710
What happened?

319
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,310
-Nurse Jeong changed the medicine?
-I think it was potassium.

320
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,030
Since your attending doctor is here,
I'll get going now.

321
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,670
Yeon-joo.

322
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,950
You're Oh Yeon-joo, right?

323
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,510
No, I'm not.

324
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,550
It says Oh Yeon-joo there.

325
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,430
Oh Yeon-joo

326
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,840
She's Oh Yeon-joo?
The woman who...

327
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,140
We finally meet, Yeon-joo.

328
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,170
We finally meet, Yeon-joo.

329
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,870
-Do you work here?
-No, I don't.

330
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,110
Well, yes.

331
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,390
But why does your business card say
Myungsei University Medical Centre?

332
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,390
Well, that's because...

333
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,030
...I used to work here before.
I don't anymore, though.

334
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,470
-I work at Myungsei now.
-That hospital doesn't exist.

335
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,710
Pardon?

336
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,330
No, it doesn't because it closed down.

337
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,550
-Did it close down?
-Yes, it did.

338
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,280
So that means I'm currently unemployed.

339
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,550
What brings you here, then?
It's not your workplace.

340
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,720
-Pardon?
-How on earth did you end up here?

341
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,430
That's...

342
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,710
You looked for me.

343
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,190
I saw it on the news that you
were looking for the witness.

344
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,830
I thought you came here by chance.

345
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,830
I accidentally saw the passing nurse.
She looked really suspicious.

346
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:01,920
It's not that I came here by chance.
I originally came here to see you.

347
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,230
That's right.

348
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,390
What happened?

349
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,950
I just heard. Why would
the nurse do that? Are you okay?

350
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,430
Isn't she Yoon So-hee?

351
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,510
That's right, she's the heroine.

352
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,590
Kang Chul's friend
and personal assistant.

353
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,590
In that case,

354
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,710
that man should be...

355
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,590
...Seo Do-yoon.

356
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,180
He used to do martial arts.
He's Kang Chul's right-hand man.

357
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,710
Is she...

358
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,510
...Ms Oh Yeon-joo?

359
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,550
Yes.

360
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,670
How can we meet like this?

361
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,870
We've been looking for you.

362
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,230
Hello. I'm Yoon So-hee,
President Kang's personal assistant.

363
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,870
Hello.

364
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,070
Why have you been out of reach
all this time?

365
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,590
Do you work at this hospital?

366
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,350
Myungsei University Medical Centre
doesn't exist.

367
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,310
She just explained about that.

368
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,150
Oh, did she?

369
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,470
By the way, she's really beautiful.

370
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,830
She's a beauty.

371
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,430
We drew up the wrong identikit
because of you.

372
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,790
Yes, she's beautiful.
I didn't say anything about it.

373
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,240
If she's beautiful,
everyone is beautiful.

374
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,630
I'm speechless.

375
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,590
You don't need to say empty words.

376
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,670
You said if I'm beautiful,
then everyone is beautiful.

377
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,750
What should I do?
I read that in the webtoon.

378
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,950
Was that directed to President Kang?

379
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,350
How did you know about that?

380
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,180
Well, that's...

381
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,910
I'm sorry,

382
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,350
but can I talk to him alone?

383
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,910
Pardon?

384
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,870
-You and me?
-Yes.

385
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,690
Just us.
I have something to tell you.

386
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,070
Please go outside.

387
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,770
But President Kang, that's a bit...

388
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,350
We aren't sure about her identity yet.

389
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,300
Why do we need identity clearance
when she saved my life?

390
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,560
Is there any better way
to check her identity?

391
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,910
The police will be here soon.
We'll talk more about this later.

392
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,430
Let us know when you're done.
We'll be outside.

393
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,270
-Isn't she suspicious?
-She's suspicious.

394
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,150
How did she know about today's incident?

395
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,710
She couldn't know about it
unless she's close to the suspect.

396
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,190
That's right.

397
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,630
And how did she know
what Chul said about her looks?

398
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,590
Did you tell her?

399
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,510
Do you think I'm crazy?

400
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,790
What is it that you want to tell me?

401
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,470
You said that I saved your life, right?

402
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,750
Of course.

403
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,670
Then you can help me, right?

404
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,590
Of course.
I will compensate you, too.

405
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,710
You don't need to compensate me.

406
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,670
Just help me get out of here quietly.

407
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,390
I can't get investigated by the police.

408
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,910
I can't testify either.

409
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,830
Why is that?

410
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,710
I'm not in the situation to do that.

411
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,190
You're not in the situation?
Are you an illegal immigrant?

412
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,870
Don't ask me the reason.

413
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,030
You said I saved your life.
You could help me with that.

414
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,310
Even though you're my saviour,
I can't do that.

415
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,710
I don't know anything about you,

416
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,750
and the police are suspecting you
to be the accomplice.

417
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,950
You should talk to the police
to prove your innocence.

418
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,950
You know well that
I'm not the accomplice.

419
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,310
What makes you so sure?

420
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,830
Your instinct tells you so.

421
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,350
Your instinct knows.

422
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,590
It seems you know me well.

423
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,590
You know how I thought
of your looks, too.

424
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,310
Yes. I know about you well.

425
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,620
You think that I might be
the key to your life.

426
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,110
Yeon-joo, who are you?

427
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,830
If you want to know, let me go right now.

428
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,790
I will tell you next time.

429
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,100
I just can't tell you right now.

430
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,270
You negotiate well.

431
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,710
It's not a negotiation.

432
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,910
I'm asking you a favour.

433
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,240
There's a reason I have to get out.

434
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,070
Wait a minute.

435
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,070
Why is he asking us to go down?

436
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,350
I don't know.
Maybe he has a secret to tell us.

437
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,910
You better tell me everything next time.

438
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,630
When is that next time?

439
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,030
You should make a promise.
Then I will let you go.

440
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,950
There are many things I'm curious about.

441
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,470
I'm not sure.

442
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,750
Perhaps when you get discharged.

443
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,070
When I get discharged? Okay.

444
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,110
Your mobile number is fake.

445
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,190
Take this.
I have several mobile phones.

446
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,790
I will call you when I get discharged.

447
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,680
If this is to track my location,
I have to tell you it's useless.

448
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,110
I won't do that to someone
who saved my life.

449
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,750
You said you know me well.

450
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,830
You just have to keep your promise.

451
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,350
I trust you.
That's why I'm letting you go.

452
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,270
How would you know I will?

453
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,550
My instinct tells me.

454
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,750
The door is closing.

455
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,990
You can go out now.

456
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,550
Wait.

457
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,670
I take back what I said.

458
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,550
It was dark that night,
so I didn't realise it.

459
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,710
I take back what I said about you
not being beautiful.

460
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,790
It must've bothered you.

461
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,350
Yes. A lot.

462
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,790
You still don't think I'm beautiful, do you?

463
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,110
I told you I know you well.

464
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,950
I know that you compliment girls generously

465
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,590
when you're not interested in them.

466
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,190
That's interesting.

467
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,510
I'm excited for our next meeting.

468
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,710
You should go now.
The police are coming up.

469
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,710
-Well, then.
-See you next time.

470
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,990
Follow me.

471
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,150
Please get in.

472
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,870
Right.

473
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,690
Hankuk Sungjin Hospital Station

474
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,390
My stomach hurts.

475
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,670
How do I go home?

476
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,430
How do I go back now?

477
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,950
How did it go last time?

478
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,950
I remember...

479
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,630
What's this now?

480
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,470
Right. "To be continued" came up.

481
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:31,190
That became the webtoon's ending cut.

482
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,390
I went back when the webtoon ended. Right.

483
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,710
Did I stay about half an hour last time?

484
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,430
Let's wait a little more.

485
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,630
I think it's only been a while.

486
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:58,230
Hankuk Sungjin Hospital Station

487
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,630
What's this?

488
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,200
It's already past 30 minutes.
Why isn't anything happening?

489
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,790
What? What?

490
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,150
What?

491
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,180
Hankuk Sungjin Hospital

492
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,470
What?

493
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,910
Oh, my gosh!

494
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,310
-Hello?
-Yeon-joo?

495
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,630
How are you? We should meet.

496
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,350
-What?
-Do you have time today?

497
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,070
-What?
-Where are you right now?

498
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,230
Seoul?

499
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,070
-Yes.
-Where?

500
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,230
The bus stop near the hospital.

501
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,750
I will be there soon.

502
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,510
Hello? Hello?

503
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,350
What is going on?

504
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,790
What...

505
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,590
What on earth is happening to me?

506
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,510
How have you been, Yeon-joo?

507
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,550
Why are you here?

508
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,350
I just got discharged.

509
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,590
What? Already?

510
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,030
You're already well?

511
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:21,650
What do you mean already?
I was in bed for two months.

512
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,790
What? Two months have passed?

513
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,950
Get in.

514
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,310
Why?

515
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,230
We can't talk in the street.
Let's talk elsewhere.

516
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,070
Let's grab lunch.
What would you like?

517
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,310
Anything is fine.

518
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,510
How have you been?

519
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,910
How have I been?
It's only been half an hour.

520
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,790
What's new with you?

521
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:30,590
There can't be anything new with me.
It's only been half an hour!

522
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,510
This can't be right.
It can't be after two months.

523
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,030
But he looks totally fine.

524
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,470
It seems like he's healed.

525
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,710
I'll take you to a place I frequent.
Is that okay?

526
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,950
Goodness.

527
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,750
Maybe this is it.

528
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,630
This is a webtoon, right?

529
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,510
Wouldn't the time go
as fast as needed for the story?

530
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,590
That's right.
Chul is the lead character.

531
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,190
We don't need scenes where the
lead character isn't doing anything.

532
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,870
So it skipped the time
when he was in the hospital.

533
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,110
I think that's it.

534
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,110
What about me? What happened to me?

535
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,590
Did I go missing for two months, then?

536
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,830
-Aren't you hot?
-Excuse me?

537
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,190
Weather forecast said it will be
29 degrees Celsius outside today.

538
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,390
I see.

539
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,870
You haven't been sleeping
out in the open, have you?

540
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,550
No.

541
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,990
I think you wore the same clothes
two months ago.

542
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,470
Here's our stop.

543
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,070
My company will officially
compensate you,

544
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,190
but I have to buy you
summer clothes first.

545
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,710
No, thanks. I'm fine.

546
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:47,630
-You look very hot.
-No, not at all.

547
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,230
You have sweat on your forehead.

548
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,910
You can pick anything you like.

549
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,950
What should I do now?

550
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,270
If I knew I'd see him in 30 minutes,
I wouldn't have agreed to meet him.

551
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:29,950
I wouldn't have answered the phone.
What do I do?

552
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,950
You still haven't heard
from Oh Yeon-joo, have you?

553
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,070
You were a fool to trust your instinct.

554
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,230
You let the criminal go.
You're an idiot.

555
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,030
Chul

556
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,030
I'm with Yeon-joo right now.

557
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,990
Why is one episode so long?

558
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,750
I was here less than 30 minutes
last time.

559
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:02,430
It's been two months.
Why isn't it over yet?

560
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,470
What if the time keeps
on running like this?

561
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:09,790
That's right.
This is a serial webtoon.

562
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,270
This is a serial webtoon.

563
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,950
Doesn't it need something
to end the episode?

564
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:18,510
That's right. Something should
happen to the lead character.

565
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,430
An incident which can be
the ending scene.

566
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,270
An incident.

567
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,350
What kind of incident?

568
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,750
Hello?

569
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,750
Hi. How did you meet her so soon?

570
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,270
She was near the hospital.

571
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,750
Not yet. I had to stop by
at some place.

572
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,070
No. You don't have to come.

573
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,270
Hold on.

574
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,230
It looks good on you.
Why don't you...

575
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,910
Hello, Chul?

576
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,030
That woman is crazy.

577
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,510
-What did she just do?
-Goodness.

578
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,110
This is shocking, right?

579
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,630
She's crazy.

580
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,750
This can be an ending scene, right?

581
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:13,670
-I can't believe it.
-What a strange woman!

582
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,710
-Why did she do that?
-She's crazy.

583
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,830
What is this? Was I wrong?

584
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,270
What was that for?

585
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,510
Why do I have to get slapped
for buying you clothes?

586
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,150
-Oh, dear.
-What does this mean?

587
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,910
That's...

588
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,310
I'm sorry.

589
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:43,830
Yeon-joo.

590
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,470
You must have reasons
for slapping someone.

591
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,790
If that didn't work...

592
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:52,830
Yeon-joo?

593
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:54,790
Maybe...

594
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,550
Would this work?

595
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,270
-Look at them.
-What is she doing?

596
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:07,910
-What is this?
-What are they doing?

597
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,870
-Goodness.
-I can't believe this.

598
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,750
-Why would she do that?
-Gosh.

599
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,910
-What's wrong with her?
-What is this?

600
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,950
-She's crazy.
-Who is she?

601
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:21,270
What should I do?
This isn't working either.

602
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:23,790
What...

603
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,590
Why did she kiss him after slapping him?

604
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,110
To be continued

605
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,510
Gosh, how absurd.

606
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,750
Hello? You got slapped?
What happened?

607
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,790
Chul, are you still there?

608
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,110
-Hello?
-Gosh, you startled me.

609
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,030
What happened?

610
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:56,950
She has this aura.

611
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,590
What kind of aura?

612
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,070
It feels like she's expressing,
"I'm the crazy witch in this area."

613
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,230
I'll call you back.

614
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,150
Yeon-joo.

615
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,510
President Kang?

616
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,390
Is there any problem?

617
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,110
Cardiothoracic surgery resident,
Oh Yeon-joo.

618
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,670
Geez, what took you so long?

619
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:57,150
Hey.

620
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,070
What are you wearing?

621
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:02,590
Oh, my. Yeon-joo. Your clothes...

622
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,110
Were you late because you went shopping?

623
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:09,270
How long was I gone for?

624
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:12,030
Goodness. About 30 minutes.

625
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:16,270
Just 30 minutes, not two months?

626
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:20,150
Did you buy those sandals, too?
Where did you buy them?

627
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,990
-All stores should be closed now.
-What?

628
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,270
What is it?

629
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,230
Goodness.

630
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:28,790
Haven't you seen it yet?

631
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,630
It's a new episode. Look.

632
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,710
-It's up already?
-Just a little while ago.

633
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:40,430
It was uploaded early today.
People are leaving comments like crazy.

634
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:44,870
They're upset and asking why Chul's
first kiss scene is with a crazy woman.

635
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:47,510
They're also upset that
it wasn't with So-hee.

636
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,510
Gosh. But...

637
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,950
I love this kind of thing.

638
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:54,430
An unexpected love story.

639
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:59,790
Please tell your father that
it made my heart flutter.

640
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,710
-Did you say a love story?
-Right.

641
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,910
I hate it when the hero and heroine
always end up together.

642
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,070
-It's so typical.
-What are you talking about?

643
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,590
He should end up with So-hee.
So-hee is amazing

644
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:15,750
-and she has a glamorous figure.
-What a pervert!

645
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:20,550
Why did you turn it off?

646
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:24,070
The screen was a bit too big.
It strangely felt weird.

647
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,790
I mean, the monitor
doesn't have to be this big.

648
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:28,150
You're the weird one.

649
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:29,870
Why are you feeling all awkward,

650
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:32,630
when it wasn't even you
who kissed Kang Chul?

651
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:36,550
Oh my, Yeon-joo.

652
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:39,430
You haven't even removed the tag yet.

653
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,550
-It's okay. I can do it myself.
-Just a second.

654
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:45,990
-Just leave it there, please.
-Did you steal it from somewhere?

655
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,110
Where are you going?
Not eating?

656
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,150
Seok-beom!

657
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,590
Do you know how much that dress is?

658
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:02,030
It's 3,550 dollars.

659
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:05,950
My gosh! This is unbelievable.

660
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:10,510
Hello?

661
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:12,310
How are you?

662
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,070
We're working on it at the moment.

663
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:17,670
What? When?

664
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,830
That's not possible.
Please wait one moment.

665
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,150
They're saying the manuscript's already
sent to the editor's office.

666
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,630
-What do you mean by that?
-Answer this.

667
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:29,710
Hello?

668
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:33,350
We haven't even finished half of it yet.

669
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,790
Yes. Who did it?

670
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,870
What is happening?
It's already up online.

671
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,870
Just a moment, please.

672
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:48,470
What? What is this?

673
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:49,910
Who did this?

674
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:52,990
No, it's not ours.

675
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,270
This is a mistake.
We are still working on it.

676
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,070
Pardon me?
Please wait a moment.

677
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,870
Mr Oh, I just received a call
from the editor's office.

678
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,350
The manuscript was...

679
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:18,710
Did you send it to them?

680
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,030
I thought there was a problem.

681
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:26,230
Okay, I got it.

682
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,710
Yes. It seems like Mr Oh sent it
to you himself.

683
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,910
Yes. He did it without telling us.

684
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:39,230
Yes, I see.

685
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,790
-Give me the phone.
-Please hold.

686
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:43,030
He wants to speak to you.

687
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,270
Hello. This is Oh Seong-moo.

688
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:47,870
Hello, Mr Oh.

689
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,030
I'm just very curious.

690
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,150
It's real fun with love scenes and all,

691
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:55,670
but it seems very different from
your usual style.

692
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,670
Delete it. I sent it by accident.

693
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:59,230
Pardon?

694
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:02,150
Take it down.
I'll send another one to you.

695
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:03,310
That's not the one.

696
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,230
Why not? It's really nice.

697
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,630
It's already attracting a lot of readers.

698
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:10,430
Take it down at once.

699
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:16,190
But Mr Oh, over 10,000 people
have already read it.

700
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:19,830
Can't you fix it in the next episode
if you're not satisfied with this one?

701
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,910
Take it down at once.
Stop babbling on!

702
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:27,990
I'll send another one by dawn.
Delete it at once.

703
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:32,470
All of you.

704
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,430
-Pack your things and go home.
-Excuse me?

705
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,990
It's going to be the last episode.

706
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,150
I can tie things up myself,
so I don't need you anymore.

707
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:49,430
I'm dismissing the team.

708
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:51,590
Go home and rest.

709
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,630
Why are you suddenly doing this?
We wish to stay until the end.

710
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:02,470
Thank you for your work.

711
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,150
Wait...

712
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:05,710
Mr Oh.

713
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:11,630
Soo-bong, why is he angry at us?

714
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:15,070
I don't understand him. Why did he
send it without telling us

715
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:17,390
only to change his mind to delete it?

716
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:20,150
Right, and how did he draw it so fast?

717
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,510
How weird.

718
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:24,830
We hadn't even finished half.
How could he within a few minutes?

719
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,510
That's right and
the content is so strange.

720
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,710
What's with the sudden kissing scene?

721
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:33,430
Mr Oh never includes
those scenes in his webtoon.

722
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,710
You're already well?
What do you mean by already?

723
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,870
Goodness.

724
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:43,790
Weather forecast said it will be
29 degrees Celsius outside today.

725
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:45,870
How can this...

726
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:48,270
Slapping

727
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,470
It even makes me speechless.

728
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:54,630
Yeon-joo?

729
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:27,230
Yeon-joo

730
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:37,990
Hello, Dad.

731
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:41,870
You saw it, too.

732
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:43,710
The new episode.

733
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:48,470
Don't pretend not to know about it.
Please just don't.

734
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:53,790
I already met Chul twice
just as you read in the webtoon.

735
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,950
I experienced it all myself.

736
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,510
I spent two months there.

737
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,710
What is happening?

738
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:03,990
Why is Chul alive?

739
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,790
-Why did you...
-You said...

740
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:08,950
it would be a murder.

741
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:13,910
I drew it. It's my artwork.

742
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:18,150
I can do whatever I wish to my webtoon.
I created everything in it after all.

743
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:19,630
And...

744
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,190
how is it murder if
the creator destroys its own creature?

745
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:25,230
It's not a murder.

746
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,470
It's called a judgment.

747
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,190
He's a monster.

748
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,430
I didn't know it at first,

749
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,710
but I've created a monster.

750
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:39,150
So I decided to judge him.
It was my mistake to create him.

751
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:44,150
How can I let him be
when he is going to eat me up?

752
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,990
I should've finished his life
a long time ago.

753
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,230
Right there at the Han River Bridge.

754
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:52,350
What are you talking about?

755
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:55,630
Forget it. What you saw today
is just an illusion.

756
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,070
Forget it all.

757
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:59,070
It's not illusion, Dad.

758
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,670
I experienced it all.

759
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,430
-How can it be illusion?
-I'm telling you to forget it!

760
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:07,070
Do you want people to call
both of us insane?

761
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:12,030
Let me be the only crazy one.

762
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,230
You stay out of it. It's dangerous.

763
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:17,870
Hello?

764
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,470
Mr Oh.

765
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,030
Mr Oh, where are you going?

766
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,390
Mr Oh!

767
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:42,630
Seok-beom, do me a favour.

768
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,830
I need to go out just for a while.

769
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,590
Where are you going
in your fancy clothes?

770
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,630
Seoinjang Motel

771
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,150
Cardiothoracic surgery resident,
Oh Yeon-joo

772
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,670
-Hello.
-What's going on?

773
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:11,070
-The manager called me just now...
-Did you hear about it?

774
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:12,910
I'm sorry, but take care of it for me.

775
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,950
Make sure the videos don't leak.

776
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:18,310
I'm on my way there, but
what video are you talking about?

777
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:19,870
The manager was very hesitant.

778
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:23,310
If you see it, you'll get mad.
Then you will swear at me.

779
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:27,630
I swear it didn't happen
because Yeon-joo is beautiful.

780
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,990
-And I found the right one.
-Found what?

781
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:33,510
The key to my life.

782
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:39,830
I'm not saying this
because she's pretty either.

783
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:42,110
If she's beautiful,
anyone can be beautiful.

784
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:45,030
She's the craziest person in my life.

785
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:46,870
However, despite all that,

786
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:51,270
Yeon-joo saved my life, and I'm certain
she has the key to my life.

787
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:54,310
That's why we should
protect her identity.

788
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,510
We should hide her from the public
no matter what.

789
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:59,390
She mustn't get investigated by
the police or be on the media.

790
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,030
You know what to do, right?

791
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:06,310
Please take care of it.
I need to go to the office first...

792
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:40,760
Who...

793
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:45,920
...are you?

794
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:49,870
You said you need an ending scene
to get out.

795
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:52,070
That means there's a rule
for entering it as well.

796
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:54,750
-What if you get dragged back?
-She's finally in my arms.

797
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:56,950
-The key to my life.
-I love you.

798
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,950
He's a monster.
He will kill me someday.

799
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:03,070
I'm sorry, but I have to end it here.

800
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:04,870
Why did you slap and kiss me that day?

801
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:08,070
-So I can disappear.
-I know you're hiding your reasons.

802
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,910
If you don't answer me, I'll shoot you.

803
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:13,680
-You would never do that.
-I can do it if I want to.
