1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,060
W-Two Worlds

2
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,920
"W" is Korea's best webtoon series.

3
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,010
Can Chul find the killer?

4
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,970
The lead character, Kang Chul
finds out through Yeon-joo

5
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,300
that he's a cartoon character.

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,840
You're going to shoot me?
Shoot if you can.

7
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,920
Shoot me!

8
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,050
This must be a perfect ending
for someone looking for a murderer

9
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,130
and became a murderer himself.

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,130
Chul and Yeon-joo realise their
true feelings for each other

11
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,010
and try to live a happy second life.

12
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,470
Why are you bleeding?

13
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,720
This means
you'll also die if you get shot.

14
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,010
You are Yeon-joo, right?

15
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,720
You are the girl who married Chul.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,380
The killer appears to Chul
and threatens to kill Yeon-joo.

17
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,130
Have I really become a cartoon character?

18
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,590
Because I married the protagonist?

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,550
Because of the killer
and Yeon-joo,

20
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,590
other characters in "W"
lose their reason for existence

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,920
and start to disappear.

22
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,920
This isn't the sequel I was hoping for.

23
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,820
Episode 9

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,860
Isn't this place...

25
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,030
Do you remember?

26
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,400
This is the place.
You were lying down around here.

27
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,280
I was so surprised because
I thought you were going to die.

28
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,240
I was lucky.

29
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,940
Promise me one thing.

30
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,110
When you leave this world again,

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,820
can you draw me something?

32
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,900
Draw you what?

33
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,490
A dream.

34
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,990
A dream?

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,650
Make everything

36
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,570
that happened two months ago when
we first met to this moment a dream.

37
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,700
Everything will be solved if we go back
to the time when we didn't meet.

38
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,820
If I don't know you,

39
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,780
I wouldn't look for you.

40
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,860
I wouldn't think about you either.

41
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,860
Then you wouldn't be
pulled into this world.

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,490
I wouldn't learn the truth from you.

43
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,490
I wouldn't shoot your father.

44
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,400
The killer wouldn't leave this world.

45
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,780
No one would be in danger.

46
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,030
And here's the most important thing.

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,860
You cannot die.

48
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,990
I won't see that with my own eyes.

49
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,700
Give this to your father.

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,780
It's too bad that we only
got to do four romantic things.

51
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,900
There were over 100 more
romantic things to do.

52
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,280
I want to hug you,

53
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,400
but I can't do that.

54
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,940
It will make me hesitate.

55
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,280
Are you going somewhere?

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,360
We're running out of time,
and this is the only certain way.

57
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,610
Yeon-joo,

58
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,070
please forget about me.

59
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
I am just a cartoon character.

60
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,280
Take care.

61
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,240
Who am I?

62
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,070
Who am I?

63
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,150
Where is Chul?

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,940
Who am I?
Why aren't you telling me who I am?

65
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,150
Who am I?

66
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,490
Tell me who I am.

67
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,940
You betrayed me.

68
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,440
Sir?

69
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,400
Is everything okay?

70
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,940
Sir.

71
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,780
Why didn't you keep your words?

72
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,280
You said you'd tell me who I am.

73
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,400
Sir, are you okay?

74
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,070
Who am I?

75
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,940
Tell me who I am.

76
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,900
Give me my face!

77
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,820
Sir?

78
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,780
Sir! Are you okay?

79
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,570
Sir!

80
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,110
Sir, are you okay?

81
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,150
I heard some noise.

82
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,440
After our parting,

83
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,570
the killer disappeared
from the real world.

84
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,030
We found two drowned bodies at the
south end of Han River Bridge.

85
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,990
We found two drowned bodies at the
south end of Han River Bridge.

86
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,900
They're both male in their 20s.

87
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,440
Three people lost their lives,

88
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,700
but there were no more victims.

89
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,650
I can't believe this.

90
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,070
Ms Gil, you should go back!

91
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,490
-You can't
-I don't know what you're saying!

92
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,990
How can Yeon-joo disappear
while in the car with you?

93
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,820
Ms Gil, it's dangerous here!
You can't go in!

94
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,570
-Geez, seriously!
-Ms Gil!

95
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,940
-Ms Gil!
-Where is your car?

96
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,030
Ms Gil, no! Ms Gil!

97
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,150
Ms Gil! It's dangerous here!

98
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,490
Ms Gil!

99
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,780
Goodness.
Why won't she listen to me?

100
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,900
Ms Gil.

101
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,400
It's that car, right?

102
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,530
Ms Gil, please don't go.
It's dangerous!

103
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,240
Yeon-joo! Goodness!

104
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,490
Oh, what should I do?
Yeon-joo, wake up!

105
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,530
Yeon-joo! Wake up!

106
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,700
-Yeon-joo!
-Mum and Soo-bong are fine.

107
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,490
And the characters in the webtoon

108
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,400
didn't disappear.

109
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,650
They are all fine.

110
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,900
Four new episodes were posted overnight.

111
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,780
Yeon-joo almost got shot.

112
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,110
The killer suddenly appeared
and shot her.

113
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,820
Who is it?

114
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
It's me.

115
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,650
Who...

116
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,490
Why are you here?

117
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,700
I thought you went to
New Zealand yesterday.

118
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,700
I just came back right away.

119
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,780
May I come in?

120
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,780
Come in.

121
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,700
What happened?

122
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,150
Where is Yeon-joo?

123
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,280
She's in her room.
She's sick in bed.

124
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,530
Did Soo-bong tell you?

125
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,700
I found her passed out after
drawing something inside the car.

126
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,280
She's unbelievable.

127
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,280
I took her to the emergency room,
and we just came back.

128
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,360
I don't know what is going on.

129
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,240
She won't tell me what she was
drawing inside that car.

130
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,360
And Soo-bong keeps talking gibberish.

131
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,780
I don't understand
what he was so scared of.

132
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,860
By the way, why did you come back?

133
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,400
I thought you'd stay there
for a month at least.

134
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,070
Excuse me.

135
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,280
What foolishness is this?

136
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,110
Give this to your father.

137
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,110
Connected with USB drive

138
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,440
To Mr Oh Seong-moo

139
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,360
It's such a mess.

140
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,150
This isn't the sequel I was hoping for.

141
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,820
To Mr Oh Seong-moo.

142
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,530
I heard you're alive.

143
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,900
I'm also alive.

144
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,030
I'm glad that you're alive,

145
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,940
but I won't apologise.

146
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,820
I'm glad that you're alive,
but I won't apologise.

147
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,780
I don't deserve to be forgiven,

148
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,780
but you don't have the right
to forgive me either.

149
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,070
What an arrogant boy.

150
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,570
I'm writing not to apologise,
but to make a suggestion.

151
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,700
We have something we must end together.

152
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,400
We're going to get some fresh air.

153
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,860
I'll accept the terrible fate
you've given to me,

154
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,150
so you should do what you need to do

155
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,440
instead of running away.

156
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,150
If it's for your daughter and not me,

157
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,700
you can do it this time.

158
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,400
End "W" with a happy ending.

159
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,110
End "W" with a happy ending.

160
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,530
Mum, go sleep in your room.

161
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,490
You're awake?

162
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,240
Are you all right?

163
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,070
Why are you sleeping there?
It's uncomfortable.

164
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,110
It's all right.
I don't want to move.

165
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,030
Your dad stopped by.

166
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,780
-When?
-Around 11 PM.

167
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,570
Gosh, he said he would stay
in New Zealand for one month,

168
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,030
but he came back.

169
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
I wonder what's going on.

170
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,150
We're looking at all surveillance
cameras within five kilometres.

171
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,740
We're looking into everything.

172
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,280
-Why can't we find it, then?
-I'm frustrated, too.

173
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,940
-Hello.
-Hello.

174
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,150
So Chul, how do you feel?

175
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,150
I still can't seem to focus.
They must've injected a lot of drug.

176
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,530
I think

177
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,860
the dream stayed in
his subconscious for a while

178
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,240
since I could still see
Chul a few more times.

179
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,700
Though only

180
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,570
for a very short period of time.

181
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,990
Kang Chul

182
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,490
I'll do a check-up now.

183
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,280
-You're not putting on surgical cap?
-Oh, that's right.

184
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,900
Hey, are you going to wear a ring
into the surgery?

185
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Hey, you shouldn't do that
when you have surgery.

186
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,990
Wow, that looks really nice.

187
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,490
Did you steal it from someone?

188
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,780
Did you get married secretly
without your professor knowing?

189
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,150
How could she get married
when she has no boyfriend?

190
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,190
I knew it right away when I saw
how she was on a blind date.

191
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,860
She's one of those people
who will stay single forever.

192
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,780
I hear there are many single old
women who live with cats.

193
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,280
She's following their exact path.

194
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,360
-Strangely enough, I agree.
-Right?

195
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,030
-You'd better stay focused.
-I'm sorry.

196
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,400
The third time I saw him
was a week later.

197
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,780
In Chul's world,

198
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,360
that's after two months.

199
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,940
Oh, I'm sorry.

200
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,360
Are you okay?

201
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,280
I'm sorry I didn't see you.

202
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,440
Your ring looks pretty.

203
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,360
Hello? I'm in front of the entrance.

204
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,610
I see you.

205
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,570
-Why are you so late?
-I was stuck in traffic.

206
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,860
Are you okay?

207
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,820
-No.
-Why not?

208
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,860
I'm sick.

209
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,530
What did you do
these past two months, then?

210
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,360
Who is she?

211
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,240
I don't know. She keeps
looking at me. I don't know her.

212
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,860
She looks sad.

213
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,030
Maybe she's one of your past lovers.

214
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,780
Perhaps you'd hurt her
and dumped her in the past.

215
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,860
Stop it!

216
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,070
Let's go.

217
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,240
Just like how I drew it,

218
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,990
Chul forgot everything.

219
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,150
What are you doing out here?

220
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,320
Hey, what's wrong?

221
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,440
As he got better and busier,

222
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,150
Chul didn't even have dreams anymore.

223
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,700
He completely...

224
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,280
...forgot about me.

225
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,030
He was infinitely devastated.

226
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,700
Life is sometimes

227
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,530
He was lost in life.

228
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,780
Chul depended on the power
of love in order to live.

229
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,530
But that man is gone now.

230
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,650
He went back

231
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,110
to being the man the readers love.

232
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,280
It's Chul again. Gosh.

233
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,280
Why are they always together?

234
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,860
Our lead character returned

235
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,700
to a man who's always strong

236
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,700
and never discouraged.

237
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,320
First Report on "W"

238
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:05,110
It was too sudden,

239
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,030
so Seon-mi and Yoon-hee
can only come on Wednesday.

240
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,700
The two of us can do it.

241
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,150
But, Mr Oh...

242
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,990
Actually, I was on the way home.

243
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,280
I am going to give up drawing cartoons.

244
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,150
I am seriously scared.

245
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,150
Ever since you got shot,

246
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,700
I've never had a sound sleep.

247
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,900
I don't understand why
my life has to be at stake

248
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,700
just for drawing cartoons.

249
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,400
I went to churches
as well as Buddhist temples.

250
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,400
I even got myself some amulets.

251
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,360
But I still feel anxious.

252
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,360
I'm seriously scared to even come here.

253
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,700
I called you because
I want to end it right.

254
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,150
I will go shave now.

255
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,570
I plan to end "W" with a happy ending.

256
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,740
A happy ending?

257
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,860
Chul will find the killer
and take revenge on him.

258
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,360
We will get rid of the killer forever.

259
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,030
Otherwise, we don't know
what else will happen again.

260
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,070
Are we killing the killer?

261
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,240
He killed three people and
even tried to kill my daughter!

262
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,700
We can't just leave him be.

263
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,700
Even though he's a killer, I created him.

264
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,400
It's only right that I end him.

265
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,940
In order to get rid of the killer,

266
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,780
you have to create
the killer's identity first.

267
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,030
He can't be a ghostly being.

268
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,150
He has to be a human I can catch.

269
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,820
I am attaching a copy of
my reports on Project W.

270
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,940
Report on Project W

271
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,030
The reports include investigation
records of 353 suspects.

272
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,030
You have to create someone
that is not in the reports.

273
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,490
Only then will I accept it,

274
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,900
and only when I accept it,
this webtoon can end.

275
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,360
First Report on W

276
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,110
You have to read everything.
Don't skip anything.

277
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,530
And we have to eliminate
all overlapping set-ups

278
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,820
or Chul will have doubts.

279
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,400
When Chul becomes suspicious,

280
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,700
-the curse will begin again.
-Mr Oh,

281
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,360
we made it a perfect crime.
So how do we create the killer?

282
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,780
Whatever evidence we come up with,
there will always be a flaw.

283
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,110
So there will be flaws.
We can't help that.

284
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:43,150
So we must come up with a face that
Chul can believe despite the flaws.

285
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,150
A face that Chul can believe?

286
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,700
I already picked the face.

287
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,570
Only this person will be acceptable
to Chul as his family's killer.

288
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,030
Mr Kang, shall I prepare breakfast?

289
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,070
After 10 minutes.
I will go wash first.

290
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,190
Okay.

291
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,020
-Yes, sir.
-Where are you?

292
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,320
I'm still at the hotel.

293
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,610
-I finally got something.
-What?

294
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,070
There was a man who came
from the hotel rooftop.

295
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,280
He was caught on
a delivery truck's dashboard camera.

296
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,820
President Kang.

297
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,860
You said you couldn't find anything.
You found nothing in these two months.

298
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,730
I know, but we missed one tiny detail.

299
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,230
The truck delivering ingredients
to the hotel kitchen.

300
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,440
I called you because I wanted to add it
to today's shooting

301
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,400
if it's the evidence.

302
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,730
It has to be right.

303
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,860
Look at the face.

304
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,900
That guy.

305
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,980
Enlarge it a little.

306
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,150
More. A little more.

307
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,530
This is...

308
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,530
He looks similar to you.

309
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,280
That's right. It is me.

310
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,110
Then you will...

311
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,820
...be the killer?

312
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,020
He won't believe it if it's not me.

313
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,400
Let's stop this!

314
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,020
I'm the only suspect he saw.

315
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,440
He'll believe it if he sees my face.

316
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,940
Yes. I know him.

317
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,730
He stabbed me on the rooftop.

318
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,230
I thought I saw an illusion since
he wasn't caught on cameras.

319
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,610
How is he caught on this camera?

320
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,780
You said other surveillance cameras
didn't catch anything.

321
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,570
That doesn't matter now.
At least one camera caught him.

322
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,480
This is unbelievable.

323
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:12,440
Let's air it on the show today.
Getting reports would be faster.

324
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,860
-Call Producer Park.
-Yes, sir.

325
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,940
-Hey, Yeon-joo. Have you seen it?
-Pardon?

326
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,190
Have you seen "W"?

327
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,320
No, not yet.

328
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,820
The King has returned.

329
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,110
The Great Oh Seong-moo
has come back.

330
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,570
After that idiot Yeon-joo disappeared,
the story is going great.

331
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,230
Haven't you seen it yet?

332
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:59,820
I was really disappointed
as I watched "W" get ruined.

333
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,400
I couldn't say anything because
he was sick.

334
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,940
And frankly, the recent storyline was
absolute rubbish.

335
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,400
It was third-rate childish romance.

336
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,530
It didn't make any sense.

337
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,190
But now, Mr Oh has finally
come to his senses.

338
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,980
Everything was just a dream.

339
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,860
This is a fresh start.

340
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,190
Chul will catch the killer
and then marry to So-hee.

341
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,820
That's how it should be.

342
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,530
Gosh. It's only right.

343
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,320
Doesn't that sound nice?

344
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,070
That's right. Your father is
in good health, right?

345
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,650
Tell him not to strain himself.

346
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,320
And tell him that I'm looking
forward to his work very much. Okay?

347
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,730
-All right.
-Okay.

348
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,860
Chul's action! Chul loves So-hee,
Chul hates Yeon-joo.

349
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,440
Oh, wait.

350
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,730
Why does the killer look
exactly like Mr Oh?

351
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,940
-Pardon?
-He looks like Mr Oh.

352
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,190
Could it be Oh my goodness.

353
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,110
It's like Hitchcock's movie, right?
He's leaving his face on his work.

354
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,110
Gosh. "W" is driving me crazy.

355
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,190
The killer has the artist's face.

356
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,020
Gosh, "W".

357
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,650
It's the best!

358
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,280
"W"! Yes!

359
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,690
He's giving it a happy ending?

360
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,440
No. He said he will finish it
in four episodes.

361
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,320
What you saw is the first of them.

362
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,860
What kind of happy ending?

363
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,440
Well, now that Mr Oh has left a clue,

364
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,940
they'll catch him using the broadcast.

365
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,940
Please take a careful look at
this picture.

366
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,320
This is the prime suspect of
the assault on Mr Kang Chul

367
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,190
at the Seoul Plaza Hotel on May 25th.

368
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,690
He seems to be in
his late 50s to early 60s.

369
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,400
On the day of the attack,

370
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,940
he was wearing a grey hooded jacket,
a khaki T-shirt and navy trousers.

371
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,940
He wears glasses and has grey beard.

372
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,570
He seems to be around 175cm tall.

373
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,570
If you know anything about him
or his whereabouts,

374
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,980
please call us.

375
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,400
-Goodness.
-Does he live in our neighbourhood?

376
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,480
They finally found him.
He is Han Sang-hoon, 61 years old.

377
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,190
He was Chul's father's
shooting team teammate.

378
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,360
He felt he was being
overshadowed by Chul's father.

379
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,480
He's been seeing a psychiatrist
for a while for paranoia.

380
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,020
He's basically crazy.

381
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,780
Restricted

382
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,940
They found all kinds of evidence
in his residence.

383
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,150
Chul's blood, a knife with his
fingerprints, Chul's family photo

384
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,020
and even records of his crime.

385
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,150
I found it.

386
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,900
Interview Room One

387
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,440
Please keep it short.

388
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,190
Thank you.

389
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,690
I killed your family.

390
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,190
Your father was a rude and arrogant man.

391
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,150
The day before it happened,

392
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,980
I ran into him in a bar after five years.

393
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,860
That jerk was still acting cheeky.

394
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,940
That's why I killed him.

395
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,820
I went in to kill just your father,

396
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,940
but I ended up killing everyone.

397
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,690
I would've killed you as well
if you were there.

398
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,530
I thought I'd get caught soon after,

399
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,940
but the prosecutor insisted
you were the killer.

400
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,730
I don't know if he's stupid

401
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,530
or if he had a plot in mind.

402
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,110
Either way, it was good for me.

403
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,730
I never thought

404
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,690
you'd keep looking for me
for over 10 years.

405
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,610
I got sick of it.

406
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,940
That's why I stabbed you on the rooftop.

407
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,980
But you still lived.

408
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,320
Why didn't you die?

409
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:48,070
Maybe I should've shot you
like I shot your parents.

410
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,440
You jerk!

411
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,110
That's not the end.

412
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,940
We should kill and eliminate the killer
from the webtoon

413
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,440
to prevent future trouble.

414
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,860
Is Chul going to kill him in vengeance?

415
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,940
That's not a happy ending.

416
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,070
A villain must be killed

417
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,320
by another villain.

418
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
The murder case of Mr Kang's family
has been aired

419
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,110
many times for the past five years.

420
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,820
I'm sure everyone remembers.

421
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,440
After a long and tiring chase,
the truth finally came to light.

422
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,020
10 years and 2 months after the accident,

423
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:34,530
Suspect Han finally confessed his crime
on August 20th.

424
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,940
-He confessed. It's over now.
-No!

425
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,150
No. That's not right, sir.

426
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,230
Chul must've bribed him.
That's not true.

427
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,820
Look here, the game is over.

428
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,320
You lost to Chul.

429
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,320
Please resign.

430
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:00,190
Are you telling me to step down?

431
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,070
Don't drag everyone down with you.

432
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,440
You are on your own now.

433
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,110
Han Cheol-ho misses his chance
to be the next president

434
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,530
and loses his mind.

435
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,280
He wants me...

436
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,440
...to go down?

437
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,860
Hello.

438
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,020
It's me.

439
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,860
How are your boys doing these days?

440
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,150
He kills the killer
under the guise of suicide.

441
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,280
Wait.

442
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,940
Stop!

443
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,940
He even makes a fake will that says

444
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,730
Chul bribed him
to make a false confession.

445
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,820
He told me to do it.

446
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,610
He told me to make a fake will.

447
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,610
He asks me to do
things like that sometimes.

448
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,150
He didn't tell me to kill him,

449
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,400
but he definitely wanted him dead.

450
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,610
Who are you talking about?

451
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,940
Han Cheol-ho, the candidate
in the presidential election.

452
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,820
Chul changes the game here again.

453
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,280
Sir. Is that true?

454
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,570
The police will eradicate crimes.

455
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,940
He's here.

456
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,070
-What was your motive?
-Why did you kill him?

457
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,730
Is what the man said true?

458
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,980
-Wait.
-Please say something!

459
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,820
Han Cheol-ho arrested for murder.

460
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,730
The killer gets murdered
and Cheol-ho goes to the prison.

461
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,570
It's a clean triumph of good over evil.

462
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,440
What do you think?
Would people like it?

463
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,980
-They'll love it.
-I know, right?

464
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,370
If this goes well,
I would finally be able to sleep well.

465
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,500
This is how it's supposed to be
in the first place.

466
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,460
Nothing would've happened, then.

467
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,410
-Is that the end?
-What?

468
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,870
-What's the last scene?
-Chul's love story.

469
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,620
We thought Chul's love story
needs an ending, too.

470
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,950
How?

471
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,870
Will he...

472
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,040
...marry So-hee?

473
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,620
No, we aren't planning that.

474
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,410
To Chul

475
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,330
Chul, congratulations on fulfilling
your heartfelt wish.

476
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,200
You've worked hard for it.

477
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,460
I'm happy that my support
paid off in the end.

478
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,120
Your long-time friend, So-hee.

479
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,540
Why'd you write me a letter?
It's unlike you.

480
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,000
Where are you?

481
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,120
Okay.

482
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,500
So-hee!

483
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,580
We'll finish it with a hint that
things will go well between them.

484
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:20,410
Hello?

485
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,830
Yeon-joo, are you listening?

486
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,460
I see.

487
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:29,460
Please answer immediately.
I almost had a heart attack.

488
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,120
It feels so futile, Soo-bong.

489
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,750
No one remembers me there,

490
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:39,710
and no one in this world
knows what I went through.

491
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,160
I don't even have a photo.

492
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,910
How foolish of me
to not even take a photo.

493
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,790
Do you know...

494
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,910
...what I did yesterday?

495
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,910
Is the final episode
coming out in August?

496
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,160
Yeon-joo?

497
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,580
Stab

498
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,370
Stab

499
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,200
Let us reconcile.

500
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,460
Sorry for what I did a while ago.

501
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,620
Answer me.

502
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,160
Where do you live?

503
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,500
Answer me.
You'll regret asking.

504
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,040
You'll regret asking.

505
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,540
Is this sweet?

506
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:01,620
I love it.

507
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:12,370
Gosh.

508
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,870
I heard you should read books like this.

509
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,620
I'm tying your shoelaces.

510
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:27,330
Did I do four sweet things now?

511
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,540
Did I do four sweet things now?
It isn't the time to do your tasks.

512
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,750
This isn't the time to do your tasks.

513
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,620
Have some watermelon.

514
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:58,910
What are you doing?

515
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:04,710
Geez, what are those?
They look messy.

516
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,460
You're too old for that.

517
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,750
Take them all off.
They look bad.

518
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,540
Put up photos of
your real boyfriend instead, will you?

519
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,330
Isn't it funny?

520
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,410
Let's talk later, Soo-bong.

521
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,200
Chul.

522
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,460
Are you doing well?

523
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,080
Are you happy these days?

524
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,200
I'm not.

525
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,000
For each day, I...

526
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeon-joo.

527
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,080
-Are you going to sleep?
-Yes, for 10 minutes.

528
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,370
What about dinner?

529
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:53,370
I'm sleepy.

530
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:55,080
Okay, see you.

531
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,160
Code Black, Code Black emergency.

532
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,410
Injured people from a shooting
will arrive soon.

533
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,290
There are too many injured people.

534
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,830
Doctors of all department
who aren't on duty

535
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,830
must come to the emergency room now.

536
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,870
Code Black, Code Black emergency.

537
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:25,370
-What's going on?
-Injured people will arrive soon.

538
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,410
There are too many injured victims.

539
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,540
Doctors of all department
who aren't on duty

540
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,910
Hankuk Sungjin Hospital

541
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,200
Was there a shooting?

542
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,000
Didn't you see the news? There was
a shooting at a broadcasting station.

543
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,410
At a broadcasting station?

544
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,160
We have emergency patients.

545
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,790
-Move out of the way.
-Please move.

546
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,040
-Go straight.
-Hello?

547
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,160
So-hee!

548
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,910
He got shot in the torso.

549
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:02,870
What's this?

550
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,040
Why am I here again?

551
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,290
It hasn't been confirmed yet,

552
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,000
but eight people died

553
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,080
and more than 15 people were injured.

554
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:13,620
I'll announce it again.

555
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,080
There was a shooting assault

556
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,870
inside W's recording studio

557
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,330
around 6 PM today.

558
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,370
The culprit hasn't been identified.

559
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,370
And despite containing the area,

560
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,200
the culprit managed to flee the scene.

561
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:32,910
The victims were staff members of W.

562
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,710
There were about 23 people
at the crime scene,

563
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:40,200
yet the culprit shot everyone in
the studio in less than five minutes.

564
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,950
Currently,
eight people were confirmed dead.

565
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,540
The 15 people who were injured

566
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,000
are being transferred
to Hankuk Sungjin Hospital.

567
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,910
-What's going on?
-Among them, seven are...

568
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,580
-This isn't how it supposed to be.
-We predict more fatality to be found.

569
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,540
Here's the list of people
who were confirmed to be dead.

570
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,620
The main host of the programme...

571
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,250
What's the current situation?

572
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,000
Who are on the list?

573
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,080
I'm a doctor!

574
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,660
It's an emergency.

575
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,710
Please hurry up.

576
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,620
Out of the way!

577
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,830
Please take a look at her.

578
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:55,080
She got shot in the leg and
is in great pain. Please do something.

579
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,120
It hurts.

580
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:00,750
Dr Oh Yeon-joo?

581
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:02,910
Dr Oh.

582
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,080
Can't you hear me?

583
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,200
Please do something!
Are you deaf?

584
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,080
Please wait.

585
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,410
How is she?

586
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,410
She needs surgery,
but she's not bleeding much.

587
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,620
She will be fine.

588
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,620
I'm sorry I yelled a while ago.

589
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,910
What about you?
Are you hurt?

590
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,370
I'm not hurt.

591
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,910
I saw in the news...

592
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,080
Oh, that's a false report.

593
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,330
I remember you.

594
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,540
You dropped that ring before, didn't you?

595
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,620
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

596
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,830
It's because I don't know why I am here.

597
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,830
Mr Kang!

598
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,290
How is Mr Son?

599
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:50,330
He's in surgery.
Can I talk to you?

600
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,000
Let's go.

601
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,080
I'm here, Mr Oh.

602
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,830
Mr Oh?

603
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,460
Let's eat some pork trotter, sir.

604
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,950
Mr Oh, I bought some pork trotter.

605
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,000
Is he sleeping?

606
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:51,830
Sir?

607
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,080
Is that you, Soo-bong?

608
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:59,460
It's me, Soo-bong.

609
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:03,950
Soo-bong.

610
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,290
Soo-bong

611
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:10,830
My face disappeared.

612
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:13,580
Soo-bong.

613
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,710
Oh, gosh.

614
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,910
Save me, Soo-bong.

615
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,830
He took my face.

616
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,870
Where did my face go?

617
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:31,870
Soo-bong.

618
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,830
Soo-bong?

619
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,710
Sit down.

620
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:45,910
Please take a close look at this picture.

621
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,250
This is the prime suspect of
the assault on Mr Kang Chul

622
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:54,000
at the Seoul Plaza Hotel on May 25th.

623
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,040
On the day of the attack,

624
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,580
he was wearing a grey hooded jacket,
a khaki T-shirt and navy trousers.

625
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:04,080
He wears glasses and has grey beard.

626
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,040
He seems to be around 175
centimetres tall.

627
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:10,330
If you know anything about him
or his whereabouts

628
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,160
-What happened?
-What happened?

629
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,200
What happened?

630
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,710
-Did he collapse?
-Did he collapse?

631
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:19,330
What's wrong with him?
What's going on?

632
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,830
We're not sure.
Please wait.

633
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,290
-What happened?
-What?

634
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:30,910
See what's wrong with him!

635
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:35,580
What's going on here?

636
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,120
Gosh!

637
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:39,080
Who are you?

638
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,120
Request for assistance.

639
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,750
Chul.

640
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:12,120
Are you there?

641
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,910
Can you hear me?

642
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,460
I had to come because you
were looking for me so desperately.

643
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,620
I wanted to show you my face.

644
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:28,200
You suffered a lot because I didn't
appear for 10 years, didn't you?

645
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:30,120
It was painful for me, too.

646
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,330
I wanted to appear in front of you,
but I had no means to.

647
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:37,080
This is me.

648
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:39,160
How's my face?

649
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:41,330
I love it so much.

650
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,500
I'll see you often.

651
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:04,580
This is breaking news.

652
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:09,410
The face of the shooting
suspect has been released.

653
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:13,950
The man is presumed to be in his 60s
and his identity is still unknown.

654
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,580
The police are openly searching for him.

655
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:22,290
Around 6 PM today, he opened fire
randomly to the people in W studio.

656
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:37,830
Please save me!

657
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,160
W-Two Worlds

658
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:36,910
The killer must pay for this.

659
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,710
We have to find out who
raised the notorious killer.

660
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:40,870
Who are you? Why are you here?

661
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,870
Why am I still here?

662
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,500
Yeon-joo, you've been
bothering me since last time.

663
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,750
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

664
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,540
What kind of happy ending is this?

665
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,830
Why did we break up
if this is how it'd be?

666
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,330
I know everything.

667
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:59,830
Do you want to know
what will happen from now on?

668
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,870
We will kill each other.

669
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,120
I want to know the truth.

670
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,750
Are you doubting me right now?
