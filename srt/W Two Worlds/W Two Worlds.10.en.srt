1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,370
W-Two Worlds

2
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,190
"W" by Oh Seong-moo

3
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,090
With accumulated sales hitting
10 million copies,

4
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,340
"W" is Korea's best webtoon series.

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,210
Its leading character, Kang Chul

6
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,340
finds out through Oh Yeon-joo
that he is a cartoon character.

7
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,170
Previously on "W"

8
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,210
They realise their feelings
for each other

9
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,920
and dream of a new life together.

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,590
I'll shoot a hole in her forehead.

11
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,010
I almost died just now.

12
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,920
The killer appears in front of Chul
and threatens to kill Yeon-joo.

13
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,710
I've waited 10 years.

14
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,590
I've been waiting for him to find me.

15
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,710
So how can it end?

16
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,590
How can this be the end?

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,670
The killer and Yeon-joo's
presence

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,550
make the other characters of "W"
lose their purpose,

19
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,800
causing them to disappear.

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,170
Make everything that happened
two months ago when we first met

21
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,840
to this moment a dream.

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,090
Forget about me. Take care.

23
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,960
Chul joins force with Seong-moo

24
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,880
and turns back time
to two months before he met Yeon-joo

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,010
in order to protect Yeon-joo
and the world of "W".

26
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,550
President Kang, are you doing well?

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,510
Are you happy these days?

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,300
That's a pretty ring.

29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,460
He completely forgot me.

30
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,840
You can do it for your daughter.
End "W" with a happy ending.

31
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,090
I plan to end "W" with a happy ending.

32
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,340
We have to come up with a face that
Chul would believe to be the killer.

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,550
The only man who Chul would believe
to be the killer is him.

34
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,340
I know him.
He stabbed me on the rooftop.

35
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,420
The killer from 10 years prior was
created and arrested.

36
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,630
They also arrested Han Cheol-ho
who misprosecuted Chul as the killer.

37
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,090
You jerk!

38
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,380
But just before everything got settled

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,300
Where is Kang Chul?

40
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,550
The killer shows up
with Seong-moo's face

41
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,960
and makes Chul's plans go down the drain.

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,260
Episode 10

43
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,510
I'm going to buy some food.
Do you want some jokbal?

44
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,800
You like jokbal.

45
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,380
Yes.

46
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,630
I'll be right back.

47
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,800
Soo-bong!

48
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,590
Soo-bong!

49
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,670
I'd rather slaughter than be slaughtered.

50
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,340
You finally kept your promise.

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,510
So this was my face?

52
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,960
Yes.

53
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,170
This is me.

54
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,960
I am you.

55
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,710
This face suits me very well.

56
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,210
You've been wanting to kill Chul, too.

57
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,920
Just like me.

58
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,840
Let's end this now!

59
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,260
That's when I realised it.

60
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,380
You and I

61
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,880
share one soul.

62
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,050
Maybe that's why.

63
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,630
I think this face is perfect.

64
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,050
Let me go!

65
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,710
I already gave you an identity.

66
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,170
I kept my words!

67
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,210
You're right. You kept your words,

68
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,340
but you're trying to kill me now.

69
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,670
You joined hands with Chul to kill me.

70
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,380
That's a betrayal.

71
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,800
All I did was follow your orders.

72
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,510
You are me, and I am you.

73
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,090
You shall follow my orders from now on.

74
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,960
I'm back, Mr Oh.

75
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,710
Mr Oh?

76
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,300
Let's eat some jokbal, sir.

77
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,960
Mr Oh, I bought some jokbal.

78
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,260
Is he sleeping?

79
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,090
Sir?

80
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,210
Is that you, Soo-bong?

81
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,550
It's me, Soo-bong.

82
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,210
Soo-bong.

83
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,840
My face disappeared.

84
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,800
Soo-bong.

85
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,090
Save me, Soo-bong.

86
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,920
He took my face.

87
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,710
Where is my face?

88
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,010
Soo-bong.

89
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,880
Soo-bong?

90
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,710
Sit down.

91
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,340
Draw me a gun. A good one.

92
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,960
Bullets, too.
Plenty of them.

93
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,960
More. Draw more bullets.

94
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,210
I'm going to kill many people.

95
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300
Please take a close look at this picture.

96
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,880
This is the prime suspect of
the assault on Mr Kang Chul

97
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,710
at the Seoul Plaza Hotel on May 25th.

98
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,260
On the day of the attack, he was
wearing a grey hooded jacket,

99
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,210
a khaki t-shirt and navy trousers.

100
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,210
He wears glasses and has grey beard.

101
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,630
He seems to be around 175cm tall.

102
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,840
If you know anything about him
or his whereabouts

103
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,210
-What happened?
-What happened?

104
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,210
-What's going on?
-What was that?

105
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,090
-What happened?
-Did he collapse?

106
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,300
What's wrong?

107
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,130
-What is it?
-We don't know, sir.

108
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,960
-Did he collapse?
-Please wait.

109
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,380
-What is this?
-What's going on?

110
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,340
-What happened?
-Go and check.

111
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,510
Who are you?

112
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,420
Request for assistance.

113
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,920
Chul.

114
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,380
Are you there?

115
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,170
Can you hear me?

116
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,460
I came since you were
looking for me so desperately.

117
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,960
I came to show my face.

118
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,380
You suffered a lot because I didn't
appear for 10 years, didn't you?

119
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,420
It was painful for me, too.

120
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,670
I wanted to appear in front of you,
but I had no means to.

121
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,340
This is me.

122
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,460
How's my face?

123
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,710
I love it so much.

124
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,460
I'll see you often.

125
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,710
Call an ambulance!

126
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,880
Help me.

127
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,960
The police are trying to find out
where he fled to,

128
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,710
but they haven't been able to
track him down yet.

129
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,510
This is breaking news.

130
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,170
The face of the shooting suspect
has been released.

131
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,960
The man is presumed to be in his 60s
and his identity is still unknown.

132
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,340
The police are openly searching for him.

133
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,460
-The suspect...
-What is this?

134
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,420
Why did Dad change the story again?

135
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,510
-Move!
-This is a horrible story.

136
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,460
What is he trying to do?

137
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,800
What about me?

138
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,420
Why am I here again?

139
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,460
Chul doesn't even recognise me now.

140
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,380
Emergency Ward

141
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,710
There has been a false report
that you were badly injured.

142
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,960
Give them an interview.

143
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,960
You can do it in the lobby.

144
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,090
-Okay.
-Mr Kang.

145
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,710
-I got a call from the police.
-Did they find him?

146
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,710
No. It was a false report.

147
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,300
They have no idea
how he got in or got out.

148
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,840
No camera caught him
coming in and out of the set.

149
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,210
That was a false report.

150
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,710
I wasn't on the scene,
and I'm not injured at all.

151
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,010
Have you seen the video message
that the killer sent?

152
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,130
Yes, I have.

153
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,210
It was clearly addressed to you.

154
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,460
What did he mean by "10 years ago"?

155
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,300
Let me ask you that.

156
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,800
What do you think it means?

157
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,130
It sounds like

158
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,340
he's the killer who murdered your family.

159
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,550
Do you think it's the same person?

160
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,670
He said it himself.

161
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,210
-He said he came back after 10 years.
-If he's really the killer then,

162
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,300
that means the police had done
a poor investigation

163
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,340
and had you falsely accused.

164
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,460
This isn't the right time for that,

165
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,710
but someone will definitely have to
take responsibility for that matter.

166
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,590
He missed the killer and
accused the victim as the murderer,

167
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,590
and now the killer has committed
a mass murder.

168
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,510
Are you talking about
Congressman Han Cheol-ho?

169
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,590
Even if I don't say his name,
every citizen would know.

170
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,840
He himself knows it.

171
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,010
That crazy psychopath.

172
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,840
Sir, wouldn't it be better for you
to visit the scene now?

173
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,710
Before the public opinion goes against

174
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,090
Excuse me. Who are you?

175
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,420
Pardon?

176
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,460
That's not our hospital's gown.

177
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,300
-Why are you here?
-I took my sister's gown by mistake.

178
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,550
She's also a doctor at another hospital.

179
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,630
You can move him now.
Please give him antibiotics

180
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,380
and notify an orthopaedic surgeon.

Safety Control Area

182
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,170
Excuse me?

183
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,880
Staff Only

184
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,710
What's going on here?

185
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,960
What should I do?

186
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,380
Where do I go?

187
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,170
Please watch the patient in Room 1013
who keeps drinking soju.

188
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,960
Why did I get flustered?

189
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,920
He doesn't even recognise me.

190
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,090
Dr Oh.

191
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,300
Can a doctor drink
alcohol in the hospital?

192
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,710
Isn't everyone on emergency call today?

193
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,630
They have enough doctors
working right now.

194
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,550
There are enough doctors
in the emergency room as well.

195
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,170
Plus, I'm not on duty.

196
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,300
May I have a sip, then?

197
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,510
I'm desperate for some right now.

198
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,090
That feels better.

199
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,630
You can finish it.

200
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,210
Thank you.

201
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,630
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

202
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,590
It's been bothering me.

203
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,880
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

204
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,960
You look like someone.

205
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,630
I do? Like who?

206
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,090
My husband.

207
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,210
Is that your wedding ring?
I thought so.

208
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,590
Hello?

209
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,090
I'm at the rooftop.

210
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,090
Mr Son's surgery is over.

211
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,090
Okay, I'll come down.

212
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,710
Thank you for the drink.

213
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,340
Seok-beom, what time is it?

214
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,760
It's been 12 hours since the incident.

215
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,920
-Turn down the volume.
-The suspect is still at large.

216
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,380
Two additional people were found dead.

217
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,670
As of now, 10 people are dead
and 13 are injured.

218
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,960
Three of the injured people
are in critical condition.

219
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,630
President Yoon Seok-joon

220
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,170
-expressed his condolences...
-Who are you?

221
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,960
-He considers the event...
-Why are you sleeping here?

222
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:04,170
-...as an act of terrorism and will
-I must've come into the wrong room.

223
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,760
Dental Office, Health Promotion Centre

224
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,300
What is this?

225
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,550
Why am I still here?

226
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,630
What's happening here?
Why am I still here?

227
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,170
We found no fingerprints or hair.
We couldn't find a thing.

228
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,590
How is this possible?
I just can't understand.

229
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,300
There should be some
traces on the surveillance camera.

230
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,670
-I don't understand.
-Day 2.

231
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:14,590
Suspect of the shooting incident, which
left more than 20 people injured

232
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,510
is still on the run.

233
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,590
The police say there's no
recording of the suspect

234
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,300
entering and leaving
the scene of the crime,

235
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,420
which is causing difficulties
in the investigation.

236
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,300
-And the day after that.
-President Kang Chul

237

Side dishes are self-serve

238
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,920
Even the day after that,

239
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,880
I still couldn't go back home.

240
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,510
I no longer mean anything

241
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,210
to the main character.

242
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,380
I'm simply

243
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,340
an extra in this webtoon.

244
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,260
Black garlic

245
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,300
At 10 AM this morning,
a funeral was held at the "W" Office

246
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,590
for the 10 shooting victims.

247
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,840
Attendants include families of
the victims, the Prime Minister,

248
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,710
-Head of Public Prosecutors' Office
-Hey.

249
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,800
Who are you?

250
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,840
I asked who you are.

251
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,210
You keep coming in here.
Just who are you?

252
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,170
You are not from our department.

253
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,340
That's my gown, too!

254
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,090
Hey! Hey!

255
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,800
I'm hungry.

256
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,130
Isn't this So-hee's house?
I saw it often in the book.

257
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,880
Do you know happen to know the password?

258
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,090
Daebak Bank

259
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,550
I'm sorry.

260
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,050
I don't really want to do this.

261
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,840
I'm just borrowing this for a while.

262
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,260
No, you don't need to come.

263
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,590
I'll take it.

264
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,130
What's the password?

265
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,210
-What is it?
-Oh no!

266
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,170
I'm inside.

267
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,960
It's on the table?

268
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,210
Okay.

269
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,670
I found it.
I'm on my way back.

270
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,300
You are...

271
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,340
...Dr Oh Yeon-joo?

272
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,840
The government can't
even repay for your hard work.

273
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,420
I can't believe this happened to you.
I am very sorry.

274
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,920
It's okay.

275
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,960
Don't say that.

276
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,260
I hope the killer gets caught soon.

277
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,170
-We haven't solved the case,
-Do you know this girl?

278
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,210
Yet we're having the funeral.
It is a shame.

279
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,920
I've never seen her.
Who is she?

280
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,670
The owner doesn't know you.

281
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,960
How do you know the password?

282
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,960
Hey, Ms Yeon-joo.

283
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,960
If you don't explain this well,
I'm calling the police.

284
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,510
Tell me. Why did you come here?

285
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,710
Why are you here?

286
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,840
I was hungry.

287
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,130
What?

288
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,130
I was too hungry.

289
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,420
I didn't eat for three days.

290
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,630
That doesn't make sense.

291
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,380
If you're hungry, you can get food.
Why come in here?

292
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,590
I don't have any money.

293
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,920
How can you not have any money?
You're a doctor.

294
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,760
I'm not a doctor.

295
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,010
I'm not a doctor there.
You just mistook me.

296
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,800
If you're not a doctor,

297
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,550
why were you in
the emergency room that day?

298
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,260
She's not just a thief.

299
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,300
-Call the police.
-Yes, sir.

300
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,340
You know how things are
these days, right?

301
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,260
No matter how small it is, I have to
check every suspicious thing.

302
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,050
The police are coming, so make your
statement at the police station.

303
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,960
Okay.

304
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,920
You don't mind going to jail?

305
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,550
It's better there.
They feed you

306
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,510
and you can sleep there.

307
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,170
Do you even know what jail is like?

308
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,960
-You must think it's like a hotel.
-I know. I've been there before.

309
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,340
Just turn me over to the police.

310
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,840
But...

311
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,760
...before they get here,
can I eat some ramyeon?

312
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,300
The water is boiling.

313
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,920
I am just really starving.
That's all.

314
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,710
What's your name?

315
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,260
-Oh Yeon-joo.
-What's your real name?

316
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,010
Oh Yeon-joo.

317
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,340
Where is your place?
What's the address?

318
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,760
There's none.

319
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,960
-You don't have a family?
-I don't.

320
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,670
You said you're married.

321
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,590
You said your husband looks like me.

322
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,340
-Do you need kimchi, too?
-Yes, please.

323
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,710
Ouch, it's hot!

324
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,420
That hurts!

325
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,300
Of course it does.

326
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,670
Wait.

327
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,130
It'll last a few days.

328
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,420
Never mind.

329
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,460
Just stay still.

330
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,130
Don't mind it. You can stop.

331
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,590
You just said it hurts.

332
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,210
I said stop it.

333
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,670
Why would you touch me?
Why make me feel sad?

334
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,840
I tried my best not to run into you.

335
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,300
I slept in the open for over a week.

336
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,800
I even stole things,
but I still never asked you for money.

337
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,880
I wanted to stay out of your life.

338
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:02,210
So why would you come out
and act all caring and kind?

339
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,300
It's so upsetting!

340
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,170
Why would you get upset?

341
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,260
Yes, I'm married.

342
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,840
This is my wedding ring,

343
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,300
but I don't have a husband.

344
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,670
That's why I have no one
I can ask for help.

345
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,960
How can you not have a husband
when you're married?

346
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,840
He disappeared.

347
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,710
He's not dead, and we aren't divorced.

348
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,300
He just disappeared.

349
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,510
We didn't even do much.

350
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,130
We only did four romantic things.

351
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,510
He disappeared after
doing those four little things.

352
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,050
He was gone after only a day.

353
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,710
Isn't it funny?

354
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,960
He never even

355
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,210
told me that he loves me.

356
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,550
I did all the talking.

357
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,130
Then he disappeared.

358
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,880
This is so unfair.

359
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,590
I tried to forget about him since
it was going to be a happy ending.

360
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,380
What kind of happy ending is this?

361
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,460
Why did we break up
if this is how it'd be?

362
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,510
He doesn't even recognise me.
I don't know what I'm doing here.

363
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,090
I want to go home, but I don't know how.

364
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:37,340
I don't know anyone here.
I don't even have money.

365
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,260
Am I too dumb for this?

366
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
I don't understand a word you're saying.

367
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,210
I don't expect you to.
Just leave me alone.

368
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,510
Mr Kang, they're here.

369
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,920
Thank you.

370
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,380
Why didn't you turn me over?

371
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,380
You seemed more relaxed
around the police.

372
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,590
I don't want to let you off
the hook so easily.

373
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,260
I have nothing on me.
I'm just a thief.

374
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,880
-Go.
-Yes, sir.

375
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,880
Why are you doing this to me?

376
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,010
Don't take an interest in me.

377
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,460
That's a strange choice of words.

378
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,510
I'm not interested. I'm suspicious.

379
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,050
Mr Son

380
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,630
-Hello, Mr Son?
-Where are you?

381
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,510
I'm going to the office. I have to
talk to the victims' families.

382
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,170
Can you come by here before you go?

383
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,960
Okay, I will.

384
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,710
-Let's stop by Sungjin Hospital.
-Okay.

385
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,590
It's been a week since the incident,

386
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,800
but the killer is still at large.

387
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,710
80 percent of the people believe that

388
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,050
he is the same killer who murdered
Mr Kang Chul's family in 2006.

389
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,550
Moreover, over 70 percent
of people think that

390
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:40,010
Congressman Han Cheol-ho should be
held responsible for this incident

391
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,090
since it was him who accused Mr Kang
as the criminal 10 years ago.

392
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,460
This incident is expected to have major
influence on his presidential election.

393
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,960
The killer admitted it himself.
It's over now.

394
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,090
No.

395
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,920
That's not what he meant.

396
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
These two cases are unrelated.

397
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,010
-They have no evidence that
-Look here.

398
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,380
10 people were shot to death.

399
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,710
The game is over now.

400
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,960
Please resign.

401
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,090
Are you telling me...

402
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,460
...to step down?

403
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,710
Don't drag everyone down with you.

404
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,510
Go down by yourself.

405
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,550
Caller ID Restricted

406
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,460
Hello?

407
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,300
Is this Mr Han Cheol-ho?

408
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,090
-Who is this?
-Don't you know me?

409
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,550
I'm the most famous person right now.

410
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,260
Who are you?

411
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,260
I called to console you.

412
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,960
You must be in misery because of me.

413
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,760
Caller ID Restricted

414
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:11,760
-You are...
-That's right. It's me.

415
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,510
If I get caught,
do you know what will happen to you?

416
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,260
I do.

417
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,170
You will kill me.

418
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,630
You will order gangsters
to disguise it as a suicide.

419
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,550
You will also make up a fake will
to put the guilt on Chul.

420
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,090
You crazy jerk.
Who do you think you're talking to?

421
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,800
Who is it, sir?

422
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,170
Weren't you thinking about it?

423
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,340
You were going to do it if I get caught.

424
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,420
I am right.

425
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,960
You will kill me to become president.

426
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,300
Just like you sentenced
Chul to death 10 years ago

427
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,380
because you wanted to be a politician.

428
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,550
I know it all.

429
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,380
Shall I tell you what will happen
to the both of us from then on?

430
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,920
We're playing second fiddle for
Chul's happy ending.

431
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,670
We will kill each other.

432
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,380
But don't you think

433
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,130
there is no need for us to do that?

434
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,760
Who will it benefit anyway?

435
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,340
I'll make you the next president.

436
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,550
What?

437
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,050
I'll help you.

438
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:38,090
I know a lot of things about Chul.

439
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,050
-Stay here and watch her.
-Yes, sir.

440
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,960
Did they catch the killer yet?

441
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,300
-No.
-I heard

442
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,710
they haven't found any evidence.

443
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,630
It's true.

444
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,960
Let's make some lines.
Write this down.

445
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,550
First,

446
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,300
it's Chul's line.

447
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,010
Chul

448
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,340
"Just leave me alone, Dad."

449
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,260
Just leave me alone, Dad.

450
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,010
Chul's father says

451
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,460
"You drank alcohol, didn't you?"

452
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,590
"You little brat!"

453
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,170
You drank alcohol, didn't you?
You little brat!

454
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,170
Yes?

455
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,920
Hello.

456
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,710
My goodness, Chul.
It's good to see you.

457
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,510
Honey, Chul's here.

458
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,380
You must be tired.
Have you eaten lunch?

459
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,670
-I have.
-Can you

460
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,170
leave us for a minute?

461
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,960
-What?
-Don't let anyone in.

462
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,380
Oh, okay.

463
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,050
-Grab a drink from the fridge.
-Okay.

464
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,920
-Did something happen?
-Yes.

465
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,880
Something happened.

466
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,960
On the day of the incident,

467
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,960
I received an e-mail,

468
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,170
but I got distracted.

469
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,340
I finally checked it earlier.

470
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,880
It was a report from someone.

471
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,590
A report? Is it about the killer?

472
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,840
Yes.

473
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,760
Not the killer of this incident,

474
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,630
but the killer from 10 years ago.

475
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,420
It's a voice file.

476
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,920
You should hear it.

477
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,710
Voice file

478
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,670
Just leave me alone, Dad.

479
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,380
You drank alcohol, didn't you?
You little brat!

480
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,960
What is this?

481
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:19,010
I said I won't stand it if you
hit me with your belt again.

482
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,380
Honey, please stop!
Chul, stop it.

483
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,920
You punk.
Get out and never come back.

484
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,920
I don't need a son like you.

485
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,260
I can't believe I've raised him

486
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,420
Honey!

487
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,670
What

488
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,420
-What is this?
-That's what I want to ask you.

489
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,420
What is this?

490
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,920
I said I won't stand it if you
hit me with your belt again.

491
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,050
Honey, please stop!
Chul, stop it.

492
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,130
You punk.
Get out and never come back.

493
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,170
I don't need a son like you.

494
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,380
I can't believe I've raised him

495
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,420
Honey!

496
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,420
President Kang.

497
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,090
I mean, Chul.

498
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:18,800
Ever since that day until now,

499
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,630
I've never once had any doubt
of your innocence,

500
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,420
but what's this?

501
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:34,090
You said you didn't
go back home that day,

502
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,260
but what's this?

503
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,420
It's fabricated.

504
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,550
-Fabricated?
-It is.

505
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,670
It doesn't make sense.
I never had this conversation.

506
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,260
How could this be fabricated?

507
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,050
I still remember your parents' voices.

508
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:56,050
How can anyone fabricate voices
of people who died 10 years ago?

509
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,670
If you're hiding anything,

510
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,550
tell me.

511
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,960
What if you can't remember
because you were drunk?

512
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,420
Are you

513
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,090
suspecting me right now?

514
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,880
I want to know the truth.

515
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,880
Chul.

516
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,550
Right now,

517
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,010
I'm very scared.

518
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,050
Are you sure

519
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:31,880
you're really innocent?

520
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,170
Who sent this?

521
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,010
This is all fabricated.

522
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,460
I don't know how they got the voices

523
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,960
Sir? Sir?

524
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:01,380
Sir!

525
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,630
-What happened?
-What's going on?

526
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,090
-Honey.
-What is this?

527
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,260
Honey.

528
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,960
What are you doing, President Kang?

529
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:42,210
-Move out of the way.
-Calm down.

530
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,090
Please send support!
There's been a murder!

531
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,760
The suspect is in the building!

532
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:09,130
Honey! Honey.

533
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,010
There's been a shooting.

534
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,630
President Kang, stop right there!

535
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,960
President Kang!

536
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:48,880
What's going on?

537
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,630
Freeze!
If you don't, we'll shoot!

538
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,260
-President Kang.
-Out of the way.

539
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,460
Get out!

540
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,670
President Kang!

541
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,210
What's going on?
Where are you going?

542
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,510
Call Seo Do-yoon

543
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,210
-Hello?
-What happened?

544
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,880
-What are you...
-It's a set-up.

545
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,460
What do you mean?

546
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,130
The police won't be able to solve it,
so I ran away.

547
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,380
I'll call you later.

548
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,380
Are you hurt?
Where are you hurt?

549
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,630
I'll drop you off somewhere,
so go wherever you need to.

550
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:47,670
Aren't you hurt?

551
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,130
-Stop the car. Hurry.
-I don't have time for that.

552
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,510
Stop the car. I'll drive.

553
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,800
Stop the car.
Otherwise, both of us will die.

554
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,590
Sit in the back.

555
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,670
Go where you need to go.

556
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,590
I'm being chased by the police.

557
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,880
I'm worse than a thief like you.

558
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:36,710
-Being with me won't be good for you.
-And go where? I have nowhere to go.

559
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,300
I have nowhere to go.
I don't know anyone either.

560
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,130
Get in the back now.

561
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,960
Why were you hurt?

562
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,510
Give me your wallet.

563
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,380
I have to buy some medicine
and I have no money.

564
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,670
Pharmacy

565
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,710
Pharmacy

566
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:25,800
Welcome.

567
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,050
Hello.

568
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:29,210
We have another shocking news.

569
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,920
May I get some gauze, bandage,

570
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,170
antiseptic and painkillers?

571
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,210
-Wait one moment.
-He died around 6 p.m.

572
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:41,630
Mr Son was shot during a shooting at "W"

573
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,050
and was being treated at the hospital

574
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,170
when he was shot by President Kang Chul.

575
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,960
-Kang is on the run at the moment.
-Did you hear that? How shocking.

576
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:56,130
-Kang Chul killed someone and fled.
-I don't believe that.

577
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,800
Do you really think
Kang Chul would do that?

578
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,380
Otherwise, why would he flee?

579
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,460
He fled because he did kill him.

580
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:07,880
Finally, all the weird happenings
made sense to me.

581
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,960
Dad and Chul's plan to
get rid of the killer

582
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,380
had failed.

583
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,130
He was shot and killed.

584
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,630
Right after the incident,

585
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,960
Kang Chul avoided police capture

586
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:22,050
-and fled the scene with a gun.
-What's this?

587
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:24,460
-We're now in a state of emergency.
-It's very strange.

588
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:27,920
-Why would Kang Chul shoot Mr Son?
-What on earth is going on?

589
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,960
-Go and find out.
-Yes, sir.

590
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,920
Detective Park, I was about to call you.

591
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,550
What happened?
Why did Kang Chul do that?

592
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:41,090
I found out why Kang Chul
killed Son Hyeon-seok.

593
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,380
I thought I should let you know first.

594
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:44,920
Why did he kill him?

595
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,590
It's true that
Kang Chul killed his father.

596
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,460
He was really the killer.

597
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,960
-We have evidence of it.
-Evidence?

598
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,760
You were right.

599
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,880
You have my respect, sir.

600
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,800
Tell me in detail.

601
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,460
Is that so?

602
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,210
As of right now,

603
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,920
we're in a world
controlled by the killer.

604
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,340
It's the world where the villain rules.

605
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,170
Is there a place you can hide?

606
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,340
Where should I go?

607
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,260
Where should I go?

608
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:27,800
Wake up.

609
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,460
Can you get up?

610
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,630
Don't lift your head.
You'll get caught on the camera.

611
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,050
Do we

612
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,300
know each other?

613
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:04,710
Do you

614
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:06,840
know me?

615
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,420
We're here. Let's get off.

616
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,960
Just a little more.
We're almost there.

617
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,880
Hang in there.

618
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,460
Why are you crying?

619
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,630
What is it?

620
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,460
-Am I dying?
-You're not dying.

621
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,510
And I'm not crying.

622
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,380
Where are we?

623
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,960
We're in a motel.

624
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,510
I tried to pick an inconspicuous one.

625
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,050
But I'm still worried.

626
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,340
You were falsely accused, right?

627
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,130
It was absurd.

628
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,340
Isn't that why you ran away?

629
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,590
I'll try to find out

630
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,090
what happened and how you can solve it.

631
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,710
I think something serious has happened.

632
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,340
I just don't know what it is yet.

633
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,340
Staying here is dangerous.

634
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,960
You also need more medicine.

635
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,460
That's why

636
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:39,550
I have to get out of here.

637
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,960
Will you be okay alone?

638
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:49,380
-Look, Ms Yeon-joo.
-Hang in there and wait for me.

639
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,260
I don't understand

640
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,050
anything you just said.

641
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,340
What are you talking about?

642
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,340
How can you help me?

643
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,380
I'm one of those people

644
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:06,130
who wish for your life to have
a happy ending.

645
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,670
Our parting should be worth something.

646
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,630
Ms Yeon-joo.

647
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,010
Who...

648
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,960
...are you?

649
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:43,420
I have to get out of here.

650
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:45,760
So...

651
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:49,960
I really hope this would work again.

652
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:34,670
To be continued

653
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:40,510

W -Two Worlds

655
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,550
Do you know what happened to Mr Kang?

656
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,840
I tried to make it a dream again
like the last time.

657
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,210
How about going further back?

658
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:19,260
Let's make it a dream he had
before the killer appeared.

659
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,460
Are you Oh Yeon-joo?

660
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,260
It wasn't only the main character
who can drag me in.

661
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:26,260
-He must be dead.
-How do you know Chul?

662
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,710
I wanted to know if he's alive.

663
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:31,210
Chul has been looking for you.

664
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,260
Is he still alive?
