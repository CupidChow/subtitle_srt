1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,460
W-Two Worlds

2
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,720
"W" is Korea's best webtoon series.

3
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,560
Kang Chul is the protagonist.

4
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,010
It looks good on you.

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,560
He meets a girl from reality,
Oh Yeon-joo,

6
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,100
and dreams of starting a happy life.

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,100
The killer who killed Chul's
entire family 10 years ago appears.

8
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,810
I will put a hole in her forehead.

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,140
He appears to Chul
and threatens to kill Yeon-joo.

10
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,600
As the purpose of the characters
in "W" disappear,

11
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,680
the characters themselves
start to disappear, too.

12
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,350
Chul join hands with the
writer of "W", Seong-moo,

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,930
and tries to protect Yeon-joo
and the world of "W".

14
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,310
They plan to catch the man who killed
Chul's entire family 10 years ago,

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,140
but just as it was
about to be accomplished...

16
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,970
The killer appears
with Seong-moo's face...

17
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,560
and makes the plan go down the drain.

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,100
He kills Mr Son Hyeon-seok
who was almost like Chul's father...

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,470
and frames Chul as the killer.

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,310
Stop the car. I will drive.

21
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,350
Chul gets shot by the police
while on the run and struggles to live.

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,970
He is saved by Yeon-joo, who went
back to the real world for Chul.

23
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,560
Go grocery shopping.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,810
Cake.

25
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,310
Give me one bite.

26
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,180
Go shopping.

27
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,310
How is this? It's 5 dollars.

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,680
It's cheap.

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,470
Episode 12

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,970
Did we do four things now?

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,470
Two more and today's task is done.

32
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,920
Do you like it with a lot of bacon?

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,040
-What did you just say?
-What?

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,540
You said something about task.

35
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,580
The task to do 10 sweet things a day.

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,330
You said your husband disappeared
after doing only four of them.

37
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,790
I wanted to do them
on behalf of your husband...

38
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,920
since you saved my life.

39
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,330
You said your husband looked like me.

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,460
Isn't that why...

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,630
you're following me?

42
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,790
How did you know?

43
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,790
I never mentioned
anything about the task.

44
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,580
I read it.

45
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,920
From where?

46
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,250
Here.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,170
Do you know this webtoon?

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,920
Your face tells me you know it well.

49
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,670
I read it here.

50
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,250
Your husband disappeared
after doing four sweet things.

51
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,420
He's so cheap.

52
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,630
How could he do that to his wife?

53
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,830
You never appeared after that
and I couldn't do anything here,

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,420
so I read this over and over.

55
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,920
The story was fun and interesting.

56
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,750
I felt bad for Kang Chul,
but he also seemed foolish...

57
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,830
like me.

58
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,080
That's why I didn't turn myself in yet.

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,170
It's so I could meet you.

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,540
I was going to ask you what happens next.

61
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,540
I couldn't go to prison
without finding that out.

62
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,880
Have you read the book after this one?

63
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,920
After this one,

64
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,630
what happens to Chul and Yeon-joo?

65
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,710
Does Chul...

66
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,130
forget Yeon-joo for good?

67
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,880
Answer me.

68
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,750
Is your husband
who suddenly disappeared...

69
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,000
...me?

70
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,500
Is it hard for you to answer?

71
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,960
Then let's find out together.

72
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,330
This is your father's studio, right?

73
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,000
I...

74
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,920
...didn't know I took the book with me.

75
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,830
I wasn't planning on telling you.

76
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,500
I was going to keep it a secret.

77
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,080
I just...

78
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,920
...wanted it to be a happy ending for you.

79
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,750
Seok-beom, wait.

80
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,170
Seok-beom, please don't go.

81
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,250
Let me go.

82
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,130
I'm so scared.

83
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,380
I'm more scared of you.
You laugh by yourself.

84
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm going back to the hospital.

85
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,460
Please stay with me just until
Yeon-joo's back.

86
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,000
When is Yeon-joo coming back?

87
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,420
You don't even know where she went.

88
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,500
Where is your father?

89
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,420
Why?

90
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,750
I want to meet him.

91
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,500
Don't worry, I won't shoot him.

92
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,250
I'd be an idiot
to make the same mistake twice.

93
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,330
Where is he?

94
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,080
He didn't draw it.

95
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,000
He never framed you.

96
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,920
Please don't mistake him.

97
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,670
Why is the door locked?

98
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,670
You'll see.

99
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Mr Oh?

100
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,330
This is Oh Seong-moo?

101
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Yes.

102
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,130
What happened to him?

103
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,500
I don't know either.

104
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,710
It's only been a few hours,
though it's been months in your time.

105
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,580
I'm dizzy.

106
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,710
I'm...

107
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,380
Come on, Dr Kang. Brother. Brother!

108
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,630
It'll only be a little while.

109
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,170
It won't be long. No.

110
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,790
Have a bowl of ramyeon.
I'll make it for you.

111
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,460
Stop offering me ramyeon.
And why do you keep touching me?

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,540
Wasn't that door closed before?

113
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,830
What? What?

114
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,580
Who...
Who is he?

115
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,500
Kang...
Kang...

116
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,330
Kang what?

117
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,580
Can you help me? She fainted.

118
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,250
Yeon-joo.

119
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,420
Yeon-joo.

120
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,580
What's wrong? Are you sick?

121
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,210
It's just exhaustion.

122
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,040
Exhaustion?

123
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,210
I skipped a month of time.

124
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,880
It was like this last time, too.

125
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,210
Does this mean all you have to do
is rest?

126
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,170
Rest should suffice.

127
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,130
I'm glad.

128
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,750
Are you going to
Myungsei University Medical Centre?

129
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,170
Of course.

130
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,790
Nurse Kim, we're coming over now.
Can you book a room for us?

131
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,460
We'll do the basic tests
and a chest x-ray.

132
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,040
Where are you going?

133
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't go.

134
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,460
I have something to take care of.
I'll join you soon.

135
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,630
Do you remember?

136
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,750
Do you...

137
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,630
...remember me?

138
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,460
Do you remember everything now?

139
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
No.

140
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,920
I'm just assuming...

141
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,330
how the Kang Chul in the comic
would have felt.

142
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,000
Since you didn't change,
I'm sure I'll find out soon...

143
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,330
what your strange charm is about.

144
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,250
I'll come by in a bit.
Please take care of her.

145
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,330
That's Kang Chul.

146
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,460
It's Kang Chul for sure.
It's definitely him. Why is he here?

147
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,920
Kang Chul...
Why is Kang Chul...

148
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
I...

149
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,790
May I come in?

150
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,080
Yes. Please come in.

151
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,080
What is your name?

152
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,710
It's Park Soo-bong.

153
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,330
I'm sorry, but can I borrow your shoes?

154
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,670
I came here without shoes.

155
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,670
Yes, sure.

156
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,250
Thank you.

157
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,380
Excuse me.

158
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,500
I've met you once before.

159
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,290
We have?

160
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,580
In the garden.

161
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,920
-I'm sorry.
-I don't think sorry will cut it.

162
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,330
I'm sorry. I don't know any scenes
that wasn't in the book.

163
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,920
I see.

164
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,670
Do you have a screwdriver?

165
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,130
A screwdriver?
Flat tip or Phillips?

166
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,750
Do you want both?

167
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,790
A loud noise

168
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,830
Pardon me.

169
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,920
Here you go.

170
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,210
I brought both flat tip
and Phillips screwdrivers...

171
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,830
just in case.

172
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,420
What are you going to do?

173
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,130
It's because it's dangerous. The
same thing shouldn't happen again.

174
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,330
He won't come out
if I destroy it completely.

175
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,000
I see.

176
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,540
If you disassemble it, you won't
be able to assemble it back.

177
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,250
What if you need it again?

178
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,580
Oh, right. You majored in
computer science.

179
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,330
-What happened to Oh Seong-moo?
-Well,

180
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,420
when I came back
after getting some snacks,

181
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,790
his face had disappeared like that.

182
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,170
He was drawing furiously
as the killer instructed him...

183
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,130
to draw the gun and the voice file.

184
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,210
It wasn't just a mess over there.

185
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,250
It was such a mess here, too.

186
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeon-joo suddenly disappeared...

187
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,830
after Mr Oh's face disappeared.

188
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,580
I was so scared that I was shuddering,

189
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,000
and then you suddenly appeared.

190
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,330
By the way, Chul,

191
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,920
may I have a handshake?

192
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,920
I've been your fan for a long time.

193
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,080
I couldn't talk to you back then
because of the situation,

194
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,630
so I...

195
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,830
Goodness.

196
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,790
It was me who drew the penthouse
and the broadcasting station.

197
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,670
I'm the one who draws those.

198
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,000
I've been drawing the background
for three years.

199
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,540
Is that so?

200
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,330
This is amazing.

201
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,880
Do you want some beer? You like
beer. I have beers of all types.

202
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,290
Water will do.

203
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,250
I'll bring you some water.
Of course I will.

204
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,000
Goodness, this is incredible.

205
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,130
Oh, my goodness.

206
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,500
He even smells good.

207
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Oh, no.

208
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,880
Here's your water.

209
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,170
Thank you. Where can I find
what happens after episode 34?

210
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,250
-Episode 34?
-I need to see the next one...

211
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
to find out what's been happening.

212
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,290
Here you go.

213
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,330
Is this the letter I sent?

214
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes, you sent it to Mr Oh.

215
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,710
Where is Kang Chul?

216
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,290
Please give it to your father.

217
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,500
Mr Oh and I were creating a story...

218
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,290
to catch the killer...

219
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,330
when that happened to Mr Oh.

220
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,130
-What's the story you came up with?
-Hold on.

221
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,000
This is the storyboard.

222
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:17,080
You can't shoot me
because you're just a set-up.

223
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,920
You're just an illusion.

224
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,040
You're nothing but a character I created.

225
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,880
Why did you have to
appear in front of me,

226
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,210
pretending to be human?

227
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,630
You're just a character,
do you understand?

228
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,500
You're just a set-up I created.

229
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,040
How can you be the Creator?

230
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,790
Why did I think you were the Creator?

231
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,750
Why was I so upset...

232
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,000
that I shot you?

233
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,630
You're nothing either.

234
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,580
Who is it?

235
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,500
Take a guess.

236
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,830
Guess who I am.

237
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,580
How do you feel being alone
in an empty world?

238
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,130
You love shooting and killing people,

239
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,630
but you have no one to kill now.

240
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,500
You probably can't shoot either.

241
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,500
How are you surviving?

242
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,130
You can't leave again like last time...

243
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,330
because I got rid of the exit.

244
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,210
Isn't it better to just die?

245
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,460
Are you telling me...

246
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,000
-to die?
-What's the point of living alone?

247
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
The time there would stop forever.

248
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,460
Why would I die?

249
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,920
Just a little bit more and
you'll disappear first.

250
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,540
You're no longer the main character.
You're a murderer and a fugitive.

251
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,630
You'll disappear soon.

252
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,000
Once the main character disappears,

253
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,330
the world keeps going again.

254
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,210
All I have to do is
wait for you to disappear,

255
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,170
so why would I die?

256
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,460
Mum?

257
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,130
Was that a dream?

258
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,830
Was that all a dream?

259
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,710
-Hello?
-Are you awake?

260
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,710
How do you feel?

261
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,920
Hello? Can you hear me?

262
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,210
I hear you.

263
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,710
I asked how you are.
Are you all right?

264
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,460
I think I am all right.

265
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,420
But where are you right now?

266
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,130
I'm near your father's studio.

267
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,880
You're here right now?

268
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,540
Are you really calling me from here?

269
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,420
How can I call you from inside the comic?

270
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,540
I just got a mobile phone
under Park Soo-bong's name.

271
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,580
Save the number. It's mine.

272
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,170
Will you continue to sleep?

273
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,920
If you're feeling okay,
let's go on a date.

274
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,630
A date?

275
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,500
While you were down for two days,
I adjusted to this world.

276
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,540
I also figured out what's happening.
I did everything.

277
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,000
Except for my marriage problem.

278
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,670
What?

279
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,040
It says that I am your husband,

280
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,750
and I think it's certainly true.
But I've only read it in the comic,

281
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,250
so I can't really feel it.

282
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,250
I've been waiting for you to wake up.

283
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,330
Let's go on a date.

284
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,000
You know me too well while
I don't know much about you.

285
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,080
So you need to give me
chances to catch up.

286
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,630
You don't want to?

287
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,540
I have to go to Dad.
Plus, I just woke up.

288
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,000
Let's talk about your dad
when we meet. I got things to say.

289
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,790
You'll go on a date with me, right?

290
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,290
Start getting ready.
I'll call you when I'm near.

291
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,880
-Hello?
-I was...

292
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,830
I was just checking
if it's really your number.

293
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,830
It is.

294
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,580
But where did you get the money
to buy the phone?

295
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,170
Oh, I took it from Soo-bong.

296
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,540
Can you pay him back for me?
I borrowed quite a lot.

297
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,880
Am I your bank or something?

298
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,920
You want me to pay for myself?

299
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,130
You're mean.

300
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,540
Even when I was broke,
I bought you clothes and ice cream.

301
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,170
I didn't say anything.
I was just asking.

302
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,170
-Why?
-When are you coming again?

303
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,290
Will 30 minutes be enough?

304
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,790
No. Give me an hour.

305
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,290
Okay.

306
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,290
Yes. He borrowed money.

307
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,080
-1,000 dollars.
-1,000 dollars?

308
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,210
-That's a lot.
-Well,

309
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,670
he had to buy shoes,
clothes and a mobile phone.

310
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,750
He needs money
to go on a date with you, too.

311
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,170
I'll pay you back later.

312
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,080
Don't worry about it.
I guess he will pay me.

313
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,920
You can't handle it.
He spends like the super rich.

314
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,790
I know. I'm going to go bankrupt.

315
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,830
By the way, what's going to happen now?

316
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,080
Will he continue to live here?

317
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,330
Is that possible?
Can I get my money back?

318
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,920
I mean, it's been all right so far.

319
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,630
I wonder if it's possible from now on.

320
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,420
I'm normal when I'm there.

321
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
So isn't it the same?

322
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,630
By the way, did you know?

323
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,960
There's something strange with his hand.

324
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,540
Don't you have more?

325
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,380
How much more?

326
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,330
The more the better.
I need a lot of things.

327
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,960
Is that all?

328
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,920
I have more in my bank account.

329
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,920
What? Your hand...

330
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,000
What? Your...

331
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,790
It's happening because
I'm not acting like the protagonist.

332
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,670
Don't tell Yeon-joo.

333
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,000
Do you remember when
So-hee was about to disappear,

334
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,250
her hand turned translucent?

335
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,000
Gosh. He told me not to tell you.

336
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,920
I said it.

337
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,210
Don't tell him that I told you.

338
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,500
Let's talk later.
Someone's at the door.

339
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,790
Gosh, I might not get my money back.

340
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,790
Mum?

341
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,630
Yeon-joo.

342
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,500
-May I come in?
-Wait.

343
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,080
How...
How did you come here?

344
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,080
You said you'd call when you're near.

345
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,920
I wanted to see how you live.

346
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,420
What?

347
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,290
I heard from Soo-bong that
your mum went to work.

348
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,880
I'm coming in.

349
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,290
The book lacks a lot of information.

350
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,790
I have the right to
know about you, too, don't I?

351
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,630
I guess.

352
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,210
So this is where you live.

353
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,580
Yes.

354
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,750
This is where I live.
It's nothing like a penthouse.

355
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,710
It's nice and cosy in here.

356
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,000
It's similar to my old house.

357
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,830
Why did you come barging in?
I'm not ready yet.

358
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,330
Get ready and come out. I'll wait.

359
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,670
There are beverages in the fridge.
Feel free to drink them.

360
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,830
Okay.

361
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,670
Wait.

362
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,000
Can you take off your gown?

363
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,880
What did you just say?

364
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,540
Nothing.

365
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,460
You're sad that I don't remember it,

366
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,830
and I'm frustrated, too.

367
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,920
So shouldn't we do everything
we did in this comic?

368
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,460
We should see each other in the nude
and kiss five times.

369
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,170
There is a big gap in our relationships.

370
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,420
I'm curious.

371
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,080
I want to feel how
Chul felt in this comic.

372
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,460
You're joking, right?

373
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,750
I am very serious right now.

374
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,920
Geez, no way.

375
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,630
Take your time.
I will wait for you here.

376
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,210
Did we complete four?
Is it time to do the task?

377
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,460
What are you doing?

378
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,380
Thank you.

379
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,920
For what?

380
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,630
For not forgetting me and missing me.

381
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,130
We didn't take any picture.

382
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,420
Let's take a picture together.
I regretted it a lot.

383
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,880
Okay.

384
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,920
Is she your mother?
She's beautiful.

385
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Yes.

386
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,750
Your husband had
never been in your room, right?

387
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
What?

388
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,630
If he knew you were such a messy person,

389
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,920
he would've thought
about marriage one more time.

390
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,540
He's such a neat-freak.

391
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,830
He would've been shocked.

392
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,630
It's all your fault!

393
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,830
I was going mad because
I thought you might be dead.

394
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,170
When would I have the time
to clean my room?

395
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,170
And I'm originally a very neat person.

396
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,330
I've seen everything,
so I'll go down and wait.

397
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,790
Come down when you are ready.

398
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,920
Where shall we go?

399
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,830
What do you feel like eating?

400
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,330
Are you going to treat me?

401
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,080
You don't know any place.

402
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,920
You have neither money nor friends.

403
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,790
So I have to buy.

404
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,080
I'll tell you what I
think about the comic.

405
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,500
Chul and Yeon-joo
got married too early.

406
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,290
But then, there was a situation.

407
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,170
So let's go on a date.

408
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,170
Like other couples.

409
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
It's funny that we're on a date
when we're married.

410
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,750
Let's take time to do
the sweet things you like.

411
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,920
Let's go naturally with the flow.

412
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,250
What do you think?

413
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,210
I'd like that.

414
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,210
Where should we go? You can choose.

415
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,750
Maybe we came too late.
It's just us here.

416
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,670
Right.

417
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,630
When do I get to have those five kisses?

418
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,460
What?

419
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,040
How about now? No one is around.

420
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,710
That's enough joking around.

421
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,210
I'm serious.

422
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,580
I was joking about seeing you in
the nude earlier, but I'm serious now.

423
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,710
You don't want to?
Is it too awkward?

424
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,130
-Then we'll take it slow.
-No.

425
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,880
Why would it be awkward?

426
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,290
Then can I do it?

427
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,290
Yes.

428
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,830
You can...

429
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,500
So this is what it feels like.

430
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
I see.

431
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,880
-I get it.
-What did you get?

432
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,500
How does it feel?

433
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,580
No comment.

434
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,250
No comment?

435
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,170
It's delicious.
I'm glad you picked this place.

436
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,130
Are you mad?
Why aren't you talking?

437
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,170
Your hand...

438
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,420
What do we do?

439
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,290
I know you've been hiding it
from me since earlier.

440
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,710
I was going to tell you
after we finished.

441
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,330
I can't...

442
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,170
...eat.

443
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,290
It's been like this for a month.

444
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,170
Ever since Mr Son died.

445
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,790
-What are we going to do?
-Take care of it.

446
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,330
How are we going to take care of it?

447
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,000
I've talked to your father a lot
since then.

448
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,420
You talked with my father?

449
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,210
I didn't know which was the real
Oh Seong-moo, so I met both.

450
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,710
That's how I knew why our plan failed.

451
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,670
No. No, no!

452
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,500
Please don't kill me.

453
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,460
Don't kill me.

454
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,210
Who are you?

455
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,290
I'm supposed to kill Kang Chul.

456
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,000
Why did you kill him?

457
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,670
How are you alive
when you've been stabbed?

458
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,330
What are you?

459
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,000
Who are you?

460
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,000
Don't be so conceited.

461
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,500
You didn't find out first.
I found out long before you did.

462
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh Seong-moo promised me then...

463
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,000
to give me a face.

464
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,830
One more thing.

465
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,750
Please...

466
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,540
You'll be the protagonist.
I'll turn you into the protagonist.

467
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,210
No, it's not hard to do.

468
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,710
I can make it happen. Please...

469
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,290
He told me I'd become
the protagonist if I get rid of you.

470
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,170
He promised me,

471
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,420
but he betrayed me
as soon as he returned.

472
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,420
That jerk.

473
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,670
That's why I ate him.

474
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,920
For breaking his promise.

475
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,130
What does...

476
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,830
There's something your father
failed to tell me.

477
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,710
He had already met the killer that day.

478
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,960
And that they'd made a promise.

479
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,920
That's why it didn't work
when we tried to turn it into a dream.

480
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,960
He was aware of his identity,
and only my memories were erased.

481
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,330
It's my mistake.

482
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,380
I chose the wrong point in time
to turn into a dream.

483
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,830
That's why things got messy.

484
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,670
Then...

485
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,080
I thought about it.

486
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,710
Let's make a promise.

487
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,630
About what?

488
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,920
When you go to the studio,

489
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,000
draw me a picture.

490
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,670
What do you mean? What now?

491
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,000
Are you telling me to turn this
into a dream all over again?

492
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,880
Then you'll disappear from here.

493
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,000
It's easy for you since
you'll forget about me and live on,

494
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,210
but I have to stay here by myself
and repeat the memories again.

495
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,710
If you were going to ask me this,

496
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,960
why did you ask me on this date?

497
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,080
Why did you kiss me just now?

498
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,710
-I never mentioned dreams.
-That's what you're trying to say.

499
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,880
You want to turn back time to
before the killer knew his identity...

500
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,500
so that everyone is safe.

501
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,830
That's what the cartoon Kang Chul said.

502
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,330
That's not my plan.

503
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,580
We were in a bind
and didn't have a choice then.

504
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,710
Now we have time to think.

505
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,080
I don't want to live the same life
all over again either.

506
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,170
Nor do I want you to have
these repeating memories.

507
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,000
Then...

508
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,540
what do you want me to draw?

509
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,790
Draw this for me.

510
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,790
What is this?

511
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,920
I think the killer has to die
for your dad to return.

512
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,710
Since I'm no longer the protagonist,

513
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,460
I might disappear again.

514
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,670
There is only one solution.

515
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,420
Proceed with the story your father
and I had planned from the beginning.

516
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,420
Hello?

517
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,750
It's me.

518
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,330
How are the kids?

519
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,380
We have to catch the killer
and make Han Cheol-ho kill him.

520
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,420
That's the best way.
So we must make it happen.

521
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,960
It's the only way for your father
and I to live.

522
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,630
Although,

523
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,920
I want to change
the ending your father wrote.

524
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,080
In the end,

525
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,880
Kang Chul and Oh Yeon-joo
should get married and live happily.

526
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,540
That would be the best ending for "W".

527
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,000
Don't you think so?

528
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,380
I don't care what the readers think.

529
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,710
I realised it after I saw your father.

530
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,670
Oh Seong-moo is not god.

531
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:04,330
This happened because he thought he was.

532
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:08,750
It's impossible for him to have
created everything in that world.

533
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,920
How can a writer make up
billions of characters?

534
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,380
It doesn't make sense.

535
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,750
What he could control was the few
he designed himself.

536
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,920
That's the conclusion I came to.

537
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,750
The comic book is only a pathway
to connect the two worlds.

538
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,290
This world and that world
are exclusively independent.

539
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,630
Two different worlds.

540
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,080
-Where does the killer live?
-Pardon?

541
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,130
There must be a place. Is there
any photo you used for reference?

542
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:01,580
There are photos of an apartment I used.

543
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,830
Where is it?

544
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,000
Was the killer's address
mentioned in the webtoon?

545
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,710
No, because things happened
before I drew anything.

546
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,460
That's why the police couldn't find him.

547
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,710
These are the photos
of the apartment I used.

548
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,960
Sungha Apartment in
Mungye-dong, Dobong-gu, Seoul

549
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,210
What the two worlds share in common
are things in the webtoon...

550
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,420
including me, a few other characters...

551
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:34,080
and certain locations
and things that are set up.

552
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,080
The two worlds came together
via Oh Seong-moo's tablet.

553
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,540
I also left via the tablet,

554
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,130
but there were variables.

555
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,790
-What's going on?
-The characters became aware.

556
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,830
Yeon-joo?

557
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,580
Depending on which
characters became aware,

558
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,040
people in real life were called upon.

559
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,630
They were ejected when one episode ended.

560
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,630
Variables continued to appear,

561
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,750
and because of that,
you've been used thus far.

562
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,830
You've been used enough.

563
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,500
It's time that we use
the variables to our advantage.

564
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,750
What do you want to eat?

565
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,580
-A hamburger.
-A hamburger?

566
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,380
Let's go get some hamburgers.

567
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:37,250
I chose apartment No. 815.
There's no particular reason.

568
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,920
10 minutes will be enough.

569
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,290
After 10 minutes, turn it on.

570
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,080
I'm in reality right now.

571
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,830
At the same time,
I'm one of the characters.

572
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,790
If a character
can call someone in reality,

573
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,040
my first hypothesis is...

574
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,170
that I can pull myself back
into the world of the webtoon.

575
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:25,790
From now on, I'll summon myself.

576
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,580
Here I come,

577
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,830
world of the webtoon.

578
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,420
Hello, this is 112.

579
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,000
I'd like to report a murder suspect.

580
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,040
I'm listening.
Which murder case are you referring to?

581
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,420
I caught the killer of
the shooting at Channel W.

582
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:10,790
Please come arrest him.

583
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,790
Okay, please wait one moment.

584
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,420
The address is No. 815 Block 2,
Sungha Apartment, 216-13 Mungye-dong,

585
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,630
Dobong-gu, Seoul.

586
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:19,830
His name is Han Sang-hoon.

587
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,880
We'll leave now and check.

588
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,460
Could you identify yourself?

589
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:26,830
I'm just a citizen.

590
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,330
Hello? Hello?

591
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:33,460
Sir, we received an important report.

592
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,420
Which one of us will die first?

593
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,630
I think it'll be you.

594
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,920
Since I caught the killer, it will
take some time for me to disappear.

595
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,500
I completed one of
the main character's tasks.

596
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,080
You scum.

597
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,000
Rot in the detention centre for a while.

598
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,630
I'll think about how to kill you.

599
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,080
Is this...

600
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,420
Once you leave here,
go to the office and draw this.

601
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,210
I've re-assembled the tablet.

602
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,750
No. You already know.

603
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,330
If I turn it on, the killer...

604
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,250
That's why we must catch
the killer so he won't roam free.

605
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,130
I'll stop him from getting his hands...

606
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,040
on the tablet.

607
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,960
First, draw my getaway car.

608
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,630
Check his identity.

609
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,420
He looks like him.

610
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,920
We caught the killer of the shooting.

611
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,290
Please send us support.

612
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:59,670
All right, that's enough.
Let's stop the interview now.

613
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,920
I'm a little tired.

614
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,250
Sir, the killer of
the shooting got arrested.

615
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,460
Wait a moment.

616
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,670
What do you mean? Where?

617
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,540
He was arrested in
his apartment in Dobong-gu.

618
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,250
-How?
-Someone reported to the police.

619
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,750
Who are you talking about?

620
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,630
-What?
-Isn't it Chul?

621
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:20,920
The person who reported him.

622
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,920
The police said
his voice was similar to his.

623
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,420
What if he's alive?

624
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,790
I think he's alive.

625
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,250
It's definitely Chul.

626
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,830
Perhaps.
We should find out more about it.

627
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,040
Okay.

628
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:41,580
No way.

629
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,290
It can't be.
He was certainly there.

630
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,830
At around 10:30 p.m. today,

631
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,630
the suspect who shot dead 10 people
at Channel W office...

632
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,540
was arrested in his home.

633
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,500
The suspect hasn't been identified yet.

634
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,580
He was reported by a courageous citizen.

635
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,420
The anonymous citizen went
into the suspect's house,

636
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,460
and after a fight, he reported...

637
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,670
The second thing you must draw is...

638
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,830
my dead, decaying body.

639
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:28,330
Where are you?

640
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,830
-What do you mean?
-Did you see the news?

641
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,210
So-hee thinks it's you
who caught the killer.

642
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:34,830
Yes, I caught him.

643
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,540
What? Is it true?

644
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
-How did you do it?
-Do-yoon, listen carefully.

645
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,170
Go to my house where I was 15 days ago.

646
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,170
There you'll find my body.

647
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,790
What? What are you talking about?

648
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,290
Report it to the police
and let everyone know.

649
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,130
The body's DNA will match mine.

650
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,330
Do-yoon, I'm dead.

651
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,080
I got shot and died unjustly
under a false charge.

652
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,130
However, I'm still alive, so don't worry.

653
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,630
I thought you should know.

654
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,420
-Hey.
-It's better that...

655
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,290
So-hee thinks I'm dead.

656
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,250
It's for her own good.

657
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,670
I'll call you later.

658
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Then,

659
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,330
what about So-hee?

660
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:38,040
If it's a happy ending for us,

661
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,330
she'll disappear again.

662
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,670
-I'll create a variable for her.
-A variable?

663
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:47,500
I can't accept the fact that there's
only one reason for our existence.

664
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,290
When there's a variable, the
direction of one's life changes...

665
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,170
like how I met you.

666
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,630
If her fate is determined only
because she's one of the characters,

667
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,830
we'll free her.

668
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,420
Do-yoon, I'm going to
the police station now.

669
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,670
I heard the voice, and I think it's him,

670
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,000
so right now, I...

671
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:21,920
What?

672
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,460
He's dead?

673
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,170
I'm going to get rid of...

674
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,210
the set-up for So-hee.

675
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,630
Today on the 23rd,

676
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,250
a dead body found in
Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi Province...

677
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,460
has been identified by the police
as Kang Chul.

678
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,790
On the 22nd of last month,

679
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,460
Kang was on the run under the charge
of killing the director of WBN.

680
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,000
After 33 days of fleeing,
he was found dead.

681
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,830
Kang was shot
by the police while fleeing...

682
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:13,750
How will you come back?

683
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,830
Once you leave now, it's over.

684
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:21,460
You can't come back here.

685
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,250
I think I can.

686
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,420
It was only possible
when you became aware.

687
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,330
That means you have to come back
after losing all of your memories.

688
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,130
-Then, it'll only be a dream.
-I don't want dreams anymore.

689
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:34,920
What are you going to do?

690
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,580
I think it'll be possible.
Wait here for me.

691
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,830
You said that last time, too.

692
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,920
You said you'd wait
until the operation is over,

693
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,630
but you disappeared.

694
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:47,790
That's Kang Chul in the comic.

695
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,130
There's one more thing
I'd like you to draw.

696
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,920
It's too expensive here
and I couldn't afford it.

697
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,040
Draw me the ring I lost.

698
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,000
My second hypothesis is...

699
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,830
that I've been called into reality.

700
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,130
Therefore, when the mission
in one episode is accomplished,

701
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:53,710
I shall...

702
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,540
come back.

703
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,210
To be continued

704
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,710
Kang Chul

705
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,080
Hello?

706
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:46,960
I came back.

707
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,130
Where are you?

708
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,420
I'm coming to you now.

709
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,830
Get ready to finish our date.

710
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,830
Let's finish our five kisses today.

711
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,330
What?

712
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:05,420
I can't stand losing.

713
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,330
I can't let your ex-husband
defeat me.

714
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,830
That's a strange competition.

715
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,830
Are you competing with someone?

716
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,080
You'll find out soon
that I'm much better.

717
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,710
W -Two Worlds

718
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:58,670
Oh Yeon-joo again!
The character I'm tired of...

719
00:59:58,750 --> 00:59:59,750
appeared again.

720
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:02,580
"W" is no longer a webtoon.
I have abandoned it.

721
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,920
Hope makes me imagine again.

722
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,540
As Chul came back to me,

723
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:08,540
"W" ended with a happy ending.

724
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,040
I heard Han Sang-hoon
escaped from prison.

725
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:12,580
You're Chul's family. The purpose of
my existence is to get rid of you.

726
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:14,250
No one asked you to be
the female lead in this comic.

727
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:15,830
Did you think it'd be a happy ending?

728
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:19,630
What happened to the woman who was here?

729
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:23,710
This is the last episode of "W."
