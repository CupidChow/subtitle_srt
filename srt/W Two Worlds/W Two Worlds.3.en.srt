1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,510
W – Two Worlds

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,070
"W" by Oh Seong-moo

3
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,940
Kang Chul gets attacked
on a hotel rooftop.

4
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,000
A strange woman appears shortly after
and saves him.

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,860
Wake up! Hey!

6
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,770
She leaves a business card with
the name "Oh Yeon-joo" and disappears.

7
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,950
Yeon-joo, where are you right now?

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,290
A nurse was instigated
by an unidentified person

9
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,240
and Kang Chul is put in danger
once again.

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,910
-Please let me in.
-No, you are not allowed.

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,370
Oh, no. Please.

12
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,660
-Yeon-joo suddenly appears to help.
-Are you okay?

13
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,080
We finally meet each other.

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,620
He avoids death once again.

15
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,080
Yeon-joo keeps appearing in his life.

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,580
Why don't you...

17
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,460
Kang Chul senses that

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,750
she holds the key to his life.

19
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,250
I drew it.

20
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,870
It's my artwork.

21
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,330
He's a monster.

22
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,120
I created a monster.

23
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,460
So I decided to judge him.

24
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,830
I should've finished his life
a long time ago.

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,250
Who...

26
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,080
...are you?

27
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,410
Episode 3

28
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,290
-Yeon-joo.
-Hey.

29
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,750
-Dad is in his room, right?
-He went out.

30
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,500
Where did he go again?

31
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,870
I don't know.
He packed his things and went out.

32
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,250
He even took his computer.

33
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,540
He kicked us out.
He told us to go home.

34
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,290
I sent Seon-mi and Yoon-hee home.

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,200
But I can't stop thinking that
it's strange.

36
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,500
I think Mr Oh kicked us out because
I told you Chul was going to die.

37
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,000
But that would mean that woman...

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,160
...is you. It should be you.

39
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,290
I told you that Chul was going to die,

40
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,710
so you went into the webtoon,
saved his life and got out again.

41
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,460
Yes. But it just
doesn't make any sense.

42
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,870
It doesn't make sense,
but it actually does.

43
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,080
It doesn't make any sense,
but it actually does.

44
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,620
It's...

45
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,080
Yeon-joo, your dress...

46
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,160
Soo-bong, listen to me carefully.

47
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,710
Do you know how much this dress is?

48
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,950
It's over 3,000 dollars.

49
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,870
What about these shoes?

50
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,750
Do you think I would buy all these
with my own money?

51
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,660
That's right.

52
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,370
Who among my friends would buy

53
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,160
this expensive dress for me
with no problem?

54
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,750
Is it...

55
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,000
...Seok-beom?

56
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,410
Professor Park?

57
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,870
Your father?

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,200
Are you saying it's Chul?

59
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,750
Do you believe me now?

60
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,660
Do you?

61
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,580
-Gosh, Soo-bong.
-Don't come any closer!

62
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,040
What's wrong?

63
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,910
-Get up now.
-Don't come closer!

64
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,540
Still, it doesn't make sense.

65
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,620
-How can this be happening?
-Stop talking.

66
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,460
I will.
How did you go into the webtoon?

67
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,200
Can you go in whenever you like?
Can I go in, too?

68
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,330
I don't know why I keep going inside it.

69
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,410
I suddenly found myself in the webtoon.

70
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,290
Anyhow, a few things became clear.

71
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,790
Everything in that world
revolves around Chul.

72
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,750
I don't appear on the cartoon
unless I get involved with Chul.

73
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,460
The time I do my own things
and my thoughts...

74
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,580
don't count. It all gets edited out.

75
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,040
Chul is the main character and
I'm just a supporting role.

76
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,750
Also, time centres around Chul.

77
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,080
It skips the time when
Chul isn't doing anything.

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,950
That's how two months
could pass in an instant.

79
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,950
Less than five minutes in this world...

80
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,870
...can be as long as
two months over there.

81
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,870
It can even be 2 years or 20 years.

82
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,950
How is it possible?

83
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,540
Think about it.

84
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,830
This webtoon has been published
serially for seven years.

85
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,710
During those 7 years,
15 years have passed in Chul's life.

86
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,120
It makes sense that
time passes faster in it.

87
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,410
It only shows important incidents.

88
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,830
Also, whether I can come back
or not depends on Chul.

89
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,500
An ending scene must include
a change in Chul's mind.

90
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,750
That's how an episode ends.

91
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,200
I can only come back when
the episode ends, and that's why...

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,460
-I did it.
-Did what?

93
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,660
You mean the kiss?

94
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,660
Did you really kiss Chul?

95
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,620
I didn't have a choice.
I had to surprise him or something.

96
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,370
I needed an ending scene.

97
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,750
No way. You did it on purpose.

98
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,660
-Everyone knows you're a fan of Chul.
-I didn't do it on purpose!

99
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,620
Was it good?

100
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,870
What?

101
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,580
I mean...

102
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,500
...he's a cartoon character.
He's not a real person.

103
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,500
How was the touch of his lips?

104
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,950
How did you feel when you kissed him?

105
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,080
I was in a hurry.
I didn't feel anything.

106
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,750
And he's not a cartoon character.

107
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,580
He is a human.

108
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,370
He's no different from us.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,500
So you were in a hurry.

110
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,580
Tell me this. Is he handsome?

111
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,290
He is.

112
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,910
And did you see So-hee, too?

113
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,660
Sure, I did.

114
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,580
-Is she really glamorous?
-Goodness.

115
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,120
Why are all men so crazy
about women's figure?

116
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,540
I'm not crazy about it.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,710
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.
Now it sounds so real.

118
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,120
It is real.

119
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,910
You'll see the reason why
I tried to save him soon.

120
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,040
He's an actual human just like us.

121
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,160
How can I watch him die?

122
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,830
Besides, I'm a doctor.

123
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,540
Right. Mr Oh said he will
end it today.

124
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,870
End what?

125
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,000
He said today's episode
will be the last one.

126
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,580
He said he'll redo today's episode.
He'll probably kill Chul.

127
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,830
He must've left because
he didn't want to be disturbed.

128
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,830
He's going to kill Chul again?

129
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,750
I should've finished his life
a long time ago.

130
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,950
Right there at the Han River Bridge.

131
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,080
He'll come back when he's done.
Even if you find him...

132
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,950
Soo-bong, do you remember when Chul
almost threw himself from a bridge?

133
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,160
In what year was that story published?

134
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,200
It was in the fifth book.
So it must be 2009.

135
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,460
In 2009?

136
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,000
2012 Reference Documents for "W"

137
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,840
2009 Reference Documents for "W"

138
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,950
Jeon Seung-min,
star of Athens Olympics

139
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,370
Suicides on Han River Bridge

140
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,580
Yeon-joo left me.
I'm all alone now.

141
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,910
Yeon-joo left me.

142
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,540
I'm all alone now.

143
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,000
Let's go.

144
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,910
I'm left alone in this house.

145
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,040
I no longer have a family.

146
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,160
I've lost my will to do anything.

147
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,120
I can't even draw a single cut.

148
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,830
How will I continue my work?

149
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,330
That's right.

150
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,080
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,160
The real reason why people die
if they fall off a bridge

152
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,580
I'm sorry, but I need to end it here.
But I need to end it here.

153
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,290
Was Chul supposed to die here?

154
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,950
What?

155
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Goodbye.

156
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,950
Hello?

157
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,620
It's all right.

158
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,540
I'll send it soon.

159
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,410
It's all done,

160
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,660
but I fell asleep.

161
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,540
Actually,

162
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,620
I should stop here for now.

163
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,790
It's due to a personal reason.

164
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,710
I already have the ending.

165
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,660
It's strange.

166
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,330
I could swear I ended it last night
with him in the water.

167
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,750
However, Kang Chul is still alive.

168
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,620
He was holding on to the railing
with one hand

169
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,620
all night long.

170
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,460
Was I drunk?

171
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,750
Did I dream of drawing the character
dead without actually doing it?

172
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,950
However,

173
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,410
this may be a start

174
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,410
to find strength again.

175
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,330
That's why...

176
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,830
I decided to save Chul.

177
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,000
2010 Reference Documents for "W"

178
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,870
The fact that JN Global's
joint representative...

179
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,370
...is Olympian Kang Chul
has become an issue.

180
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:45,370
This is his first public appearance
after his court judgement in 2007.

181
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,830
JN Global is an e-commerce company

182
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,500
that went public last year and
it is maintaining its market price...

183
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,080
-Hey, did you wait a long time?
-Yes.

184
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,910
What do you think about
me buying this broadcasting station?

185
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,460
What did you say?

186
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,200
Now that I have money,
I should catch him.

187
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,540
You said money
and labour force were an issue.

188
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,580
Using a private agency is illegal.
And I can't use national institutions.

189
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,660
So I thought I could buy
this broadcasting station.

190
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,040
I can find the culprit by making
a crime-solving programme.

191
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,160
The staff should only be composed
of Korea's best professionals.

192
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll hire only the best
state attorneys and prosecutors.

193
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,620
I'll provide all the money.

194
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,410
You can be the supervisor.

195
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,750
I already decided the name
of the channel to be "W."

196
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,080
"W" for "who" and "why."

197
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,080
The purpose is to find out who
committed the crime and why.

198
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,250
Who killed my family

199
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,500
and why did they do it?

200
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,120
I should find that out now.

201
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
It was like I was possessed.

202
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I respect you, sir.

203
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Thank you very much.

204
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,290
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you!

205
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,750
Hello. I'm a huge fan of "W!"

206
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,040
Thank you.

207
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,830
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

208
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,790
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

209
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,950
My gosh!

210
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,370
Mr Oh, I respect you very much.

211
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,660
-Please accept me as your student.
-Please stand up.

212
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,950
-Thank you.
-Things are working out so well

213
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,500
-that even I can't believe it.
-Oh, my gosh!

214
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,580
Do you enjoy reading webtoons?

215
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,540
There's a webtoon that's lauded...

216
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,120
to have changed the dynamics
of Korean media contents.

217
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,410
He's become popular recently.

218
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,790
The webtoon artist of "W,"

219
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,330
Oh Seong-moo is with us today. Hello.

220
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,620
Hello.

221
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,040
I've wanted to meet you.
I finally get to meet you today.

222
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,950
-It's nice to meet you.
-Me, too.

223
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,950
I'm actually a big fan of yours.

224
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,870
Thank you.

225
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,500
How do you feel these days?
Does the popularity of "W"

226
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,000
feel real to you?

227
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,910
I'm not sure.

228
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,660
I've only been working on my desk

229
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,950
and busily trying to meet deadlines.

230
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,160
Now that I'm sitting here,

231
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,620
-it seems more real.
-I see.

232
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,950
There's "Sherlock Holmes" in London

233
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,910
I definitely succeeded.

234
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Soo-seon must regret
that she left me.

235
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,330
Darn, I lost him!

236
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Strange things keep happening these days.

237
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,370
My drawing doesn't turn out
the way I want.

238
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:46,330
It feels as if Kang Chul is rejecting
the story that I'm coming up with.

239
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,910
Where are you going?

240
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,160
Is it because of the alcohol?

241
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,750
It happened again.

242
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,250
I woke up in the morning
and saw a scene I didn't draw.

243
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,870
Have I lost my mind?

244
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,790
He's alive.
He's definitely alive.

245
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,460
I can definitely feel it, but how...

246
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,830
How is he alive?

247
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,460
2015 Reference Documents for "W"

248
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Monster

249
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,540
I'd rather slaughter than be slaughtered.

250
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,830
Monster.

251
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,200
He's a monster.

252
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
He'll kill me one day.

253
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,620
I'd rather slaughter than be slaughtered.

254
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,370
No.

255
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,080
I should have killed him a long time ago.

256
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,950
Everything went wrong

257
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,660
since the time at the Han River.

258
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,200
-What medicine is that?
-I have a headache.

259
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,500
You probably caught a cold after
only wearing a dress on a rainy night.

260
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,370
-I know.
-Why did you go out so late?

261
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,830
No one cares.

262
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,290
I'm leaving.

263
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,460
Goodness, what on earth is this?

264
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,250
Gosh.

265
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,790
Why with Yeon-joo?

266
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,330
What kind of rubbish is this?

267
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,080
The door is closing.

268
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,460
I felt some negative energy just now.

269
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,540
-What on earth?
-Kang Chul kissed her.

270
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,120
Goodness.

271
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,870
What's with this woman? I hate her.

272
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,410
Everyone in the country is reading it.

273
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,620
Soo-bong, I just got off work.
How's Dad?

274
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,660
He's not home yet.

275
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,870
No matter how much I think about it,

276
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,790
it's still hard to believe.

277
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,410
How could it happen?

278
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,790
This is what I don't understand.

279
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,500
Let's say you initially went inside
because of Kang Chul,

280
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,200
but why did it happen again?

281
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,830
I don't know either.

282
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,000
You said you need an ending scene
to get out.

283
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,580
That means there is a rule for
entering it as well.

284
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,330
And why is it only you?

285
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,460
Isn't that the biggest problem?

286
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,500
What if you're suddenly dragged
into the webtoon?

287
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,460
What will you do then?

288
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,040
How do you know what would happen
if you get involved with Chul?

289
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,790
Yeon-joo.

290
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,950
Hello? Yeon-joo,
are you listening to me?

291
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,370
Hello?

292
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,830
Hello? Hello?

293
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,330
Yeon-joo?

294
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,040
Hello?

295
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,950
Who are you?

296
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,160
I found this mobile phone
at a bus station.

297
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,580
Where is the owner?

298
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,910
I only found this mobile phone and a bag.

299
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,870
Oh, no.

300
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,540
I'm sorry, but can you wait
for me there? I'll be right over.

301
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,620
Yes. Okay.

302
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,500
My mouth always causes problem.

303
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,950
Oh, gosh.

304
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,950
You're here. This way, please.

305
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,950
I didn't hear the details on the phone.

306
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,790
What exactly happened?

307
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,370
Mr Kang told me to make sure
nobody speaks about it.

308
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,540
Anyone who talks about it will get fired,

309
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,620
so you don't have to worry about us.

310
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,500
But we have no right
to stop our customers.

311
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,830
We got the contact number of
the person who recorded the video.

312
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,410
You should meet the customer
and settle things yourself.

313
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,460
What is the video about?

314
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,160
It's...

315
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,330
It seems like he had an argument

316
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,540
with a lady he came with.

317
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,290
An argument?

318
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,460
I don't know what exactly happened.

319
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,160
Why don't you...

320
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,580
The lady suddenly got upset
and slapped his face.

321
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,370
Then they somehow became fine again

322
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,540
and started to kiss.

323
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,910
Kiss?

324
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,950
And they went inside
the fitting room together.

325
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,710
They locked the door, too.

326
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,330
Mr Kang came out alone after a long time.

327
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,000
But that's not what he wanted to hide.

328
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,160
He wanted to hide the fact
that she disappeared.

329
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,710
She disappeared?

330
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,950
Yes. They went in together,

331
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,160
but only Mr Kang came out.
She just disappeared.

332
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,330
I don't understand
what you're talking about right now.

333
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,950
I don't understand it either.

334
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,410
-But everyone says the same thing.
-Where is the fitting room?

335
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,950
It's over there.

336
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,330
Not that. It was the other door.

337
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,620
There's nowhere to leave.
How did she manage to disappear?

338
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,870
-Can you look here?
-Excuse me?

339
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,200
Oh, my!

340
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,410
Hello?

341
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,500
I'm at the store right now.

342
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,080
Did you meet the manager?

343
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,080
Oh Yeon-joo is here.

344
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,410
-What?
-She's here.

345
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,910
Inside the fitting room.

346
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,370
What happened?

347
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,330
That's what I want to ask.
What happened?

348
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,500
She was in there.
Why did you say she disappeared?

349
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,290
Yeon-joo.

350
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,040
She won't wake up.

351
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,500
Is this the rescue centre?

352
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,950
-We have a patient here.
-Don't call an ambulance.

353
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
-Pardon?
-Hang up the phone.

354
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,370
What are you trying to do?

355
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,580
Where are you going?

356
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,460
She can't go to a hospital.
I'm taking her to a hotel.

357
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,910
How will you take the responsibility?

358
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,160
Please send over Dr Yoon.

359
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,410
I'll go there first.
Wrap up and come to the hotel.

360
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,950
What?

361
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,710
Why am I here again?

362
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,790
I'm curious, too.
Why did you come back?

363
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,870
I don't know either.

364
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,370
Sir.

365
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,040
What's going on?

366
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,290
Who is she?

367
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,410
You're here.

368
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,950
-Where's Dr Yoon?
-He's not here yet.

369
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,080
President Kang!

370
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,330
Detective Park is here.

371
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,870
Hello.

372
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,830
Hello. What brings you here?

373
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:50,290
I came in regards to
the witness named Oh Yeon-joo.

374
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,040
I see. You haven't found her yet?

375
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,950
She's really strange.

376
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,500
Just how did she manage to avoid
all the surveillance cameras?

377
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,660
You don't have to try too hard.

378
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,910
She's not a criminal.
It's okay if you can't find her.

379
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,370
What are you talking about?
We will find her.

380
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,080
By the way...

381
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,790
Something happened.

382
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,290
I need to put her in bed.

383
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,460
You don't have to see us out.

384
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,620
We'll get going, then.

385
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,040
What's this? Isn't she Ms Oh Yeon-joo?

386
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,460
What happened?

387
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,870
Finally, she's in my arms.

388
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,080
What?

389
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,950
The key to my life.

390
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,910
By the way, is she really pretty?

391
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,200
Is she pretty?

392
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,750
What?

393
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,330
Why does everyone say she's beautiful?

394
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,870
You're awake.

395
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,080
How are you feeling?

396
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,910
I feel dizzy.

397
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,040
You're probably still drowsy
from the medicine.

398
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,580
You're not dying, so don't worry.

399
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,460
Where am I?

400
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,540
My room. It's where I stay.

401
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,160
The penthouse?

402
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,370
How do you know that?

403
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:19,660
You live in a hotel penthouse.
It's on the topmost 33rd floor.

404
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,830
You really know everything about me.

405
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,080
I know everything.

406
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,580
What else do you know?

407
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,620
I know that your family

408
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:41,460
suddenly got killed in your house
and it traumatised you.

409
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,950
That's why you live in hotels
and not your own house.

410
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,580
That's interesting.

411
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,910
What else do you know?

412
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,870
You keep a gun underneath your pillow.

413
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,120
You always keep it there
even though it's illegal.

414
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,950
You can't sleep without it.

415
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,200
How do you know that?

416
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,950
I saw it.

417
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,080
Where did you see it?

418
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,080
That was the saddest scene.

419
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,620
The Han River Bridge.

420
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:39,200
I cried as well at the time.

421
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,290
I was afraid...

422
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,950
...Chul would really kill himself.

423
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,660
Die!

424
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,580
Die! Die!

425
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,000
Die!

426
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,750
You were supposed to guard the door.

427
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,950
-We were told to come downstairs.
-By who?

428
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,910
The message was from
Do-yoon's phone,

429
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,620
but he said he didn't send it.

430
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,200
I will...

431
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,250
...find you soon.

432
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,200
Just wait.

433
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,460
Where am I?

434
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,790
Is this Chul's room?

435
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,870
It is! This is his bed and that is...
Oh my gosh.

436
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,250
Did I get dragged in here again?
Why?

437
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,870
Why? How?

438
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,790
You're awake.

439
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,790
-Yes.
-How are you feeling?

440
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,290
I'm okay.

441
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,370
A nurse checked on you.
She said you're fine.

442
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,710
-You'll be just fine.
-Why did she say I fainted?

443
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,870
-She said it's from overwork.
-Overwork?

444
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,040
Severe exhaustion puts
a lot of strain on your body.

445
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,410
Severe exhaustion?

446
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,540
You were in bed for two days.

447
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,290
Maybe you overstrained yourself.

448
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,910
What?

449
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,660
Right, I guess maybe I did.

450
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,120
Why don't you have lunch with
President Kang? He'll be back soon.

451
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,620
-Will he come back here?
-Yes.

452
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,660
I prepared some clothes.
You can change in the bathroom.

453
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,410
-I see.
-Excuse me.

454
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,870
What should I do?

455
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,660
What am I supposed to do now?
My goodness.

456
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,500
It's huge.

457
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,000
It's see-through.

458
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,000
Gosh.

459
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,790
Isn't that the biggest problem?

460
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,120
How do you know what would happen
if you get involved with Chul?

461
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,460
What if you're suddenly dragged
into the webtoon?

462
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,580
Wait a minute.

463
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,750
I found it.

464
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,620
-Did you say she's alone?
-She's in the shower.

465
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,200
I told you not to leave her alone
when she wakes up.

466
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,910
-I can't go in there with her.
-My gosh.

467
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,910
What should I do?

468
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,660
Which one should I pick?

469
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,370
She can't run away from here.
This is the 33rd floor.

470
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,120
I heard she's awake.

471
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,660
-Yes, you can see her later.
-Why? What is she doing now?

472
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,370
She's having an honest talk with Chul.

473
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,750
In the bathroom?

474
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,540
Here you go again, Yeon-joo.

475
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,790
What is this now?

476
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,290
It's 11 AM and you just woke up.
What are you trying to do here?

477
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,040
It's nothing.

478
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,830
-Excuse me?
-It's nothing.

479
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,950
You always do things
and say it's nothing.

480
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,910
Don't come near me.

481
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,250
Stop or I'll shoot you.

482
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:47,460
Gosh, you're such an unpredictable woman.

483
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,200
You suddenly showed up,

484
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:52,250
slapped me in the face, kissed me,

485
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,620
disappeared and showed up again.

486
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,500
Now, you suddenly took your clothes off
and point a gun at me.

487
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,500
I know you don't understand me.
I'd do the same if I were you.

488
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,950
But there's a reason why I'm doing this.

489
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,330
-What reason?
-Don't move.

490
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,200
I'm really going to shoot you.
I'm not kidding.

491
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,000
-Go ahead, then.
-I'm serious.

492
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,370
It's dangerous!

493
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,290
Why worry when you're going to kill me?

494
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,750
I said I will shoot you!

495
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,080
You have to have bullets.
Don't you know that?

496
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,790
I wanted to see

497
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,830
what you'd do when you know
that I keep a gun under my pillow.

498
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,710
Why are you doing this?

499
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:57,200
I don't like doing this,
so let's compromise by talking.

500
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,660
I have about 100 questions,

501
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,370
but I'll let you live
if you answer the first question.

502
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,250
How did you disappear that day?

503
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I'll have to report you to the police
if you don't answer.

504
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,460
How cruel!

505
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,200
You said I saved your life.

506
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,370
You certainly did.
That's why I let you go before.

507
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,710
Aren't you the one who broke the promise?

508
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,500
You disappeared without
answering any of my questions.

509
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,580
You must keep the promise now.

510
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:32,290
I waited two months for you
like a gentleman.

511
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,750
Do you agree?

512
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,040
How did you disappear?

513
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,790
There must have been a way.

514
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,540
I'll report you to the police
if you don't answer.

515
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,830
If you can't answer it,
here's my next question.

516
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,160
Why did you kiss me
after hitting me that day?

517
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,830
I'll wait
since we still have a lot of time.

518
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,870
I did it so I could disappear.

519
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,160
What did you say?

520
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,750
I did it so I could disappear.

521
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,000
Do what?

522
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,250
Kiss you.

523
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,080
The kiss?

524
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,080
Yes.

525
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,040
You kissed me so you could disappear?

526
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,500
Yes.

527
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,040
I didn't imagine such an answer.

528
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,750
So you disappeared that day
because you kissed me?

529
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,330
Is that the way?

530
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,160
It's true,

531
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:51,620
so please stop this and let me go.

532
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,500
-Is that so?
-Yes.

533
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,950
Why are you still here?

534
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,830
You're still here.

535
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:32,500
Just kissing won't make me disappear.

536
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,790
There has to be a change in emotions.
I was talking about that kind of kiss.

537
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,200
Emotions?

538
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,080
I didn't like it very much then.

539
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,950
You may not have liked it,
but you were surprised.

540
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,870
-Yes, I was.
-That's what I mean.

541
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:49,540
There was some kind of change
in your emotions. That's the rule.

542
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:53,660
-You seem surprised. You're blushing.
-I'm talking about you.

543
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,790
-What do you mean?
-Your change of emotions counts.

544
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,370
What kind of rule is that?

545
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,660
-Why are my emotions important?
-Because you're the main character.

546
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,290
The main character?

547
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,460
For what?

548
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,710
What you just did can be
considered sexual assault.

549
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:16,160
I'm going to sue you.

550
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,370
You're the one who
committed sexual assault.

551
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,120
On top of that, you slapped me.

552
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,160
Besides, I was doing
a scientific experiment

553
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,660
to prove the logic of your statement.

554
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:28,040
What you're saying now...

555
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:33,000
...is that you can only disappear when
there's a change of emotions in me.

556
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,290
Is that correct?

557
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,500
-Yes.
-Is that why you slapped me?

558
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,160
Did you fire the gun
and took off that gown to surprise me?

559
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,580
That's right.

560
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,000
That's very peculiar.

561
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:50,080
I thought you'd say you teleported.

562
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,080
Still, it doesn't seem like a lie

563
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:55,870
since you're still here even when
you had a chance to disappear.

564
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,910
I'm not lying.

565
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,910
Just because it's not a lie
doesn't mean it's true.

566
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,410
You're only talking about what happened

567
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,950
without including the important context.

568
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:17,790
There must be something you're hiding.

569
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,000
There must be a context which explains
why you can disappear

570
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,500
only when there's been
a change of emotions in me.

571
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,250
You must tell me.

572
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,200
I don't know any more than that.

573
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,410
How could you not know?

574
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,120
Answer on the count of 10.

575
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:35,790
One.

576
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,580
-Two.
-I said I don't know.

577
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,870
Three.

578
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,200
-Four.
-Don't scare me.

579
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,290
You won't even fire.

580
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,460
Five.

581
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,040
What's going on?

582
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,080
Get out.

583
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,080
What are you doing?

584
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,460
I'm investigating instead of the police

585
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,950
since you talk too much.

586
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,750
However, Yeon-joo
keeps teasing me

587
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,460
instead of telling the truth.

588
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,580
Are you all right?

589
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,500
-Stop it.
-Get out.

590
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,950
-Stop it. She's still a patient.
-Get out!

591
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,160
That is how you fire a gun.

592
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,750
It's a very important skill
when my life's on the line.

593
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,830
It doesn't matter even though
you saved my life.

594
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,500
You were a saviour,
but you're also very dangerous.

595
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,790
That's why I'm going to shoot
if you don't answer.

596
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,460
I stopped at five, right?

597
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,540
Six.

598
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,790
Seven.

599
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:56,250
How important is the secret that
you can't tell even at gunpoint?

600
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,460
You won't shoot me.

601
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,620
Eight.

602
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,160
How can you be sure?

603
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,580
You...

604
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,710
...wouldn't do that.

605
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,540
Nine.

606
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,040
I thought you knew everything about me,

607
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,830
but you're wrong about certain things.

608
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,370
I can do it if I want to.

609
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,870
No way.

610
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,160
Will you not answer me?

611
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,540
Ten.

612
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:36,120
Were you surprised?

613
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,950
You didn't know the power you had.

614
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:49,950
What happened?

615
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,580
Did you shoot her?

616
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:53,580
Did you?

617
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,660
She passed out because of shock.
Move her to a room.

618
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,580
Have you lost your mind?
What were you thinking?

619
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,790
I was only trying to scare her.

620
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,160
You've completely lost your mind.

621
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,200
Please come now.

622
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:43,410
The patient became unconscious again.

623
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,120
Something...

624
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,710
...shocking happened.

625
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,660
Yes, please come now.

626
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,120
-Could you bring us some water?
-Okay.

627
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:01,540
Did he lose his mind after being
in the hospital for too long?

628
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,460
He's odd, but she's very odd as well.

629
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,540
They're both odd.

630
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,080
Did you call the nurse?

631
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,160
I said to hand her over to the police.

632
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:19,290
Did you bring her to act like a thug?
Are you in a gang?

633
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,000
Why would you threaten
a sick woman with a gun?

634
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,160
Isn't an investigation for truth
what you wanted?

635
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,290
-Report her to the police now.
-Not the police.

636
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,410
I can't bear to watch this.

637
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,410
Report her to the police first.
If they can't solve it,

638
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,540
we can investigate then.
That's the order of things.

639
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:39,040
Why make things complicated?

640
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,500
You don't know
what you're getting yourself into.

641
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,710
I said no police.

642
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,370
It will never be solved
once the police are involved.

643
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,710
I told you.
Yeon-joo is the key to my life.

644
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,040
Please change my flight to night time.
I'm dropping by Busan.

645
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,290
Is she awake?

646
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,370
How is she?

647
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,370
I gave her tranquilliser
and her blood pressure is normal.

648
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,580
-Please give us a minute.
-Sure.

649
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,710
Are you upset?

650
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,710
Did you just ask if I'm upset?

651
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,870
That is a major understatement.
You shot me with a gun!

652
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,750
I'm sorry for surprising you.

653
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:58,410
Actually, I knew that
a gunshot wouldn't kill you.

654
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,620
Why don't you know that?

655
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,040
You're invincible, Yeon-joo.

656
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:06,370
You can never die.

657
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:10,710
You really didn't know that?

658
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,660
How do you know that?

659
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,750
If you answer my question, I'll tell you.

660
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:21,790
Since we both witnessed what happened,

661
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,870
let's admit that you are
not an ordinary person.

662
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,710
You're perhaps from another world.

663
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,370
Another world that I don't know about.

664
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,660
And you work as a cardiothoracic
surgery resident there.

665
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,000
Right?

666
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,620
Cardiothoracic surgery resident,
Oh Yeon-joo

667
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,950
Where is that?

668
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,290
Anyway, I'm relieved.

669
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,620
I checked with my eyes that
you can't disappear like last time.

670
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,330
If everything is up to me,

671
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,910
that means there is no way
you can escape.

672
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,500
You know me well, don't you?

673
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,290
Once I make up my mind,
I never get swayed.

674
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,460
That's my talent.

675
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,950
I even won a gold medal with that.

676
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,580
So now, you can't go back

677
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,460
until you've answered all my questions.

678
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,250
Stay here with me.

679
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,410
Since you saved my life,

680
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,750
I will protect you from
the police and the media.

681
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,710
Stay as long as you like.

682
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,370
And if you want to go back,
just answer my questions.

683
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,950
It seems like you have a lot of
surprising things to tell me.

684
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,500
If you say the truth and
surprise me, you get to go back.

685
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,080
I'll find the answers I want then.

686
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,040
What do you think?
It's a fair deal, isn't it?

687
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:53,040
Surprise me if you want to go back.

688
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:56,620
What kind of world is
the world you live in?

689
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,120
You said you know and
saw everything about me.

690
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,950
Where did you see me?

691
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,080
Is it hard to answer?

692
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,200
It is hard.

693
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,200
Then let's stay here together.
I don't mind.

694
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:19,710
We have plenty of time.

695
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:21,620
You want me...

696
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,800
...to live here?

697
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,710
If not here, where would you go?

698
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:31,040
I don't think you have anywhere to go.

699
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,000
We're ready.

700
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,410
I planned to have lunch together
before going on a business trip.

701
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,910
But something came up in Busan.
Let's eat when I'm back.

702
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,330
I'll be back on Friday. My secretary
will assist you in the meantime.

703
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,750
Right.

704
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,200
Here's the mobile phone
you threw last time.

705
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,120
Call me if anything happens.

706
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:16,540
Let us reconcile.
Sorry for what I did a while ago.

707
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,950
I sincerely apologise.

708
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,250
Rest well.

709
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,330
I love you.

710
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,330
Never mind.

711
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,620
Right.

712
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:01,080
You must've thought I'd be really
surprised to see you in the nude.

713
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:04,370
Did you think my heart would pound
and my eyes would go blind?

714
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,710
No, I just took a chance.

715
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,660
-Do you know you're unbelievable?
-I know that.

716
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:15,040
Take care.

717
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,120
Let's go.

718
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:32,290
-What was that, really?
-What?

719
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,660
You said she's not beautiful at all,

720
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:36,910
but you act like you're in love.

721
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,950
You've seen her naked,

722
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,830
she kissed you and confessed her love.
She even slapped you.

723
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:43,500
All that looks like a love fight.

724
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,200
And what was that?
You're going to stay here together?

725
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,830
That's like a couple moving in together.

726
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,370
-You're right.
-Anyone would think that.

727
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:55,410
-Right.
-You're so cool about it.

728
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,460
It's complicated.
Think however you want.

729
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,160
Wait.

730
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:07,460
What is it?

731
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:09,710
You said you're going somewhere.

732
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,330
I'm stopping by Busan
and going straight to New York. Why?

733
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,910
Be careful.

734
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:21,620
Am I going to die on the way?

735
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:24,200
Will the train derail?
Or will the aeroplane get hijacked?

736
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,950
I don't know. I'm just worried.

737
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:31,750
So you're not sure
how I'm going to die this time.

738
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,080
When I'm here,
I don't know things either.

739
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,120
So I can't help you.

740
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:40,000
You can know from there, then?

741
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,620
Yes.

742
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,750
I'm even more curious about you now.

743
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:56,200
You never answer my questions.
Why are you worried that I might die?

744
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,540
I am one of those people

745
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,290
who want your life to be a happy ending.

746
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,290
I'm your fan. I swear.

747
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:20,250
Are you saying I'm going to
be unfortunate if I hear the answer?

748
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,370
Perhaps.

749
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,790
That's why I can't answer.

750
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:40,950
Besides, you are my first patient
whom I saved on my own.

751
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,790
Is that right? I'm honoured.

752
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:47,830
-You are my second patient, too.
-I'm even more honoured.

753
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,000
So...

754
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:53,250
...always be careful.

755
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,950
I will.

756
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,120
I guess you can answer this question.

757
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,830
How old are you?

758
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,250
I'm 30.

759
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,410
We're the same age.
Are you married?

760
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:23,410
No.

761
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,830
That's good.

762
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,120
I found out why
I keep getting dragged here

763
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,120
only after a while.

764
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,660
It was because this man...

765
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:51,330
...had said that
I was the key to his life.

766
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:55,790
In that moment,

767
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:59,500
the heroine of this webtoon changed.

768
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,160
From Yoon So-hee

769
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:04,160
to Oh Yeon-joo.

770
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:40,250
W – Two Worlds

771
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,460
I'm sure Yeon-joo is
the key to my life.

772
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:45,040
She's the only one who can
open the door to all the secrets.

773
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,410
Would you have a glass of wine with me?

774
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,580
Excuse me.

775
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,950
You're the doctor from the rooftop.

776
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,330
What do I do?
I can't get caught by the police.

777
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:53,460
Please reveal your identity.

778
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,370
Even if I want to,
I have no identity to reveal.

779
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,910
If she's an innocent citizen,
why can't she identify herself?

780
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,500
They're convinced that
you are the criminal.

781
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,200
You need to answer my question now.

782
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:04,000
-You're going to regret this.
-I won't.

783
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,660
What do you mean by the world I live in?

784
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,540
The world inside a webtoon.
