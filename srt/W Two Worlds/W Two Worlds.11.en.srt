1
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,130
W-Two Worlds

2
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,430
"W" is Korea's best webtoon series.

3
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,140
Its lead character, Kang Chul
finds out through Oh Yeon-joo...

4
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,930
that he is the lead character
of a cartoon.

5
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,560
In order to get rid of the killer,
you have to create the killer first.

6
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,310
So this is my face?

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,850
Chul joins force with Seong-moo
to protect his world and Yeon-joo.

8
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,600
You tried to kill me.
That's a betrayal.

9
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,350
Just before everything got settled...

10
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,510
Let's make some lines.
First, it's Chul's line.

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,140
Just leave me alone, Dad.

12
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,890
-You drank alcohol, didn't you?
-This is all fabricated...

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,560
Mr Son, who was like a father
to Kang Chul, is killed.

14
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,600
Hey! Stop!

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,430
-And Chul gets falsely accused.
-Are you hurt?

16
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,010
Episode 11

17
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,390
Where are we?

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,930
We're in a motel.

19
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,470
I tried to pick an inconspicuous one.

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,850
But I'm still worried.

21
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,430
You've been framed, right?

22
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,970
You've been framed with a crime
that you will never commit.

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,260
Isn't that why you ran away?

24
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,930
I'll try to find out what happened
and how you can solve it.

25
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,680
I think something serious has happened.

26
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,970
I just don't know what it is yet.

27
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,060
Staying here is dangerous.

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,930
You also need more medicine.

29
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,470
That's why I must get out of here.

30
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,760
Will you be okay alone?

31
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,470
Look, Ms Oh Yeon-joo.

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,310
Hold on for a bit longer and wait for me.

33
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,060
I don't understand
anything you just said.

34
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,060
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,220
How can you help me?

36
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,180
I'm one of those people...

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,060
who wish for your life
to have a happy ending.

38
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,430
Our parting should be worth something.

39
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,600
Ms Oh Yeon-joo.

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,890
Who...

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,970
...are you?

42
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,430
I have to get out of here.

43
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,640
So...

44
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,760
I really hope this would work again.

45
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,600
To be continued

46
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,430
To be continued

47
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,430
Soo-bong.

48
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,180
Soo-bong!

49
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,810
Dad?

50
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,140
Dad.

51
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,470
Why did you do that? You said
you'd end it with a happy ending.

52
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,430
Why did you kill everyone...

53
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,560
and framed it on Chul?

54
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,890
Can't you just let him be happy now?

55
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,560
Dad.

56
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,970
Dad?

57
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,140
I am sorry.

58
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,760
I am sorry.

59
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,970
Hello? Yeon-joo. Where are you?

60
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,850
I came to the hospital.
Why are you not here?

61
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,060
I came to the studio and Dad...
What happened to him?

62
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,010
You saw him? His...

63
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,640
His face disappeared.

64
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,680
Of course I did! What happened?

65
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,470
His eyes, nose and lips disappeared.

66
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,680
Shoot Mr Son in the heart.

67
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,600
Draw a handgun in Chul's hand.

68
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,430
He was drawing like crazy.

69
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,600
So, Dad was drawing according
to the killer's orders?

70
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,100
I don't know. I don't know.

71
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,140
I just...
I am just...

72
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,060
too terrified.

73
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,600
What will happen to Dad now?

74
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,600
Is Dad the killer?
Then how about that...

75
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,930
I just don't know.

76
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,350
It's dangerous there,
so hurry up and get out.

77
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,560
Chul was shot.
He might die if I leave him alone.

78
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,810
But you might die first!
Mr Oh is not himself!

79
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,100
That's not him over there!

80
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,260
Just lock the door and get out of there.

81
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,350
Excuse me?

82
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,600
-Doctor.
-Yes.

83
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,060
Doctor, I am terrified.

84
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,430
Someone might come, Doctor.
Let's go inside.

85
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,260
-Okay. Let's go in.
-Let's hurry inside!

86
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Open it.

87
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,100
The door is open.

88
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,430
Mr Seo, you need to come with us.

89
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,970
There will be a very long investigation.

90
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,760
I can't believe I was fooled
into cooperating with you.

91
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,140
I could just...

92
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,260
Then again, I guess
you couldn't have known.

93
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,470
Mr Son knew Chul for over 30 years,

94
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,350
but he was killed by Chul anyway.

95
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,560
Sir.

96
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,850
-We found out where Chul fled to.
-Where is it?

97
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,560
His car was caught on camera at an
intersection in Yongin an hour ago,

98
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,850
but it disappeared before reaching
Baekbong Intersection.

99
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,470
The stretch is only three kilometres.
We'll find him soon.

100
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
He was shot, so he couldn't
have gone far.

101
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,560
Cooperate for an inspection, please.

102
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,060
We're looking for a suspect on the run.

103
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,220
May I check your trunk?

104
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,930
What? Is Kang Chul here?

105
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,640
I'm not sure. My shift just started.

106
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,470
-Let me see your guest list.
-Sure.

107
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,600
-Which room is it?
-Room 209.

108
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,220
-Who is it?
-It's the police.

109
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,310
-What is it?
-We're looking for a suspect.

110
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,510
-Please cooperate with us.
-Sure.

111
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,970
-Who is it?
-It's the police.

112
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,560
Please cooperate for an inspection.

113
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,310
-What is it?
-Please excuse us.

114
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,970
Thank you for your cooperation.

115
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,890
Which room is next?

116
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,810
It's Room 213.

117
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,180
What is this? There is no Room 213.

118
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,430
Maybe there was a mistake.

119
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,140
Second floor is done.
We're going up to the third floor.

120
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,060
15-O-1596

121
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,010
15-O-1623

122
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,100
15-O-1623

123
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,510
Medical Supplies

124
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,430
Hang in there. Just hang on.

125
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,140
What if...

126
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,010
you can't remember
because you were drunk?

127
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,600
Are you...

128
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,180
...suspecting me?

129
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,930
I want to know the truth.

130
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,850
Sir.

131
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,060
It's not me.

132
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,220
It's not me, sir.

133
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,180
Ms Oh Yeon-joo.

134
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,260
Is that you?

135
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,810
Answer me.

136
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,970
Where are you?

137
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,600
Come to your senses...

138
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,220
Come to your senses and wake up.

139
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,140
I can't be there right now.

140
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,430
So you need to...

141
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,100
treat yourself. Please wake up.

142
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,890
Who are you?

143
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,310
Are you Oh Yeon-joo?

144
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,680
When did you get out?

145
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,720
Dad?

146
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,100
Dad.

147
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,760
So this is where you work?

148
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,680
Let's go in.

149
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,140
Wait, wait.

150
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,600
Yeon-joo?

151
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,350
-Excuse me?
-Yes?

152
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,310
It's our first time meeting.

153
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,930
Isn't it too much
to hold hands like this?

154
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:16,600
-I...
-Let's take it slow.

155
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,600
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

156
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,810
I'm sorry.

157
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,220
Yeon-joo?

158
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,060
Yeon-joo...

159
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,760
Gosh.

160
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,060
I thought something bad
had happened to you.

161
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,680
Are you okay? Is your lip okay?

162
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,060
How is Mr Oh?

163
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,510
I put him to bed and locked the door.
I had no choice.

164
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,810
This is a great office.

165
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,180
It's Kang Chul.

166
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,760
Is this the bathroom?

167
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,390
He became quiet when
I turned off the power.

168
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Why?

169
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:48,760
Maybe he loses contact with
the killer when you turn it off.

170
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,140
I think so.

171
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,430
I'm not sure, though.

172
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,060
What do we do with Mr Oh?

173
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,060
I'm trying to make it a dream again
like last time.

174
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,310
Dream? A dream?

175
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,060
That's right. We should
make everything a dream.

176
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,760
How about going further back?

177
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,350
Something like 10 years ago
before Chul's family died.

178
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,180
Let's make it a dream he had
before the killer had appeared.

179
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,260
Then we'd be rid of him
from the start, wouldn't we?

180
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,430
But...

181
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,890
I can't turn this on.

182
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,310
What if the killer is just waiting
for me to turn this on?

183
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,060
We can't draw anything with it right now.

184
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,010
What else can we do, then?

185
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,350
Hello?

186
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,510
Wow, so this is her father's office.

187
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,060
Where's Yeon-joo?

188
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,640
She's right here.

189
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,430
Where?

190
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,760
What?

191
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,890
What is this?

192
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,390
What?

193
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,600
Wait, Seok-beom.

194
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,140
That's not what I meant.
Wait, Seok-beom.

195
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,180
Changmin Party

196
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,010
Oh Yeon-joo?

197
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,060
Is Yeon-joo her real name?

198
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,140
Who is this Yeon-joo?

199
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,510
Why did he run away with her?

200
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,890
Han Cheol-ho

201
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,180
Really?
Then we should look for her first...

202
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,760
to catch that brat.

203
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,060
What goes around comes around.

204
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,970
It means that the fate is on our side.

205
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,930
It also means that the world is still
going the way it should be going.

206
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,930
I told you that
Kang Chul is a psychopath.

207
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,760
That's right.

208
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,810
If Chul gets arrested,
the process will take too long.

209
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,180
He is better off being shot dead.

210
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,220
It will be even better if
he leaves a repenting will.

211
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,430
Who are you?

212
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,010
Why are you here?

213
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:09,930
I'm sorry.

214
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,310
Hey!

215
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,390
-Who is that woman?
-Pardon?

216
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,260
Have you all lost your mind?

217
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,310
Why did you let her in?

218
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,560
What are you waiting for?
Go get her!

219
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,640
Yes, sir.

220
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,930
What's going on? Why was I
in Han Cheol-ho's office?

221
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,260
Why Han Cheol-ho?

222
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,180
Is it because he's looking for me?

223
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,560
Did he pull me into this world?

224
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,680
Are you Oh Yeon-joo?

225
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,600
When did you get out?

226
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,180
Then last time,

227
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,810
it wasn't Chul who took me in,

228
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,810
but it was the killer?

229
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,060
The main character isn't
the only one who can pull me in.

230
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,470
Why is it like this all of a sudden?

231
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,220
-Did you catch her?
-We lost her.

232
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,560
How could no one notice
someone coming into my office?

233
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,930
I'm sorry, sir.

234
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,180
Who is she?

235
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,140
What's this?

236
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,010
Oh Yeon-joo?

237
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,010
What's the date today?

238
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,560
It's the 22nd.

239
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,760
What time is it?

240
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,760
It's 11 PM.

241
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,390
Do you know what happened to Kang Chul?

242
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,760
Kang Chul?

243
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,430
Yes, I haven't seen the news.

244
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,010
He fled after killing someone.

245
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,060
He hasn't been caught yet.

246
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,430
Thank you.

247
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,810
If it's 11 PM,

248
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,310
only two hours have passed.

249
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,600
Welcome.

250
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,390
Pardon me, but what's today's date?

251
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,930
Today? It's the 22nd.

252
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,720
It's the 22nd?

253
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,220
It was the 22nd before, too.

254
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
Pardon?

255
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,970
Is it September 22nd?

256
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,760
Yes.

257
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,350
A month passed already.

258
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,930
Do you know what happened to Kang Chul?

259
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,180
Kang Chul?

260
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,720
Yes. I haven't seen the news
because I was abroad.

261
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,930
They're still searching for him.

262
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,970
It's been a month, but they haven't
caught him yet. What a rascal.

263
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,850
I heard a rumour that he died somewhere.

264
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,600
Some said he got shot
when he was running away.

265
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,140
He can't die that easily.

266
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,100
Someone like him should
be taken to trial...

267
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,930
so he can rot in prison forever.

268
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,890
-I'd like to pay.
-Okay, sir.

269
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,220
About 300 members of
Citizens' Coalition for Justice...

270
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,810
gathered in front of the
WBN Office requesting...

271
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,640
for the broadcasting station
to close down.

272
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,350
-Under Kang Chul's management, WBN...
-Geez.

273
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,930
I'm sick of the news.
It's always about Kang Chul.

274
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,430
I hope they'll stop talking about it.

275
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,640
It's not even good news.

276
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,310
How could a person do such a thing?

277
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,350
He shot his father.

278
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,060
He shot his teacher.

279
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,760
He's thick-skinned enough to pretend
to be a protector of justice.

280
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,140
He pretended to be a hero.

281
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,100
Are you there?

282
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,470
Answer me. Are you there?

283
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,970
I heard a rumour that he died somewhere.

284
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,810
Some said he got shot
when he was running away.

285
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,350
Aren't you going down?

286
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,470
Join me. Have some drinks.

287
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,560
This is the last day.

288
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,060
So let's celebrate it.

289
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,600
He must've died.

290
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,350
He has to. Otherwise,

291
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,310
he wouldn't be able to
endure it this long.

292
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,010
What is he planning to do anyway?

293
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,430
He must've died from a gunshot...

294
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,260
or jumped into a reservoir somewhere...

295
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,640
because he had no courage to face it.

296
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,930
It has to be one of the two reasons.

297
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,930
Right?

298
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,260
If he is really dead...

299
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,970
then he is just cruel.

300
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
How can he not leave any words for me?

301
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,310
Mr Seo.

302
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,470
-Someone is here.
-Who?

303
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,140
Ms Oh Yeon-joo.

304
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,970
I saw her that time.
It is her.

305
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,140
She wants to meet you.

306
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,060
Where is she?

307
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,810
Ms Oh?

308
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,640
-Yes.
-Are you Ms Yeon-joo?

309
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,180
You were in the car with Mr Kang.

310
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,890
Right.

311
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:57,010
The police were looking for you.
Why appear just now?

312
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,680
-There was a reason.
-Why did you come to me?

313
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,680
I was wondering...

314
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,390
if you know what happened to Kang Chul.

315
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,760
I haven't seen him since that day.

316
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,760
I was wondering if you
have any news about him.

317
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,970
How would I know where he is?
Even the police can't find him.

318
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,260
What's your relationship to Mr Kang?

319
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,430
We are...

320
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,260
nothing.

321
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,560
I'm just curious...

322
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,060
whether he's alive or not.

323
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,180
Is he still alive?

324
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,850
I'm worried that he's dead.

325
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,060
He was badly hurt when I last saw him.

326
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,970
I shouldn't have left him like that.

327
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,510
We ran out of medicine, so...

328
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,640
Sinori Village Hall

329
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,470
Go there.

330
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,140
I'll make a call.

331
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,680
Mr Kang has been looking for you.

332
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,720
He is...

333
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,680
alive?

334
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,510
Also, I have a favour to ask.

335
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,810
I don't know what
your relationship with Mr Kang is,

336
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,260
but please persuade him
to turn himself in.

337
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,970
There is no other option.

338
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:57,140
To reduce his sentence,
he has to turn himself in soon.

339
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,310
I can't help him any longer.

340
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,510
Please persuade him.

341
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,560
Who is she?

342
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,760
A hotel staff.

343
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,430
Sinori Village Hall

344
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,930
Sinori Village Hall

345
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,850
Ma'am, is this Sinori Village Hall?

346
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
It is.

347
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,060
Ms Oh Yeon-joo.

348
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,430
Long time no see.

349
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,930
Get in.

350
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,180
How have you been?

351
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,350
I'm glad to see a familiar face.

352
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,680
Say something, won't you?

353
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,180
I was so excited to have
a sound conversation.

354
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:21,930
I thought...

355
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,180
you were dead.

356
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,180
No way.

357
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,220
You explained how
to treat myself so clearly.

358
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,970
Come to your senses and wake up.

359
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,930
I can't be there right now.

360
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,060
So you need to treat yourself.

361
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,930
Please wake up.

362
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,350
Come to your senses and get moving.

363
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,310
There were no antibiotics,
so I couldn't give you a shot before.

364
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,680
Get the antibiotics first.

365
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,890
You have to inject that into your vein.

366
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,430
Do as I say.

367
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,220
When I examined you earlier,
the bullet was lodged deep inside you.

368
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,510
Even if it hurts,
you have to take it out yourself.

369
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,060
Close your wound...

370
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,930
and you're done.

371
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,760
You did great.

372
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,430
You drank alcohol, didn't you?
You little brat!

373
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,560
Why did you hit me? I said I won't
stand it if you hit me again.

374
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,350
Honey, please stop!

375
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,810
Chul, stop it.

376
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,510
You punk. Get out.

377
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,850
Never come back.

378
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,930
I don't need a son like you.

379
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,140
I can't believe I've raised him...

380
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,180
Honey!

381
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,350
I said I won't stand it
if you hit me again.

382
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,140
Honey, please stop!

383
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,180
-Chul, stop it.
-You punk. Get out.

384
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,720
Never come back.

385
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,600
I don't need a son like you.

386
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,760
I can't believe I've raised him...

387
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:12,970
Honey!

388
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,640
15-O-1623

389
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,310
The whereabouts of President Kang Chul
who shot Mr Son Hyeon-seok,

390
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:06,890
the former director of Channel W,
is still unknown.

391
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,470
Everything he has done
to uphold justice...

392
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,140
turned out to a charade
to hide his crime.

393
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,970
The public is enraged.

394
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:19,470
Meanwhile...

395
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,430
I'm losing my mind.

396
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,260
After you left,
I moved from place to place.

397
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,100
This is the fifth place.

398
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,180
What took you so long?

399
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,470
You acted like you'd be back soon.

400
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,890
You told me you'd figure out a way.

401
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,390
That's why I thought you'd be back soon.

402
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,430
There was a reason why I couldn't.

403
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,260
What's the reason?

404
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,510
It looks like you couldn't
figure out a solution.

405
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,760
You only said it to console me.

406
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:55,850
I got my hopes up.

407
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,810
I thought you knew something.

408
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,890
I wondered why you were
so sure I was innocent.

409
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,680
I thought, "Is she a secret agent?"

410
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,810
"Does she know the killer?"

411
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,350
"Is she the killer's friend?"

412
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,970
"Is she the killer's daughter?"

413
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,680
Why did you look for me
without a solution?

414
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:25,220
I was worried.

415
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:31,180
I felt bad to leave you
there alone that night.

416
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,310
Has your husband returned yet?

417
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:42,220
Do you miss a man's touch? Is that why
you disappeared after kissing me?

418
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,510
Because I look like your husband?

419
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,390
"Do you miss a man's touch"?
How can you say that?

420
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,430
You haven't eaten dinner, right?
Let's buy something to eat first.

421
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,930
I don't have food in my place.

422
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,560
You have nowhere else to go.

423
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,140
You have no money or a place to go.
You don't know anyone.

424
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,260
You have no choice but to ask for
a help from a fugitive.

425
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:09,810
Am I wrong?

426
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,760
You're right.

427
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,600
I don't have money, but I'll take you in.

428
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,930
I owe you my life.

429
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,140
You don't have spare clothes, right?
I'll buy you some.

430
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,600
I'm fine.

431
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,600
I have to buy you clothes.
I want to.

432
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,310
Don't these look comfortable?

433
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,430
It's old-fashioned. I like it.

434
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,060
Pick something you like.

435
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,930
It's embarrassing, but I can't
buy you expensive clothes.

436
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,390
I do have a lot of money,

437
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:06,970
but I don't have access to it now.

438
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,890
How is this?

439
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:15,310
Well...

440
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,720
It's five dollars. It's cheap.

441
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,010
We both have no money,
so let's cut down expenses.

442
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:26,220
If I could, I would buy you
a dress worth 3,000 dollars.

443
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,760
I hope you know that.

444
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,180
I can't show people my face.
Go in and pay for it.

445
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,260
-How much is this?
-It's five dollars.

446
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:47,970
You picked a nice one.

447
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,810
It's too hot. Let's cool off.

448
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,810
Where's my change?

449
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,510
I shouldn't waste any money.

450
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,680
Let's go.

451
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:27,930
It's good.

452
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,810
How is yours?

453
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,930
It's vanilla-flavoured.

454
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:36,600
Give me a bite.

455
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,470
I don't like it. Mine tastes better.

456
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,680
Try it.

457
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,180
Isn't mine better?

458
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:56,260
What's wrong with you?

459
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:59,560
-What do you mean?
-You're a fugitive from law.

460
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,430
You've been on the run for a month.

461
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,680
Besides, do you even know who I am?

462
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,680
You don't know me, but you let me
stay with you and bought me clothes.

463
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,140
You're having ice cream when you should
be figuring out how to clear your name.

464
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:13,810
What are you thinking?

465
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,310
Are you going to
just idle your time away?

466
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,970
You'd go crazy if unreasonable things
keep happening to you.

467
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:26,430
Consider me crazy.
I can't think about anything.

468
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:32,310
I did everything I can for a month.
I couldn't come up with a solution.

469
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,810
Now I have two choices.

470
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,680
Keep running until I get caught
or turn myself in.

471
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,760
After that, it will be a fight in court.

472
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:42,680
I'll be stuck in prison forever
either way.

473
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,970
I think this is my fate.

474
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,760
No matter how hard I try,
I reach the same conclusion.

475
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,810
Maybe I'm destined
to have an unhappy ending.

476
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,310
We've shopped and eaten ice cream.
That's two things, right?

477
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,890
Let's get groceries now.

478
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:19,680
Shall we get some snacks?

479
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,640
Have you tried this? Let's get it.

480
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:38,640
Strangely, I have a huge appetite
now that I have someone to eat with.

481
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,470
Shall we buy some watermelon, too?

482
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,890
I'll make you spaghetti.
Do you like cream spaghetti?

483
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,680
You can't cook.

484
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,060
Who says I can't cook?

485
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,600
You're right, I can't,
but I studied online.

486
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,180
I didn't have much to do
and I wanted to cook for you.

487
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:18,970
What?

488
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,470
Go wash.

489
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:26,510
The bathroom is that way.

490
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:36,930
Did we do four things now?

491
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,720
Two more and today's task is done.

492
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,930
"Go grocery shopping".

493
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,010
"Eat some cake".

494
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,140
"Go shopping".

495
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:12,180
Do you like it with a lot of bacon?

496
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,060
-What did you just say?
-What?

497
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:19,560
You said something about task.

498
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,390
-Oh, that.
-What do you mean by that?

499
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,560
The task to do 10 sweet things a day.

500
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:30,310
You said your husband disappeared
after doing only four of them.

501
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,760
I wanted to do them
on behalf of your husband...

502
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,010
since you saved my life.

503
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,510
You said your husband looked like me.

504
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:45,640
Isn't that why you're following me?

505
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:51,260
How did you know?

506
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:55,180
I never mentioned
anything about the task.

507
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,060
I read it.

508
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,260
From where?

509
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,470
From where did you read it?

510
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,640
Here.

511
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:24,560
Do you know this webtoon?

512
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,260
Well, I guess you don't have to
tell me that you know it well.

513
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:31,140
I read it in here.

514
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:34,760
Your husband disappeared
after doing four sweet things.

515
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,930
I think he is being cheap.

516
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:42,180
How could he do that to his wife?

517
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:58,010
There's no way out.

518
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,470
I looked at everything, but there's
no proof that it was fabricated.

519
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:05,060
Chul.

520
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,060
Turn yourself in.
There's no other way.

521
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,640
Have you looked into Dr Oh Yeon-joo?

522
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,180
She did hang around the Department
of Cardiothoracic Surgery for a week,

523
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,260
but no one knows who she is.

524
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:20,640
Also,

525
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:23,180
Han Cheol-ho is
also looking for her.

526
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,060
-Why?
-He wants to take his chance.

527
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,310
He rummaged through everything.

528
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,890
There was nothing left for me to find...

529
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,970
except for one thing.

530
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:46,970
It's a comic book which mentions
Oh Yeon-joo, so I brought it.

531
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,060
I haven't read it closely yet.

532
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:58,640
I thought I should give it
to Kang Chul when I see him,

533
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:00,560
but then, that happened.

534
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:04,310
-It's a comic book.
-Kang Chul is the main character.

535
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,560
There's also a character
named Oh Yeon-joo.

536
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,560
I'm so sleepy.

537
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,850
What's this?

538
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,430
President Kang.

539
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,470
Are you well?

540
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,680
Yeon-joo.

541
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,600
-Are you going to sleep?
-Just for 10 minutes.

542
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,350
Code Black, code Black.
Emergency room.

543
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:52,060
Victims of a shooting will arrive soon.

544
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,390
We need more staff
as there are too many injured.

545
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:57,930
Except for the required staff,
all the other doctors must...

546
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:00,470
I thought this comic book would be yours.

547
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,350
Am I wrong?

548
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,600
You never appeared afterwards,
and I couldn't do anything here,

549
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,510
so I read this over and over.

550
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:12,760
I even memorised the lines.

551
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:19,310
I wasn't interested in it at first.

552
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:22,930
Do you hear me?

553
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,760
Please call for an ambulance.

554
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:31,560
Where are you, Yeon-joo?

555
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:37,470
Yeon-joo?

556
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,140
What kind of context is this?

557
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:43,720
Answer me. You'll regret it.

558
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:12,810
It's not that I'm lucky. I set it up
so that you can't shoot me.

559
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,310
The story was fun and interesting.

560
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:38,260
I felt bad for Kang Chul,
but he also seemed foolish...

561
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:39,970
just like me.

562
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,510
That's why I didn't turn myself in yet.

563
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,430
It's so that I could meet you.

564
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,970
I was going to ask you what happens next.

565
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,890
I couldn't go to prison
without finding that out.

566
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,430
Have you read the book after this one?

567
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,220
After this one,

568
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:05,930
what happens to Chul and Yeon-joo?

569
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:11,180
Does Chul...

570
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,640
forget Yeon-joo for good?

571
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,350
Answer me.

572
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,350
Is your husband
who suddenly disappeared...

573
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:28,430
me?

574
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:02,600
W-Two Worlds

575
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,810
Do you remember me?

576
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:08,560
Let's go on a date like other couples.

577
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,510
Give me a chance to catch up.

578
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,510
You can't be the main anymore.
You're just a murderer on the run.

579
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,930
You'll disappear soon.

580
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,930
There's only one way.

581
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,680
It's what your father and
I have planned from the start.

582
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,180
Promise me one thing.
Draw me something.

583
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,470
Do you want me to make it a dream again?

584
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,640
All I have to do is
wait for you to disappear.

585
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,260
Now, we need to use the
variables to our advantage.

586
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,850
I'll summon myself from now on.
