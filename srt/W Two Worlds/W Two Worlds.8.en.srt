1
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,390
W-Two Worlds

2
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,630
Chul is a multimillionaire
with assets worth 800 million dollars.

3
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,540
We will find the killer through
the crime investigation programme.

4
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,030
He founds broadcasting channel "W"

5
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,780
to look for the criminal
who murdered his family 10 years ago.

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,740
But he gets attacked

7
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,570
-and becomes seriously injured.
-The police spotted Kang Chul...

8
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,200
Then Chul meets webtoon artist,
Oh Seong-moo,

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,450
who created and destroyed his life.

10
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,740
-Draw the killer's face.
-There is no killer.

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,700
There he finds out that his life...

12
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,910
...is just a fake reality
fabricated by the artist.

13
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,700
He tries to end his own life.

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,820
You tried to kill me when
I desperately wanted to live.

15
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,240
Why did you save me when I chose to die?

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,860
Who would want to live this life again?

17
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,570
It's because I love you!

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
He is saved once again by Yeon-joo,

19
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,910
and he realises
his true feelings for her.

20
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,570
Just remain as my friend.

21
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,660
You are fired.

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,990
Thank you for everything.

23
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,780
-Her hand disappeared?
-It's ridiculous, but it happened.

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,490
Is that a wedding ring?

25
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,030
Oh, gosh!

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,360
Oh, dear!

27
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,410
Chul is about to live
a happy second life with Yeon-joo.

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,410
I'll put a bullet in her head.

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,030
It's her turn now.

30
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,240
The killer appears.

31
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,700

32

Episode 8

33
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,450
Hello?

34
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,740
Where are you?

35
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,360
How did you go back?

36
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,200
How did you go back?

37
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,660
Who gave you the permission to die?

38
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,910
I've waited so long for you.

39
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,360
-Who are you?
-Who am I?

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,990
Don't you know me?

41
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,490
I killed your family.

42
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,860
I killed your family.

43
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,410
It was 10 years ago at your house.

44
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,410
There is no such person.
There is no killer.

45
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,610
That was just a set-up.

46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,110
It was a set-up to make
the protagonist strong.

47
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,990
Who...

48
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,740
Who are you?

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,860
I killed your parents and your siblings.

50
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,070
I took them down with just four bullets.

51
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,410
I am a marksman

52
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,990
just like you.

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,280
So you should find me.

54
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,070
Why would you die without finding me?
You can't die now.

55
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,910
This won't until until you and I
finish our business.

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,910
I see you have a new family now.

57
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,990
It's her turn now.

58
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,910
I'll put a bullet in her head.

59
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,240
Wait for it.

60
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,990
Hello?

61
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,700
When did you get here?

62
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,780
What's wrong?

63
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,860
Why did...

64
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,610
"The End" change "To be Contiued"?

65
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,660
-What?
-You said it suddenly changed.

66
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,110
The end

67
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,410
To be continued

68
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,740
You said you could save me

69
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,070
because the letters changed.

70
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,280
I don't know. It just changed.

71
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,030
It just changed?

72
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,660
I thought there must be a reason
why it can't end yet.

73
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,360
I don't know what, though.

74
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,740
What is it?
Why are you asking me that?

75
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,660
-Mr Kang.
-Yes?

76
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,280
I brought Mrs Kang's dress.

77
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,570
Okay.

78
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,410
Did she say dress?

79

Caller ID Restricted

80
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,660
This way, please.

81
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,610
-Hello, Mrs Kang.
-Hello, Mrs Kang.

82
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,780
Hello.

83
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,240
It's a pleasure to meet you.

84
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,700
Since we don't know
your personal style yet,

85
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,910
we prepared dresses of
different styles for your choosing.

86
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,990
I see.

87
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,660
Over here, we have a fancy pink dress.

88
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,990
If you prefer something simpler,
there's this striped dress.

89
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,990
Okay.

90
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
What is this?

91
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,410
You said you want to experience parties.

92
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,990
Number one, a Cinderella story
with glamorous parties.

93
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,410
I heard you also wanted that.

94
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,910
I looked for a party you can attend
wearing a dress.

95
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,990
Luckily, I got invited to a state dinner.

96
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,570
A state dinner?

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,740
It's at the Blue House,
so pick a nice one.

98
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,910
The Blue House?

99
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,200
Do-yoon

100
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,280
Are you saying I'm going to
the Blue House?

101
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,610
For your information,
I like exposing dresses.

102
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,740
I think this is the most exposing one.

103
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,700
No, don't listen to him.
He's just kidding.

104
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,280
Yes. Did you find out?

105
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,490
They can't track down the location.

106
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,030
They don't know the location,
and the number doesn't exist.

107
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,030
It's strange.

108
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,490
Who was the call from?

109
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,160
I killed your parents and your siblings.

110
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,410
I took them down...

111
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,990
...with just four bullets.

112
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,660
I am a marksman just like you.

113
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,240
So you should find me.

114
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,450
Why would you die without finding me?
You can't die now.

115
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,360
Look into it further.

116
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,990
The 353rd report on W Project.

117
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,200
Reports on W Project

118
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,780
August 2016.

119
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,070
Written by Kang Chul.

120
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,490
I'm discarding all the reports
I've written so far.

121
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,910
From now on,
I will work on a new hypothesis.

122
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,990
The killer...

123
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,910
...exists.

124
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,240
The killer exists.

125
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,160
The killer definitely exists.

126
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,110
However,

127
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,700
he is physically unsubstantial

128
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,070
since he wasn't given one.

129
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,700
Thus, he has neither a face
nor identification.

130
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,570
-That's not it.
-Shoot it!

131
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,490
He was created only to kill my family.

132
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,490
He doesn't have any sense of guilt
towards killing.

133
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,990
He doesn't feel sadness

134
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,990
or pleasure.

135
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,990
It's because he doesn't have personality.

136
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,780
Mum.

137
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,860
Dad...

138
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,530
His only role is to traumatise me

139
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,530
and to make me engaged
in solving violent crimes.

Caller ID Restricted

141
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,200
Hello?

142
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,110
Hello...

143
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,990
Where are you?

144
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,280
How did you come back to life?

145
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,860
How did you come back to life?

146
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,240
He appears only when
he is needed for the story

147
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,240
and disappears when he is not.

148
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,860
He can appear anywhere

149
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,160
in any way.

150
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,740
If the creator wants,
he can appear any time...

151
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,280
...without any context.

152
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,990
He can appear any time without context
and commit murder.

153
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,410
And commit murder.

154
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,070
What is a state dinner anyway?

155
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,110
Don't people like the Prince of England
go to that?

156
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,570
Would we be dancing? Dancing?

157
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,450
I can't dance. Gosh.

158
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,910
Would we be dancing waltz?

159
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,660
Gosh, I can't do this.
This is crazy.

160
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,360
May I come in?

161
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,820
How do I look?

162
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,410
They said this suits me the best.

163
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,570
It's her turn now.

164
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,910
I'll put a bullet in her head.

165
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,070
Wait for it.

166
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,360
I guess I look bad.
I guess it's really bad.

167
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,070
Don't say anything. I got it.

168
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,570
Go back.

169
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,570
I'm going already.

170
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,780
Do I look that bad?

171
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,410
Go home. It's dangerous here.

172
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,820
What?

173
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,530
Is there any way you can go back?

174
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,610
I can't just go back.
I can't go back whenever I want to.

175
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,530
What's the matter?

176
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,450
What is it?

177
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,530
Smile when you get off later.
They'll take pictures of you.

178
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,910
I don't think I can do this.
I'm not good at things like this.

179
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,070
Just hold my hand and follow me, okay?

180
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,360
-Here!
-Please look here!

181
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,110
-Please look here!
-Over here!

182
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,700
You two look beautiful together.

183
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,070
How do you feel to be invited
to the state dinner?

184
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,660
Please tell us.

185
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,110
-Please look here!
-Let us take your picture!

186
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,530
-Here!
-Please look here!

187
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,070
Ma'am, are you all right?

188
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,280
-I'm all right.
-Let me help you.

189
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,910
No, I'm all right.

190
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,490
It's okay. I'll do it.

191
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,160
What's going on?

192
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,740
She fell off the bed while sleeping.

193
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,200
Are you all right?

194
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,740
Yes, I'm fine.

195
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,530
Okay, you can leave.

196
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,910
Why did you fall off the bed?

197
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,280
I was just dreaming.

198
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,160
What dream was it?

199
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,860
It was a very sweet dream.

200
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,160
A very sweet dream?

201
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,910
You haven't slept yet?

202
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,110
I think it's almost 3 AM now.

203
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,410
Everyone is watching out for you,

204
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,200
so relax and go back to sleep.

205
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,610
By the way,

206
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,910
is the security guard necessary?

207
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,410
The door's open, and I feel like
people are looking at me,

208
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,610
so I can't sleep well.

209
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,240
We don't know when he'll appear,
so there's no helping it.

210
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,990
I don't die here.

211
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,910
I can't ever die here.
I'm invincible here.

212
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,990
Regardless of what the killer said,
what's there to worry about?

213
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,820
Variables.

214
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,910
There are always variables in the world.

215
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,530
Who knew if the killer
would suddenly appear?

216
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,660
There's nothing we can do
until we know where he is.

217
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,910
Go back to sleep.

218
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,280
So I have to keep on living like this?

219
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,200
I can't go to the party, can I?

220
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,610
I already cancelled it.

221
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,990
I just got out of prison,

222
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,200
but I'm trapped in here again.

223
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,740
I can't even go outside.

224
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,280
You told me to mark
the sweet things you'll do for me.

225
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,200
You said we'll go grocery shopping.

226
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,280
You said we'll do 10 things a day,
but we haven't done a single thing.

227
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,410
We can't go outside, but isn't there
something we can do in here?

228
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,820
Aren't you hungry? I am.

229
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,660
-Shall I call someone?
-It's okay. I have to do it.

230
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,490
Wait outside.

231
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,280
Just a minute.

232
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,280
To be perfectly honest,

233
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,780
there's only one thing
I know how to cook.

234
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,200
What is it?

235
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,990
It's ramyeon.

236
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,280
-Is that cooking?
-That's my favourite food.

237
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,780
Okay, let's just eat ramyeon
and call it even.

238
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,990
Okay.

239
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,070
Where's the ramyeon?

240
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,740
Where's the ramyeon?

241
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,570
That's the oven.
Why are you opening that?

242
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,490
Oh, that's right.

243
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,910
It's usually kept here.

244
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,660
Here it is.

245
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,280
You're right.

246
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,990
Move out of the way. I'll make it.

247
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,490
I should be cooking so
I can finish one of my tasks.

248
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,200
I don't think we can call it even.

249
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,860
Make me a proper dish later
after you study.

250
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,610
Okay.

251
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,490
Are there eggs and spring onions?

252
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,110
-Do you want eggs in it?
-Yes.

253
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,990
Here they are.

254
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,530
There's something I don't understand.

255
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,240
Why did your father do that?

256
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,610
How could he order the killer
to kill his own daughter?

257
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,910
That character always follows
your father's orders.

258
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,360
I don't know.

259
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,160
But I'm sure my dad wouldn't do that.

260
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,780
Who else is there?

261
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,820
I don't know,
but there's no way my dad drew it.

262
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,200
Why would he?

263
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,570
Plus, Dad said he'd never draw again.

264
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,910
Are you all right?

265
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,990
Call the nurse.

266
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,820
Just bring me some medicine.
I'll take care of it.

267
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,280
Why would you call a nurse for this?

268
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,910
What's wrong?

269
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,160
-Why are you bleeding?
-Pardon?

270
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,410
You shouldn't be bleeding at all,

271
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,240
but why are you bleeding?

272
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,990
This means...

273
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,860
...you'll also die if you get shot.

274
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,450
To be continued

275
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,530
Mr Kang, I brought some medicine.

276
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,990
It's okay, the bleeding stopped.

277
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,860
Go back downstairs,
and come back when I call you.

278
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,200
What's going on? Why am I bleeding?

279
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,280
Variables.

280
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,070
There are always variables in the world.

281
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,360
I see you have a new family now.

282
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,780
It's her turn now.

283
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,240
I'll put a bullet in her head.

284
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,860
The killer...

285
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,820
...knows about me?

286
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,490
How?

287
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,410
What's going on? What changed?

288
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,610
Why are there variables now?

289
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,910
What's the context?

290
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,610
Please leave a message after the beep.

291
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,990
I wonder if Dad hasn't arrived yet.

292
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,490
So-hee

293
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,860
Hello?

294
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,160
Are you sleeping?

295
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,660
No. Why are you calling at this hour?

296
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,990
Can't I call at this hour?

297
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,530
Right.

298
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,490
Is your wife beside you?

299
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,990
Are you drunk?

300
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,990
Is Yeon-joo...

301
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,360
...sleeping beside you right now?

302
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,700
I really can't imagine it.

303
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,610
Are you...

304
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,660
Are you really married?

305
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,910
I know. Yes.

306
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,820
You've done nothing wrong.

307
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:20,700
You never promised me anything.

308
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:26,280
But I guess I'm slow-witted.

309
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,200
I thought things would turn out well
if I waited.

310
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,740
I was so stupid.

311
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,820
But I'm not the only one
who thought that.

312
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,410
Everyone

313
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,530
thought like me.

314
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,570
So-hee.

315
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,910
What am I to you?

316
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,360
Who am I to you?

317
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,280
Who was I to you?

318
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,030
What?

319
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,740
What?

320
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,410
My hand.

321
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,700
What's wrong with it?

322
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,740
Hello?

323
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,990
Hello, So-hee?

324
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,570
Her hand disappeared?

325
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,160
Like a ghost.

326
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,990
It suddenly went translucent
like a ghost.

327
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,490
It doesn't make sense,
but I definitely saw it.

328
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,990
Characters.

329
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,910
So you should find me.

330
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,030
Why would you die without finding me?
You can't die now.

331
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,410
The purpose of the characters.

332
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,280
Kang Chul, the main character

333
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,200
Yoon So-hee, Chul's friend
and personal assistant

334
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,070
The first purpose of the characters
are to deliver the story.

335
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,490
The real murderer, an unknown man

336
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,570
The W Project ends here.

337
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,910
When the purpose is gone,

338
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,200
the character disappears.

339
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,530
They disappear forever.

340
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,820
On the contrary, when a character's
purpose becomes clearer...

341
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,860
Wear the ring first.

342
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,200
Is this a wedding ring?

343
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,280
Are you all right?

344
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,280
Then the character becomes
one of the main characters

345
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,070
by force.

346
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,990
No way.

347
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,070
Have I become a real cartoon character?

348
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,780
Because I married the protagonist?

349
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,820
Is that why I bleed?
Does this mean I can actually die?

350
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,360
Then how about the killer?

351
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,200
Why doesn't he cease to exist
when his purpose is gone?

352
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,410
Where are you?

353
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,570
How did you come back to life?

354
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,200
Did he revive himself?

355
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,700
Did he awaken?

356
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,820
Like me?

357
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,820
Is the killer...

358
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,160
...in the outside world?

359
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,610
Let's drink.

360
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,990
River flows

361
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,160
My gosh!

362
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,910
Hey, who are you?

363
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,200
Move! Clear the way!

364
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,200
-Where is this?
-My goodness!

365
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,700
Where am I?

366
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,280
Where is Chul?

367
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,030
Who are you?
I don't know!

368
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,660
Save me! Save me!

369
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,280
Save me!

370
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,280
"W" ends with Chul's death leap.

371
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,450
The identity of the killer
remains unknown.

372
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,910
It's the vainest ending.

373
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,660
The killer followed me into reality
and found out the truth.

374
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,410
When he realised that he doesn't exist,

375
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,530
he became furious.

376
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,530
The one who wanted
the killer's identity revealed

377
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,240
even more than me was

378
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,820
the killer himself.

379
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,030
He's dead?

380
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,490
Chul is really dead?

381
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,910
Who said he could die?

382
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,530
I've waited so long for him.

383
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,030
I've waited 10 years.

384
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,110
I've been waiting for him to find me.

385
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,110
So how can it end?

386
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,160
How can this be the end?

387
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,860
He found out about my death
and became furious.

388
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,360
Did the water pipe explode?

389
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,360
The end

390
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,660
To be continued.

391
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,610
He stopped "W" from ending.

392
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,030
He wanted to end it with me.

393
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,490
Wait. Someone is there.

394
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,820
Hello! Why are you there?
It's dangerous up there.

395
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,200
And now,

396
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,070
he is still wondering around there

397
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,410
because he doesn't know how to come back.

398
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,490
He must be worried.
What should I do?

399
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,530
Who would call at this hour?

400
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,950
Hello?

401
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,450
Hello?

402
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,910
You are back?

403
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,610
You're back?

404
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,660
You are Oh Seong-moo's daughter,
aren't you?

405
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,660
You are Yeon-joo, right?

406
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,490
You are the girl who married Chul.

407
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,030
You are the girl who married Chul.

408
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,410
Mr Oh Seong-moo's house

409
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,490
Emergency contact list
for the show personnel

410
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,990
-Really?
-Good morning, Soo-yeon.

411
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,360
She's sleeping.

412
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,610
She must've gotten
a lot of complaint calls yesterday.

413
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,160
Hey, Soo-bong!

414
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,530
Wake up, Soo-bong!
Wake up now!

415
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,990
-What's wrong?
-Wake up! We have to run!

416
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:13,280
-What? What's wrong with you?
-Hurry! Where's the car key?

417
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,990
-Find the car key!
-What's going on?

418
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,160
You should first tell me what's going on!

419
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,950
-What's going on?
-Hurry up!

420
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,990
-Did you find the key?
-But what's happening?

421
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,070
-Hurry!
-What's wrong?

422
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,320
Tell me what's going on!

423
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,610
-Hurry up!
-What's going on?

424
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,910
Hurry!

425
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,200
Gosh!

426
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,950
Go. Hurry up!

427
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,410
Gosh, I got it.
Let me start the car first.

428
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,700
Yeon-joo, do I just keep going?
Where are we going?

429
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,360
Just go as far away from the house
as you can.

430
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,360
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.
What is it now?

431
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,660
I'm tired of going through
things like this now.

432
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,360
I think nothing will surprise me now.

433
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:31,990
Don't answer your phone.

434
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,360
Don't answer calls from
unknown numbers, okay?

435
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,740
Who would call me?

436
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,990
The killer is...

437
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,990
-...looking for me.
-What are you talking about?

438
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,530
Go... Go back.

439
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,910
Go back.

440
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,360
Who is that?

441
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,990
Isn't that a gun? It's a gun.

442
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,740
That's a gun, Yeon-joo!

443
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,410
-Back up!
-It's a gun!

444
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,990
-Let go of my hand!
-Hurry up!

445
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,700
Let go of my hand.

446
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,240
What's going on?

447
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,410
Did you check the bathroom?

448
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,240
She's not there.

449
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,110
I'm here.

450
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:51,740
Mr Kang?

451
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,110
Was that Mrs Kang's voice?

452
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,410
Yes, I found her.

453
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,410
Are you okay?

454
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,410
-Are you hurt?
-I...

455
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,780
I almost got killed.

456
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,530
The killer took a shot at me.

457
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,700
Where?

458
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,910
He called my dad's house
and I answered it.

459
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,740
He showed up right away
after just a few minutes.

460
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,240
I was running away from him
when he took a shot at me.

461
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,530
I came here right before it hit me.

462
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,610
What about Soo-bong?

463
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,910
-Who is Soo-bong?
-He's my dad's pupil.

464
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,070
He was in the car with me.

465
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,990
Please don't kill me!
I'm so sorry. Please!

466
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,030
I'll be a better person. I'm sorry.

467
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:07,110
Please spare my life!
Please don't kill me.

468
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,610
I'm sorry.

469
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,280
Yeon-joo? Yeon-joo!

470
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,530
What if he shot Soo-bong?

471
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,910
He's after you. He won't hurt him
without a reason.

472
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,820
I'm worried about my mum.

473
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,910
What if he goes to my mum's place
looking for me?

474
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,280
Goodness!

475
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,570
Soo-bong! Are you okay?

476
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,240
Are you okay?

477
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,990
I was on my way to Seong-moo's house.
Is Yeon-joo there?

478
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,200
-Ms Gil.
-Yes?

479
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,110
Ms Gil, you can't go there.
Go somewhere else.

480
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,990
-You should go that way.
-What's wrong with you?

481
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,570
You'll get shot if you go this way.

482
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,990
-You'll get shot. Go left.
-Oh, my.

483
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,570
-I'm sorry. Just trust me, please.
-What are you doing?

484
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,160
Go left. Just hurry up and go.

485
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,280
-What's wrong with you?
-Please go now.

486
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,070
Arrival in Seoul on August 15th

487
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,450
Excuse me.

488
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,530
-You're Mr Oh Seong-moo, right?
-Yes.

489
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,860
I'm a big fan.
Can I have your autograph?

490
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,240
I wasn't sure if it was you.

491
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,240
I heard you were badly injured.
I guess you've recovered.

492
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,780
I'm fine now.

493
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,070
Is "W" really over?

494
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,910
Are you planning a sequel?

495
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,780
I just like your work so much.

496
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,660
It was a pleasure.

497
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,360
Ladies and gentleman,

498
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:42,160
we will be arriving at Auckland
International Airport in 30 minutes.

499
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,160
Have we arrived?
Gosh, this is so tiring.

500
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,110
Ladies and gentlemen,

501
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,160
we will be arriving at Auckland
International Airport in 30 minutes.

502
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,820
Who am I?

503
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,490
Who am I?

504
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,030
Where is Chul?

505
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:06,240
Who am I? Why aren't you
telling me who I am?

506
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,530
Who am I?

507
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,200
Tell me who I am!

508
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,280
Sir, is everything okay?

509
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,660
Sir? Are you okay?

510
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,410
Sir.

511
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,780
Didn't your father tell you anything?

512
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,450
No.

513
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,740
I can't call him.
He's still on the plane.

514
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,410
Where were you going?

515
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,860
Isn't this So-hee's place?
I saw it often in the book.

516
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,410
So-hee, it's me. Open the door.

517
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,240
-So-hee.
-What's going on?

518
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,160
-Do you know the password?
-Pardon?

519
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,280
Is there anything you remember
from the book?

520
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,570
Please eat. Why won't you eat?

521
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,740
Aren't you hungry?

522
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,700
My gosh, what is that?

523
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,660
-Don't we look good together?
-Yeon-joo.

524
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,950
He's totally obsessed over So-hee.

525
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,530
-He's making such crazy connections.
-How?

526
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,660
Do you know why
So-hee lives in Room 702?

527
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,410
It's because my birthday is July 2nd.

528
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,360
So-hee sets every password to 2405.

529
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,990
It's my mobile phone number.

530
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,780
So-hee can't escape from me.

531
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,990
So-hee, you're mine.

532
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,110
Gosh, what is that? That's pathetic.

533
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,860
She's right. You're so pathetic.

534
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,610
Look who's talking.

535
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,360
It's 2405. Her password is 2405.

536
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,490
Stay here. Don't come in.

537
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,740
So-hee.

538
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:05,990
Chul.

539
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,740
I think I'm going to die.

540
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,110
What's wrong with me?

541
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:19,530
My hands are disappearing.
Look at this.

542
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,660
Her hand disappeared?

543
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,410
My legs are gone, too.

544
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,780
What's happening to me?

545
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:37,990
It's because you're drunk.
There's nothing wrong with you.

546
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,820
It's because I'm drunk?

547
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,450
Yes, you're drunk.

548
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,990
Let's get you up.

549
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,410
It's a wedding ring.

550
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,700
You're really wearing it.

551
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,910
You really got married.

552
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,660
-So-hee.
-I thought I'd marry you one day,

553
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,280
but what am I?

554
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,070
What am I?

555
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,530
What am I? What am I?

556
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,410
It's a misunderstanding, So-hee.

557
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,280
You know it's a fake marriage.

558
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,360
It's all fake.
There's nothing going on between us.

559
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,610
It's a misunderstanding?

560
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,200
Yes, it is.

561
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,070
What are you worried about?

562
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,530
You're very precious to me.

563
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,780
You're the closest person to me.

564
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,910
I need you for the rest of my life.

565
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,160
You need me?

566
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,160
Of course.

567
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,410
You can't leave.

568
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,280
I'm not dying?

569
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,700
Why would you die?
That won't happen.

570
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,410
You're drunk now.

571
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,780
Everything will be fine after some sleep.

572
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,410
Really?

573
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:08,860
Yes, really.

574
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,410
I'm going to study computer engineering.

575
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,030
Aren't you going to shoot?

576
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,660
That was just a hobby.

577
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,070
I was hoping for your second
gold medal in the Olympics.

578
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,740
Your dad will be disappointed.

579
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,030
I can become the world champion
in computers.

580
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,610
Gosh, hey.

581
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,030
You're not a genius who can do anything.

582
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:05,200
Yes, I'm a genius.

583
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,280
-I'm a genius. Didn't you know?
-What?

584
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,200
Why, you...

585
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,990
Hey.

586
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:15,360
Come here.
You're such a rascal.

587
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,160
I forgot about it,

588
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,200
but So-hee was
the female lead character.

589
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,530
This happened because of me.

590
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,780
It's a horrible fate
that your father created.

591
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:38,410
In the character set-up.

592
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,200
Our reason of existence.

593
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,410
Isn't it cruel

594
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,030
how there is only one reason

595
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,160
for our existence?

596
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,200
We're also human.

597
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,990
It's such a mess.

598
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,910
This isn't the sequel I was hoping for.

599
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,280
Dear Oh Seong-moo.

600
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,280
What are you doing?

601
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,200
I'm tying your shoelaces.

602
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,280
Here is my chance.

603
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,990
Did I do four sweet things now?

604
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,360
This isn't the time to do your tasks.

605
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,280
We're going to get some fresh air.

606
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,410
Isn't this place...

607
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,610
Do you remember?

608
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,200
This is the place.
Didn't you fall around here?

609
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,990
I was so startled because
I thought you were going to die.

610
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,410
You're lucky

611
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,610
that you met such
a skilled doctor like me then.

612
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,410
I was lucky indeed.

613
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,490
Promise me one thing.

614
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,860
When you leave this world again,

615
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:01,360
can you draw me something?

616
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,490
Draw you what?

617
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,030
A dream.

618
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:07,490
A dream?

619
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:10,910
A scene where I wake up from a dream.

620
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,160
Make everything that happened
two months ago when we first met

621
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,660
to this moment a dream.

622
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,240
Make all that happened a long dream.

623
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:29,240
It isn't hard, is it?

624
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,070
It shouldn't be
when you brought me back to life.

625
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:39,610
No matter how much I think about it,
that's the only way I can think of.

626
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:44,740
Going back to the time before I
thought you were the key to my life.

627
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,990
I met you here for the first time.

628
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,160
We must find her.

629
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:59,700
I think she has the key to my life.

630
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,070
I started to wonder about you
and looked for you.

631
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:07,360
Then you kept getting
pulled into this world.

632
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,780
A webtoon world.

633
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:13,160
This is a world inside a webtoon.

634
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,910
And you are the lead character
of that webtoon.

635
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,780
I learned the truth I shouldn't know
because of you.

636
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,110
I met your father.

637
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,820
I did things I shouldn't do.

638
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,110
The killer followed me then

639
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:43,570
and is making a mess
in your world right now.

640
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,160
My friend is close to disappearing.

641
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,740
And here's the most important thing.

642
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,660
You cannot die.

643
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,660
I can't see that with my own eyes.

644
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:08,240
Everything will be solved if we go back
to the time when we didn't meet.

645
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:12,280
If I don't know you,
I wouldn't look for you.

646
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,530
I wouldn't think about you either.

647
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:17,610
Then you wouldn't be
pulled into this world.

648
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,070
I wouldn't learn the truth from you.

649
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:23,160
I wouldn't shoot your father.

650
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,910
The killer wouldn't leave this world.

651
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,410
No one would be in danger.

652
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,160
Thank you for saving me.

653
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,240
I didn't know how I should live,
but I know now.

654
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:38,410
I should live according to my fate.

655
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:42,110
If looking for a killer I can't catch
for the rest of my life

656
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,070
is the reason for my existence,
then so be it.

657
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,160
What do you think?

658
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:55,240
Do you understand me?

659
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,030
I do.

660
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,530
Can you do that for me?

661
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,160
This is all a dream

662
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:18,780
that I had while I'm in the hospital.

663
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:20,860
A dream I can't even remember.

664
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:33,610
Promise me.

665
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:36,570
You have to do that
immediately when you go back.

666
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,240
Don't hesitate at all.

667
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,450
He doesn't need to
follow the rules of reason,

668
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,200
so he can appear any time.

669
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,610
Answer me. We don't have time.

670
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,360
He might be up to something as we speak.

671
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:52,990
He doesn't have character after all.

672
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,280
I...

673
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,410
...promise you.

674
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:07,200
Okay, then.

675
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,280
It's too bad that we only
got to do four romantic things.

676
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,200
There were
over 100 more romantic things to do.

677
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,490
I want to hug you,

678
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,570
but I can't do that.

679
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,280
It will make me hesitate.

680
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,910
Are you going somewhere?

681
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:52,910
We're running out of time,
and this is the only sure way.

682
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:57,070
Yeon-joo,

683
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,530
forget about me.

684
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:04,910
I am just a cartoon character.

685
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,820
When you miss me,

686
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,410
go to a bookstore
and see me in the comic book.

687
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:14,990
Okay?

688
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:23,740
Take care.

689
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,610
According to the hospital,
President Kang,

690
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,820
who was attacked by an unknown man,
is now recovering and in stable state.

691
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:05,610
The hospital is currently
swarming with people who are...

692
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,740
...worried about President Kang.

693
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:11,820
The police are tracking the man
who attacked President Kang,

694
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,160
but there is no clear lead yet.

695
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,240
This is M News reporting.

696
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:21,030
You're up.

697
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,360
How are you feeling?

698
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,160
-Did they find anything?
-Not yet.

699
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:29,200
They're analysing the surveillance
cameras, but it'll take some time.

700
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,570
You know how slow they are.

701
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,410
Did you cry?

702
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:37,410
-What?
-Those look like tears.

703
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,990
I don't know.
I think I had a dream.

704
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,820
It must've been a pretty sad dream.

705
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,200
I don't remember.
Can you get me some water?

706
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,530
Okay.

707
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,990
Anyway, your problem
is that you are too reckless.

708
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:04,280
Why would you go up there alone?
That's just asking for it.

709
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:07,200
You're lucky the waiter went up there.

710
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,530
Why would you meet him alone
when you don't know him?

711
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,780
W-Two Worlds

712
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,740
I will accept the darned fate
you've given me.

713
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,780
Just like how I drew it,

714
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:37,370
-The ring is beautiful.
-Chul forgot everything.

715
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,070
We can begin again now.

716
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,950
Chul will catch the killer
and marry So-hee.

717
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:48,240
Nobody remembers me there,

718
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,070
and nobody here knows
what I went through.

719
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,160
I called you because
I want to end it right.

720
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,450
I thought of the killer's face.

721
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:58,030
He is the only one
Chul would accept as the killer.

722
00:58:58,450 --> 00:58:59,620
Yeon-joo?
