1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,450
W-Two Worlds

2
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,190
With accumulated sales
of over 10 million copies,

3
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,520
"W" is Korea's best webtoon series.

4
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,820
Kang Chul, the lead character,

5
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,980
finds out through Oh Yeon-joo that
he is a character in a cartoon.

6
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,860
Chul becomes a murderer and a fugitive,

7
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,480
and nearly ceases to exist as he
loses his right as the protagonist.

8
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,110
So, Chul goes back to the world of
"W" and catches the killer.

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,980
Previously on "W"

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,650
The moment it was going to
end with a happy ending...

11
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,820
When I recognise the characters,

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,400
the characters in the cartoon world
can be summoned into the real world?

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,520
Call Han Cheol-ho!

14
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,860
Yeon-joo.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,980
-Where is Chul?
-He went back there.

16
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,110
That means Kang Chul isn't here, right?

17
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,570
The killer comes to the real world...

18
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,190
and kidnaps Yeon-joo.

19
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,650
Do you want to go with me?
Let's go find your husband.

20
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,520
He shoots Yeon-joo
to catch Chul.

21
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,440
Episode 14

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,980
-Give me a defibrillator.
-Yes, doctor.

23
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,110
-What should I charge it to?
-Charge it to 150.

24
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,730
-Is it charged?
-Yes, it's charged.

25
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,730
Stay away. One, two, shock.

26
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,150
One more time.

27
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,690
-It's charged.
-Stay away.

28
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,940
One, two, shock.

29
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,150
It's PEA.

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,190
Continue with heart massage
and bring me some blood packs.

31
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,520
-Hurry!
-Okay.

32
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,730
Yoojin Factory. Chilsan-dong 63-2,
Eunha-gu, Gwangmyeong

33
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,400
Darn it.

34
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,520
What's that bloodstain?

35
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,230
He shot...

36
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,270
some girl.

37
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,940
What girl? I don't see any girl.

38
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,360
I saw her fall.

39
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,690
Soo-bong!

40
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,860
Yeon-joo. Yeon-joo!

41
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,690
Where is it?

42
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,690
Save me.

43
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,980
No, Yeon-joo...

44
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,190
Yeon-joo...

45
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,360
Park Soo-bong

46
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,980
Please pick up the phone! Gosh.

47
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,150
Hello? Hello, Yeon-joo?

48
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,610
Where are you? Are you okay?
What happened?

49
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,570
-Hello?
-Is that you, Soo-bong?

50
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,820
Mr Oh?

51
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,570
Where's Yeon-joo?

52
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,190
Where are you now?
Where are you?

53
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,320
Mr Oh! Where are you going?

54
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,480
Yeon-joo is there.
I have to find her.

55
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,190
Take my car!

56
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,940
Here. Here.

57
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,900
Wait, Mr Oh!
You should sit in the other seat.

58
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,610
Wait. Mr Oh...

59
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,980
Mr Oh, we're going to
the killer's hideout, aren't we?

60
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,980
Are you all right?
You are okay, right?

61
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,980
Hello, hi. Excuse me.

62
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,190
Who are you?

63
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,900
By any chance, have you
seen an injured woman?

64
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,980
Oh, that girl.

65
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,230
An ambulance took her a while ago.

66
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,690
An ambulance...

67
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,270
What happened?

68
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,320
I'm sure she's fine, sir.

69
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
They took her to the hospital
straight away.

70
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,730
The paramedic system is
really good these days.

71
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,520
No, no, no.
It can't be.

72
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,320
No. No.

73
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,400
Chul took her.

74
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,650
Then she's okay. Chul...

75
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,110
Chul took her.

76
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,940
No. No.

77
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,400
No.

78
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,690
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

79
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,610
Is there a woman who was shot
admitted here?

80
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,400
Are you Ms Oh Yeon-joo's guardian?

81
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,150
Yes, we are.

82
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,320
Where is Yeon-joo?

83
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,400
That's...

84
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,860
Intensive Care Unit

85
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,520
Park Soo-bong

86
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,980
Are you Ms Oh's husband?

87
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,940
Yes.

88
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,610
The surgery went well,

89
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,270
but she'd bled excessively
before the surgery...

90
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,690
and had a cardiac arrest during.

91
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,110
We performed CPR on her
for over 30 minutes.

92
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,690
She hasn't gained
her consciousness back yet.

93
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,070
She's not breathing by herself
and her pupils are open.

94
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,520
She's not reacting to any stimulus.

95
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,770
-Then...
-She...

96
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,320
She might not make it.

97
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,980
She might not make it?

98
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,110
-Brain dead?
-We're not sure yet.

99
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,730
If she doesn't wake up...

100
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,270
-Mr Oh!
-Sir, are you okay?

101
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,610
Mr Oh!

102
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,190
My darling Yeon-joo...

103
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,360
Where is she?

104
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,230
Gosh. The thing is...

105
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,110
She's not going to wake up?

106
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,440
No.

107
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,900
What a pity.

108
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,400
Where's her husband? She's a gunshot
victim. We need his statement.

109
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,770
He's inside.

110
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,360
This way.

111
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,650
Oh, my.

112
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,320
Where did they go?

113
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,770
-What?
-She suddenly disappeared.

114
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,690
Her husband, too.

115
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,610
We haven't found them yet.

116
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,480
Gosh. We find it very strange, too.

117
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,070
Oh, my. Look at that.

118
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,070
Why isn't she home yet?

119
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,520
I should call her.

120
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,900
-He's good.
-She's always late these days.

121
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,360
Maybe she's seeing someone.

122
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,690
Mum

123
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,900
Sir, it's Ms Gil.

124
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,190
What should I say?

125
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,270
Say you don't know.

126
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,820
Hello, Ms Gil?

127
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,230
Is that you, Soo-bong?

128
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,270
Yes, I am.

129
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,690
Yeon-joo left her mobile phone
at the studio.

130
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,400
Why would she leave her phone there?

131
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,610
She was hanging out here,

132
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,650
but she got paged
and went to the hospital.

133
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,860
I'll tell her to call you.

134
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,110
I just don't feel so well.

135
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,650
Goodbye.

136
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,400
Yeon-joo.

137
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,820
Yeon-joo!

138
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,110
Yeon-joo!

139
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,110
Chul?

140
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,980
Open the gate, please.

141
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,650
Okay.

142
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,770
-Is Mr Oh back?
-Yes.

143
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,770
Hold on, Chul.
What happened to Yeon-joo?

144
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,940
Chul.

145
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,070
Chul, where is Yeon-joo?

146
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,270
You're back.

147
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,570
Where is Yeon-joo?

148
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,070
Where is she?

149
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,400
I took her to the other world.

150
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
Why?

151
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,650
Why did you do that?

152
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,320
They said she won't wake up.

153
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,070
If something goes wrong here,
you can't turn it back.

154
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,730
She spent three days in the hospital.

155
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,650
They also said she won't wake up,
so I moved her to my hotel room...

156
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
because I couldn't explain about
her gunshot wound.

157
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,270
She spent another week there.

158
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,900
She opened her eyes just once.

159
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,980
Yeon-joo.

160
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,230
Can you see me?

161
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,320
Just for a little while.

162
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,690
And?

163
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,570
What about now?

164
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,150
She died.

165
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,770
Sir.

166
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,690
Sir.

167
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,270
Sir, are you okay?

168
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,690
Sir.

169
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,980
Oh, goodness. Sir.

170
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,820
Sir.

171
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,400
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

172
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,480
I heard Mr Oh is in the hospital.

173
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,980
Yes, he came in this morning.

174
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,230
Why?

175
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,650
Something must've stressed him out.

176
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,070
He took the medicine with alcohol.
He's okay now.

177
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,690
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

178
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,980
-Why?
-I...

179
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:25,980
I left some bad comments saying
he shouldn't draw such rubbish.

180
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,480
I also used some swear words.

181
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,860
What if it was the comments
that stressed him out?

182
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,980
That's possible.

183
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,480
Goodness.

184
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,400
What room is he in?

185
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,150
Chul

186
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,570
Hello, Chul?

187
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,980
Yes. He woke up a while ago.

188
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,020
Okay.

189
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,230
Right.

190
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,070
Hold on.

191
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,110
Sir, I'm Park Min-soo, the surgeon who
operated on you. Do you remember?

192
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,980
I told you not to drink alcohol.
Why did you drink it again?

193
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,400
No matter how hard your work is,
you shouldn't do this.

194
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,980
Hang on. Where is Yeon-joo?
She should be here with you.

195
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,570
Mr Oh, may I ask you something?

196
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,770
Why did Yeon-joo die so suddenly?

197
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,900
She was a useless character,

198
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,110
but still, it doesn't feel good
to see her die like that.

199
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,480
A grim and sad ending isn't
so bad, but...

200
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,570
What...

201
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,110
What are you doing, sir?

202
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,940
Mr Oh? Mr Oh!

203
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,610
Mr Oh.

204
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,980
Let go. Let me go!

205
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,110
Why are you doing this?

206
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,900
I did it.

207
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,480
I shot her.

208
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,610
I shot Yeon-joo. I did it.

209
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,860
-You didn't shoot her.
-I did.

210
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,150
I shot her.

211
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,650
I remember everything.

212
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,980
I shot my own daughter.

213
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,980
No, that wasn't you.

214
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,400
I can't...

215
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,820
live any longer.

216
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,270
-I can't live anymore.
-Wake up and listen to me.

217
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,980
Do you know why I came to find you?

218
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,400
There's something you must do.

219
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,070
Don't blame yourself.

220
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,650
It's the killer who shot your daughter.

221
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,400
And you're the only one who can save her.

222
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,520
You must come back to your senses.
Don't lose yourself.

223
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,070
You must save your daughter.

224
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,980
How can I?

225
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,360
She's dead.

226
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,480
She's dead,

227
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,940
but you can save her.

228
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,770
Because she married me, she unwittingly
became a cartoon character...

229
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,230
like me.

230
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,860
That's why she gets hurt
and bleeds in the cartoon.

231
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,110
That's how she got shot and died.

232
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,110
And just like a cartoon character,
she can be saved by drawings.

233
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,980
Just like how I came back to life.

234
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,150
Do you understand?

235
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,980
Your drawing can bring her back.

236
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,980
That's why I took her to
the other world before she died.

237
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,400
It's not over yet.

238
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,900
I won't ever give up.
I will bring her back to life...

239
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,070
no matter what.

240
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,980
How can I draw when everything is broken?

241
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,690
I destroyed the tablet with a hammer...

242
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,520
because he ordered me to.

243
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,980
I destroyed all of it
because he ordered me to.

244
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,270
The tablet isn't there anymore.

245
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
Yes, there is.

246
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,860
There has to be.

247
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,940
I'm sure it's there somewhere.

248
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,150
Gosh, where did he go?

249
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,360
Why did he leave so suddenly?
What did you tell him?

250
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,400
I didn't say much...

251
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,270
other than a few questions
about the cartoon.

252
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,480
He got up when I asked him
why Yeon-joo died.

253
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,690
What's wrong?

254
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,400
What's wrong?

255
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,070
Why did you ask that?
Why?

256
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,610
Why did you ask
such a question to a patient?

257
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,270
Are you out of your mind?

258
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,730
You're an impolite doctor who
doesn't understand the situation.

259
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,900
Why did you ask such a question?

260
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,270
Have you lost your mind?

261
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,400
Mr Oh!

262
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,270
-Please call the nurse.
-Please call the nurse.

263
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,980
Mr Oh, Mr Oh.

264
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,900
Mr Oh, are you okay?

265
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,270
Did I do something terribly wrong?

266
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
Can't I...

267
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,360
ask why a cartoon character died?

268
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,570
I think I hurt his feelings.

269
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,770
I'm going back in,
so please take care of him.

270
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,980
Wait, Chul. Wait...

271
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,770
What...

272
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,150
You probably don't know
what Yeon-joo means to me.

273
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,110
Yeon-joo...

274
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,820
is my only family.

275
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,730
She isn't a family
you created out of your imagination.

276
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,730
She's my real family that truly exists.

277
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,110
I have memories with her
that are real and not fabricated.

278
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,190
She's a part of destiny that I chose.

279
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,480
For the first time,
it was based on my own will.

280
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,770
That's why I can't give up on her.

281
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,770
Yeon-joo...

282
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,980
...is proof that I'm a person
just like you.

283
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,940
That I'm a human, too.

284
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,190
I'll save your daughter
and live with her happily.

285
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,110
I won't ever back down this time.

286
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,900
No one can discourage me. I'll turn
the table around no matter what.

287
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,270
And it shall be...

288
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,150
...a happy ending for us.

289
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,270
I almost forgot.

290
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,480
Your life is also important to me.

291
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,980
It's not because you created me...

292
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,980
but because you're the father of my wife.

293
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,900
You're already my family.

294
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,610
You may not agree, but you are to me.

295
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,860
So please don't do anything stupid.

296
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,520
Do you understand?

297
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,270
That arrogant brat.

298
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
Chul.

299
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,900
Please be careful, okay?

300
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,270
Goodness, this is killing me.

301
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,860
Stop crying and wait.
I might need your help.

302
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,820
My help? For what?

303
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,150
I'm not sure yet.

304
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,650
Be careful, okay?

305
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,980
How is there another one?

306
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,520
Up until now, I've only used one tablet.

307
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,360
I'm sure there's a substitute.

308
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,980
If there wasn't, the killer
wouldn't have destroyed it.

309
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,400
It's the most important
thing to him after all.

310
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,270
Draw that first.

311
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,980
Your tablet.

312
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,520
He destroyed it so that
we can't use it again.

313
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,230
I'm sure he drew a copy
of the tablet in the cartoon.

314
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,190
Otherwise, he wouldn't have destroyed it.

315
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,150
Can't you remember?

316
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,650
I put it in a trunk.

317
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,570
A car trunk?

318
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,980
The police didn't find
any tablet as evidence.

319
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,480
-Han Cheol-ho.
-Han Cheol-ho.

320
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,690
It's used by illustrators.

321
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,480
It's for drawing.

322
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,150
-Drawing?
-Yes.

323
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,900
This is good enough for professional use.

324
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,980
How do we use it?

325
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,070
You can draw on it like it's paper.

326
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,900
This is the pen for the tablet.

327
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,110
Why did he leave it in the trunk?

328
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,690
-It's not a weapon.
-Pardon?

329
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,400
Never mind.

330
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:30,070
Sir, Mr Park is asking
when you'll be arriving.

331
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,070
-Tell him I'll be right there.
-Okay, sir.

332
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,070
Hello? Yes.

333
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,690
Turn it off for now.

334
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,980
Do you think...

335
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,190
the copy will function like the original?

336
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,230
I'm not sure. We'll have to find out
what the difference is.

337
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,610
We still have to find it first.

338
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,610
We must.

339
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,070
This is not the copy.

340
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,610
It's a trap.

341
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,520
Hey, Chul.

342
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,900
Is this what you're looking for?

343
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,400
Gosh.

344
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,400
It's been a long time
since we met like this.

345
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,860
I couldn't touch you ever since
you became President Kang.

346
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,610
But now,

347
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,610
you're dead.

348
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,940
You put on a show and
pretended to be dead.

349
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,270
So nobody will say anything...

350
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,820
even if you die here.

351
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,860
You're already dead anyway.

352
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,480
Even if I kill you here,

353
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,270
it won't be considered a crime.

354
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,820
Die.

355
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,110
You dug your own grave.

356
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,520
Is it still hazy?
Do you feel dizzy?

357
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,480
Hey.

358
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,770
Aren't you curious?

359
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,230
Aren't you curious about
where I got that drug?

360
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,480
It's here.

361
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,770
Isn't it fascinating?

362
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,270
How can a thing like this exist?

363
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,150
Turn it off for now.

364
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,270
Yes, sir.

365
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,690
Wait.

366
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,690
Tell them to park the car again.

367
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,520
I need to check it before I go.

368
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
Yes, sir.

369
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,980
Documents

370
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,400
What are all these?

371
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,230
He is a real lunatic.

372
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,070
He got lost in delusions while drawing.

373
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,150
Were you trying to form
a terrorist organisation, Chul?

374
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,650
What...

375
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,400
What's this?

376
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,020
Revolver

377
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,520
Where did it...

378
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,400
Not only guns.

379
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,610
It has all kinds of drug.

380
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,520
Sodium amytal, scopolamine,

381
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,610
pentotal sodium, amphetamine, mescaline.

382
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,820
All right. Which shot
do you want to get?

383
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,110
Which one do you want?

384
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,860
Sodium?

385
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,070
Pentotal sodium.

386
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,520
President Kang,

387
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,900
I'm saving you from drug overdose.

388
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,480
You've been appearing and
disappearing like a ghost.

389
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,110
But I guess it's hard now
with the drug in your body.

390
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,610
Isn't this something that
only happens in a cartoon?

391
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,690
You appear when you press enter.

392
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,770
You disappear once again
when you press delete.

393
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,980
I understand now why you
and Han Sang-hoon fought.

394
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,980
But...

395
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,230
what I'm really curious about is...

396
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,360
What on earth is this?

397
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,610
From now on, you have to answer.

398
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,770
Where did Sang-hoon get that?

399
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,110
And how are you guys related?

400
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,570
How did you know that I have it?

401
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,190
Who originally owned it?

402
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,690
Who is the girl that disappeared
after being shot?

403
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,900
How do you come into my room so easily?

404
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,270
Okay.

405
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,320
Let's begin.

406
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,110
This is payback for being such
an annoyance in the past 10 years.

407
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,820
Darn punk.

408
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,110
Hey.

409
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,690
Talk.

410
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,400
Hey.

411
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,070
Talk.

412
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,320
Hey.

413
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,110
-Yes?
-Why are you not coming?

414
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,860
Something came up.

415
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,650
I'll be there right away.

416
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,820
Since you were little,

417
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,520
you've been famous for keeping quiet.

418
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,520
It'll be different this time.

419
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,150
You know it too, right?

420
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,980
You know what's inside.

421
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,610
You better be determined.

422
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Hospital.

423
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,980
What?

424
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,070
Hospital.

425
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,820
Say that again. What did you say?

426
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,230
I have to deliver it to the hospital.

427
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,190
Speak louder.
What about a hospital?

428
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,230
Why is he not calling again?

429
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,400
I should've quit earlier.

430
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,230
It's up.
One more episode.

431
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,570
Please.

432
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,070
Please, please, please.

433
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,730
W -Two Worlds

434
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,190
"Secret of the Tablet"

435
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,270
Please.

436
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,980
Gosh! I told you to be careful.

437
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,400
So you're telling me...

438
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,070
to believe that?

439
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,770
It's true.

440
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,070
-Go in and guard him.
-Yes, sir.

441
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,770
Wait. He's already dead.

442
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,900
It's okay if he dies.
Don't give him a drop of water.

443
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,270
Yes, sir.

444
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,190
Put him up.

445
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,480
It's me.

446
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,230
Tell him that I'm stopping by
somewhere for an emergency.

447
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,520
What time is it now?

448
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,770
What?

449
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,900
Just tell me what time it is.

450
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,900
What time is it?

451
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,400
It's 2:30 AM.

452
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,730
2:30 AM.

453
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,610
It's been 30 minutes now.

454
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,900
He should be there by now.

455
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,650
What?

456
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,860
Soo-bong, you'll get the thing now.

457
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,690
Guard it well.

458
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,070
What are you saying?

459
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:11,520
To be continued

460
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,150
Soo-bong, you'll get the thing now.
Guard it well.

461
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,980
What is this? Is this my name?

462
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,900
Is he calling me?

463
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,230
Stop crying and wait.
I might need your help.

464
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,650
Was that what he was talking about?

465
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,400
Was it?

466
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,190
Are you going to carry it yourself?
It looks heavy. Let me carry it.

467
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,400
-It's fine. Lead the way.
-Yes, sir.

468
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,610
Mr Oh! Mr Oh!

469
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,980
A new episode has been posted.

470
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,980
A new episode?

471
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,730
Did things go wrong with Chul, too?

472
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,980
I'm not sure.

473
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,980
Chul is about to die.

474
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,360
Sir, take a look at this.

475
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,570
Soo-bong, you'll get the
thing now. Guard it well.

476
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,860
He left a message to me.

477
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,110
This is for me, right?

478
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,520
He says I'll get the thing.

479
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,940
What does he mean by that?
What is the thing?

480
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,520
Is it the tablet? It is, right?

481
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,980
Which floor is it, sir?

482
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,400
It's on the 8th floor.
Medical ward, Room 810.

483
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,730
Hospital.

484
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,360
Say that again. What did you say?

485
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,150
I have to deliver it to the hospital.

486
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,400
Deliver what?

487
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,730
That tablet? Why?

488
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,110
I need to save someone.

489
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,940
Who?

490
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,110
Let me get this straight.

491
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,190
That girl who got shot by Han Sang-hoon
and disappeared...

492
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,900
is Oh Yeon-joo, your wife.

493
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,070
That's why you killed Han Sang-hoon.

494
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,270
Your wife who was brain-dead...

495
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,610
stayed in your penthouse...

496
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,110
and died a while ago.

497
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,940
That's right.

498
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:57,900
She died.

499
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,320
And?

500
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,110
I can bring her back to life
with the tablet.

501
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,480
You saw what that tablet can do.

502
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,400
That's why I went to get it.

503
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,610
Bring her back to life?

504
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,480
Would she rise from the dead
if you press the enter key?

505
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,900
It should be drawn.

506
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,150
Drawn?

507
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,820
The tablet's owner must draw it.

508
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,070
That's why I need to bring it
to the hospital.

509
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,230
The owner is in the hospital now.

510
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,820
You crazy jerk.

511
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,980
Do you think
this is some kind of a cartoon?

512
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:51,360
How can you draw someone back to life?

513
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,980
Wasn't what you saw
like a cartoon as well?

514
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,480
So?

515
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:02,900
Keep talking.

516
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:11,520
Go and get some more boys.
I need to check something.

517
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,650
Yes, sir.

518
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,900
-Get them.
-Yes, sir.

519
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,900
Who are you?
You can't come here without permission.

520
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,520
We got Mr Kang's permission.

521
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,360
Let us in.

522
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,900
What are you talking about?

523
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,400
Did you say Mr Kang?

524
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:41,820
He's dead.
How dare you use his name?

525
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,730
We rented this place for our VIP clients.

526
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,190
You can't barge in here.

527
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,610
Hello? Seo Do-yoon
wouldn't let us in.

528
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,270
Okay.

529
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,860
Please talk to Mr Kang.

530
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,270
-Hello?
-Do-yoon.

531
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,610
-Let them in.
-Are you insane?

532
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:16,400
What are you going to do?

533
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,400
Let them see her.

534
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,270
-Is she really dead?
-Yes.

535
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:45,520
It seems she died just a while ago.
She does have a gunshot wound.

536
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,770
Okay. Step out for now.

537
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:01,820
How am I supposed to take this?

538
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,820
You can confirm it yourself.

539
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:07,360
How?

540
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,110
If a drawing can...

541
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,360
bring my wife back to life,
it should be a proof enough.

542
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,900
It will answer all of your questions.

543
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:29,110
Hankuk Sungjin Hospital,
Medical ward, Room 810.

544
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:31,900
His name is Oh Seong-moo.

545
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,320
2:30 a.m.

546
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,270
It's been 30 minutes now.

547
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,650
He should be there by now.

548
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,400
What?

549
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,690
Soo-bong,

550
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:56,610
you'll get the thing now.

551
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,360
Guard it well.

552
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,570
To be continued.

553
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:07,730
What the...

554
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,230
What happened?

555
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,190
Here it is, Room 810.

556
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,230
Yoon Sun-ae.

557
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,900
What is this?
Oh Seong-moo isn't here.

558
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,770
Excuse me.

559
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,320
Mr Han Cheol-ho.

560
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,270
Hello.
Besides that patient,

561
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,730
is there a patient named Oh
Seong-moo staying in this room?

562
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,940
This is a private room.

563
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,690
-Shall I help you find him?
-No, thank you.

564
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,730
I must've come to the wrong room.
You can go back to work.

565
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,320
Why would he lie about something
you'll find out soon?

566
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,400
The third hypothesis.

567
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,730
When I'm in the real world,

568
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,190
I can summon the character
with my perception.

569
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,980
Now, I summon Han Cheol-ho...

570
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,690
to the real world.

571
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,070
Darn punk.

572
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,820
It's the tablet, isn't it?

573
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,980
How can I get it?

574
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,440
What is this?

575
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:58,230
Mr Oh, it's Han Cheol...

576
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,110
Are you Oh Seong-moo?

577
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,360
Yes, that's me.

578
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,230
You're Oh Seong-moo?

579
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,520
You weren't here just now.

580
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,150
Hold on.

581
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,860
Why do you look so much like
Han Sang-hoon?

582
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,070
You're...

583
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,480
You're Han Sang-hoon, right?

584
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,520
-How are you...
-Hey!

585
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,610
What are you doing?
Give it to me!

586
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:28,650
What do you think you're doing?

587
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,150
Who are you?

588
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:34,070
-Help me!
-Who are you, you rascal?

589
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:43,070
Gosh, Mr Oh.

590
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:47,190
How did Cheol-ho carry
that himself here?

591
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,320
Is that the tablet?

592
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,860
So there was a copy of it.

593
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,190
Will it function like the original?

594
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,650
Mr Oh, Han Cheol-ho...

595
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,770
He went back.

596
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,900
Goodness, I'm sleepy.
Do you have the key?

597
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,360
Yes.

598
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,610
Goodness, what's this?

599
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:49,070
-What do we do?
-What happened?

600
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,150
Goodness.

601
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,940
Hello? Sir? Wake up.

602
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,570
Are you okay?

603
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,270
Untie him first.

604
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,070
Hello.

605
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,820
Come to the hotel.
I have to explain something to them.

606
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,980
President Kang is in danger.

607
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,360
President Kang is actually...

608
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:40,320
Ms Yeon-joo?

609
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,520
Nurse, nurse.

610
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:51,730
To be continued

611
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,070
When was that?

612
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,900
It was about 20 minutes ago.

613
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,400
-About 20 minutes ago?
-Yes.

614
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,270
I see.

615
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,610
-Hello?
-Soo-bong.

616
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,610
Yeon-joo?

617
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,900
It's me. What happened?

618
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,400
Yeon-joo? Yeon-joo?

619
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,940
Are you really Yeon-joo?

620
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,900
Goodness, are you really Yeon-joo?

621
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,270
Yes, I must have survived.

622
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,020
Where are you?

623
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,270
Where are you right now?

624
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,440
I...

625
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:40,270
I'm at a hotel.
I just came back to this world.

626
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:42,860
Are you okay? Can you talk?

627
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,270
I guess you're talking now.

628
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,480
Are you hurt?
Do all of your fingers and toes move?

629
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,270
Do you remember everything?
What about your wound?

630
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,650
It doesn't hurt.

631
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,980
I feel completely fine.

632
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:57,610
You scared me to death.

633
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,480
How did I come back to life?

634
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,730
It's because of Mr Oh's drawing.

635
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,770
Is Dad back?

636
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,570
Of course he is.

637
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,150
He didn't answer his phone.

638
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:12,400
What? He's probably
at the hotel now.

639
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,110
He was waiting for the webtoon
to be uploaded.

640
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,400
"W" by Oh Seong-moo

641
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,690
He probably went there
after seeing the webtoon.

642
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,610
I'm actually looking for Chul.

643
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,070
Where?

644
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:32,650
At the place where Chul was tortured.

645
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,320
He was tortured?

646
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:37,980
I came to pick him up, but he isn't here.

647
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,270
Hey, wait.

648
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,980
Goodness.

649
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,820
Shouldn't we call the ambulance?

650
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,270
Tell the boss.

651
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:50,730
Okay.

652
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:56,270
Goodness.

653
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:59,320
-Taxi.
-What?

654
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,400
Call me a taxi.

655
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,400
I need to go to a hotel.

656
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:08,270
You should go to the hospital now.

657
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,400
Gosh.

658
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,480
He said he called the ambulance,
but Chul disappeared in the meantime.

659
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,150
Maybe he left to see you.

660
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,070
Was he hurt a lot?

661
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:27,400
I see. How about Dad? Is he okay?

662
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:33,070
You were dead, of course he's worried.
You aren't the person to worry.

663
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:34,520
Okay.

664
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:38,730
I'll read the webtoon
to see what happened.

665
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,900
That will be faster.

666
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:44,980
Okay.

667
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,480
-Thank you for letting me use it.
-Sure.

668
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:54,610
May I surf the Internet for a while?

669
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,820
I need to save someone.

670
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:36,570
Why isn't he coming?

671
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:29,770
Final episode

672
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:10,480
I'll only be free once it ends.

673
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:11,940
Where have you been?

674
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,070
Until the final episode ends,

675
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:16,110
we can't leave this world.

676
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,900
Let me go! Let me go!

677
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,400
I have a hostage
so that I can survive, too.

678
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:22,730
Come here.

679
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,440
Why are you still alive?
I definitely shot you.

680
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,070
Why are you still alive?

681
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:29,860
The police are coming here.
They'll find this house.

682
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,480
Now, you must decide...

683
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,900
how you'll end this.
