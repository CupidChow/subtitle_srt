1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,960
(Kong Jae-hyun as Kim Hyung-ki,
Chun Jae-young as Kim Pil-hyun)

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,110
(Jin-kwon as Baek Ho-min,
Han Ji-won as Lee Yoon-seul)

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,470
(Kimg Kang-min as Han Ji-woo)

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,150
(Son Woo-hyun as Kang Seo-jun)

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,870
(To My Star)

6
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,890
Hey, Hyung-ki.

7
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,240
Come on, be careful!

8
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,750
Are you okay?

9
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,590
Yes.

10
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,320
Ham, crabmeat, pickled radish,
spinach, and what else?

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,930
Dried laver.
Of course, we need dried laver for gimbap.

12
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,710
-What?
-My photo. Who did this?

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,900
Wait.

14
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,390
What? A horn?

15
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,360
By the way,

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,229
is that the only outfit you have?

17
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,750
I have extras of the same outfit.

18
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,070
Why?

19
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,880
Wearing the same outfit
makes my life easier.

20
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,460
You're so weird.

21
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,009
Yes!

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,720
(I'm here alone.)

23
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,910
Hello.

24
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,680
What? I've never seen you around here.

25
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,880
What's up with the mask?

26
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,070
Well...

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,450
By the way, you have good eyes.

28
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,300
Thank you.

29
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,710
Where would you like to sit?

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,380
-Right here.
-Okay.

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,400
-You're here.
-Hey.

32
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,460
What would you like?

33
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,140
He knows what I like.

34
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,720
-Okay.
-Are you from Italy as well?

35
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,710
My parents are in Italy.

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,250
I see.

37
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,620
Did you live in Italy?

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,079
-I was in Piedmont.
-I see.

39
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,910
He graduated from
1 of the 3 major culinary schools there.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
His food is so good.

41
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,590
I see.

42
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,800
Where are your parents?

43
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,290
(Delightful Fried Chicken)

44
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,120
Hello.

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,750
Is anyone here?

46
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,690
-What?
-What?

47
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,510
My gosh. Come on.

48
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,070
I was out delivering chicken that day.
I didn't see anything.

49
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,530
You promised to make gimbap with me.

50
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,210
Are you ready?

51
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,000
My goodness. Oh, my.

52
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,210
You got it wrong. Okay?

53
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,560
Stay still.

54
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,890
The thing with this shirt is

55
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,590
that it looks good
when you wear it like this.

56
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,700
My gosh. Nice.

57
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,110
Wear it just like this.

58
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,370
I mean, it's nice to dress
in different styles.

59
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,610
Your hair... Why don't you try this?

60
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,600
Or like this?

61
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,860
You look handsome in any hairstyle.

62
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,780
Get the eyelash off your face.

63
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,940
I really don't know what happened.

64
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,310
And I don't feel like accepting
this money, either. Take it.

65
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,130
What's that?

66
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,270
Mr. Kang Seo-jun took the CCTV footage
of my restaurant himself.

67
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,000
He gave me this money,
so I could keep it a secret.

68
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,350
Listen. You're not the police.
And he said this wouldn't happen.

69
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,060
Why are you doing this to me?

70
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,909
You're making me feel guilty.

71
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,850
Hello, I'm Kang Seo-jun.

72
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,550
(All right. I came up with a new video.)

73
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,760
(It's called Seo-jun's Cooking Class!)

74
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,390
I'll make a variety of dishes
in this video.

75
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,540
And I've invited a guest.

76
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,570
(He's a handsome chef.)

77
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,310
Let me introduce Chef Han Ji-woo to you!

78
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,430
(Well, I'm not a chef yet.)

79
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,720
(No, you are. Say hello.)

80
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,760
(All right.)

81
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,410
Bend your fingers.

82
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,990
Like this?

83
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,500
More. Bend them more.

84
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,909
Sorry.

85
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,200
It's a habit.

86
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,330
That's a weird habit to have.

87
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,970
Is it because you're a chef?

88
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,590
Bye.

89
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,440
What are you going to do?

90
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,630
Who knows?

91
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,940
Kang Seo-jun is my neighbor,
so I'll ask him directly.

92
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,480
What?

93
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,760
Does he live in your area?

94
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,460
Did you see him?

95
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,680
I'll find out first.

96
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,500
Make sure you're
the second person to find out.

97
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,050
I wonder if you know what he's up to.

98
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,090
He's working
as a part-timer at a restaurant.

99
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,200
Hey, Seo-jun. What was
the name of the restaurant?

100
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,970
If you need me to tell you the restaurant,
just let me know.

101
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,450
Darn it.

102
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,610
(This is a great meal
for a protein-focused diet.)

103
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,669
(It's a colorful roll of gimbap
made of eggs.)

104
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,440
-Are you proud?
-You bet I am.

105
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,880
I'm going to try the dish right now.

106
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,710
Can you hold up your palm?

107
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,520
All right.

108
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,240
Okay.

109
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,780
Look.

110
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,760
It's so good.

111
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,540
If Chef Han cooks eggs,
I just eat them. He has my trust.

112
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,320
How does it feel?

113
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,210
Let me see. I'm good at that.

114
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,370
I'm okay.

115
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,260
You should go see a doctor.

116
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,600
I'll take care of it.
Worry about your finger.

117
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,530
Let's go on a picnic.

118
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,550
Can I invite Pil-hyun and Ho-min?

119
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,380
You wanted to get your permission first.

120
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,660
Sure.

121
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,060
(What took you so long to answer
my call? What are you doing?)

122
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,240
Let's go on a picnic.

123
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,020
(A picnic? Are you mad?)

124
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,480
Yes, this is a picnic.

125
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,930
Yes, it is.

126
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,090
But this isn't a real picnic.

127
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,760
What if people see you? Come on!

128
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,840
It's okay. No one will know.
Don't worry about that.

129
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,010
How could that be?
This space is completely open!

130
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,680
Eat a lot, Ho-min.

131
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,980
Goodness.

132
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,980
Hey, Ji-woo.

133
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,460
It's been a while since I saw you.
Thanks for making gimbap.

134
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,530
Seo-jun made it.

135
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,900
"Seo-jun"?

136
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,090
Thanks for the food.

137
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,740
It's good.

138
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,160
Hey, this is so cool.

139
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,890
You finally got your dream job!

140
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,720
Are you running this restaurant with
the chef from your previous restaurant?

141
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,560
Yes.

142
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,150
But this is a shame.

143
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,270
Gimbap doesn't pair well with drinks.

144
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,920
There's no such thing.
It pairs well as long as it tastes good.

145
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,680
-Right?
-Yes.

146
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,620
Come on, Seo-jun.

147
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,400
Forget it. We'll talk in private later.

148
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,620
-Don't scare me. Come on.
-By the way,

149
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,700
I get that you have no respect for me.
But a part-timer at a restaurant?

150
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,190
How is that possible?

151
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,730
It doesn't sound possible. Right.

152
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,620
Ji-woo, can you teach me
how to make saffron risotto next time?

153
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,750
My goodness. So you'll cry again
after eating that?

154
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,870
Hey, things are different now.

155
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,540
I'll just reminisce.

156
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,030
My parents abandoned me
and ran away to Italy.

157
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,970
That was the last meal I had
when I went to Italy.

158
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,930
Gosh. They bragged
how expensive that dish was.

159
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,450
But you cried every single time
you ate it after you came back.

160
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,260
That should teach you not to eat it.

161
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,760
Or you should go back to Italy.

162
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,920
No. I have my pride.

163
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,840
My gosh. You're enjoying it, Ho-min.

164
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,240
Eat a lot.

165
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,440
Okay.

166
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,780
Gosh. You guys are ridiculous.

167
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,100
What?

168
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,880
No! Hold it back! Eat it! Swallow it!

169
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,420
I'll clean it up. Throw it up here.

170
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:20,860
My gosh. He can't even hold his liquor.
Why did he drink so much?

171
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,110
How can he be so cute?

172
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,240
You looked cranky at first.

173
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,130
-So he was scared of you.
-Just throw it up.

174
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,800
-Isn't that funny?
-Just do it.

175
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,340
Not really.

176
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,980
I'm so happy now

177
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,630
because everyone I like is here.

178
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,940
We haven't known each other for long.

179
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,920
How can you like me already?

180
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,070
But he has a tight inner circle.

181
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,610
He doesn't say that to anyone.

182
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,820
Gosh, stop that.

183
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,500
Are you okay?

184
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,660
See? He said I have a tight inner circle.

185
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,180
But you flirt all the time.

186
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,390
Me? When?

187
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,430
"He's cute." "You're handsome."
"I like you."

188
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,760
This is considered flirting to everyone.

189
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,580
Are you jealous now?

190
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,600
Can I kiss you?

191
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,370
One,

192
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,440
two,

193
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,640
three,

194
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,620
four,

195
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,640
five,

196
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,890
and six.

197
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,000
(To My Star)

198
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,750
(To My Star)
