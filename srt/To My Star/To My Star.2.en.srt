-Kim Pil-hyun?
(-You didn't save my number?)

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,950
(You really don't like me.)

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,230
(I still own the house.)

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,740
-I'll hang up if you want to rub it in.
(-Hold on.)

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,280
(Did you meet Seo-jun?)

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,950
Yes. He said he was staying here.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,320
(So he already told you.)

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,650
(Yes. He'll stay there
for the time being.)

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,640
(You were looking for another
roommate anyway. It all worked out.)

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,830
Okay.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,860
(Ask him to pay the utilities.
He's rich, anyway.)

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,370
(He might be there for a while.
Play nice.)

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,570
(He is a bit annoying, though.)

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,269
Next time, give me a week's notice.
Please inform me in advance.

20
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,730
(Gosh, I wanted to do that,)

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,580
(-but you didn't--)
-I'm hanging up.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,160
Goodnight.

23

24
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,750
Isn't that odd?

(TB ENT)

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,360
Why do people always hang up first?
(TB ENT)

27
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,680
I don't do that.

28
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,030
(TB ENT)

29
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,060
Right. Thanks.
(TB ENT)

30
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,610
That's comforting.

31
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,430
By the way, Seo-jun
couldn't have beaten him up, right?

32
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:37,650
(TB ENT)
By the way, Seo-jun
couldn't have beaten him up, right?

33
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,090
(TB ENT)

34
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,580
Sometimes, he says scary things.
(TB ENT)

35
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,630
Sometimes, he says scary things.

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,430
Ho-min. He's a troublemaker,
but he's not violent like that.

(TB ENT)

38
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,479
You trust him, right?
(TB ENT)

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,340
Answer me.

40
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,890
Are you getting anxious?

41
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,550
No. No way.

42
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,750
I don't feel anxious at all.
I totally trust him.

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,290
When will you drop off his stuff?

44
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,800
Tomorrow. And he asked me
to do something for him.

45
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,960
He did?

46
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,840
Good morning.

47
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,700
Thanks to you, I had a good night's sleep.

48
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,060
Okay. You drank four cans
of beer last night.

49
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,820
Beer isn't alcohol.

50
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,870
You're mad that I finished all of them.

51
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,840
We'll have to share the house now.

52
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,170
We should respect each other.

53
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,190
I'm not being petty over food.

54
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,610
I think you are.

55
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,690
You're Pil-hyun's friend.
I'll drop the honorifics.

56
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,870
You already did. So suit yourself.

57
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,310
Why are you so hostile against me?

58
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,860
It was a joke to break the ice.

59
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,050
Don't mind me.

60
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,829
Should I pay for the beer?
Do you need the money?

61
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,680
You should apologize first.

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,880
If I only give you 10,000 won,
I should apologize.

63
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,700
But I usually pay back tenfold.

64
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,540
I made a lot of money from working
like a dog since I was a kid.

65
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,430
What?

66
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,550
I heard you pay rent here.

67
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,380
Saving up some money instead of
keeping your pride is not a bad idea.

68
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,920
You left this yesterday.

69
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,690
Eat it or throw it out.
You take care of it.

70
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,730
Does this have to do
with the pride of a chef?

71
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,880
I don't want free money.

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,530
Who is it?

73
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,170
(Hello, I'm Seo-jun's manager.)

74
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,930
Do you also just pay people

75
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,300
instead of letting them know
you're having a guest over?

76
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,060
If that's what you want, yes.

77
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,170
How much do you want for that?

78
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,510
Fine. I will tell you in advance
before bringing people over here.

79
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,860
So can you let my friend in
who's waiting outside?

80
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,950
Oh, right. I'm sensitive to smell.

81
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,460
You didn't take a shower last night.

82
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,020
Please take hygiene seriously
even if you just stay at home.

83
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,090
That hurt.

84
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,680
Don't make food waste either.

85
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,880
But seeing how you're wasteful,
that might be hard.

86
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,680
Make a lot of money.

87
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,060
You startled me. What?

88
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,910
Why did you slap yourself?

89
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,460
He seems so unfriendly.

90
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,800
My roommate?

91
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,240
He's the unfriendly one.
Why did you slap yourself?

92
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,230
-My gosh.
-You drive me crazy.

93
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,909
Come on in.

94
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,590
Gosh.

95
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,870
This is a nice house.

96
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,240
Eggs? You hate eggs.

97
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,260
I have to eat it. He's scary.

98
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,430
Did you bring my GoPro camera?

99
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,500
-By the way,
-Yes?

100
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,730
do I smell?

101
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,920
Pardon?

102
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,460
No.

103
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,800
He probably didn't mean it, right?

104
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,450
You're free today, right?

105
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,340
What should we do today?

106
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,960
Well, I have to go and help Ji-nam
with his shoot as a backup.

107
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,260
(Min-seok)

108
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,020
"I'm sorry."
(Min-seok)

109
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,460
(Min-seok)

110
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,570
"There are too many things I want
to learn before I settle for a job."
(Min-seok)

111
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:39,659
"There are too many things I want
to learn before I settle for a job."

112
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,230
(Min-seok)
"There are too many things I want
to learn before I settle for a job."

113
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,020
(Min-seok)

114
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,220
"I'm sorry. You should find someone else."
(Min-seok)

115
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,630
(Min-seok)

116
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,850
I told you. We should pay people
on the tenth of every month.

117
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,750
They all quit after getting the paycheck
on the last day of the month.

118
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,470
He still texted you.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,860
I train them, but once they learn
the ropes, they leave.

120
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,480
It's a cycle.

121
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,830
We'll find another one. I'll write a post.

122
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,010
That jerk, Min-seok.

123
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,360
Hello.

124
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,680
A table for two?

125
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,140
(Pizza)

126
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,470
(He always pays his victim.
I'd love to get beaten up too.)

127
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,100
(Good for In-woo.)

128
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,690
(He's close to Kang Seo-jun,
got beaten, and got paid.)

129
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,310
(I've got zero interest in him. Get lost.)

130
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,810
(Too bad that he got caught.)

131
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,170
Do you always come home this late?

132
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Yes. I do.

133
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,040
Are you going to drink beer
because you didn't get to last night?

134
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,820
-Yes.
-With what?

135
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,190
I had pizza for dinner.
It was a bit greasy.

136
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,130
So what?

137
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,800
We should drink it together.

138
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,780
Are you a loner?

139
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,410
The air feels like we should mix
soju and beer together.

140
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,840
Soju and beer.

141
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,030
(Ipsul)

142
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,690
Yes. This is the best brand for soju.

143
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,530
Things were a bit tense in the afternoon.

144
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,660
I heard chefs are all kindhearted.

145
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,620
And I'm not bad for an actor.

146
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,070
I hope we can get along.

147
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,620
I think you are.

148
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,700
I've never punched anyone in my life.

149
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,470
I mean, off camera.

150
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,640
Talk is cheap.

151
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,460
Then, you must be scared right now.

152
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,580
You're with a guy who beats people up
when he drinks.

153
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,110
Cheers.

154
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,230
It's good.

155
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,080
This puts me in a good mood.

156
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,480
You're good.

157
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,390
By the way, I ate... What's that called?
I ate that egg breakfast dish.

158
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,370
I guess I don't hate eggs, after all.

159
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,910
Are you touched?

160
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,510
-No.
-Yes, you are.

161
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,410
At first, when people told me,
I was great at acting.

162
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,260
I was elated too.

163
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,610
You don't care about
other people's feelings.

164
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,640
And you just say whatever you want to say.

165
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,930
I'm jealous of you.

166
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,640
You won't stay here for long, anyway.

167
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,320
We don't have to get to know each other.

168
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,760
But still.
We'll be living in the same house.

169
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,740
It'd be nice to get along.

170
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,120
Well,

171
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,510
are you avoiding me in case I'm a jerk?

172
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,540
You'll be more polite and clean up more

173
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,400
if we aren't so close.

174
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,830
I bet you love giving people advice.

175
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,090
There's a test to see
if you're a boomer or not.

176
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,490
You should watch out.

177
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,090
You're young, but you sure have
the potential to be a boomer.

178
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,850
See? You're being petty over food.

179
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,480
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

180
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,910
(To My Star)

181
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,700
(To My Star)
