00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,960
(Kong Jae-hyun as Kim Hyung-ki,
Chun Jae-young as Kim Pil-hyun)

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,110
(Jin-kwon as Baek Ho-min,
Han Ji-won as Lee Yoon-seul)

(Kimg Kang-min as Han Ji-woo)

(Son Woo-hyun as Kang Seo-jun)

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,260
(To My Star)

6
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,100
Can I kiss you?

7
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,090
One,

8
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,770
two,

9
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,310
three,

four,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,100
five,

12
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,430
and six.

13
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,640
What are you doing?

14
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,380
What... What have I just seen?

15
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,980
Get up, Ho-min.

16
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,830
I want to go home now.

17
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:28,210
I'll cancel the contract.

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,150
Hello?

19
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,710
-I want to call a chauffeur.
-You had time to say no.

20
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,039
You had time to say no.

21
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,950
You had time to say no.

22
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,150
You had time to say...

23
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:22,280
Must I take a shower before I sleep?

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,079
He reeks of alcohol. Seriously.

25
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,079
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,240
Do you remember last night?

27
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,750
It wasn't a dream, right?

28
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,170
It wasn't?

29
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,110
No. It wasn't.

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,710
What is it? What's wrong with you?

31
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,620
It wasn't a dream.

32
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,490
Call Seo-jun now.

33
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,220
No.

34
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,030
What?

35
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,579
I'll call him after 10 minutes.

36
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,890
Was his drink spiked last night?

37
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,240
Hey. What time is it?

38
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:56,780
Do you think I'm Siri?

39
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,420
(I can help you.)

40
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,730
Just tell me what happened.

41
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,150
What was that last night?

42
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,530
(You were too drunk last night, right?)

43
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,980
(You don't even remember, right?)

44
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,590
(Hey.)

45
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,060
(Seo-jun, you can't do that
if you're a human being. Okay?)

46
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,649
(You're lucky Ji-woo is kind.)

47
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,540
(I'd be so offended if I were him.)

48
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,960
(Why did you do that?)

49
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,470
(Were you doing that for me?)

50
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,670
Was I the only one who got drunk?

51
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,860
(Yes!)

52
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,460
(Do you feel anxious
when you're not causing trouble?)

53
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,520
(Does it drive you mad?)

54
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,760
(How will you face Ji-woo?)

55
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,870
I'll think about it.

56
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,170
(Please do. Seo-jun,
let's be careful, okay?)

57
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,560
(-What if someone took a photo?)
-Gosh, come on.

58
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,880
Okay. Bye.

59
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,950
Hello?

60
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,710
Did he hang up on me?

61
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,360
(You don't have to work today.
Just rest up.)

62
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,690
(You don't have to work today.
Just rest up.)

63
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,040
What is it? What did he say?

64
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,040
Is there something wrong with me?

65
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,690
Why? Did he hang up on you again?

66
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,110
I'm used to that now.

67
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,330
My gosh. Why again?

68
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,490
This happened twice already.

69
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,640
Gosh. We didn't get any orders
this morning.

70
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,720
Let's develop another dish.

71
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,020
We don't need a part-timer
for the time being.

72
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,670
Did you two fight?

73
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,690
No.

74
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,720
Why isn't he here, then?

75
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,920
There he is.

76
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,320
Sorry. I drank too much last night.

77
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,590
We don't have any delivery orders
or customers today.

78
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,310
That's why I said
you didn't have to come in.

79
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,700
-Where are you going?
-To smoke a cigarette.

80
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,240
I thought you quit.

81
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,780
No one can't quit smoking.

82
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,720
Don't smoke.

83
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,210
One cigarette won't kill me.

84
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,720
Let me know if we get a delivery order.

85
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,460
I think you're the one who's flirting.

86
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,970
What do you mean?

87
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,409
Nothing.

88
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,290
I guess you remember everything.

89
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,120
Sorry.

90
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,440
I don't know why I did that.

91
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,830
When will you make saffron risotto?

92
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,040
Let's pretend last night didn't happen.

93
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,390
And don't do that next time.

94
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,480
No, I don't want to do that.
Let's talk it out.

95
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,930
It's your habit.

96
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,340
Not really.

97
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,300
Hey, Yoon-seul.

98
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,830
Yes, he's here. Why?

99
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,600
(Yang In-woo's agency is preparing
to publish an article.)

100
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,730
They'll say you already apologized,
ask the public to forget about it...

101
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,100
and make it look like
it's a small incident between guys.

102
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,390
That's their approach.

103
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,260
If you don't fight back,
you'll be their punching bag.

104
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,710
I'll be honest with you. I want
to get to the bottom of the truth,

105
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,820
so I can go back to the city desk.

106
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,940
I appreciate your honesty.

107
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,659
It's all about timing.

108
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,300
If you want to make it right,
you must do it now.

109
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,460
Or whatever the reason is,
you'll be deceiving the public

110
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,470
because you took the CCTV footage.

111
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,600
Why did you do it?

112
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,120
Now that I know you took the footage,
if you don't tell the truth,

113
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,710
I will.

114
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,690
Hey, In-woo. It's about time we meet now.

115
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,930
(Saffron)

116
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,750
I'm making it because I want it too.

117
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,320
I gave it some thought
as I cleaned the house today.

118
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,900
I think I like you.

119
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,140
I was wondering when you'd be home today.

120
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,780
I wanted to call you.

121
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,500
And I'm happy now that you're home.

122
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,620
With you,

123
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,300
I don't feel anxious.

124
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,200
Were you a puppy in your previous life?

125
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,680
-Is that your answer?
-Or you must be bored out of your mind.

126
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,010
How can you trash
someone's heart like that?

127
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,910
Even when you reject someone,

128
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,110
you ought to look at that person.

129
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,310
You still need to be polite.

130
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,600
I no longer want to be part of

131
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,420
your stupid game.

132
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,190
Let's just cook.
You said you wanted to cook this dish.

133
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,080
I'm even more sure of myself
now that I'm looking at you.

134
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,690
I'm not joking around.

135
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,080
I want to kiss you
even when I'm not drunk.

136
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,040
Date with me.

137
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,940
(To My Star)

138
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,740
(To My Star)
