00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,960
(Kong Jae-hyun as Kim Hyung-ki,
Chun Jae-young as Kim Pil-hyun)

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,100
(Jin-kwon as Baek Ho-min,
Han Ji-won as Lee Yoon-seul)

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,270
(Kim Kang-min as Han Ji-woo)

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,340
(A small black star grew in my heart.)

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,020
(Son Woo-hyun as Kang Seo-jun)

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,150
(I wanted my own universe.)

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,310
(To My Star)

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,970
Everything will be fine.
I'll go check it out.

9
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,230
Why did you throw a rock?

10
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,120
I didn't.

11
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,030
I came out after checking our CCTV.

12
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,390
Why did you throw a rock?

13
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,330
He threw a rock?

14
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,360
Doesn't Kang Seo-jun live here?

15
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,250
Pardon?

16
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,950
I saw his manager go in.

17
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,840
Hello, is this the police?
Someone threw a rock at my home.

18
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,580
I'm sorry. I just wanted to check.

19
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,310
But

20
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,820
does he really not live here?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,100
Yes.

22
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,700
What was that? Why is he looking for
Kang Seo-jun at your house?

23
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,600
And what about his manager?

24
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,740
This is where the CEO of Kang Seo-jun's
agency lives.

25
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,110
What?

26
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,990
So the person your parents knew was
the chairman of the board at TB Group?

27
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,630
What? Why are you telling me that now?

28
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,480
Then is Kang Seo-jun really here?

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,190
Why would Kang Seo-jun be here?

30
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,950
He's not.

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,150
Are you getting off work?

32
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,710
Yes. I couldn't find a place to park,
so I parked down there.

33
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,520
Let's talk over a drink.

34
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,930
I can't tonight.

35
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,600
Why not?

36
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,310
I'm tired.

37
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,220
Tired? You're tired?

38
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:46,680
Why?

39
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,410
You're acting suspicious.

40
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,020
Is someone at your place?

41
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,670
What are you talking about?
There's nobody here.

42
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,090
You must be really tired today.

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,540
Fine. You should say that you're tired
more often from now on.

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,430
Go in and get some rest.

45
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,810
Goodbye.

46
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,190
It must've been
a kid from the neighborhood.

47
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,340
Are there still kids like that these days?

48
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,980
I guess so.

49
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,579
If you're not going to eat more,
I'll start cleaning up.

50
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,210
You should go get some rest.

51
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,700
But

52
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,020
why did you come back so late?

53
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,810
You didn't sell me out,

54
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,970
did you?

55
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,220
What are you talking about?

56
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,990
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,020
I was just a bit shocked.

58
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,820
Do you want to watch a movie with me?

59
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,870
What?

60
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,680
If I go right to bed on a day like this,

61
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,760
I end up getting stoned in my dreams.

62
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,060
I end up being in a lot of pain.

63
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,210
That's why when I wake up,
I actually feel pain.

64
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,630
That's none of my...

65
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,050
The movie isn't over yet.

66
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,810
About what we were talking about...

67
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,600
Ji-woo. It's perfect right now.

68
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,670
Let's squeeze it right now.

69
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,720
What are you talking about?

70
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,750
I can't stand seeing nose hairs
popping out,

71
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,960
messy eyebrows and pimples.

72
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,070
-I'll take care of it.
-How will you take care of it?

73
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,570
Come here. You can't do this alone.

74
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,290
What are you doing? I said I was fine.

75
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,960
I really want to do it.

76
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,810
Can you let me?

77
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,960
Are you really crazy?

78
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,460
Just once.

79
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,800
Stay still.

80
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,270
Look at me.

81
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,450
As you can see,

82
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,010
I take good care of myself,
so I don't have anything like that.

83
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,190
Just once.

84
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,740
Don't do such a weird thing ever again.

85
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,580
Fine.

86
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,800
The movie isn't over yet.

87
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,650
Let me do it when we get closer.

88
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,010
There's no way that would ever happen.

89
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,570
Did you go to work already?

90
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,110
Okay.

91
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,570
Why would Reporter Park write
an article like that?

92
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,500
"He was always a piece of trash?"

93
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,690
My gosh.

94
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,300
-What is this?
-Are you here?

95
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,840
What are you doing here?

96
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,680
-You...
-She told me you were high school alumni.

97
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,040
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,110
What brings you here?

99
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,150
You ignored me and ran off really quickly
last time.

100
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,970
Oh, right. Thank you.

101
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,460
Why would you thank her?

102
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,030
I have nothing to say.

103
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,120
It's because you won't answer your phone.

104
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,360
I really have nothing to say.

105
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,300
I already said it's not true.

106
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,970
There are no specific details,
so who would believe you?

107
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,990
They already covered their tracks,

108
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,150
so we couldn't even get any CCTV footage.

109
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,170
I'm sure you know better than us.

110
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,640
That's what I'm saying.
If it's not true, say it.

111
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,620
Be more exact so that it's believable.

112
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,170
You could tell me the specific details.

113
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,400
It's because I'm frustrated.

114
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,040
If we find anything,
I'll let you know first.

115
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,230
Thank you.

116
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,870
Where is Kang Seo-jun right now?

117
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,340
It seems like he already left his house.

118
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,390
I'm sure he's in
some countryside right now.

119
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,490
Are you sure he's not at
your house in Buam-dong?

120
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,490
I leased it out,
so a few people live there.

121
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,820
Okay. I'll see you next time.

122
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,090
(TB ENT)

123
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,470
You have to be really careful around her.

124
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,080
She was no joke ever since
she followed my dad around.

125
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,570
My gosh.

126
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,650
High school alumni, my foot.

127
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,290
I told you I was sorry.

128
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,130
Hey, put some gloves on.

129
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,810
It's fine. This is faster.

130
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,260
Are you okay?

131
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,680
-Yes, I'm fine.
-Let me see.

132
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,170
I said I was fine.

133
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,580
Focus on cooking.

134
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,250
What's wrong with you?

135
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,590
You know you'd get hurt,
but you act like you want to.

136
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,860
Are you a pervert?

137
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,590
I heard someone is coming in
for an interview.

138
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,970
Did someone call the restaurant.

139
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,270
Yes. I think his name was Kang Seok-jung.

140
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,570
Hello.

141
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,380
How much is the one you're looking for?

142
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,890
-40,000 won?
-No.

143
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,430
We can't make one for 30,000 won.

144
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,510
Hello.

145
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,210
As you can see, I'm Kang Seo-jun,

146
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,360
but I called and said my name was
Kang Seok-jung.

147
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,610
You suddenly asked for my name,

148
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,790
so I was flustered.

149
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,260
I'm asking because I'm really curious.

150
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,800
Why did you come here?

151
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,370
There's something I wanted to say
to you right away,

152
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,360
but I didn't have your number,
so I called the restaurant.

153
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,870
They asked if I wanted an interview,
so I said yes.

154
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,450
I see.

155
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,130
He didn't tell me anything,
so I had no idea.

156
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,450
I see.

157
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,270
You're handsomer in person.

158
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,540
You're quite handsome yourself.

159
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,720
My gosh.

160
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,200
When I first came,
I said I'd give him my autograph,

161
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,350
but Ji-woo ignored me completely.

162
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,620
Let's see.

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,940
I'm not in a good position right now,

164
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,540
but later...

165
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,240
You can put this up here later.

166
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,560
Oh, right.

167
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,110
What do you have to say?

168
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,220
Say it and leave.
We're going to be busy soon.

169
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,510
The biggest relief is that

170
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,370
I didn't get stoned in my sleep
last night.

171
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,850
Do you guys run this restaurant together?

172
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,590
I guess you could say that.

173
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,780
I see.

174
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,830
Boss. Make me one rose shrimp linguini.

175
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,950
-Hey, Han Ji-woo.
-I'll show you where the restroom is.

176
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,720
-Oh, hello. Come here.
-It's over by this way.

177
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,570
I'll make it for you. Hurry up.

178
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,550
Have a seat.

179
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,340
What was that? What are they doing?

180
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,930
Hey. Have you been to
Han Ji-woo's place recently?

181
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,830
No, why?

182
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,730
It's nothing. I'll ask him myself.

183
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,170
Do you know how many excuses I made
to avoid eating with Reporter Park?

184
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,980
He's so talkative.

185
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,290
Stay here. That woman is a reporter.

186
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,480
Hold on.

187
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,110
Why are you hiding me?
This has nothing to do with you.

188
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,330
Regardless of what it is, if there is
trouble, it affects our business.

189
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,010
Hold on. Then stay with me.

190
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,330
Why should I?

191
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,050
I left my phone.

192
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,420
I don't have my cellphone.

193
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,190
What is this? Where's Han Ji-woo?

194
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,660
Is he still in the restroom?

195
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,590
Didn't you see him earlier?

196
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,000
They both left.

197
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,410
He left?

198
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,080
Yes.

199
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,970
Why are you looking for him?

200
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,080
I have something to ask him.

201
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,130
Why did you come here?

202
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,020
Here me out.

203
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,400
I had a dream where I made a video
about cooking,

204
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,030
and my fans really liked it.

205
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,280
It got a lot of views too. That's why

206
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,870
I want to do it for real.

207
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,290
Why are you telling me that?

208
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,310
I need to do it with you.

209
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,130
You said you need a part-timer.
I'll get a job here.

210
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,390
You don't have to pay me.

211
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,870
I'm sorry. This isn't my restaurant.
I'm just an employee here.

212
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,250
-I need to go out and work.
-Hold on.

213
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,800
I came all the way here to tell you this.

214
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,430
It's none of my business.

215
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,950
Whose is this?

216
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,040
Help me out.

217
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,280
I'm always bored being by myself.

218
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,230
I need a different skill too.

219
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,100
It's not an easy job that you can start

220
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,350
out of curiosity.

221
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,290
I didn't think that it would be easy.

222
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,860
Making something delicious for someone

223
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,970
seemed really cool.

224
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,720
It's probably mine.

225
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,320
You've got to be kidding me.

226
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,870
Sis. Hold on.

227
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,380
"Sis"? Did you just call me "Sis"?

228
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,890
You are older than me. The toilet...

229
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,960
The toilet is clogged.

230
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,480
It's been clogged ever since
Ji-woo went in there earlier.

231
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,210
You should use
the restroom somewhere else.

232
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,010
Gosh.

233
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,760
As you can see, I'm Kang Seo-jun.

234
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,390
It's nice to meet you.

235
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:15,860
(To My Star)
