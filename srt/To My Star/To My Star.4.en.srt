1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,960
(Kong Jae-hyun as Kim Hyung-ki,
Chun Jae-young as Kim Pil-hyun)

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,100
(Jin-kwon as Baek Ho-min,
Han Ji-won as Lee Yoon-seul)

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,470
(Kimg Kang-min as Han Ji-woo)

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,150
(Son Woo-hyun as Kang Seo-jun)

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:30,300
(To My Star)

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,070
By the way, are you okay?

7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,910
What do you mean?

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,740
You know, Kang Seo-jun
might be violent like the news said.

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,430
It won't matter if I keep my distance.

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,560
Give him a job here!

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,510
Then, he'll do the interview with me
to give his side of the story!

12
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,630
What? How did she manage that?

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,010
Why did you hide it from us?

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,850
I know, right?

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,200
Goodness.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,180
What?

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,590
What did you tell Yoon-seul?

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,240
If people found out I worked here
after clearing up the misunderstanding,

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,530
that would be a huge story!

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,470
Right. Sure.

21
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,270
You'll hurt your fingers.
Bend your fingers like this.

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,170
Push down the knife smoothly
like you're drawing.

23
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,530
Gosh. When you raise the knife back up,

24
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,990
follow the same path of pushing it down.

25
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,250
Like this?

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,620
Like this?

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,520
Just like this, I cut a carrot.

28
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,960
-Is this fun for you?
-Totally.

29
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,690
Sir.

30
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,130
(-Get your order.)
-Still having fun?

31
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,020
(Get your order.)

32
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,759
(-Get your order.)
-I told you we'd be busy.

33
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,720
Hello.

34
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,610
You can sit wherever you want.

35
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,500
Give me some shredded cheese.

36
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,990
Okay.

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,449
Cheese...

38
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,640
-Here's your cheese.
-Pack the food in advance.

39
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,280
-Yes, chef.
-Thanks.

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,700
Hello.

41
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,460
Hello. Get the takeout container.

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,790
Please sit here.

43
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,550
-Are you giving me a hard time on purpose?
-No way. This is what we do here.

44
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,910
Give them the menus.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,100
Gosh.

46
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,650
-Water, please.
-Okay.

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,020
Hello.

48
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,100
-Hello. Here you go.
-I want some pickles, please.

49
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,640
- What would you like?
-Okay.

50
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,540
-Seok-jung.
-Yes. The pickles?

51
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,840
I need to wipe here, right? Okay.

52
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,010
Empty out the trash cans here,
restock the soap,

53
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,870
wipe the mirror,
and dry the basin with a towel.

54
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,670
Here you go.

55
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,210
Wait.

56
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,770
You're giving me a hard time on purpose.

57
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,620
I'm not that petty.

58
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,910
Come on.

59
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,060
You already seem pretty cozy with him.

60
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,090
He's not shy around people at all.

61
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,760
So it just looks like that.

62
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,210
I'll take out the trash.

63
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,440
Get in.

64
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,420
-I'm good.
-Why not?

65
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,010
I'll take the bus.

66
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,740
Wait. Hold on. Wait a second.

67
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,850
What's the point?

68
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,370
Put that on.

69
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,810
Okay. You gave me a lot of work today.

70
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,500
But I'll still give you a ride.

71
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,570
Gosh. I'm such a nice guy.

72
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,670
There you go.

73
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,290
Good job today.

74
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,090
Get home safely.

75
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,720
You too. Have a good night.

76
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,700
Get home safely.

77
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,659
Boomer, hold on tight.

78
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,640
Hello?

79
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,110
Yes.

80
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,470
Get off.

81
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,510
This isn't home.

82
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,890
I haven't been out for a while.

83
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,050
Gosh. You always do whatever you want.

84
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,160
It seems all you ever do is work.
That's why I brought you here.

85
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,000
Sure. Of course.

86
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,480
Let's go.

87
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,930
Where are we?

88
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,110
Here?

89
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,360
This is my favorite spot.

90
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,660
Why?

91
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,280
It's pretty.

92
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,450
And there aren't a lot of people here.

93
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,430
This is nice.

94
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,120
Your restaurant is doing pretty well.

95
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,750
Is it because the food is good?

96
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,520
The restaurant is at a good location,

97
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,370
but we have a long way to go.

98
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,300
We rest more than we cook.

99
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,909
By the way,

100
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,120
how long have you been living on your own?

101
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,400
Since high school.

102
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,140
Then, did you want to become a chef
since high school?

103
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,850
I tried it out for a bit. And I had
the most fun with cooking, so that's why.

104
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,100
Don't you act because it's fun for you?

105
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,260
Yes, that's right.

106
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,150
It's very stimulating too.

107
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,400
But that's everything.

108
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,860
At first, it's nice and interesting.

109
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,850
But once you get used to it,
it loses its sparkle.

110
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,680
And

111
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,540
love

112
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,409
becomes everything in life too.

113
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,830
I bet you've never dated a girl.

114
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,630
I have.

115
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,010
-You have?
-Yes, I have.

116
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,250
You have? Really?

117
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,240
Yes. You have.
I bet you've dated a lot of girls.

118
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,780
Gosh, I can see that.

119
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,190
You think I'm lying?

120
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,590
Want to play basketball?

121
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,630
We don't even have a ball.

122
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,610
There's always a ball
at a place like this.

123
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,330
If you beat me, I'll ignore
my suspicion and believe you.

124
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,610
Come on. I have dated...

125
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,300
Hey.

126
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,840
Fine. You win.

127
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,730
You've dated a lot of girls.

128
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,530
I made myself clear. I'm not driving.

129
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,020
Okay.

130
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,620
Gosh. I ended up drinking it.

131
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,230
I'm sorry. I had to drink it.

132
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,450
Fine. Drink it up.

133
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,920
But that's it.

134
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,620
I dig guys like you a lot.

135
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,300
Guys who put up a strong front.

136
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,770
They seem really strong, you know.

137
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,410
I didn't know I could see stars in Seoul.

138
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,930
They look like satellites.

139
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,190
Really? What's the difference.

140
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,740
I don't know.

141
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,020
Well, there's no way
we can see bright stars in Seoul.

142
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,340
Why not?

143
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,240
I heard we can see planets
or the North Star.

144
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,000
I heard satellites travel really quickly.

145
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,440
Maybe, they are not satellites.

146
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,730
Forget it. That's not important.

147
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,730
We can just look at them
and enjoy the view.

148
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,610
I want

149
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,480
to see space before I die. That's my wish.

150
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,740
And I think I'm very close
to fulfilling my wish.

151
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,210
-What? You already popped it.
-Yes.

152
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,480
Let's see if you did it right.

153
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,900
If you don't do it right,
it will leave a scar. Let me see.

154
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,980
It might leave...

155
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
I'll put this on.

156
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,080
Did you buy the pimple patch?

157
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,760
That's not the right spot.

158
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,300
It's right here.

159
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,920
You know,

160
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,180
it's a rare thing to find someone
you enjoy spending time with, right?

161
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,210
We should try to get along.

162
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,690
You still don't like me?

163
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,870
Come on, let's try to get along.

164
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,230
Drop the honorifics too.

165
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,860
Don't you already have a lot of friends?

166
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,200
I didn't say we should be friends.

167
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,470
Well, friends get along well.
So I guess we can be friends.

168
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,380
Let's go. It's cold.

169
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,560
You dropped the honorifics right away.
Let's go.

170
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,930
Do you guys have a day off?

171
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,260
-Yes, we do.
- When?

172
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,160
-Why do you ask?
-I ought to know too.

173
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,440
I'm a part-timer there.

174
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,290
Every Monday.

175
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,010
Then, teach me
how to make gimbap on Monday.

176
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,640
Why?

177
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,190
That's such a homey dish.

178
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,770

179
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,570
