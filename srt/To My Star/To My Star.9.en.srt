00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,960
(Kong Jae-hyun as Kim Hyung-ki,
Chun Jae-young as Kim Pil-hyun)

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,110
(Jin-kwon as Baek Ho-min,
Han Ji-won as Lee Yoon-seul)

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,470
(Kim Kang-min as Han Ji-woo)

00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,150
(Son Woo-hyun as Kang Seo-jun)

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,270
(To My Star)

6
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,390
I'll think about you
whenever I eat this dish.

7
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,180
What? Whatever.

8
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,630
By the way,

9
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,840
the space on the wall

10
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,259
was for me, right?

11
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,160
No.

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,830
Like I'm going to believe that.

13
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,320
There's a pimple in the same spot.

14
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,610
I told you I'd squeeze it for you.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Gosh, come on. Focus on recycling.

16
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,180
Wait.

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,560
-Hold on.
-Gosh.

18
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,039
It's like I'm dreaming.

19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,380
Why?

20
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,509
How did you know about the photo?

21
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,380
The reporter who took the photo told me.

22
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,490
I see.

23
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,230
Everything is taken care of.

24
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,360
Let's just think about us now.

25
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,220
I'm sleepy.

26
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,300
Have you lost your mind?

27
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,420
Yes, I am.

28
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,410
He has 10 billion won. What's so bad
about taking 100 million won?

29
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,910
Hearing you say that is ruining
whatever friendship we had left.

30
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,250
So tell me. Are you happy
to get a big payout like that?

31
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,200
Are you happy with yourself?

32
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,550
Exactly.

33
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,760
I should be.

34
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,060
Unbelievable.

35
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,610
Think about why you are still miserable
after getting that much money from him.

36
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,920
If you figured that out,
you wouldn't have called me.

37
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,760
Why did you want to come here again?

38
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,330
So I could ask you again.
Properly, this time.

39
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,600
I know I'm being selfish,

40
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,930
but if it's okay with you,

41
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,850
I want to keep living with you.

42
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,970
And as long as you're on board,

43
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,310
I don't care if people find out.

44
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,810
Why are you rushing?

45
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,909
If we like each other,
we can continue to be together.

46
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,810
And if not, then we don't.

47
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,890
What is this?

48
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,400
You say that now
after you played hard-to-get?

49
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,710
I didn't want to get hurt again.

50
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,230
And I didn't want to hurt you either.

51
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,820
But staying away from each other
doesn't prevent getting hurt either.

52
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,890
So you have dated before.

53
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,220
I told you I have.

54
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,980
With how many people?

55
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,960
Is that important?

56
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,250
Of course. I haven't been
in many relationships.

57
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,920
Liar.

58
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,280
See? You're dismissing me again.

59
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,320
Whenever you do that,
I'm disappointed. That hurts. Okay?

60
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,659
I just express my feelings a lot.

61
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,340
Is that a crime? Is it?

62
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,159
Fine. That's what I find
attractive about you.

63
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,800
I'll do better

64
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,440
because I know that falling in love

65
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,350
is a rarity in this world.

66
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,450
Let's go. It's cold.

67
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,640
Wait.

68
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,060
You always get up so quickly.

69
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,640
Wait for me.

70
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,580
Well,

71
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,920
can I sleep in your room tonight?

72
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,300
-No.
-Why not?

73
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,980
I don't like sleeping with people.

74
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,410
Wait.

75
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,790
But I like that.

76
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,340
I like that.

77
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,800
I like it.

78
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,409
I like it. Please?

79
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,390
Let's sleep together.

80
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,900
Are you all ready?

81
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,250
You're here.

82
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,630
What's that?

83
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,990
Presents from your fans.

84
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,610
When will you go back home?

85
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,980
Home?

86
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,590
Home? My gosh.

87
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,130
Yes.

88
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,730
Okay. I'm on my way now.

89
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,920
What?

90
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,250
I didn't know you came back.

91
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,740
I'll wire the deposit back to you.

92
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,290
We're planning to live here together.

93
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,070
Congratulations, Seo-jun.

94
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,260
Thanks.

95
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,590
I'll be at the restaurant.

96
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,040
Why?

97
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,150
I should go and get my things.

98
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,040
Call me if something happens.

99
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,020
Okay.

100
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,030
You're giving me a headache.

101
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,730
Despite the low budget for the project,

102
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,930
when we heard that you were joining,

103
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,700
all of us were pleasantly surprised.

104
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,820
We just assumed that
you would choose to star

105
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,150
in Director Bong Chan-wook's
upcoming movie, "Pest".

106
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,150
Well, that's a great project as well.

107
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,870
But the story I want to tell

108
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,600
is from your project.

109
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,980
Thank you.

110
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,750
This won't be an easy project.

111
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,160
But I hope we do well together.

112
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,570
I'll do my best.

113
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,700
It was difficult for the agency
to support this decision,

114
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,150
but he was very firm about it.

115
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,410
Please take good care of my actor.

116
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,860
Of course.

117
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,490
-Let's work well together.
-Sure.

118
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,350
What is this?

119
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,720
How can you be so brazen
when you're dirt-poor?

120
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,510
I should say that to you.

121
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,720
You should keep your mouth shut
even if I punch you now.

122
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,080
See?

123
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,190
Why won't you let me win?

124
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,790
It's obvious
that I have it better than you.

125
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,870
But why do you keep bothering me?

126
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,490
What? What is it?

127
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,850
Is that how I seem to you?

128
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,810
What?

129
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,650
Why are you closing down the restaurant
after the stunt you pulled?

130
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,240
I'll return the money.

131
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,610
Just give me some time.

132
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,780
I know we can't pretend it never happened.

133
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,770
I'm glad to hear that.

134
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,120
Like you said we can't pretend
that it never happened,

135
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,180
but we can still go back to where we were.

136
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,810
Where we were?

137
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,290
What does that mean?

138
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,190
I just wanted to be friends with you.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360
I wouldn't have been

140
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,330
able to run this restaurant without you.

141
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,990
Take care.

142
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,270
(Where are you?)

143
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,460
(Are you okay?)

144
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,090
(Why aren't you home?)

145
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,850
(Did something happen?)

146
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,560
You too.

147
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,310
(What's taking so long?)

148
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,110
(Kang Seo-jun: What's taking so long?)

149
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,120
Do you want to be the CEO?

150
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,710
Pardon?

151
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
Life is so hard.

152
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,540
Mr. Kim.

153
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,570
What brings you here again?

154
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,220
She said she was your school friend.

155
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,260
This is probably my last time here.

156
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,030
I'll see you in front of
your father's house if I can.

157
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,460
Are you going back to the city desk?

158
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,530
-Yes.
-Congratulations.

159
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,730
You guys kind of grew on me.

160
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,430
It's my farewell.

161
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,130
My drinking buddies are goners.

162
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,720
Call me when you're drinking.

163
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,770
When are you available?

164
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,930
Well, tomorrow?

165
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,540
Sure. I'll call you tomorrow.

166
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,700
-Sure.
-Okay.

167
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,670
Really?

168
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,530
Yes. I'm calling her.

169
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,170
I'll go alone.

170
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,160
You know, something was gnawing at me.

171
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,990
I can't trust these people
who studied abroad.

172
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,630
Gosh, what a hassle.

173
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,880
This is so annoying. I'm so angry.

174
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,210
-What do you want?
-What do you think?

175
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,970
I'm so stressed.

176
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,700
You'd better get away
from Seo-jun and Ji-woo.

177
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,740
And that money? That ainâ€™t yours.

178
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,600
I know. I messed up everything.

179
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,330
I was about to leave!

180
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,260
Right.

181
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,680
Let's say it is all my fault.

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,190
Is that what you want?

183
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,510
What? I can speak English too.

184
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,540
I studied abroad!

185
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,660
Sir.

186
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,150
Isn't it too early
to clean the restaurant?

187
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,610
Did the restaurant go under?

188
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,700
Gosh. I came back for my job.

189
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,200
Min-seok.

190
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,380
Do you think I'm a joke too?

191
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,940
Did the interview go well?

192
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,700
Yes.

193
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,090
I think I'm going to start
working next week.

194
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,180
How about this?

195
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,480
Do you want me to open
a restaurant for you?

196
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,060
You and your nonsense again.

197
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,560
Goodness. Was I talking nonsense?

198
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,370
Was I talking nonsense?

199
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,750
I told you to stop treating me like a baby.

200
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,660
But you are younger than me.

201
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,390
You're so funny. You are younger than me.

202
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,990
Gosh. Are you asking me to play?

203
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,970
"Play"?

204
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,390
Play what?

205
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,470
Jujitsu?

206
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,870
I'm not sure.

207
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,220
Let's find out.

208
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,100
(Thank you for being our stars,
albeit for a brief moment.)

209
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:01,390
(To My Star)

210
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,190
(To My Star)
