Hello!

00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,490
I am Son Woo Hyun, who took the role of “Kang Seo Jun” in “To My Star.”

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,080

[Q. What was your first impression of shooting?]

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,540
I felt very excited and looked forward to it.

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,470
I actually really enjoyed the script reading.

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,430
And I feel like those same feelings and energy

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,140
are brought out on set,

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,770
so the shooting was very enjoyable.

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,210
- Cut!
- It's a cut!

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,290
[Cut? Why?]

15

- Why?
- I haven't gone yet...

[Q. What kind of character is Kang Seo Joon?]
- My character, Kang Seo Joon,

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,520
is a top star.

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,670
He is a top star who enjoys many things.

I start to change.

[Q. What kind of character is Han Ji Woo?]

27
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,090
Well, my dear Ji Woo is...

28
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,660
He is a boy who has been fending for himself and lived alone since he was young.

29
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,010
Because of that, he lacks social skills a bit.

30
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,120
He doesn't know how to approach others,

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,140
is a bit cold, and not affectionate.

32
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,130

Hey!

36
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,830
Don't you have any other clothes?

37
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,860
What's this?

38
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,510
Is that a Go board or what?

[Director: Hahaha]
[Ji Woo: (Sulky)]

[Clap, Clap]

43
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,290
Today's shooting has gone well, and everyone stayed safe.

44
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,120
Please tell us how you feel.

45
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,380
It feels like we only started one hour ago.

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,990
I feel sad thinking it's already the last cut.

47
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,830
I'm sure it's all thanks to the director.

[Top level social skills]
[Impressed]

Great social skills.
[Embarrassed, LOL]

50
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,740
I have no doubt

51
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,200
he will become successful.

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,830
And lastly,

53

let's wish good luck to "To My Star."

[Yup.]

Cut!

60
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,490
Hello,

61
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,370
I am Han Ji Won, playing Yoon Seul

62
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,120
in "To My Star."

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,690
[Q. Please introduce your character!]

64
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,060
Yoon Seul is a very obstinate reporter.

65
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,260
She used to work at the local news but transferred to the entertainment division.

66
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,940
She is diligent in digging into cases to bring out the truth.

67
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,800
This is the kind of reporter she is.

68
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,620
Action!

69
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,460
[Working hard on covering a case.]

70
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,240
[Q. Your impression of the first shooting?]

71
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,160
Well, I was worried and nervous

72
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,310
because it's the first shoot.

73
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,690
But the atmosphere on-site and with the director was great,

74
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,160
so I think we are doing a good job.

75
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,230
Since Yoon Seul is a reporter,

76
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,220
you can use your phone or something to act like you are taking notes.

77
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,430
[Oooh!]
[Amazed]

79
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,280
Is this product placement?

[This is not a product placement... Hahaha]

81

who plays Pil Hyun in "To My Star."

83
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,390
Thank you for your care.

84
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,150
[Q. What kind of character is Pil Hyun?]

85
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,130
In "To My Star,"

86
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,260
Pil Hyun is someone who is very firm even with himself.

87
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,030
He strongly hopes to be acknowledged

88
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,720
by others around him.

89
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,590
He wants to be approved

90
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,440
and not to be looked down on.

91
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,640
This desire is quite strong with him.

92

I'm Kim Pil Hyun!

93
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,520
[Q. Why does he have the same name as your role in previous work?]

94
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,660
I think Pil Hyun from "Where Your Eyes Linger"

95
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,290
and Pil Hyun from "To My Star"

96
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,330
are connected in some aspects.

97
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,310
I think that's why it felt so original and fun

98
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,390
to prepare for the role in this series.

99
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,570
[Q. One last word?]

100
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,210
I am very happy to be filming with great people.

101
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,030
The production team,

102
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,520
the staff, and the actors

103
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,250
are all working hard on this work,

104
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,320
so we hope many viewers will watch it.

105
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,490
I don't know, but for now...

106
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,220
Yes, like that.

107
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,030
- I'll go this way.
- Okay.

108
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,770

109
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,490
I am Kong Jae Hyun,

who plays Hyung Ki in "To My Star."

111

[Q. Please introduce your character!]

112
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,610
The character I am playing, Hyung Ki,

113
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,430
is someone who lives in a different world

114
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,750
from Ji Woo and Seo Jun's.

115
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,140
Compared to Ji Woo and Seo Jun's star-like nature,

116
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,020
I think he is more down-to-earth

117
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,250
and more human.

118
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,530
He gets easily jealous and has an inferiority complex.

119
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,150
He has very low confidence in himself

120
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,230
and struggles on his own

121

trying to live his life.

122

When you look at him,

123
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,430
you might pity him

124
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,500
or hate him.

He is the best driver.

136

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,930
- You spoke well.
- Not at all.

168
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,890
I guess it's because you work

169
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,400
as a member of NewKidd.

170
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,650
Normally, I mean,

171
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,590
I also had a hard time and stammered.

172
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,620
But you were really good at speaking.

173
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,740
- And lastly.
- Yes.

174
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,260
Then...

175
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,020
Your determination.

176
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,030
- Determination?
- There are a few episodes still left to shoot.

177
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,250
- That's right.
- Please say a word about your determination.

178
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,520
I will work hard!

179
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,330
- I will work hard. Good luck!
- Yes, Good luck!

180
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,590
It isn't a bad deal.

181
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,440
You rent this place monthly, anyway.

182
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,600
- It's the next scene?
- We're ready here!

183
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,300
Did you bring the GoPro?

184
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,850
Do I smell? Wait.

185
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,670
Hello...

186
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,620
- It's a video?
- Cutie boy.

187
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,580
Ah, it's a video.

188
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,060
Then, Miss Director,

189
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,480
please tell us how the scene was just now.
[Shakes head in refusal]

190
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,190
- The cut just ended...
- Yes.
[Runs away]

191
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,310
Why are you running away?

192
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,370
The director...

193
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,490
seems to have nothing to add.

194
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,190
Are you making coffee?

195
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,570
Ah, yes.

196
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,350
I'm a chef, after all.

197
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,240
I make coffee as well as a barista would.
[Dignity of a Chef]

198
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,790
[Laughs at what he said himself]

199
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,040
Hello, this is Kang Seo Joon's

200
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,860
Cook-Cook lesson.

201
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,750
Today, we'll be making

202
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,420
egg kimbap together.

203
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,800
Why did you make this?

204
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,090
This is a knife.

205
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,460
It's very sharp, isn't it? I should be careful.

206
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,750
A knife and—

207
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,750
We'll be having lunch after this scene!

208
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,150
They said we'll have lunch after this scene.

209
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,890
This is very good news.

210
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,920
[Look at his stream of consciousness, LOL]

211
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Take two.

212
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,430
Ready.

213
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,510
Action!

214
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,600
So just say what you have to say!

215
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,120
Listen carefully while I'm being nice.

216
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,860
[Q. What are you filming today?]
- Today? Well,

217
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,230
we're filming Seo Joon and In Woo's...

218
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,560
I'm In Woo, by the way.

219
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,360
And with Seo Joon, we're...

220
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,090
we're filming a scene

221
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,630
with a strong emotional confrontation.

222
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,400
We'll do well.

223
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,490
- We're done here!
- Yes!

224
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,300
[Moving to the outdoor scene!]

225
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,430
At that time, the drink was already empty.

226
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,240
Goodbye!
[In Woo is going home]

227
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,650
Wait a second.

228
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,780
Today...

229
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,770
this is actor Jo Han Joon who plays In Woo.

230
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,160
It's a pity, but because he only has one scene, an important scene...

231
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,480
[Yoon Seul grabbing the attention at the back, LOL]

232
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,660
His shooting ended well and he is now going back home.

233
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,730
Please say a few words about your impressions on the shoot today.

234
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,790
Quiet!
[Assistant director]

235
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,230
Sorry.

236
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,770
You've just finished filming an important scene.

237
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,820
It's your first and last shoot,

238
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,770
so please tell us how you feel.

239
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,360
They are filming right next to us,

240
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,880
so I have to speak quietly.

241
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,750
The staff, director,

242
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,490
and everyone really treated me so well.

243
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,390
I felt grateful while filming.

244
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,140
Really.

245
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,870
You worked hard.

246
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,690
He did really well. You've worked hard.

247
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,560
Now let's wish good luck to "To My Star."

248
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,000
It's a short series,

249
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,860
- but it's that much more impactful.
- but please enjoy watching.

250
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,730
"To My Star"...

251
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,290
Good luck!

252
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,020
- You worked hard.
- Thanks, bye.

253
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,370
What? Why?

254
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,920
5-1A, cut 6, take 1.

255
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,570
Ready!

256
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,550
Action!

257
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,190
Hello, we are here today to film the fifth episode.

258
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,730
How do you feel today?

259
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,380
I told you earlier...

260
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,490
You did?

261
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,520
How do I feel today? Really good.

262
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,360
I slept well last night.

263
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,660
Thanks to our director,

264
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,290
Hwang Da Seul, who always livens us up,

265
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,470
I'm full of energy.
[Top level social skills as usual.]

[Some dust]
[Seo Joon's good manners.gif]

267
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,040
What is this?

268
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,800
Actually,

269
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,590
this is me.

270
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,150
It's Kang Seo Joon.

271
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,690
[I want it...]

272
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,430
Since Seo Joon

273
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,920
is very narcissistic,

274
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,100
his phone case is full of self-love.

275
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,480
Seo Joon's phone case

276
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,370
has his own avatar on it.

277
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,290
I guess his fans made it for him.

278
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,590
We'll start now!

279
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,730

- Good luck.
- Good luck!

282
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,400
5-10A, cut 4, take 1!

283
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,220
Ready!

284
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,130
Action!

285
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,660
You're scaring me.

286
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,060
By the way...

[The shooting goes on into the night]

288
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,190
No! Eat it! Swallow it!

289
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,250
Throw up here, I'll clean it up.

290
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,320
Today,

291
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,700
it's the first time we are working together

292
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,340
since the script reading.

293
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,090
Please tell us how you feel.
[He's become a full-fledged making-of emcee now]

294
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,160
He leads me well

295
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,570
and he is very considerate.

296
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,060
So it's been...

297
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,730
- very comfortable and fun shooting with him.
- Wait.

298
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,370
I didn't ask just to hear that, you know.

299
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,460
He's worked very hard.

300
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,320
He put in a lot of work today.

301
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,390
We'll end it by wishing good luck

302
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,850
to "To My Star."

303
