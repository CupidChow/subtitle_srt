1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,960
(Kong Jae-hyun as Kim Hyung-ki,
Chun Jae-young as Kim Pil-hyun)

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,110
(Jin-kwon as Baek Ho-min,
Han Ji-won as Lee Yoon-seul)

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,470
(Kim Kang-min as Han Ji-woo)

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,150
(Son Woo-hyun as Kang Seo-jun)

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,260
(To My Star)

6
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,390
I saw someone

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,220
hanging about the restaurant,
so I went and grabbed the camera.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,900
So why are you showing me this?

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,170
My father's company went under.

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,510
They took our house.

11
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,030
I'm the only one
who has a job in my family.

12
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,270
So what?

13
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,610
I took out a loan with the restaurant
as collateral.

14
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,980
And I'm about to lose this restaurant.

15
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,220
And Kang Seo-jun has a lot of money.

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,830
He even said how
he fixes problems with money.

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,640
I'll take this picture to him
and ask him for money.

18
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,090
Are you

19
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,030
serious right now?

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,580
I'm sure you don't want
to lose this restaurant either.

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,570
You came up with all of the recipes.

22
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,920
If you start at a new restaurant,
you'll have to start from the bottom.

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,400
So you're asking me to join you,
extorting money out of him?

24
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,940
You're just taking the easy way out.

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,850
You don't mean it, right?

26
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,050
Come on,
you can't possibly want to do this.

27
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:43,170
You make me sound like
the worst person on Earth.

28
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,370
Hey, do you think you're some hotshot chef
because you're rolling with Kang Seo-jun?

29
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,240
Come to your senses, you scumbag.

30
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,070
If I didn't stop this,
people would have found out anyway.

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,220
Then, people would be shaming you.

32
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,260
And your life would be over
after you hit rock bottom. Got that?

33
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,470
Ji-woo.

34
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,120
We've known each other for a long time.

35
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,930
He doesn't mean anything to you.

36
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,650
Right?

37
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,570
How could you say that to me?

38
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,880
(When I thought about it,)

39
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,460
(it was disgusting.)

40
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,840
What?

41
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,740
What happened with you

42
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,600
disgusted me when I thought about it.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,100
Wait.

44
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,650
That doesn't make sense.

45
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,850
Something happened, right?

46
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,280
If I stay with you,

47
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,090
I might find myself in trouble.

48
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,610
What? What's going on?

49
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,690
Can I get my deposit back?

50
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,600
Hey.

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,450
Are you okay, Seo-jun?

52
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,360
You know I take birthday parties
very seriously, right?

53
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,760
But I'm not in the mood to celebrate.

54
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,650
So go out and have fun without me.

55
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,820
What are you talking about? No.
We'll stay with you.

56
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,100
Do that for me.

57
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,329
And

58
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,510
I don't want to waste food.

59
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,840
Can you guys take the food with you?

60
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,490
(The person you have reached
is unavailable.)

61
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,470
(You'll be directed to a voicemail box.)

62
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,030
Who is it?

63
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,990
(Hello. This is So-yeon
from Vaspatch, USA.)

64
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,100
(I came here to apologize to you.)

65
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,920
(I just wanted to be updated
about how you're doing.)

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,980
But something happened.

67
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,110
Something bad happened, actually.

68
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,620
(Italian Restaurant)

69
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,540
Hello?

70
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,440
Why is the restaurant closed?

71
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,990
(Isn't Ji-woo there?)

72
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,540
No, he's not here.

73
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,900
You're here.

74
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,220
Hey.

75
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,370
What on earth happened?

76
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,620
Do you know anything?

77
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,690
Gosh. I'm sure something
happened between them.

78
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:59,470
I guess something bad happened.

79
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,970
Is Mr. Han Ji-woo
really going to move out?

80
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,560
Yes.

81
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,890
I guess something urgent came up.

82
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,130
He asked for his deposit,
so I wired it this morning.

83
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,560
I thought his parents asked you
to put him up in that house.

84
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,680
Gosh, whatever.

85
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,780
He hates owing people, so it was
hard to convince him to move in there.

86
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,890
Look at this mess now.

87
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,920
Where are you?

88
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,940
(Where are you?)

89
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,930
I can't promise you,

90
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,530
but I'll try to wire you 20 million won.

91
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,510
Do what you need to do with that.

92
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,280
Is it from Kang Seo-jun?

93
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,660
It doesn't matter
where the money came from.

94
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,370
I don't want your money.

95
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,220
Why not?

96
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,940
Because I'm poorer than you?

97
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,140
I'm doing this, so I can save
the restaurant and you.

98
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,640
Don't use me as an excuse.
If you want to do it, own it.

99
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,200
You can get a job
with your resume and career.

100
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,600
Am I wrong?

101
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,640
When will I pay back all the debt
with chicken feed salary?

102
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,970
I didn't want to do this either.

103
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,130
That's not an excuse.

104
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,210
Kang Seo-jun called me.

105
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,280
What?

106
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,390
He knew everything.

107
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,570
You didn't have to come.

108
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,730
You don't own a house.

109
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,400
But I do.

110
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,560
Being a villain requires a lot of work.
Good job with that.

111
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,580
As you know,

112
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,830
this isn't my first rodeo.

113
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,790
Where's the money?

114
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,200
Why would I bring that much money
in cash? I'm not some caveman.

115
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,810
Seo-jun.

116
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,410
What?

117
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,430
I'll handle this.

118
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,530
Done.

119
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,330
If you still leak the photo
after this payout,

120
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,490
I won't let this slide.

121
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,920
Hop on.

122
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,180
No.

123
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,590
Wait.

124
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,980
Please.

125
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,270
Let's talk at home.

126
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,450
Come home with me.

127
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,270
Where were you last night?

128
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,890
You didn't go to Ms. Lee's either.

129
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,340
Where's your stuff?

130
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,760
Give me the memory card.

131
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,830
I want to burn it.

132
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,550
You could have just told me.
Why did you leave like that?

133
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,320
I didn't want to
be some fodder for gossip.

134
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,860
I'm sorry.

135
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,340
I was doing fine before you came.
Why are you messing up my life?

136
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,110
I said I didn't want you
to toy with my life.

137
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,820
You're going to leave anyway.

138
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,480
You were just toying with me because
you were bored and I happened to be here.

139
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,130
Just stop it now. It's over.

140
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,610
Go find someone who suits you.

141
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,940
Don't play with me.

142
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,420
Everything is handled.

143
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,530
So you can move out now, right?

144
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,300
You can go back to your house.

145
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,520
I can't find a better house

146
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,210
than this with the rent I can afford.

147
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,770
I'm not playing around.

148
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,320
I'm serious.

149
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,640
Do you still want me to leave?

150
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,970
Yes.

151
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,630
Okay.

152
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,650
I thought about it, but I can't do it.

153
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,310
The thought of not having you in my life

154
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,820
breaks my heart.

155
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,760
I really don't want this to end.

156
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,270
Don't get me wrong. Just listen.

157
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,140
This all means

158
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,620
that you like me too?

159
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,250
That's what it sounds like to me.

160
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,170
Ji-woo.

161
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,720
If this is too hard for you,

162
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,930
I'll go to you.

163
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,480
(To My Star)

164
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,230
(To My Star)
