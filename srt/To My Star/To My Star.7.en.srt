1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,960
(Kong Jae-hyun as Kim Hyung-ki,
Chun Jae-young as Kim Pil-hyun)

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,110
(Jin-kwon as Baek Ho-min,
Han Ji-won as Lee Yoon-seul)

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,470
(Kim Kang-min as Han Ji-woo)

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,150
(Son Woo-hyun as Kang Seo-jun)

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,260
(To My Star)

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,020
I'm even more sure of myself
now that I'm looking at you.

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,670
I'm not joking around.

8
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,100
I want to kiss you
even when I'm not drunk.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,020
Go out with me.

10
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,980
Do you pity me?

11
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,410
-What?
-Do you pity me because

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,010
I have no money
and have to rely on other people.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,099
I'm sure Pil-hyun told you everything.

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,650
You're just like everyone else.
You're pitying me because my life is

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,840
such a struggle.

16
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,180
You know that it's not true.

17
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,479
You know that too.

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,270
I only thought about myself. I'm sorry.

19
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,050
I won't do that.

20
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,720
(No, you are. Say hello.)

21
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,600
(Please introduce yourself.)

22
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,540
(Forget it. Let's just cook.)

23
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,090
(Why not? You can do that for me.)

24
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,850
(I want to hear your introduction.)

25
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,740
(Introduce yourself. Please?)

26
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:25,970
(Then, I won't do this.)

27
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,060
(Cash and Cash)

28
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,120
(I want to celebrate
Pil-hyun's birthday today.)

29
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,660
(Can he come over today?)

30
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,440
(Yes, that's fine.)

31
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,980
(Actually, we have one more visitor.)

32
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,360
(I'll tell you who it is.
Have a good day at work.)

33
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,110
What's this?

34
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,910
It's nothing.

35
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,230
I can't go out thanks to somebody.

36
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,420
I hope this is okay.

37
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,190
Do you want some gimbap?

38
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,990
I made some killer rolls of gimbap.

39
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,300
Just get to the point.

40
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,380
You only showed up after I said
I might disclose the security footage.

41
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,840
But you said you wouldn't.

42
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,580
It won't help you either if it gets out.

43
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,250
Me?

44
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,970
Will it be worse than you?

45
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,330
Sit.

46
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,280
You weren't behind this.

47
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,830
It was the agency's idea, right?

48
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,800
I couldn't increase
my followers for the life of me.

49
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,840
After this incident, the number tripled.

50
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,110
Seo-jun.

51
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,410
You have everything.

52
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,760
You said acting became a routine
and you weren't sure.

53
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,910
You said you wanted to take a break.

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,930
That's why I was being civil.

55
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,760
I gave you

56
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,140
more leniency than you deserve.

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,890
I was in Nuridan when I was young.

58
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,620
It was some kind of a youth association.

59
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,640
And I played a game there.

60
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,850
Each team sent out one representative.

61
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,450
The winner had a chance to take stocks.

62
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,659
Although I already had
a lot of stocks by then,

63
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,490
I tried to win even the last game.

64
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,480
Why are you bringing that up?
Just get to the point.

65
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,640
Listen up when I'm being nice to you.

66
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,500
So I even won the last game.

67
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,410
The last team went bankrupt.

68
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,790
Had I let them take the win
for the last game,

69
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,400
that team of 10 would have
enough money to survive.

70
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,760
Just saying.

71
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,990
So here's the plan I have.

72
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,470
In-woo.

73
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,240
Your opinion matters here.

74
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,920
Should we say

75
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,780
both of us were engaged in the fight?

76
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,760
That it was mutual?

77
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,220
We don't have to bring in other people.

78
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,930
Seo-jun.

79
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,650
I finally got a chance to play the lead
for the first time

80
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,600
in my 10-year-acting career.

81
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,330
Can you help me out with this once?

82
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,920
A lot of people still
want to offer you roles.

83
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,260
Can you just lie low for a bit?

84
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,030
You'll still be where you are
once you come back.

85
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,560
I don't know why I lied.
I guess I was just

86
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,040
desperate.

87
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,970
Can you share your fame?

88
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,340
Come on, let's do that.

89
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,500
I'm sure you can do that.

90
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,610
In-woo.

91
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,950
You must know that

92
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,080
it wasn't easy to get to where I am.

93
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,260
I'm glad

94
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,410
that you're awful to the end.

95
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,720
Yes. I'm done talking to him. Send it.

96
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,050
Okay. Fine.

97
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,220
Let's do what you said.

98
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,900
Let's go with your plan.

99
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,190
But can you make it sound like
I punched you less?

100
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,830
Yes. Send it now.

101
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,210
Hey!

102
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,110
Gosh. Darn it.

103
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,970
Kang Seo-jun.

104
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,669
Why are you doing this to me?

105
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,400
You wanted to cover it up.

106
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,920
You wanted to make it look like
it was no big deal.

107
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,170
You said you didn't want to disclose it.

108
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,350
Hey, In-woo.

109
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,750
My fans have been miserable
because of you.

110
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,690
I have no mercy for you now.

111
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,890
No. Seo-jun.

112
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,670
Whatever you did, you should've left
other people out of this.

113
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,440
Leave.

114
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,570
I don't like you anymore.

115
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,310
(The email has been sent.)

116
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,080
(-That's him. I think it's him.
-He's really bad at acting.)

117
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,130
(He's not even
that good-looking in person.)

118
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,560
(The security footage of the restaurant
has been disclosed.)

119
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,660
(Actor Yang's statement regarding
the assault has been proven false.)

120
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,860
(When Yang was asked about his injuries,)

121
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,150
(he said he lied
in the heat of the moment.)

122
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,880
(He expressed his deepest regret
for his action.)

123
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,870
(But the public has
a negative opinion of the actor.)

124
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,380
How did you talk him into disclosing it?

125
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,490
He won't even listen to me.

126
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,160
A bit of sincerity goes a long way.

127
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,300
Between the two of us,
I'm the sincere one.

128
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,190
Guys, please stop fighting.

129
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,620
Sorry. I have a lot on my plate right now.

130
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,400
Seo-jun

131
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,170
went through this all by himself.

132
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,170
He said he got better.

133
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,810
Isn't today your birthday?

134
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,710
I hope this sweet drink helps.

135
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,350
Gosh.

136
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,430
I have a lot of stories about this.

137
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,800
How did you know?

138
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,990
(He said he lied
in the heat of the moment.)

139
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,580
(He expressed his deepest regret for)

140
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,220
(-his action. But...)
-At least, Seo-jun dodged a bullet.

141
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,760
What's your point?

142
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,350
I don't want us to be in trouble either.

143
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,900
You should thank me.

144
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,400
Happy birthday, Pil-hyun.

145
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,340
That startled me. Gosh.

146
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,210
Thanks.

147
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,370
Don't look at me like that. Okay?

148
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,830
I don't appreciate that gaze.

149
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,290
When did it start?

150
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,490
Why didn't you tell us?

151
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,650
I've been getting treatment.

152
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,710
I didn't want you to worry.

153
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,790
I'm so disappointed.
You should've told me at least.

154
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,800
Well, I just need to stay away from
glass-breaking sounds. I'll be okay then.

155
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,040
Let's eat. What do you want?

156
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,020
Should we drink wine today?

157
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,430
What's going on?

158
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,960
When you're overwhelmed,

159
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,080
when you're shy, or when you lie,

160
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,680
you said a hug would solve everything.

161
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,020
Let's keep the group hug going.

162
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,100
And I never doubted you.

163
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,290
Same here!

164
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,640
You guys emphasizing that
makes it sound suspicious.

165
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,730
-♫ Happy birthday to you ♫
-♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

166
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,700
Open your eyes.

167
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,860
-♫ Happy birthday to you ♫
-♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

168
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,910
What's up with the cake?

169
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,720
- ♫ Dear Pil-hyun ♫
- ♫ Dear Pil-hyun ♫

170
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,770
I learned it from Ji-woo.

171
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,240
-♫ Happy birthday to you ♫
-♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

172
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,060
You said it was delicious.
It's a special day.

173
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,410
Okay! Drop the beat.

174
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,260
Are you mad?

175
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,120
I didn't mean to have such a rowdy party.

176
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,710
We had a lot to celebrate today.

177
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,900
I don't care. I'm moving out.

178
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,590
Why all of a sudden?

179
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,970
Hey, Ji-woo.

180
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,760
What are you talking about?
Why are you doing this?

181
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,160
When I thought about it,
it was disgusting.

182
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,530
What?

183
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,440
What happened with you

184
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,340
disgusted me when I thought about it.

185
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,800
Wait.

186
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,400
That doesn't make sense.

187
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,600
Something happened, right?

188
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,020
If I stay with you,

189
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,790
I might find myself in trouble.

190
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,300
(To My Star)

191
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:01,090
(To My Star)
