Give me your bag.

00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,250
I couldn't even drink water.

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,790
It's in the car. Get in.

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,500
Where's my car?

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,490
Given the circumstance,
you want to stay under the radar.

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,840
Just get in before the reporters get here.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360

-Sorry.)

Mr. Kang!

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,590
Is that Kang Seo-jun?
Did he get a new car?

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,320
The driver. I think
he was Kang Seo-jun's manager.

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,220
Is he? Probably, he is.

27
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,590
They knew we were here, right?

28

Did you read the article?

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,780
No.

32
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,850
But I'm sure it's awful. Right?

33
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,410
Yes. Totally.

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,580
I'll drive us to the office
before reporters swarm in.

35
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,340
I need to use the restroom first.

36
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,670
What if people recognize you
in the restroom

37
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,080
and take photos of you?

38
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,200
Gosh. But I can't just go in front of you.

39
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,650
I'll find one.

40
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,830
I don't think we can find
a restroom nearby.

41
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,190
You can't use the one in the subway.

Hello.

I'm sorry. But we're not open yet.

46
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,030
I'm in a hurry.

47
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,840
Can you cook a tasty dish
that comes out fast?

48
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,510
Thank you.

49
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,140
It's my routine in the morning.

50
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,410
Okay. I thought this would be
a nice breakfast dish.

51
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,710
I see. Okay. How much is it?

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,079
-It's 13,000 won.
-It's 13,000 won.

53
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,130
Here.

54
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,670
Did you have breakfast?

55
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,579
-No.
-You should have that.

56
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,380
I don't like eggs.

57
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,370
Let me at least wrap up the salad for you.

58
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,780
It's fine.

59
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,360

62

I can't take a photo.

63
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,220
Oh, right. I can give you an autograph.

64
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,510
I don't need it.

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,500
-No. I can do that for you.
-If you're not going to eat,

66
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,700
please leave.

67
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,360

Hey!

71
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,990
What? Is it worse than you thought?

72
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,110
Do you have to ask?

73
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,110
I would rather have you go viral
with a love scandal than this.

Who knows? They used to be really tight.

People who are closest to you
are the ones that betray you.

What's that, Ji-woo?

80
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,760
Can I eat it?

81
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,190
-The veggies wilted. It's been a while.
-It's fine.

82
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,830
It got cold. Do you still want to eat it?

83
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,140
No. Now that you put it that way,
I kind of don't want to eat it.

84
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,460
What? What is it?

85
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,410
A customer didn't eat it this morning.

86
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,210
Seriously? He must be filthy rich.

more customers today than yesterday.

Yes. I'm on my way.

95
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,540
I was going to be there.

96

Bye.

Bye.

I can't even take a breather.

99
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,980
Min-seok didn't call me.

100
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,870

Are you serious? How is that evidence?

106
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,030
You two went into the restaurant together.

107
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,190
And you left together.

108
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,000
During that time,
he got beaten up as you can see.

109
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,940
But you left the restaurant unscathed.

111

Do you think he'll pick up?

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,820
Gosh. This is disappointing.

113
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,280
We were on the same side.

114
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,560
Exactly.

Come on, just tell me! I'm the CEO
of the agency. Please tell me.

117
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,330
Whatever. I didn't do it.

118
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,750
-I really didn't do it.
-Listen.

119
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,520
If you didn't do it, tell me the truth.

120
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,160
You'll frustrate me to death.

121
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,050
I know you can handle this.

122
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,720
(Whatever. It wasn't me.)

123
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,180
There's footage of you withdrawing money
from an ATM at a convenience store.

124
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,960
Really? That's great.

125
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,080
Who would give cash for the settlement
money? People would wire it.

126
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,190
Then, that'd leave evidence.

127
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,510
So you gave him cash.

128
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,030
Gosh. Sometimes, you can be pretty smart.

129

-Thank you.
-Come on.

130
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,409

131
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,120
Right?

132
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,920
Why won't you talk to me?
We have to make a statement.

133
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,950
Gosh. Why would he do this?

134
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,870
How would we know why?

135
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,760
Whatever. It's all my fault.

136
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,200
People look down on me because
I got the job with my connections.

137
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,600
So I can't even handle this mess.

138
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,510
Why wouldn't they? Even an artist
from my agency looks down on me.

139
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,410
Of course, people would look down on me.
You know?

140
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,180
Stop saying that.

I was in the area to sign a contract.
So I stopped by for some pasta.

-Okay.

163
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,580
Hold on. Hyung-ki, you're going
to cook it for us, right?

164
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,140
(Well, we all follow the same recipes.)

165
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,130
(-Come on.
-But you learned cooking in Italy.)

166
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,630
(-Of course.
-Okay.)

167
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,780
When our lease is up,

168
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,980
-you have to renew it with us.
-Sure.

169
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,570
I'll make cream pasta with pork belly.

170
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,420
-Okay.
-I like that one.

171
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,910
(-I'll make it quick.
-Okay.)

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,760
(-Okay.
-Sure. Gosh.)

173
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,560
(I really like that guy.)

174
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,730
(They must work hard when they are young
to guarantee retirement.)

175
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,370
(I wish my son can be more like him.)

176
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,200
(Right. He's always traveling.)

177
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,610
(There's a saying that the first customer
of the day determines each day's sales.)

178
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,560
(It rather turned out to be a decent day.)

179
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,810
You're from the restaurant. What?

180
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,570
Gosh.

181
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,430
Goodness. Oh, my.

182
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,930
-Who are you?
-Well,

183
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,960
I guess you didn't hear I was coming.

184
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,500
Who are you?

185
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,890
Well, did you cover yourself up?

186
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,780
What are you doing in my house?

187
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,310
Well, I have to stay here
for the time being.

188
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,520
We've met before,
but it's still nice to see you again.

189
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,290
This is news to me.

190
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,010
Call your landlord.

191
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,680
By the way, we ran into
each other twice in one day.

192
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,440
We were fated to meet again.

193
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,710
(No. I knew it.)

194
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,310
(Today is my unlucky day.)

195
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,910
(To My Star)

196
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,480
(To My Star)
