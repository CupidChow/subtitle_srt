1
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,006
Our detectives sent these pictures this morning.

2
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:51,246
They tracked her financial record.

3
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:53,702
Nam is certainly not just an assistant.

4
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:05,126
The baby in your womb

5
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:08,246
has to repay me for raising you.

6
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:09,846
What are you doing?

7
00:02:10,157 --> 00:02:12,366
The better question is, "What have I done?"

8
00:02:12,534 --> 00:02:15,606
We need to review the accounting before the joint venture.

9
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:18,566
We might catch Rit with something.

10
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:22,606
I suspected Nam at first.

11
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:25,526
I thought Mr. Rit gave his statement to cover up for her.

12
00:02:26,182 --> 00:02:28,806
Now that Un mentioned the accounting review

13
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:32,446
and I saw Mr. Rit's huge amount of unexplained money,

14
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:34,326
I think

15
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:37,646
Mr. Noot might have found something

16
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:40,886
that led to his death.

17
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:43,886
Isn't this too complicated?

18
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:45,446
Sa, my lady.

19
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:48,326
Every death is complicated.

20
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:54,806
It's not like your gossip about who hooked up with who, who had affairs.

21
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,646
That's called complicated relationships.

22
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:01,926
That's none of your business!

23
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,606
By the way, what San said could be true.

24
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:09,486
Did Rit really do it?

25
00:03:09,974 --> 00:03:12,526
Rit, Noot, and I

26
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,558
grew up together.

27
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:16,206
My dear Un.

28
00:03:16,677 --> 00:03:19,166
Money is not a simple matter.

29
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,606
Siblings fight over it all the time.

30
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:23,478
Couples even kill each other for money.

31
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,886
You should be careful.

32
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:28,046
If he didn't do it, that's good.

33
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:32,726
You know what? I'll have my men keep an eye on Rit and Nam.

34
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:34,566
From now on,

35
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:37,086
you need to be more careful, Un.

36
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:40,206
Okay.

37
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,686
Un.

38
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,574
I think you should be careful.

39
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:52,206
If it's him,

40
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:54,206
he's really close to you.

41
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,166
I'm worried.

42
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:58,246
Okay.

43
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,486
I want to find out about that accounting too.

44
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:04,586
I'm going to check the accounting records tomorrow.

45
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:06,286
Un.

46
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:09,246
I just told you to be careful.

47
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:12,486
Okay.

48
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:15,126
I promise I won't risk myself.

49
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:21,046
Honestly, I think it's possible that the motivation was money.

50
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:24,686
I just can't believe that we suspect

51
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,446
Rit to be the killer.

52
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,326
I understand.

53
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,126
If there's a possibility,

54
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,286
you should still be careful.

55
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,126
I'll be visiting my grandfather with my mom tomorrow.

56
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,006
I was going to visit him today, but it's too late now.

57
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,126
Did Kan drive you?

58
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,637
Kan hasn't come home since last night.

59
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,966
I don't know where he is.

60
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:55,526
I can't reach him.

61
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:57,406
Really?

62
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:00,751
I'll pick you up tomorrow, then.

63
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:02,166
Okay.

64
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,166
Let's go.

65
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,606
Drive safely.

66
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:10,406
Text me when you get home.

67
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,846
- Yes.  - Okay.

68
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,925
Have you visited your grandfather?

69
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,166
I haven't.

70
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,086
I couldn't make it today. I'll go tomorrow.

71
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:35,926
Yeah. Don't avoid him.

72
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:39,086
Visit him so that you won't have anything to worry about.

73
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,326
I don't know what to say when I see him.

74
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:51,429
You want to apologize to him, don't you?

75
00:05:58,653 --> 00:06:00,606
If I had kept my composure that day,

76
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:03,566
this might not have happened.

77
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:08,886
If you want to apologize to him, do it.

78
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:11,886
Your grandfather might be stubborn,

79
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:14,046
but I think he doesn't hate you.

80
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:17,366
He's just upset and wants to get his way.

81
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:19,926
If he hears an apology,

82
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:22,126
he might go easy on you.

83
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:42,006
Why is your mom checking her phone all the time?

84
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,957
I guess she's waiting for something.

85
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:46,286
Excuse us. Coming through.

86
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:51,686
Hey! That was Mr. Chairman.

87
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:59,966
Phim, wait for me here.

88
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,566
What do you think she's doing?

89
00:07:07,486 --> 00:07:08,646
I don't know.

90
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:11,582
Let her do what she wants.

91
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,286
Even if we tell her to stop, she won't stop.

92
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:16,926
Is your mom really going after Mr. Chairman?

93
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:47,326
Okay. Thanks.

94
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,926
Phattra.

95
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:05,686
Thank you for remembering me, sir.

96
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,966
I moved abroad after Phim married Noot.

97
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,294
I haven't visited you till now.

98
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,366
I'll be back.

99
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:20,286
Why are you here now? Just leave.

100
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,886
I don't want to see anyone.

101
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,806
Why would I leave so soon?

102
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:27,806
I haven't said what I have to say.

103
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:30,686
I don't want to hear about your daughter.

104
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:34,214
You don't want to hear the good news, sir?

105
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,166
I know Phim is pregnant.

106
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:42,126
It's a shame.

107
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,589
Noot didn't live to see his child.

108
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,126
If you're done talking, leave.

109
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,486
I'm not done, sir.

110
00:08:51,317 --> 00:08:54,926
You're probably unaware that the baby

111
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:57,046
is a boy.

112
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,926
If Phim were to live outside and struggle,

113
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:07,646
I'm afraid she might have a miscarriage.

114
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:12,486
I'm here to tell you that

115
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:16,646
I'm sending Phim back to Jangwangprawas

116
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,926
as the daughter-in-law

117
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:22,126
and mother of JP's only heir.

118
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:27,998
Phattra.

119
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,086
Mrs. Wan.

120
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:33,726
Good morning.

121
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:36,686
I'm just leaving.

122
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:40,166
I'll see you at home, I guess.

123
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:48,366
Goodbye, sir.

124
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:19,126
Have you reached Kan?

125
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:20,446
No.

126
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,806
I think we should report it to the police.

127
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:25,206
It's not normal now.

128
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:29,260
If Kan comes back, we can withdraw the report.

129
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:30,646
That's a good idea.

130
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:33,086
Kan usually tells me when he goes anywhere.

131
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:34,886
He's been missing for days now.

132
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:38,566
Let's go to see San at the station after visiting your grandfather.

133
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:41,646
Kuer.

134
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,006
What's wrong?

135
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,006
There might be an emergency case.

136
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:50,997
Did your mom tell you what room it is?

137
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:52,886
She did.

138
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:56,286
But can you wait outside?

139
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,006
I was about to wait outside anyway.

140
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:06,566
Are you okay?

141
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:12,486
I just don't know what to say to him.

142
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:16,966
You will know what to say when you see him.

143
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,039
Let's go.

144
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,446
Excuse us. Coming through.

145
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:32,606
Just pretend you don't see them.

146
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:42,366
Are you here to visit Grandfather?

147
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:44,326
Yes.

148
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:47,126
The doctor has discharged you, Phim?

149
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:51,606
Yes.

150
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:53,606
What did they say?

151
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:57,406
They said the baby was healthy.

152
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:02,446
Noot's baby?

153
00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:13,166
If I say it's not Noot's, would you believe it?

154
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:16,486
Phim.

155
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:20,246
I think we should stop saying that about the baby.

156
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:22,446
I care about you

157
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:24,646
because we are close friends.

158
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:28,166
I don't want you to think of me more than that.

159
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:34,946
I respect Un.

160
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:37,566
Un is my fiancee.

161
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:40,309
I don't want her to misunderstand me again.

162
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:47,218
Phim doesn't want anything to be misunderstood, Kuer.

163
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,486
Good morning.

164
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:57,002
She just wants Un to understand

165
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:02,366
that the baby, who's JP's heir,

166
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,406
is fine. There's nothing to worry about.

167
00:13:09,086 --> 00:13:13,486
Un, please tell the staff at home to prepare a room for Phim and me.

168
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,246
I'm bringing Phim back home today.

169
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,446
Let's go.

170
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,566
Is that Phim's mother?

171
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:36,926
Yes.

172
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:40,326
Let's go.

173
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:50,526
I don't know why my mom would come home now.

174
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:53,886
You need someone like your mom right now.

175
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,566
I think she's back for the money.

176
00:13:57,886 --> 00:14:01,326
She never asked for your money before, Phim.

177
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,566
I think she's doing it because she wants a good life for you.

178
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:08,966
A good life financially, but not mentally.

179
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:14,406
I know. At least you don't have to suffer both ways.

180
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,046
You will have the money to pay for your treatment and raise your child.

181
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:18,686
Why would you struggle on your own?

182
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,366
Sorry, ma'am.

183
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:23,366
You can get in now.

184
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:27,566
Phim, you should sit at the front. It doesn't shake as much.

185
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:29,886
Come.

186
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:36,726
Thank you.

187
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:46,846
I'm sorry.

188
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:54,366
I know

189
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,286
you don't want me to get back together with Kuer.

190
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:01,286
You thought he was the reason Noot died.

191
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:06,366
You know that, but why did you still do it?

192
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:13,006
Because I love him.

193
00:16:14,462 --> 00:16:16,806
I don't just love him blindly.

194
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:23,446
I saw solid evidence proving Kuer and Phim didn't have an affair.

195
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:27,494
If this is what you want to say, leave.

196
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,806
- Grandfather.  - When I recover,

197
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,806
you'll be fired from JP.

198
00:16:47,782 --> 00:16:49,406
I'm heading to work, Mom.

199
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:43,006
Why is loving someone so hard?

200
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:49,206
It's okay.

201
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:54,166
Should I try talking to him?

202
00:17:57,806 --> 00:17:59,086
Don't.

203
00:18:01,485 --> 00:18:03,005
He won't listen to anyone.

204
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:34,086
I'll take care of JP for him while he's recovering.

205
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:36,646
When he returns,

206
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:38,406
I'll resign.

207
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:41,206
Are you sure?

208
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:45,886
It's not hard to find a job.

209
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:54,726
But before I resign, I have something important to do.

210
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:58,446
Can you drop me off at work?

211
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:03,086
Let's go.

212
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:05,206
Are you okay?

213
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:25,486
Why are you calling me now?

214
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:32,446
Crap! I thought I had hit "submit."

215
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,126
Oh, no!

216
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,246
Good. Let me submit my work so I can get paid.

217
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:54,246
I've been a love guru so much that I haven't been working. I'm out of cash.

218
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:55,952
(Tony)

219
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,886
Where does your story begin, sir?

220
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:07,126
Haven't we talked enough yesterday?

221
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:08,766
Do you sleep at all?

222
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:10,526
I can't sleep.

223
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:13,486
I can, and I want to sleep more.

224
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:15,326
(I've been working so hard)

225
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:19,606
that I haven't slept for two days straight. I'm tired.

226
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,966
I think I'll talk to Un.

227
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,046
Are you back at the hotel?

228
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,566
I am.

229
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:29,406
Have you taken a shower?

230
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,166
I have.

231
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:33,646
If I haven't, it'll have been three days.

232
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:35,846
Good.

233
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,886
When you go to talk to her,

234
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:40,046
she won't have to focus on the way you smell.

235
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,613
Will she listen to me?

236
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:44,901
Oh, you!

237
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:47,646
You're smart. You're educated.

238
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:50,634
Why can't you figure this out?

239
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:53,326
I'm trying.

240
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:55,846
But at this point,

241
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:58,621
I don't know what to do.

242
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:02,806
You know what?

243
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:07,406
If you're done brushing your teeth and getting dressed,

244
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,206
you can go talk to Un.

245
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:12,286
And don't call me again. I'm going to sleep. Bye!

246
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:22,406
Will Un believe me?

247
00:21:27,862 --> 00:21:29,526
Let's try it anyway.

248
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:38,246
I'll get my stuff, and we'll leave.

249
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,166
Rit.

250
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:44,726
Miss Un doesn't want me as her assistant.

251
00:21:44,926 --> 00:21:46,326
She wants Prang instead.

252
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:50,286
She's suspecting me.

253
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:52,966
She's afraid you'd report her activities to me.

254
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:55,323
Won't you do something about it?

255
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:59,886
Miss Un looks like she's been trying to catch us since that meeting.

256
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:05,886
She's been trying to catch us. She can only catch us if we do something.

257
00:22:07,014 --> 00:22:08,486
We do nothing for now.

258
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:13,606
Are you waiting for her to strike first?

259
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:15,846
I'm not waiting.

260
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,886
I'm just not going after her myself.

261
00:22:18,486 --> 00:22:20,486
Someone like Un is not easy to stop.

262
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:22,566
She will find out what she wants to know.

263
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:25,613
If she's really suspecting us,

264
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:27,566
she'll try to do something.

265
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:34,846
Please check the details

266
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:36,326
and send your reviews to me.

267
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:38,406
Okay, Noom. I'll do it as soon as possible.

268
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:43,766
Mr. Noom.

269
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,886
- Yes, Miss Un.  - I have a favor to ask.

270
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:51,126
Of course. Let's talk inside.

271
00:23:04,646 --> 00:23:06,406
How can I help you, Miss Un?

272
00:23:07,477 --> 00:23:09,886
How many years have you been working for JP?

273
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:12,966
About 15 years.

274
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,246
Noot asked to see the accounting before, right?

275
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,606
He did.

276
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:22,166
It was when we were dealing with C-Itsara.

277
00:23:22,621 --> 00:23:23,966
Did he find anything?

278
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:26,726
It looked like something was off at first.

279
00:23:26,854 --> 00:23:30,046
It ended up being just a miscalculation.

280
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:36,006
Then I would like annual reports for the past five years

281
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,006
and the financial budget of Purchasing Department.

282
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:42,646
I want to know how much we spend per year

283
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:44,446
and how we spend it.

284
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:45,966
Of course.

285
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:49,526
Please prepare it for me. I'll collect it before I leave.

286
00:23:50,651 --> 00:23:51,651
Yes.

287
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:53,566
Thank you.

288
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,005
With this evidence,

289
00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:11,806
Kuer should be home free, Mrs. Kamalas.

290
00:24:12,338 --> 00:24:13,686
Thank you so much, San.

291
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,006
You're welcome.

292
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:19,566
Hey, San! What are you doing here?

293
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:22,046
He is giving me the DNA results.

294
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:24,002
How did it go?

295
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:25,686
Why are you worried?

296
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:27,766
You didn't do it. We can't catch you.

297
00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:30,286
How is Un doing?

298
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:31,966
I just dropped her off at the office.

299
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,166
You guys need to be more careful these days.

300
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:39,806
She said there was something important she needed to do.

301
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:43,846
When Mr. Prawit recovers and returns to work,

302
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,486
Un will probably resign.

303
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:50,975
That's a loss for Mr. Prawit.

304
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:55,406
Un is a woman, but she's talented and smart.

305
00:24:55,548 --> 00:24:57,973
She is capable of taking JP forward.

306
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:04,886
I sorted them by year.

307
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:06,926
The purchasing budget is in a separate folder.

308
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,107
Everything is in this box.

309
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:10,486
Thank you.

310
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:33,406
Mr. Rit.

311
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:35,286
You are involved.

312
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:36,726
I don't know anything.

313
00:25:36,877 --> 00:25:38,726
Accounting is your direct responsibility.

314
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:42,086
If you have problems, you have to solve them yourself.

315
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:47,966
Darn it!

316
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:00,526
What's wrong, Rit?

317
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,206
Un asked for the accounting documents that Noot asked for.

318
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:05,246
Did Noom give those to her?

319
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,086
Even if it's been edited,

320
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:13,286
someone who knows accounting

321
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:16,446
will be able to spot what we've forged.

322
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:19,486
That's for Noom to deal with.

323
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:26,486
Drive a bit past the entrance. I'll meet you on the road.

324
00:26:27,101 --> 00:26:29,806
I don't want Rit to see me bringing these documents home.

325
00:26:31,432 --> 00:26:33,526
I'll wait for you by the street.

326
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:35,446
No one will see you picking me up.

327
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:37,918
You don't have to, Un.

328
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:42,484
No. We agreed not to let Rit see us together.

329
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:55,966
Okay.

330
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:03,606
Un!

331
00:27:33,606 --> 00:27:34,966
Are you hurt, Un?

332
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:37,806
Un!

333
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,866
Un? Are you okay? Are you hurt?

334
00:27:54,302 --> 00:27:57,486
Just go back. I told you not to come.

335
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:07,126
Tony.

336
00:28:07,846 --> 00:28:09,046
Thank you so much.

337
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:10,406
Is this

338
00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:12,246
what you call taking care of Un?

339
00:28:15,158 --> 00:28:16,446
I'm sorry, Miss Un.

340
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:19,886
A bottle got stuck under the brake, and I lost control.

341
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:21,726
Are you hurt?

342
00:28:22,397 --> 00:28:24,606
It's okay. I'm not hurt.

343
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:26,126
I'm really sorry, Miss Un.

344
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:28,886
I'm in a hurry. Please excuse me.

345
00:28:29,326 --> 00:28:30,566
I'm sorry.

346
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:43,486
Thank you.

347
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,566
Hey, Un told you to leave. Why are you still here?

348
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:56,766
You should go home.

349
00:28:56,997 --> 00:28:58,646
I'll go home with Tony.

350
00:29:15,431 --> 00:29:17,246
If this is all you can do for her,

351
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:19,646
just let me take your place.

352
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:29,166
What are you doing?

353
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,686
That's enough!

354
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:33,886
If you want to go crazy, do it alone.

355
00:29:34,302 --> 00:29:35,606
Let's go, Tony.

356
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:08,926
It looks like Kuer fought with Miss Un, Rit.

357
00:30:10,046 --> 00:30:11,646
Who is the other guy?

358
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:14,126
That guy...

359
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:17,486
I saw him at Mr. Noot's funeral.

360
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:24,406
It's good if they fight. She won't have time to mess with others.

361
00:30:26,086 --> 00:30:27,486
But still,

362
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:30,526
she took the documents from Noom, Rit.

363
00:30:43,486 --> 00:30:44,686
Hello? Okay.

364
00:30:44,998 --> 00:30:46,566
When Un gets home today,

365
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:49,686
please check what documents she brings home.

366
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,262
The police don't permit anyone inside.

367
00:30:57,445 --> 00:30:58,966
There might be some evidence in there.

368
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:08,126
Don't look at the two of us.

369
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:11,126
It got nothing to do with my daughter.

370
00:31:11,885 --> 00:31:14,206
The police haven't ruled Phim out as a suspect.

371
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,206
Her affair is still a motivation.

372
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:36,646
Hey, Kuer. Where's Un?

373
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:40,326
You said you're picking her up. Why are you here alone?

374
00:31:42,246 --> 00:31:43,646
She went home with Tony.

375
00:31:44,966 --> 00:31:48,126
- Who?  - The guy who has a crush on Un from America.

376
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,086
- What?  - Yeah!

377
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,846
I went to JP's office to pick Un up.

378
00:31:53,365 --> 00:31:55,378
- A car was about to run over her.  - What?

379
00:31:55,686 --> 00:31:58,326
Stop saying what. Listen to Kuer first.

380
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:01,086
- Tell me about it now.  - Yeah, go on.

381
00:32:02,446 --> 00:32:05,006
- She's lucky Tony saved her.  - What?

382
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:09,926
Sorry. Who drove it?

383
00:32:10,814 --> 00:32:12,246
The head of accounting.

384
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,366
What happened next?

385
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,806
Here. I'll help you carry it.

386
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:36,206
- It's okay.  - You can tend to other stuff.

387
00:32:36,446 --> 00:32:38,426
Tony will help me carry it up.

388
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:39,766
Okay.

389
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,366
Un, are you back already?

390
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:58,646
You're such a hard worker. You brought some work home.

391
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,566
Yes, Aunt Wing.

392
00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:05,406
I think you should put that box in your grandfather's room.

393
00:33:05,557 --> 00:33:07,926
Don't bother carrying it upstairs. It's heavy.

394
00:33:08,694 --> 00:33:11,206
It's okay. I work better upstairs.

395
00:33:11,493 --> 00:33:13,966
That way, we don't have to clean up the room when Grandfather returns.

396
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:18,326
- Let's go.  - Wait. Is this your new friend?

397
00:33:21,037 --> 00:33:22,246
I'm not new.

398
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,046
I've known her for years.

399
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,606
What about Mr. Kuer?

400
00:33:27,661 --> 00:33:28,707
We're keeping a distance.

401
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:32,006
So this man is not a new friend,

402
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:36,566
but rather a new boyfriend, is he?

403
00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:42,686
Excuse me.

404
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:52,286
Put it here.

405
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:01,086
I can't believe Aunt Wing.

406
00:34:03,573 --> 00:34:04,573
What happened?

407
00:34:05,118 --> 00:34:07,446
If she had a chance, she would have opened this box.

408
00:34:08,374 --> 00:34:10,566
She had the gut to ask who Tony was.

409
00:34:11,014 --> 00:34:12,094
That's right.

410
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:14,486
I didn't think she'd be bold enough to ask.

411
00:34:15,229 --> 00:34:21,166
That woman asks everything. She doesn't care. She wants to know it all!

412
00:34:23,222 --> 00:34:27,246
I have something more interesting than Aunt Wing to tell you.

413
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:28,886
What?

414
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,886
Phim is back home!

415
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:34,606
Phim is here?

416
00:34:34,846 --> 00:34:37,486
Yeah, with her mom.

417
00:34:39,335 --> 00:34:41,926
Her mom is something else too.

418
00:34:43,717 --> 00:34:44,806
Gade.

419
00:34:45,006 --> 00:34:47,806
You were not working while you were at home, were you?

420
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:49,886
Why?

421
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:51,926
You know everything.

422
00:34:53,822 --> 00:34:55,822
I work for money.

423
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:58,126
I spy for favors.

424
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:01,726
I'm staying at my friend's home. I can't just do nothing.

425
00:35:03,062 --> 00:35:05,605
You think Phim is scary, right?

426
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:07,646
Her mom is even scarier.

427
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:09,366
I saw it myself.

428
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:13,646
I told Un to prepare rooms for us.

429
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,166
Didn't she tell you?

430
00:35:16,749 --> 00:35:19,886
She didn't. She's not home yet.

431
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:22,686
I'll be staying at home.

432
00:35:22,771 --> 00:35:24,806
She's the mother of the heir

433
00:35:25,046 --> 00:35:27,446
to Jangwangprawas with legal rights.

434
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:29,506
Mr. Prawit has been informed.

435
00:35:29,949 --> 00:35:33,926
Don't claim his name. My father is still in the hospital.

436
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,046
He is.

437
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:41,566
She happened to be in the same hospital. We saw each other.

438
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,966
He now knows the truth that the baby in Phim's womb is a boy.

439
00:35:51,813 --> 00:35:53,666
There has been gossip

440
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:57,087
that you got pregnant while sleeping with your lover.

441
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:04,286
We can talk about that later.

442
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:07,286
I need rooms to stay in right now.

443
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:09,246
We've come a long way.

444
00:36:09,446 --> 00:36:12,646
Don't you have any water or food to welcome us?

445
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:16,566
I'll arrange something for you.

446
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:21,006
We have already prepared a room.

447
00:36:21,995 --> 00:36:23,246
It's not Noot's room.

448
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:25,286
That room is on lockdown.

449
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:27,886
Prepared a room? What do you mean?

450
00:36:28,017 --> 00:36:30,686
Did you know these two are moving in?

451
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:32,446
Father has been informed.

452
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:35,446
He didn't give his permission, but he didn't say no either.

453
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:37,726
What would you have me do?

454
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:43,006
Nok, get their bags.

455
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,006
This way, please.

456
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,086
She almost knocked your Aunt Wing over.

457
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,526
Aunt Wing alone is bad enough.

458
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:56,726
Now we have to deal with Phim and her mom too.

459
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,158
I want to pack my stuff and move out right now.

460
00:37:00,649 --> 00:37:01,886
Come on.

461
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:03,966
You've been through worse.

462
00:37:04,151 --> 00:37:05,406
That's work.

463
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:10,646
Think of it as work, then. That way, you wouldn't mind.

464
00:37:11,038 --> 00:37:14,846
When your work is done, move on to a new project. Don't get stressed.

465
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:19,966
That is very well said.

466
00:37:23,953 --> 00:37:25,406
Thank you, Tony.

467
00:37:26,263 --> 00:37:27,566
Thanks for your help.

468
00:37:30,686 --> 00:37:33,486
If you need my help, tell me.

469
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:36,006
I'll go home now.

470
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:39,286
Why are you leaving so soon this time?

471
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:43,046
I have some work to do.

472
00:37:44,126 --> 00:37:46,686
You have work? Since when?

473
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:53,366
Since just now.

474
00:37:56,606 --> 00:37:57,726
I have to go.

475
00:37:58,223 --> 00:38:00,406
Gade, please walk Tony to his car.

476
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:01,806
I want to take a shower.

477
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:06,446
Okay. You take a shower.

478
00:38:06,765 --> 00:38:08,566
Let's go. I'll walk with you.

479
00:38:20,962 --> 00:38:22,046
Tony.

480
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,526
Have you talked to Un? About what you wanted to talk about.

481
00:38:26,863 --> 00:38:28,046
I haven't.

482
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:31,486
You were in the car with her for a while. Why didn't you ask?

483
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:34,726
I don't know how to start.

484
00:38:36,591 --> 00:38:38,206
I thought you guys cleared it up.

485
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:42,406
Un didn't give me a chance.

486
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,726
Why?

487
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,926
I think she's worried about the work she asked me to do.

488
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:52,326
I'm off.

489
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:57,806
Drive safely.

490
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:10,606
From what you told me,

491
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,966
it's really unusual.

492
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:15,086
What's really strange

493
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:17,646
is the fact Un let Tony drive her home.

494
00:39:18,715 --> 00:39:20,715
Why? Why did she go home with Tony?

495
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:22,326
Why didn't she go home with you?

496
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:26,126
That Tony guy used to date Un, didn't he?

497
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:31,206
There's one more thing I haven't told you guys.

498
00:39:33,486 --> 00:39:34,806
- What is it?  - What is it?

499
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:39,486
Before we talked the other day,

500
00:39:39,617 --> 00:39:41,166
when you suspected Rit,

501
00:39:41,788 --> 00:39:43,788
I talked to Un out front.

502
00:39:45,326 --> 00:39:47,086
I don't want anything to happen to you.

503
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:50,846
I don't want you to risk your life.

504
00:39:52,488 --> 00:39:54,286
If anything happens to you,

505
00:39:57,212 --> 00:39:58,486
it's not worth it.

506
00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:01,086
What are you planning to do?

507
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:07,006
I think there's someone with malicious intent.

508
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,726
I don't want you to proceed with the joint venture right now.

509
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:15,366
It's risky, you know?

510
00:40:16,491 --> 00:40:17,886
You mean

511
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,526
if I proceed with the joint venture,

512
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,886
you think someone will hurt me?

513
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:44,486
If we break up,

514
00:40:47,008 --> 00:40:49,886
they will think the joint venture won't happen now.

515
00:40:55,915 --> 00:40:57,513
With the events unfolding,

516
00:40:57,642 --> 00:40:59,166
it has become clear that

517
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:01,651
someone inside JP's office

518
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:03,646
is not pleased with that joint venture.

519
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,846
Un needs to review the financial balance

520
00:41:06,984 --> 00:41:09,126
that will be sent to C-Itsara.

521
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:13,046
That led to the accident where the head of accounting

522
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,766
tried to run Un over.

523
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,846
Is it possible

524
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:21,566
that Mr. Rit doesn't want it to be found out?

525
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:24,006
He took a good amount of money from the company.

526
00:41:24,143 --> 00:41:26,746
Look at what he bought for Nam, his assistant.

527
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:30,446
San, can you issue an arrest warrant for him now?

528
00:41:30,578 --> 00:41:32,326
I can arrest you!

529
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:34,766
I need evidence to arrest someone.

530
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,686
I can't just go and arrest them.

531
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:39,846
Then Un is really in danger, like Kuer said.

532
00:41:41,642 --> 00:41:46,366
Yeah. I was shocked about Un getting run over. I forgot.

533
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:48,027
My men

534
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:50,126
tracked the internet cafe's IP this afternoon.

535
00:41:50,253 --> 00:41:54,046
I know who sent that lead to Sa's page.

536
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,326
Do you remember her?

537
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:09,600
What does she want?

538
00:42:09,806 --> 00:42:12,159
Does she want you to take Phim?

539
00:42:19,994 --> 00:42:22,286
Hey! You took so long.

540
00:42:22,605 --> 00:42:24,726
I thought you girls were not having dinner.

541
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,566
I took a shower.

542
00:42:26,762 --> 00:42:28,646
Gade waited to come with me.

543
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:33,806
Look. We have extra seats on the table tonight.

544
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:36,806
If you want to find out who they are,

545
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,726
see it for yourself.

546
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:42,126
They're sitting at the table.

547
00:43:00,065 --> 00:43:02,566
Un brought a box of documents home.

548
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,406
Did you see what's inside?

549
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,624
I didn't. She took it upstairs with her.

550
00:43:07,777 --> 00:43:10,416
She just came down for dinner.

551
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:17,886
I'll go upstairs to look. If she comes up, call me.

552
00:43:18,108 --> 00:43:19,366
Okay.

553
00:43:44,398 --> 00:43:45,646
Where is the food?

554
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:51,246
Set the plates for everyone.

555
00:44:01,537 --> 00:44:02,926
Father is not here.

556
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:05,246
But you're showing up here every day.

557
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,366
Is this your girlfriend's?

558
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,366
I don't have a girlfriend.

559
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:44,166
My sister probably dropped this earring.

560
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:57,846
See? The netizens are talking crap about you.

561
00:44:57,956 --> 00:44:59,606
If you sue them, you'll be set for life.

562
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:02,366
Kuer, when will you set the record straight?

563
00:45:03,649 --> 00:45:06,326
Soon. I won't leave it for too long.

564
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:09,646
You should do it soon. I wonder

565
00:45:09,787 --> 00:45:11,526
what Phim's mother is doing next.

566
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:14,206
It might work in her favor, you know?

567
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:17,646
They can get back to Jangwangprawas with a clean slate.

568
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:23,326
San.

569
00:45:23,482 --> 00:45:24,646
I'm hungry.

570
00:45:26,906 --> 00:45:29,806
Kuer is here. Why would you want it now?

571
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,726
Hungry, not horny!

572
00:45:35,894 --> 00:45:38,526
- Are you hungry? I thought you were horny.  - Yeah.

573
00:45:38,696 --> 00:45:41,846
If you're hungry, the food has arrived. Bring my food too.

574
00:45:42,254 --> 00:45:43,886
- Are you ordering me?  - Yeah.

575
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:49,006
Yeah. I can help. It's not hard.

576
00:45:49,926 --> 00:45:50,926
Let's go.

577
00:45:51,053 --> 00:45:52,366
It's easy. Let's go.

578
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:53,606
I see your future now.

579
00:45:53,704 --> 00:45:55,376
Do you think I don't see my own future?

580
00:46:01,588 --> 00:46:02,766
I'll get it for you.

581
00:46:02,966 --> 00:46:04,486
- Okay.  - You get the food.

582
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:27,686
Can I come in?

583
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,006
What do you want?

584
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,446
Un asked me to bring this to you.

585
00:46:33,206 --> 00:46:34,726
Why would she ask you to?

586
00:46:35,696 --> 00:46:36,846
I don't know.

587
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:38,726
She probably trusts me.

588
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:43,286
If you're uncomfortable

589
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:45,326
and want me to keep it,

590
00:46:45,515 --> 00:46:46,646
I can do that for you.

591
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,510
I'm not hungry anymore.

592
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,926
You're not hungry. Are you horny instead?

593
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,206
Hey! I'm not!

594
00:47:06,332 --> 00:47:07,526
You're not?

595
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,646
You're staring at him without blinking once.

596
00:47:11,187 --> 00:47:15,566
I'm not horny. I'm nosy. I want to know what's going on.

597
00:47:20,773 --> 00:47:22,646
- Go! Get away!  - What?

598
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:44,366
You've delivered the documents. Now leave.

599
00:47:49,212 --> 00:47:51,046
I needed to deliver this myself,

600
00:47:51,842 --> 00:47:53,446
not because I wanted to see you.

601
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:55,806
Why did you come then?

602
00:47:55,919 --> 00:47:58,086
Un asked me to help review these.

603
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:02,486
I have a Ph.D. in accounting and finance.

604
00:48:03,801 --> 00:48:06,606
Un probably thinks I can help you with these.

605
00:48:09,205 --> 00:48:10,806
When will we start reviewing them?

606
00:48:16,035 --> 00:48:17,999
I know you don't want to see me.

607
00:48:19,955 --> 00:48:21,955
Honestly, I don't want to see you either.

608
00:48:23,326 --> 00:48:26,126
It is what it is. Deal with it.

609
00:48:38,278 --> 00:48:41,046
Rit, are you home already?

610
00:48:41,364 --> 00:48:42,826
I've been back for a while, Mom.

611
00:48:43,068 --> 00:48:45,006
I took a shower.

612
00:48:46,046 --> 00:48:47,366
I rushed back home.

613
00:48:47,544 --> 00:48:48,926
You said we have a guest.

614
00:48:49,245 --> 00:48:50,766
We do have a guest in the house,

615
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:52,486
but she's more like a leech.

616
00:48:56,555 --> 00:48:57,646
A leech?

617
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:01,566
Don't mind her. This is how Aunt Wing is.

618
00:49:01,726 --> 00:49:02,926
Why would you tolerate her?

619
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:06,926
Hey! Are you calling me a leech?

620
00:49:07,608 --> 00:49:08,686
Are you?

621
00:49:08,791 --> 00:49:10,086
If you are, then yes.

622
00:49:10,264 --> 00:49:11,374
Wait.

623
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,546
A leech feeds itself on whatever it clings to.

624
00:49:14,846 --> 00:49:17,366
What about you? Can you even feed yourself?

625
00:49:17,558 --> 00:49:20,566
Don't you just sit around to be waited on hand and foot?

626
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:23,886
You're even more disgusting than the leech you called me.

627
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:26,329
Hey! Are you insulting me?

628
00:49:26,803 --> 00:49:28,406
Mom! Please.

629
00:49:28,776 --> 00:49:30,526
Let me go!

630
00:49:30,657 --> 00:49:31,886
She's insulting me.

631
00:49:32,063 --> 00:49:35,846
I have hands, you know? If you slap me, I'll fight back.

632
00:49:40,235 --> 00:49:42,566
The hospital called. They said we should prepare.

633
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,286
Father can come home the day after tomorrow.

634
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,086
Why is he not back today

635
00:49:47,264 --> 00:49:49,264
so that he can kick these two out?

636
00:49:50,046 --> 00:49:51,246
I don't know.

637
00:49:52,646 --> 00:49:55,566
If you had been to the hospital, you wouldn't have had to ask why.

638
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:00,926
I'm letting you know because they're delivering a bed tomorrow.

639
00:50:01,126 --> 00:50:03,046
They think Father won't be able to walk up the stairs.

640
00:50:03,646 --> 00:50:04,726
You did good!

641
00:50:04,845 --> 00:50:08,726
You're smart. If you're capable, then do everything yourself.

642
00:50:10,012 --> 00:50:12,526
Let's go, Rit. We'll have dinner.

643
00:50:31,453 --> 00:50:32,806
Do you think he saw it?

644
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,526
Surely.

645
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:43,586
Did you see it? Phim's mom is a real deal.

646
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:46,886
I did. She's something else.

647
00:50:48,601 --> 00:50:50,846
I saw you staring at Phim.

648
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:52,246
What's wrong?

649
00:50:56,772 --> 00:50:59,406
The earrings that Phim wore.

650
00:51:00,554 --> 00:51:02,766
I saw one of them at Kuer's apartment

651
00:51:03,288 --> 00:51:05,288
back when I dressed his wound.

652
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:09,606
You mean when you and Kuer first met?

653
00:51:09,762 --> 00:51:10,886
Yeah.

654
00:51:11,213 --> 00:51:14,606
Back then, Kuer said it was his sister's.

655
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:17,846
Wait. What are you thinking?

656
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:21,286
I'm just suspecting

657
00:51:21,438 --> 00:51:23,486
that the earring was Phim's.

658
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:25,606
If it was,

659
00:51:27,075 --> 00:51:30,886
the timeline for the baby to be Kuer's

660
00:51:32,174 --> 00:51:33,566
is possible.

661
00:51:34,486 --> 00:51:36,366
You're crazy. It's not his.

662
00:51:37,173 --> 00:51:39,646
You and Kuer weren't dating back then.

663
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:42,406
It's not wrong if he hooked up with someone, right?

664
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:48,606
It would be wrong

665
00:51:48,947 --> 00:51:51,446
if the baby really happened to be Kuer's.

666
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,086
Yeah, about that...

667
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:00,526
Let's deal with it later.

668
00:52:01,376 --> 00:52:02,686
We should look at this.

669
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:16,326
You said Un wouldn't do anything about the accounting right now?

670
00:52:16,587 --> 00:52:18,606
I don't know when she changed her mind.

671
00:52:18,947 --> 00:52:21,366
She took these in yesterday without telling anyone.

672
00:52:25,948 --> 00:52:29,206
Should I ask our accounting team to help review them?

673
00:52:30,012 --> 00:52:31,366
There's no need, Grandmother.

674
00:52:31,635 --> 00:52:33,366
Un has someone helping me.

675
00:52:34,188 --> 00:52:35,272
Who?

676
00:52:35,532 --> 00:52:36,686
It's

677
00:52:37,108 --> 00:52:39,846
the person who came here to talk to me the other night,

678
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:42,206
the one you saw.

679
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:09,046
Tony, please bring these documents to Kuer.

680
00:53:12,486 --> 00:53:13,926
Why are you bringing them to him?

681
00:53:15,089 --> 00:53:19,406
I need Kuer to see if there's anything wrong with the budget.

682
00:53:22,006 --> 00:53:23,006
Un.

683
00:53:23,646 --> 00:53:25,166
Was that fight with Kuer even real?

684
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,926
You know I love you.

685
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:45,286
Why are you doing this to me?

686
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:47,446
Don't you care if I feel sad?

687
00:53:50,213 --> 00:53:51,686
I'm sorry.

688
00:53:52,015 --> 00:53:54,086
I needed to do this.

689
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:57,606
I needed everyone to believe Kuer and I fought.

690
00:53:58,813 --> 00:54:00,066
Why?

691
00:54:01,078 --> 00:54:04,326
I suspect someone in the office is against the joint venture.

692
00:54:05,126 --> 00:54:07,446
It might have something to do with Noot's death.

693
00:54:09,995 --> 00:54:13,166
Does that mean the accounting documents you brought

694
00:54:13,947 --> 00:54:16,086
were why you almost got run over?

695
00:54:17,264 --> 00:54:18,726
I'm not sure.

696
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:32,326
If it's about your safety,

697
00:54:34,225 --> 00:54:35,646
I'll do it.

698
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:37,686
Thank you, Tony.

699
00:54:42,598 --> 00:54:43,806
If that's the case,

700
00:54:44,366 --> 00:54:48,646
can you please help him check if there's anything wrong?

701
00:54:50,805 --> 00:54:53,726
Are you asking me to help Kuer review those documents?

702
00:54:57,006 --> 00:55:00,806
You're good at accounting. You can spot anything off right away.

703
00:55:02,862 --> 00:55:04,526
Please help me, Tony.

704
00:55:43,421 --> 00:55:46,726
The accounting department told me you're reviewing accounting documents.

705
00:55:47,226 --> 00:55:48,235
Yes, I am.

706
00:55:48,316 --> 00:55:50,766
You need to submit them to C-Itsara for the joint venture, right?

707
00:55:50,984 --> 00:55:52,406
I can help you.

708
00:55:54,057 --> 00:55:55,406
I'm not doing that, Rit.

709
00:55:55,527 --> 00:55:58,606
I just want to figure out the budget for next year.

710
00:55:58,904 --> 00:56:02,006
While Grandfather is not here, I have to do it.

711
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:05,606
If I didn't know our past expenditures,

712
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,126
it would be hard for me to plan ahead.

713
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:18,206
Regarding the joint venture with C-Itsara,

714
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,886
I think I won't be proceeding with that anymore.

715
00:56:24,028 --> 00:56:27,886
Why? You said it was a good project before.

716
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,926
Maybe I'm seeing things more clearly now.

717
00:56:34,446 --> 00:56:35,766
What's wrong?

718
00:56:36,588 --> 00:56:38,166
Did you fight with Kuer?

719
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,286
Let's say we're keeping a distance.

720
00:56:47,486 --> 00:56:48,606
Come in.

721
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:56,366
Miss Un, Mrs. Kamalas is here to see you.

722
00:56:57,402 --> 00:56:58,686
Bring her in.

723
00:57:01,766 --> 00:57:03,726
Take it easy.

724
00:57:04,096 --> 00:57:07,406
Talk to her nicely. You'd want a good business rather than an enemy.

725
00:57:13,326 --> 00:57:14,526
Good morning.

726
00:57:17,922 --> 00:57:19,326
Good morning.

727
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,646
How are you, dear?

728
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,526
You almost got run over by a car?

729
00:57:31,566 --> 00:57:32,566
Yes.

730
00:57:33,605 --> 00:57:35,046
Please sit down.

731
00:57:37,726 --> 00:57:39,166
I'm worried.

732
00:57:39,318 --> 00:57:42,646
I have to see for myself that you're safe.

733
00:57:43,646 --> 00:57:45,606
I'm fine, Grandmother.

734
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:48,008
Thank you for caring for me.

735
00:57:48,575 --> 00:57:50,623
Why would I not care?

736
00:57:53,987 --> 00:57:55,206
Grandmother.

737
00:57:55,453 --> 00:57:58,566
Everyone seems to believe Kuer and I fought.

738
00:57:59,584 --> 00:58:04,886
Un, whatever you do, be careful. Don't take a big risk.

739
00:58:05,744 --> 00:58:06,966
Yes.

740
00:58:07,323 --> 00:58:10,286
I believe the people who assaulted Kuer and Noot,

741
00:58:10,569 --> 00:58:13,366
although they seem to have different reasons,

742
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,966
these two events

743
00:58:15,098 --> 00:58:17,246
have one thing in common.

744
00:58:17,503 --> 00:58:19,002
That's the joint venture.

745
00:58:19,671 --> 00:58:24,926
When you got involved, you became a target too.

746
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:27,326
You have to be really careful.

747
00:58:28,374 --> 00:58:30,626
- Please.  - Yes, Grandmother.

748
00:58:55,591 --> 00:58:57,566
- Thanks.  - What?

749
00:58:58,087 --> 00:58:59,246
This one is mine.

750
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,446
If you want some,

751
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:03,926
pour it yourself. The coffee is in the jug. The cups are there.

752
00:59:20,595 --> 00:59:21,806
Rit.

753
00:59:22,221 --> 00:59:24,766
What did Mrs. Kamalas talk to Miss Un about?

754
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,452
I think it's about the joint venture.

755
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,606
Un sad she's pulling out of the project.

756
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,286
Why did she ask to review the budget, then?

757
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:37,006
She said she needed it to plan for next year.

758
00:59:39,025 --> 00:59:40,806
You called me last night

759
00:59:41,256 --> 00:59:43,446
and said there was nothing in that box.

760
00:59:43,932 --> 00:59:45,932
I think it's strange, Rit.

761
00:59:46,554 --> 00:59:49,726
I'm wondering where the documents are gone too.

762
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:09,446
The number is really off.

763
01:00:11,158 --> 01:00:12,246
By a lot?

764
01:00:12,917 --> 01:00:14,206
I'm not sure.

765
01:00:14,439 --> 01:00:16,439
The numbers just don't balance out.

766
01:00:17,077 --> 01:00:19,077
I think this has been edited.

767
01:00:27,409 --> 01:00:28,409
Good.

768
01:00:28,752 --> 01:00:31,606
If you detect it early, you can leave early.

769
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:37,446
I'll leave now.

770
01:00:39,023 --> 01:00:40,726
Should I call Un and tell her now?

771
01:00:41,049 --> 01:00:43,284
That you're leaving without finishing your work.

772
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:53,366
That's mine.

773
01:01:04,766 --> 01:01:06,206
Who's here to see you?

774
01:01:06,543 --> 01:01:10,386
It's my house's doorbell. They're here to see me.

775
01:01:36,939 --> 01:01:38,046
He's hungry.

776
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:57,292
Thanks.

777
01:01:57,406 --> 01:01:58,566
What?

778
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,046
This is mine.

779
01:02:00,949 --> 01:02:03,766
If you're hungry, order something.

780
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:25,966
See? Look what he's doing to me.

781
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:27,526
Did you find anything, though?

782
01:02:27,736 --> 01:02:28,886
I did.

783
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:30,846
Here.

784
01:02:32,701 --> 01:02:35,766
He marked it for me. Apparently, the number has been edited.

785
01:02:36,249 --> 01:02:39,806
They didn't cover their tracks. We found it. There's still more to review.

786
01:02:41,172 --> 01:02:45,006
Just one day with him, and he's all you're talking about. Such bromance!

787
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,646
I'm kidding. Just kidding, bro.

788
01:02:49,795 --> 01:02:52,886
- I'm just kidding.  - That means there's a problem within the company.

789
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:55,566
I think the reason

790
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:57,366
is certainly Mr. Rit.

791
01:02:57,566 --> 01:02:58,566
What's the proof?

792
01:02:58,762 --> 01:03:00,246
This is the proof. See!

793
01:03:00,397 --> 01:03:02,966
I don't mean the proof of him scamming.

794
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:06,422
Kuer and Un suspect something else too.

795
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:09,729
This can be a motivation for killing.

796
01:03:11,446 --> 01:03:13,046
The boat was left at the harbor.

797
01:03:13,141 --> 01:03:15,802
If Rit really killed him, how did he leave the island?

798
01:03:17,246 --> 01:03:18,846
Who killed Mr. Noot?

799
01:03:19,507 --> 01:03:21,366
How did they do it?

800
01:03:21,642 --> 01:03:23,406
We don't have evidence.

801
01:03:25,871 --> 01:03:27,286
You're getting smart,

802
01:03:27,555 --> 01:03:30,606
as expected of a cop's girlfriend.

803
01:03:35,919 --> 01:03:39,606
- You're embarrassed.  - What?

804
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:42,886
Hello?

805
01:03:44,475 --> 01:03:47,166
Okay. See you at the hospital.

806
01:03:48,668 --> 01:03:50,806
I told my men to inform the hospital

807
01:03:51,096 --> 01:03:53,806
to tell me if someone called Kan came in.

808
01:03:54,027 --> 01:03:55,726
- You found him.  - There he is.

809
01:03:55,893 --> 01:03:58,646
I don't know if it's the same Kan. I need to see it.

810
01:03:58,759 --> 01:04:00,406
I'm coming with you.

811
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:03,126
- What about the BBQ?  - Leave that for later.

812
01:04:09,976 --> 01:04:11,206
Mrs. Wan?

813
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:12,997
Yes?

814
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,267
Please sit down.

815
01:04:20,677 --> 01:04:23,526
Un is running the company in Mr. Prawit's place, right?

816
01:04:24,643 --> 01:04:26,286
- She is.  - That's good.

817
01:04:26,548 --> 01:04:27,766
A woman is running the company.

818
01:04:27,879 --> 01:04:30,966
They say women understand things better than men.

819
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:35,263
If Un gets married to Kuer,

820
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:37,846
will she be working for C-Itsara?

821
01:04:39,006 --> 01:04:40,426
I don't know.

822
01:04:41,718 --> 01:04:45,406
I think it would be good if Un works for JP for now.

823
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,566
I heard Un is very talented.

824
01:04:50,235 --> 01:04:53,526
When Phim's son grows up, he can learn from Un.

825
01:04:53,692 --> 01:04:55,340
And then he can succeed her.

826
01:04:56,308 --> 01:04:59,046
In the future, Un might not want to work.

827
01:04:59,138 --> 01:05:01,846
She might just want to spend the money with Kuer and live comfortably.

828
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:04,298
Don't forget!

829
01:05:04,436 --> 01:05:06,846
We still have my son, Rit.

830
01:05:06,962 --> 01:05:11,126
You two can't decide this on your own.

831
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:14,646
Apparently, before Father got sick,

832
01:05:14,918 --> 01:05:18,226
he said he would fire Un and replace her with Rit.

833
01:05:22,527 --> 01:05:24,527
If Father thinks Rit is capable,

834
01:05:25,126 --> 01:05:27,286
he wouldn't have picked Un in the first place.

835
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:31,126
I agree with Mrs. Wan.

836
01:05:33,766 --> 01:05:36,166
Your daughter doesn't even have the right.

837
01:05:36,427 --> 01:05:38,046
The son in her womb does.

838
01:05:40,998 --> 01:05:42,845
He's Noot's son.

839
01:05:42,954 --> 01:05:45,620
He's Mr. Prawit's biological great-grandson.

840
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:48,646
I think the one who doesn't have the right

841
01:05:48,921 --> 01:05:51,166
is probably Rit, right?

842
01:06:05,913 --> 01:06:07,913
So you ran from your mom to me?

843
01:06:13,006 --> 01:06:15,166
Inheritance is all my mom talks about.

844
01:06:15,329 --> 01:06:19,086
Grandfather is still alive, and she's already claiming it.

845
01:06:20,932 --> 01:06:23,886
It's yours. It's your baby's.

846
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:26,606
She's protecting your benefit. That's natural.

847
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:31,006
I don't want Jangwangprawas' inheritance anymore.

848
01:06:32,533 --> 01:06:34,166
It doesn't make me happy.

849
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,966
You want Choenitsarachai's inheritance instead, don't you?

850
01:06:45,326 --> 01:06:49,046
What's the happiness in loving someone who doesn't love you?

851
01:06:51,246 --> 01:06:53,846
If your mom finds out you're still after Kuer,

852
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:55,606
that will be a big deal.

853
01:06:56,754 --> 01:06:58,046
I don't care.

854
01:07:02,566 --> 01:07:03,846
What have you done?

855
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:10,126
I misled Tony.

856
01:07:10,686 --> 01:07:12,286
He believes Kuer got me pregnant

857
01:07:12,566 --> 01:07:16,006
and left me. I can't really say it's Kuer's baby.

858
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:19,006
I have to make everyone else think it's Noot's at the same time.

859
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:22,126
After all, I got pregnant while married to Noot.

860
01:07:25,268 --> 01:07:26,766
I know it's wrong.

861
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:30,470
If Un still loves Kuer,

862
01:07:32,334 --> 01:07:34,606
he will never look at me.

863
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:39,566
If Un doesn't want Kuer, I still have a chance.

864
01:07:40,646 --> 01:07:44,326
Are you expecting Tony to tell Un that?

865
01:07:56,827 --> 01:08:01,926
JP's group chat was talking about Kuer and Un fighting out front.

866
01:08:02,527 --> 01:08:04,926
Un left the office with another man.

867
01:08:05,409 --> 01:08:06,966
That's probably Tony.

868
01:08:07,128 --> 01:08:08,128
Really?

869
01:08:13,149 --> 01:08:14,446
Yesterday,

870
01:08:15,003 --> 01:08:18,286
Un seemed to notice the earrings Kuer gave me.

871
01:08:20,173 --> 01:08:22,006
This might ignite the flame I need.

872
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:33,086
I want to ask about the earrings you were wearing.

873
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:34,606
Are you sure you want to hear it?

874
01:08:34,784 --> 01:08:37,846
I have to remove you as Vice President no matter what.

875
01:08:40,638 --> 01:08:42,638
Kuer and I have known each other for a long time.

876
01:08:43,451 --> 01:08:46,046
We could have been seeing each other

877
01:08:46,365 --> 01:08:48,886
somewhere other than that golf course, couldn't we?

878
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,526
I would like Mrs. Prawing and everyone in the house to take a DNA test.
