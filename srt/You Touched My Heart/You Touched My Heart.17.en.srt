1
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:38,246
Where do you think you're going?

2
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:40,766
We can talk about this, Mr. Rit.

3
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:48,406
If she delivers this baby, every wealth of ours will be his.

4
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:51,566
A child born to a dead mother

5
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:52,948
won't be happy anyway.

6
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:55,486
I will probably have a chance to survive.

7
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,166
What did Kan say?

8
00:02:57,397 --> 00:03:00,366
Mr. Rit and Mrs. Wing are probably the masterminds behind everything.

9
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:04,606
I would like Mrs. Prawing and everyone in the house to take a DNA test.

10
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:06,574
Everything is done.

11
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:08,806
We will take our leave.

12
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,915
Rit, you tell me to keep an eye on Un's letter.

13
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,846
A letter was sent to her.

14
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:29,406
I missed my chance.

15
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,886
I was about to open it, but Gade snatched it from me.

16
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:35,406
Did you see the sender's name?

17
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:37,366
I took a glance at it.

18
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:40,486
His name was Thoedsak or something.

19
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:50,086
What is it, Un?

20
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:54,566
Kan said

21
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:57,446
the reason Noot died

22
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:00,406
was probably because of Rit.

23
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:04,566
Rit said he left home before Noot did.

24
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,046
I'm not sure.

25
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,846
Kan is confident his father's death

26
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,566
wasn't an accident.

27
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:14,406
Aunt Wing was behind it.

28
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:19,966
Prawing?

29
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,606
Yes.

30
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:26,301
The person who Kan saw fixing Dad's car

31
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,725
right before his accident

32
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:31,326
was the same person who attacked Kan.

33
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:34,246
He tried to kill Kan

34
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:37,726
because Kan overheard Aunt Wing talking on the phone.

35
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,566
She said, "Take care of Phim"

36
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:42,086
before Phim had the accident.

37
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,206
I don't understand.

38
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,006
Why did Aunt Wing kill Dad?

39
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,726
Your grandfather has two children. Your dad and Prawing.

40
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,566
I think your grandfather wanted to give his son everything.

41
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,646
Without your dad,

42
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:12,006
Prawing will get everything.

43
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:16,686
I was pregnant with you.

44
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:19,006
Chana, Noot's mother, was here too.

45
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:22,997
Your grandfather probably forgot to include Prawing in the will.

46
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:25,766
That's why.

47
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:28,685
When Noot's mother died,

48
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,086
Prawing immediately volunteered to raise Noot.

49
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:34,589
He was the only heir to Jangwangprawas.

50
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,166
Dad's case went cold long ago.

51
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,606
We can't catch her with that now.

52
00:05:56,126 --> 00:06:01,046
We might be able to catch her for attempting to kill Kan and Phim.

53
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:06,926
I'll talk to Mrs. Phat.

54
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:09,006
I'll try talking to her.

55
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,526
Anyway, you have to be careful.

56
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:16,806
Someone like that can never be trusted.

57
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,046
Hey! What exactly happened?

58
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:40,646
It's nothing, Mom. It's just formal DNA testing.

59
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:43,086
Is that really all?

60
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:45,234
If they're not suspecting me, why would they test me?

61
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:48,166
I don't go out. I'm at home all the time. Everyone is a witness.

62
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,126
Just let them do their thing, Mom!

63
00:06:58,022 --> 00:06:59,326
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:05,046
Hey.

65
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:09,046
Why are you so anxious about this?

66
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:21,886
I'll be staying at the apartment.

67
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:55,086
Is there a day that you don't have to work?

68
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,766
No, I need to work for money.

69
00:07:58,126 --> 00:07:59,886
Yeah, you do.

70
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:02,686
Are they eating downstairs?

71
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:06,334
I think no one wants to eat today.

72
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,646
Why? What's going on?

73
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,086
Mrs. Phat.

74
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:39,446
Are you waiting for Phim?

75
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:41,766
Yes.

76
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:44,526
Come and sit, please.

77
00:08:57,085 --> 00:09:00,526
Our children probably don't realize it.

78
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:03,286
No matter how old they are,

79
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,886
they're still kids in their moms' eyes.

80
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:22,566
I want to talk to you about Phim's accident that hospitalized her.

81
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:26,646
What about it?

82
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:32,686
I believe it wasn't an accident.

83
00:09:36,686 --> 00:09:39,566
Be careful. That is all I have to say.

84
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,646
Okay. Thanks a lot.

85
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:10,126
What happened, Dad?

86
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,286
Where are you going?

87
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,206
I'll be away for a while.

88
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,148
Is something wrong?

89
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:19,886
If the police come for me, tell them I'm out of town.

90
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:22,806
What have you done?

91
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:29,006
We'll talk later.

92
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,926
I'll contact you once I find a place to stay.

93
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,926
Un.

94
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,726
Can we move out to Kuer's house tonight?

95
00:10:52,446 --> 00:10:53,806
No!

96
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:57,366
What if that mother and son get crazy and

97
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:00,006
sneak in to slit our throats?

98
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:02,726
You're overthinking.

99
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:07,326
I'll pack my stuff now. You take a shower and pack up.

100
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:11,566
When you're done, we will either get a hotel room or go to Kuer's house.

101
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:21,766
There's a letter for you.

102
00:11:28,126 --> 00:11:32,166
The purchasing budget is in a separate folder. Everything is in this box.

103
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,029
(I sent you the files of the real accounting documents)

104
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,326
(before they were edited.)

105
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:54,006
(Mr. Rit has been forging the accounts to scam the company.)

106
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:56,046
(I helped him.)

107
00:11:57,262 --> 00:11:59,286
(Please ask the police)

108
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:01,414
(to put me in a witness protection program.)

109
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,566
Rit, you changed your mind. Will you stay with me tonight?

110
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:44,966
That's good. I miss you.

111
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,086
What's wrong, Rit?

112
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:04,806
Noom sent something to Un.

113
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:10,086
I think it's not good for us.

114
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:24,926
You're not getting away.

115
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:28,286
Even if I die,

116
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,926
I won't let you get away.

117
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,566
You'll be dead. What can you do to me?

118
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:39,246
Ah!

119
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:01,926
How did you leave your home?

120
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:04,926
We just packed up and snuck out.

121
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:17,246
The police found Noom's body.

122
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,006
Did he commit suicide?

123
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:22,726
I don't know. We're waiting for forensics.

124
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:27,406
I want you to open this flash drive.

125
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:29,806
Is this the one Noom sent you?

126
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,102
Yes.

127
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:39,006
These files are previous annual accounting.

128
00:14:39,606 --> 00:14:42,766
That means they were the original before they were edited.

129
00:14:43,158 --> 00:14:46,486
That's why Noom asked to be in the witness protection program.

130
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:56,086
Sa, are you still up?

131
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:57,886
I've been waiting for you.

132
00:14:58,126 --> 00:15:01,166
Oh? You're curious.

133
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:02,686
That's just part of it.

134
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:04,686
What do you want then?

135
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,446
Take a shower and tell me.

136
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:10,686
I'll take a shower then.

137
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,126
I'm sleeping with you.

138
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:18,766
Do you want more of last night?

139
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:22,646
We slept together once, so I didn't want to sleep alone.

140
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:27,206
Okay. Let's go. I'll take a shower.

141
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:30,046
Let's go.

142
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:46,398
Well, I'll go to see the boat again tomorrow.

143
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:49,686
I think Mr. Rit is involved somehow.

144
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:54,446
Today, when I went to collect the DNA samples,

145
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,646
his mom looked so suspicious.

146
00:15:58,533 --> 00:15:59,686
Really?

147
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:04,466
Can you stop talking about work for a minute?

148
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:07,246
Why? I thought you wanted to know.

149
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:09,886
You're usually the one who keeps asking.

150
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:14,726
I do want to know.

151
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,566
But I want you to take a shower more.

152
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:22,397
If you're tired, go to bed. Why would you wait for me?

153
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,806
You waited for me, and now you're rushing me. What is it?

154
00:16:28,173 --> 00:16:29,406
I'm not tired.

155
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:35,366
If you don't go in the shower,

156
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:37,526
I'll go in and clean you up.

157
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:42,004
Are you serious?

158
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,406
I'm waiting to wash your back.

159
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:51,366
- Let's go!  - Sa!

160
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:11,926
What's the matter, officer?

161
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:13,646
Is Mr. Artit here?

162
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:16,446
What's the matter?

163
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,886
Whose motorcycle parts are these?

164
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:24,726
What about them?

165
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:28,566
We need to collect those parts as evidence.

166
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:32,406
Is Mr. Artit here?

167
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:35,326
He's out of town.

168
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:08,166
Dad.

169
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:11,726
Dad.

170
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:18,710
Come in.

171
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,886
What's up, Mek?

172
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:33,686
The police came to the home today

173
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:37,486
before I could sell those bike parts.

174
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:41,806
It's fine.

175
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,646
They took them, right?

176
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:46,366
They did.

177
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,126
You're lucky someone told you first.

178
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:55,166
Are you really not running away?

179
00:18:55,949 --> 00:18:57,126
If I run,

180
00:18:58,078 --> 00:18:59,846
I won't make it anyway.

181
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:01,486
Why, Dad?

182
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:15,086
Look here. From what I see, this is the number before it was edited.

183
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,206
Compare it to this.

184
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:21,086
They don't match.

185
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:29,846
What should I do now?

186
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,206
There are many more like this one.

187
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,846
Un, here's your coffee.

188
00:19:37,061 --> 00:19:38,301
Thanks.

189
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:49,046
Here's your coffee.

190
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,006
Thanks.

191
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:57,526
Take this file

192
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:00,646
and the page I marked to Inspector San,

193
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,126
and that letter too.

194
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:04,166
Even if the head of accounting is dead,

195
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:06,526
I think we can still use this as evidence

196
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:08,846
to charge or even arrest Mr. Rit.

197
00:20:10,973 --> 00:20:14,046
If we were to link this to Noot's death,

198
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:16,606
I think it's not solid enough.

199
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:18,294
That's right.

200
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,766
We can catch him for scamming.

201
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:24,886
If you suspect him of murder, we need more

202
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:27,406
to prove that Rit could have done it.

203
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,726
But still, even with these files,

204
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:35,486
Rit might blame it on the dead, such as Noom.

205
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:40,166
The dead get blamed all the time.

206
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:43,086
Noot killed himself.

207
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,686
Noom probably "killed himself" too,

208
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:48,646
if he hadn't sent this letter to ask for witness protection.

209
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:50,326
If it's as Gade says,

210
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:53,886
it looks like the suspect is trying to cover up both cases.

211
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:56,646
Rit is the one behind the accounting scam.

212
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,406
If it's linked to the murders as we think, that means

213
00:21:01,517 --> 00:21:05,686
Noot died because he dug up the accounting for the joint venture.

214
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:11,286
It's possible that Rit is behind both Noot and Noom's death.

215
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:18,886
Why would Rit want that money? It's too much.

216
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:24,646
Right...

217
00:21:25,644 --> 00:21:27,446
Oh, hi!

218
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,766
You're all here.

219
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:35,766
Father.

220
00:21:35,997 --> 00:21:38,166
Are you going to work straight away?

221
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:41,206
You can fire Un and replace her with Rit.

222
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:42,686
What does that have to do with you?

223
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,406
Why does the company concern you?

224
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:56,606
I'll rest for a few days and go back to work.

225
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:59,806
You still can't move the right side of your body.

226
00:21:59,966 --> 00:22:02,526
- I think you should...  - Even if I can't move,

227
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:05,166
I can still work.

228
00:22:06,964 --> 00:22:08,126
Let's go.

229
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:10,406
Phim.

230
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,006
How are you?

231
00:22:18,126 --> 00:22:19,606
I'm fine, Grandfather.

232
00:22:30,206 --> 00:22:31,966
Take good care of my great-grandson.

233
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:34,886
When he's born,

234
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,766
I'll give him everything as promised.

235
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:44,966
Yes.

236
00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:47,806
I'll take good care of him.

237
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:51,126
Me and Noot's son will be healthy.

238
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:56,926
Take me to my room.

239
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,966
Why are you following me?

240
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:25,686
We need to talk.

241
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:27,246
About what?

242
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:32,310
Why did you slap me?

243
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:37,286
How dare you?

244
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:40,846
Hey! This is not enough

245
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,470
compared to what you have done to my child!

246
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,726
What did I do?

247
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:47,526
You sent someone to attack her and kill her baby.

248
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:53,726
I want to talk to you about Phim's accident that hospitalized her.

249
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,006
- What about it?  - I believe it wasn't an accident.

250
00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:01,526
I heard this from Un. It's about Mrs. Wing.

251
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:05,167
Mrs. Wing?

252
00:24:05,566 --> 00:24:08,446
She hires someone to kill Phim's baby

253
00:24:09,694 --> 00:24:12,726
because she doesn't want another heir to compete with Rit.

254
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:25,286
This malicious thought is expected of Mrs. Prawing.

255
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,726
How did Un find out about this?

256
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:34,486
Mrs. Wing tailed and attacked Un's driver.

257
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,446
I don't know why.

258
00:24:37,638 --> 00:24:39,406
He's lucky to survive.

259
00:24:41,325 --> 00:24:43,726
You're delusional. Do you have proof?

260
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:46,246
I don't have it today, but I might have it tomorrow.

261
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:49,526
If you lay even a finger on my daughter again,

262
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:52,366
the one who gets hurt badly will be you!

263
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:05,126
Did she say that because she found out?

264
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:07,086
If she did,

265
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:09,006
that means Un told her.

266
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:15,966
If Un knew this, the police must know about Artit too.

267
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:27,286
The mother of Nam's boyfriend hired me to kill a driver of Jangwangprawas

268
00:25:27,837 --> 00:25:29,926
because he knew that she hired me

269
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,326
to attack Phim and kill her baby.

270
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:37,406
That family is not normal, Dad.

271
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:39,046
They harm ones of their own.

272
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:42,046
If the money is big enough,

273
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,966
it can change people.

274
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:47,726
Are you really not running away?

275
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:53,606
I will, but not now.

276
00:25:54,757 --> 00:25:58,686
I'll make sure they don't blame it on you and Nam.

277
00:25:58,968 --> 00:26:00,806
What do you mean, Dad?

278
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:05,405
I'm worried about Nam.

279
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:07,806
You said the other day

280
00:26:10,157 --> 00:26:13,486
that you and Nam helped him out of the boat where someone died.

281
00:26:14,246 --> 00:26:15,646
From what you told me,

282
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:17,686
I think he killed that person.

283
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:21,046
I don't believe he'll confess,

284
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:22,678
even if he gets caught.

285
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:29,486
I fear he will blame you and Nam for it.

286
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:19,726
Here are your pills, Father.

287
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:38,286
Thanks.

288
00:27:42,582 --> 00:27:45,686
I can arrest Rit with this. As for Noot,

289
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:47,526
we can charge him.

290
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:51,806
File a scamming report to the police tomorrow.

291
00:27:51,966 --> 00:27:53,726
We will proceed from there.

292
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:57,446
It shouldn't have come this far, San.

293
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:04,246
It's just money. It changed my cousin into someone completely different.

294
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:08,529
This might be who he has always been.

295
00:28:08,806 --> 00:28:10,246
Money

296
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:11,846
just made it obvious.

297
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:15,425
By the way,

298
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:18,806
I sent my men to Artit's house this morning.

299
00:28:19,256 --> 00:28:21,926
His son said he was out of town.

300
00:28:22,271 --> 00:28:24,806
What should we do now?

301
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:26,646
Do you know

302
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:28,246
what my men found?

303
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:32,686
What did they find, San?

304
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:35,086
They found the remains of Kan's motorcycle.

305
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:37,686
Did he flee?

306
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:39,566
I don't know.

307
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:42,886
Do you have evidence to arrest him now?

308
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:46,206
I just got it this morning from my men.

309
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:48,806
At first, I sent them just to question him,

310
00:28:48,973 --> 00:28:50,846
but they found his son

311
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,406
trying to sell those bike parts, so they confiscated them.

312
00:28:55,536 --> 00:28:56,846
What's this all about?

313
00:28:57,521 --> 00:28:59,966
It doesn't sound like it's just accounting.

314
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,086
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

315
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:11,046
Yesterday, I thought about Noot's case all night.

316
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:12,646
I tried to piece it together.

317
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:16,566
Were Rit and Noot really on that boat?

318
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:19,099
If Rit was really on that boat,

319
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:21,206
and the murder happened,

320
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:24,846
the boat would have been floating at sea. How did he get out?

321
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:26,366
That's easy.

322
00:29:26,794 --> 00:29:28,286
Another boat was there to pick him up.

323
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:31,606
Gade, if it's that easy,

324
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:33,566
San would have closed the case already.

325
00:29:35,171 --> 00:29:36,456
Seriously, Un.

326
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,860
I had Gade's idea at first.

327
00:29:39,206 --> 00:29:43,446
This morning I called Man to ask if another boat was there that night.

328
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:45,566
Do you mean the one who works at the harbor?

329
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:49,286
The one called Man works at the harbor.

330
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:53,166
He oversees all of Jangwangprawas' ferries to the island.

331
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:55,046
He said there were two boats that night.

332
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:56,926
One was Noot's.

333
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,846
You drove the other one.

334
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,246
That's a dead end.

335
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:08,806
It's still inconclusive. There are harbors nearby.

336
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:11,486
I got something from the one called Man.

337
00:30:12,656 --> 00:30:14,486
I'll ask you again.

338
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:17,806
Every time Noot took his boat out, how did he do that?

339
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,326
It's as I told you

340
00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:22,206
the last time you questioned me.

341
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:24,846
Mr. Noot kept the key to his boat.

342
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:27,566
I only have the spare keys. I usually

343
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:29,606
got the boat ready for him

344
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:31,766
and detached the anchor before he arrived.

345
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,006
What if the boat had problems? What would you do?

346
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:36,846
I can access the boat easily.

347
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:39,246
The other mechanics can be called too.

348
00:30:43,336 --> 00:30:45,576
The tools on the boat.

349
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:48,526
Is this all of it?

350
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,380
Go on. Don't stall.

351
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,566
You said you liked me stalling.

352
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:04,766
That's for other stuff.

353
00:31:06,762 --> 00:31:08,726
- Don't tell me...  - We hooked up.

354
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:13,526
They know now!

355
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:17,406
So honest.

356
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,286
You're awesome.

357
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:22,846
I'm telling you honestly so that you don't have to ask.

358
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,566
Go on.

359
00:31:26,691 --> 00:31:31,526
Man said something was missing from the photo.

360
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:33,366
What was missing, San?

361
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:35,086
A pair of mechanic's gloves.

362
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:38,406
Does that mean someone else was on that boat?

363
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:39,926
Yes.

364
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:42,446
I sent my men to recheck the boat

365
00:31:42,686 --> 00:31:44,966
and focus on fingerprints.

366
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,299
If the gloves were missing,

367
00:31:47,504 --> 00:31:51,486
that means the suspect probably opened the toolbox without gloves.

368
00:32:11,242 --> 00:32:12,406
I'm glad

369
00:32:12,686 --> 00:32:14,126
I kept these from that day.

370
00:32:21,078 --> 00:32:22,238
Is there a problem with your boat?

371
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,686
Yes, there is.

372
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:25,806
I'll call in a mechanic tomorrow.

373
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:28,240
Okay.

374
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:36,406
Thank you, Mek.

375
00:32:36,787 --> 00:32:40,366
If you want a mechanic to come back for the boat, tell me. I'll drive them.

376
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:41,669
Okay.

377
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,206
I'll go back to my boat now.

378
00:32:45,457 --> 00:32:46,606
Let's go.

379
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,966
What's this? Are we eating here?

380
00:33:50,423 --> 00:33:51,566
Yes, Mom.

381
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:56,886
Let's go.

382
00:34:12,987 --> 00:34:15,326
Good morning, Mom.

383
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:20,632
Mom?

384
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:27,406
Nam and I are dating.

385
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,246
I'll prepare the food.

386
00:34:48,606 --> 00:34:49,926
Is this her house?

387
00:34:52,783 --> 00:34:54,126
It's ours.

388
00:34:56,086 --> 00:34:57,286
Ours?

389
00:35:07,994 --> 00:35:09,086
Rit.

390
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:13,326
Don't tell me

391
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:16,806
you built this house with the company's money.

392
00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:20,486
You told me that

393
00:35:20,616 --> 00:35:22,486
you had a problem at the company.

394
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:25,766
Noot tried to blame you for the accounting mistakes.

395
00:35:26,551 --> 00:35:27,906
You told me that day.

396
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:29,846
What's wrong, my dear?

397
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,686
What did they do to you?

398
00:35:31,872 --> 00:35:33,166
It's Noot, Mom.

399
00:35:35,555 --> 00:35:36,766
Why?

400
00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:38,366
What did Noot do?

401
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,566
He reviewed the accounts.

402
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,686
He accused me of scamming the company.

403
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:50,886
I think he's trying to blame it on me.

404
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:53,715
Why would he do that?

405
00:35:53,805 --> 00:35:56,166
I think he likes the woman I'm in love with.

406
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:58,246
Who is it?

407
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,006
Nam.

408
00:36:01,217 --> 00:36:02,526
She's his assistant.

409
00:36:03,984 --> 00:36:06,286
Nam, you were Noot's assistant, weren't you?

410
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:12,726
Yes.

411
00:36:13,865 --> 00:36:14,879
Rit.

412
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:16,886
We need to talk.

413
00:36:36,366 --> 00:36:37,366
Stop.

414
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:40,526
Did you have anything to do with Noot's death?

415
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:43,326
Why are you asking me that?

416
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,416
Money and a woman.

417
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,806
Noot caught you scamming the company

418
00:36:51,005 --> 00:36:52,966
when he reviewed those papers, right?

419
00:36:56,286 --> 00:36:57,406
Mom.

420
00:36:58,406 --> 00:36:59,926
I brought you here

421
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:03,526
because I wanted to tell you that I built this house for us.

422
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,839
Did you build this house for us, or did you cause trouble for us?

423
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,206
How dare you!

424
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:11,606
Do you realize this? If Noot were alive,

425
00:37:11,794 --> 00:37:13,486
we'd still get a share of his inheritance.

426
00:37:13,587 --> 00:37:15,686
If you did this, we'd get nothing!

427
00:37:15,886 --> 00:37:20,326
Do you know why I was swallowing my pride to raise Noot?

428
00:37:20,646 --> 00:37:25,326
That's to build a future for the two of us! How could you do this to me?

429
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:29,726
Are you still choosing Noot even now?

430
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:35,846
He's dead.

431
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:38,486
You only have me.

432
00:37:45,326 --> 00:37:47,046
The whole time Noot was alive,

433
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,366
I knew you loved him more than me.

434
00:37:54,784 --> 00:37:56,606
I couldn't do anything about it.

435
00:37:59,602 --> 00:38:00,766
Rit?

436
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:07,726
Grandfather was never fair to us.

437
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:13,666
I know you're a daughter,

438
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:17,126
but you're still his child.

439
00:38:19,725 --> 00:38:21,446
I'm his grandson too.

440
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:26,846
He never thought we were important.

441
00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:31,206
He saw us as little bugs.

442
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:35,726
He made us work for him.

443
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:39,926
Yet we don't get rewarded like Uncle Vee's kids.

444
00:38:44,235 --> 00:38:46,235
Even when Noot died,

445
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:51,606
Grandfather chose to give the company to Un over me!

446
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:57,406
Do you think what Grandfather did was right?

447
00:39:01,912 --> 00:39:03,046
Rit.

448
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:05,926
I'm sorry, my dear.

449
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,846
I'm sorry.

450
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,886
I'm sorry, my dear,

451
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:25,566
that I never told you

452
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:31,206
how much I love you.

453
00:39:34,802 --> 00:39:36,686
I just want to say

454
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:41,366
that I never loved Noot more than you.

455
00:39:43,777 --> 00:39:45,886
Everything I did,

456
00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:48,114
do you know why I did it?

457
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,206
I did it for the two of us.

458
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,366
I'm sorry, my son.

459
00:40:18,485 --> 00:40:19,486
Mom.

460
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:24,806
I think Un found out about the accounting.

461
00:40:27,936 --> 00:40:30,686
I'm telling you about this house right now

462
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:35,286
because I might be away for a while.

463
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:37,686
Why?

464
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:40,286
Are you running away?

465
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:42,726
Rit.

466
00:40:42,926 --> 00:40:44,206
If you run,

467
00:40:45,966 --> 00:40:48,126
you'll be running for the rest of your life.

468
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,246
What would you have me do?

469
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:53,326
Should I stay and get caught?

470
00:40:55,024 --> 00:40:56,566
I scammed

471
00:40:57,696 --> 00:40:59,126
and killed.

472
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,366
My son.

473
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,966
Rit.

474
00:41:25,778 --> 00:41:26,846
Please.

475
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:28,806
Tell me.

476
00:41:30,806 --> 00:41:32,406
What exactly

477
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:35,006
happened on that day?

478
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:45,046
I fought with Noot that day.

479
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:52,246
Noot found out that I had scammed the company.

480
00:41:56,518 --> 00:41:59,246
He told me to confess to Grandfather, or he'd tell him.

481
00:42:00,762 --> 00:42:04,406
I left home before he did. I went to Nam's.

482
00:42:05,296 --> 00:42:07,006
I wanted to ask her what I should do.

483
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,046
Soon after, I changed my mind.

484
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,286
I drove to see Noot at the harbor.

485
00:42:19,326 --> 00:42:21,246
I didn't want to let this go.

486
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:24,086
I wanted to talk to him and settle it.

487
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,326
I'm taking the boat out.

488
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,406
Man is not at the harbor.

489
00:42:39,606 --> 00:42:41,246
I'm telling you so that he knows it's not stolen.

490
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,335
Rit.

491
00:42:56,434 --> 00:42:58,740
Can you not tell Grandfather about the accounting?

492
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,126
I can,

493
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:07,926
if you tell him yourself.

494
00:43:19,886 --> 00:43:21,686
Have you not earned enough?

495
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:24,326
Why are you doing this to me?

496
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:26,806
You're doing this to yourself.

497
00:43:26,965 --> 00:43:29,329
What did I do? I'm just telling the truth.

498
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:32,086
If you didn't scam us,

499
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:34,086
this wouldn't have happened.

500
00:43:34,798 --> 00:43:36,246
I scammed?

501
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:38,966
I just took what I deserved!

502
00:43:42,448 --> 00:43:44,246
I'll give you time to think.

503
00:43:44,976 --> 00:43:46,976
I'll drop you off at the harbor.

504
00:43:47,395 --> 00:43:49,086
I'll be home after I'm done on the island.

505
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:16,806
Nam, please come and pick me up.

506
00:45:19,006 --> 00:45:22,006
The morning after that, everyone found out Noot had died.

507
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:26,926
I didn't mean to kill him, Mom.

508
00:45:40,668 --> 00:45:42,246
I'll take care of this,

509
00:45:43,689 --> 00:45:45,689
but you have to promise me

510
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,966
that you'll do exactly as I say.

511
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,206
Someone's here to see you, Inspector.

512
00:46:06,412 --> 00:46:08,412
- Who is it?  - It's Mrs. Prawing, sir.

513
00:46:13,889 --> 00:46:17,206
I think you know that on the day you collected the DNA samples,

514
00:46:17,381 --> 00:46:18,806
I seemed suspicious.

515
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:22,726
Are you trying to tell me something, Mrs. Wing?

516
00:46:24,397 --> 00:46:25,566
Well...

517
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:31,126
Rit was with Noot on the boat the night he died.

518
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:35,646
I fear that my son will be suspected.

519
00:46:35,846 --> 00:46:39,406
That's why I didn't tell you this in the first place.

520
00:46:39,646 --> 00:46:42,646
But today, I'll talk to you about this.

521
00:46:43,915 --> 00:46:46,566
You mean Mr. Rit was the one who killed Mr. Noot?

522
00:46:46,787 --> 00:46:47,986
No, sir.

523
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:52,486
Rit found out

524
00:46:52,631 --> 00:46:57,526
that Noot had an affair with Nam. They had a fight.

525
00:46:59,326 --> 00:47:02,406
Noot seemed to be bored of Nam.

526
00:47:02,714 --> 00:47:05,206
He broke up with Nam, but Nam couldn't accept it.

527
00:47:05,347 --> 00:47:09,006
Rit got on that boat to try to talk to him the night he died.

528
00:47:09,646 --> 00:47:10,646
Noot.

529
00:47:10,983 --> 00:47:12,246
I beg you.

530
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:13,541
Leave Nam alone.

531
00:47:13,991 --> 00:47:15,606
She is my girlfriend.

532
00:47:18,758 --> 00:47:20,126
She flirted with me.

533
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,466
I can't just ignore her, you know.

534
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:27,246
Noot was heading to Phiman Island

535
00:47:27,998 --> 00:47:29,446
to see Phim.

536
00:47:29,696 --> 00:47:33,749
Nam got there on her brother's fishing boat.

537
00:47:34,286 --> 00:47:35,886
They met on the island.

538
00:47:36,126 --> 00:47:41,766
Mek and Nam got on Noot's boat to talk to him.

539
00:47:41,923 --> 00:47:43,806
Nam and Noot had a fight.

540
00:47:43,936 --> 00:47:45,936
I'm not breaking up!

541
00:47:46,523 --> 00:47:48,686
I'm breaking up with you. What can you do?

542
00:47:49,238 --> 00:47:51,206
You said I'll be your wife.

543
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:53,732
You said you're getting a divorce.

544
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,385
I won't break up!

545
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,686
Nam!

546
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,526
Were you always going to leave me?

547
00:48:08,446 --> 00:48:11,286
Do you think someone like you can be my wife?

548
00:48:12,337 --> 00:48:14,337
Have you ever looked at yourself?

549
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:22,366
You guys go back to your boat.

550
00:48:23,755 --> 00:48:25,286
Leave me alone.

551
00:48:28,943 --> 00:48:31,286
If you can shoot me,

552
00:48:31,635 --> 00:48:32,886
do it then!

553
00:48:33,032 --> 00:48:34,286
Do it!

554
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,966
Don't mess with me again.

555
00:48:39,343 --> 00:48:40,726
Mek got so angry

556
00:48:40,846 --> 00:48:42,686
that Noot was leaving his sister.

557
00:48:42,816 --> 00:48:44,286
He angrily pushed Noot

558
00:48:44,357 --> 00:48:47,121
and hit his head on the counter before he...

559
00:48:47,214 --> 00:48:48,595
Don't shoot!

560
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,046
My son

561
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:03,806
is a scapegoat for a crime he didn't commit. Is that the right thing?

562
00:49:08,086 --> 00:49:09,686
I heard something about

563
00:49:10,168 --> 00:49:12,366
Mr. Noot and Nam's affair too.

564
00:49:13,129 --> 00:49:15,406
Then you have to help me, sir.

565
00:49:16,366 --> 00:49:18,446
I'll investigate this further.

566
00:49:23,474 --> 00:49:25,474
I have something to ask you, Mrs. Wing.

567
00:49:25,747 --> 00:49:27,166
What is it?

568
00:49:28,016 --> 00:49:30,446
Phim drove her car off the road.

569
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:36,846
What does that have to do with me?

570
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,286
I have a witness

571
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,583
saying you hired someone to cause that.

572
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:48,486
Wait, sir.

573
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:51,286
Anyone can say anything.

574
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:53,686
Do you have any proof?

575
00:49:54,337 --> 00:49:56,806
What about what you said earlier?

576
00:49:57,481 --> 00:49:59,006
Do you have any proof?

577
00:50:24,456 --> 00:50:27,406
Wan, where is your kid?

578
00:50:28,523 --> 00:50:29,686
I don't know.

579
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,446
You don't know, or you don't want to tell me?

580
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:36,486
- I don't want to tell you.  - Why?

581
00:50:37,457 --> 00:50:39,526
I fear for my kid's safety.

582
00:50:39,642 --> 00:50:42,886
Do you have to fear for someone like her?

583
00:50:45,394 --> 00:50:48,006
My daughter found out something she shouldn't have known.

584
00:50:50,246 --> 00:50:52,566
Something that caused trouble for someone.

585
00:50:54,566 --> 00:50:56,126
Someone could go to jail for it.

586
00:51:01,166 --> 00:51:02,926
It's not just someone.

587
00:51:04,276 --> 00:51:05,276
Hey!

588
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:07,246
You're an outsider. What does this concern you?

589
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,206
I wouldn't want any part of it

590
00:51:09,522 --> 00:51:11,522
if it didn't harm my daughter.

591
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:13,846
Your daughter?

592
00:51:14,064 --> 00:51:15,686
What harm came to your daughter?

593
00:51:15,814 --> 00:51:17,966
She's pregnant. She does nothing all day.

594
00:51:18,068 --> 00:51:20,166
She just eats and sleeps, goes out, and goes shopping.

595
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:23,166
She's just waiting for her love child to claim the inheritance.

596
00:51:25,664 --> 00:51:27,926
The harm is that someone here

597
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,686
doesn't want my grandson to be born to claim that inheritance.

598
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:40,686
Some people deserve to pay for their sins.

599
00:51:41,246 --> 00:51:43,166
Assault with malicious intent

600
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:45,886
is not just punishable by a 500 baht fine.

601
00:51:47,224 --> 00:51:50,766
Remember that in your thick skull.

602
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:54,366
I'm not the only one who wants you in jail.

603
00:51:54,642 --> 00:51:58,246
A lot more people are trying to convict you and your son.

604
00:51:59,755 --> 00:52:00,846
Wait.

605
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:02,286
Me and my son?

606
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:04,766
My son has nothing to do with this.

607
00:52:21,126 --> 00:52:22,366
What did I...

608
00:52:33,624 --> 00:52:37,071
Rit, we need to talk. See you at your house.

609
00:52:44,697 --> 00:52:45,875
My dad is not home.

610
00:52:46,126 --> 00:52:47,406
I told you that already.

611
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:49,006
I'm not here to see Mr. Artit.

612
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,926
I need to ask you a few questions.

613
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:08,446
I took a long leave. I might get fired for this.

614
00:53:09,675 --> 00:53:13,566
I can't go to work and leave you alone anyway.

615
00:53:15,128 --> 00:53:17,926
And you can't go to the resort either.

616
00:53:18,741 --> 00:53:20,741
Or can you?

617
00:53:21,006 --> 00:53:23,086
Mr. Chairman is okay with you now.

618
00:53:27,834 --> 00:53:28,874
Phim.

619
00:53:30,402 --> 00:53:31,526
Phim?

620
00:53:33,646 --> 00:53:34,846
What?

621
00:53:35,717 --> 00:53:37,406
Didn't you hear what I said at all?

622
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,726
Sorry. I wasn't listening. I was thinking about some stuff.

623
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,286
Did you think about Kuer and Un?

624
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,166
If you keep this up,

625
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,736
it will mess up your mental health.

626
00:54:01,954 --> 00:54:04,486
Stress is not good for the baby, you know.

627
00:54:07,663 --> 00:54:10,886
If you can't forget him, go see him and talk to him.

628
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:14,726
Talk to Kuer. Make him say it to you,

629
00:54:15,423 --> 00:54:17,726
so you'll know if it's possible or not.

630
00:54:17,959 --> 00:54:19,766
Don't just stare out into nothing.

631
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:23,006
I don't want to talk to him.

632
00:54:24,882 --> 00:54:26,046
Why?

633
00:54:26,423 --> 00:54:29,086
You want him. You need to talk to him, right?

634
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:32,613
I want to talk to Un.

635
00:54:35,173 --> 00:54:37,406
She's a woman. She probably understands me better.

636
00:54:42,602 --> 00:54:44,326
Will she talk to you then?

637
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:48,646
I don't know. I need to try.

638
00:55:09,296 --> 00:55:10,366
What's wrong, Mom?

639
00:55:10,646 --> 00:55:12,046
Why can't we talk at home?

640
00:55:12,185 --> 00:55:13,395
It's Phattra.

641
00:55:13,527 --> 00:55:15,527
She said something like she knew what you did.

642
00:55:15,657 --> 00:55:17,926
I asked her what she knew. She wouldn't say.

643
00:55:19,806 --> 00:55:21,126
What did she say?

644
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:26,006
She said many people are trying to convict you and me!

645
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,966
You and me?

646
00:55:29,282 --> 00:55:30,446
That's right.

647
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:33,686
I don't know where she got this idea.

648
00:55:33,846 --> 00:55:36,526
If I had to guess, she probably heard it from Wan.

649
00:55:36,748 --> 00:55:40,286
Where else could Wan find out, if not from Un?

650
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,286
Rit, what are you doing?

651
00:56:05,846 --> 00:56:08,126
Why would I let anyone hold me back?

652
00:56:10,257 --> 00:56:12,926
I won't let anyone hold me back again.

653
00:56:16,028 --> 00:56:17,286
I want to tell you this.

654
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:19,366
I talked to the police.

655
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:21,846
They didn't seem to believe me.

656
00:56:24,398 --> 00:56:26,686
They went to see Nam's brother at his home.

657
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,486
Really? If that's the case,

658
00:56:29,755 --> 00:56:31,686
we need a backup plan.

659
00:56:31,824 --> 00:56:35,646
The police can't find out about the scam and Noot's death.

660
00:56:38,089 --> 00:56:40,526
There's no evidence in Noot's case.

661
00:56:41,428 --> 00:56:42,766
They only have eyewitnesses.

662
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:46,326
Is that so?

663
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,526
Should I take care of them?

664
00:57:28,744 --> 00:57:31,697
I sent my men to question Nam's family again today.

665
00:57:31,846 --> 00:57:33,526
They took their fingerprints too.

666
00:57:34,095 --> 00:57:35,486
Did you find out anything?

667
00:57:35,893 --> 00:57:38,766
Why did you track down Nam's family?

668
00:57:38,915 --> 00:57:41,326
Mrs. Prawing came to me at the station.

669
00:57:41,644 --> 00:57:42,646
Aunt Wing did?

670
00:57:43,535 --> 00:57:44,926
Why did she come?

671
00:57:46,206 --> 00:57:49,086
Tell us more. Why would you stop at that?

672
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:52,766
I'm eating, you see?

673
00:57:54,068 --> 00:57:55,326
Tell us now.

674
00:57:58,902 --> 00:58:02,006
I can't reveal that yet, but it's about Nam's family.

675
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,166
Nam? Noot's assistant and Rit's girlfriend?

676
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,366
Yes, that's the one.

677
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:11,251
I don't know if Mrs. Prawing was telling the truth.

678
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:14,246
It's a lead in the investigation.

679
00:58:14,352 --> 00:58:17,926
Without her statement, Noot would have been considered alone on that boat.

680
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:20,446
You mean Mrs. Prawing told you that

681
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:23,886
Noot probably wasn't alone on that boat, was he?

682
00:58:24,257 --> 00:58:25,726
I'm not saying that.

683
00:58:26,166 --> 00:58:27,286
What else do you know?

684
00:58:27,471 --> 00:58:31,046
I told my men to investigate further since there was a possibility.

685
00:58:32,515 --> 00:58:35,166
There's one more thing. Do you know?

686
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:38,001
Artit, Nam's father,

687
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,246
was the one who attacked Kan.

688
00:59:20,867 --> 00:59:23,526
It's such a small world, is it?

689
00:59:27,086 --> 00:59:28,766
I'm so hungry.

690
00:59:31,496 --> 00:59:32,686
Bye, Un.

691
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,046
My team is almost done with the editing.

692
00:59:39,354 --> 00:59:40,966
- Are you posting it soon?  - Yeah.

693
00:59:43,817 --> 00:59:45,006
Good luck.

694
00:59:58,976 --> 01:00:00,335
It's done.

695
01:00:00,487 --> 01:00:02,206
What? What's done?

696
01:00:02,543 --> 01:00:03,846
Kuer's video.

697
01:00:04,038 --> 01:00:06,205
In that video, it's obvious how much he loves Un.

698
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,414
She's the one he wants to marry.

699
01:00:08,512 --> 01:00:10,903
When I was about to post the video,

700
01:00:11,006 --> 01:00:12,686
Kuer told me to let him know before I posted it.

701
01:00:12,767 --> 01:00:16,326
I think he wants to see that video with Un.

702
01:00:17,486 --> 01:00:20,446
You sure know a lot about others.

703
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:22,406
I know about myself too.

704
01:00:22,634 --> 01:00:23,886
What do you know?

705
01:00:24,707 --> 01:00:26,006
I know what I want.

706
01:00:26,097 --> 01:00:27,326
What do you want?

707
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,366
I want

708
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,366
to sleep with you every night.

709
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:38,486
Let's go, then. I don't want to sleep alone either.

710
01:00:42,143 --> 01:00:44,006
Let's go! Let's do it!

711
01:00:52,303 --> 01:00:53,303
Un.

712
01:00:54,524 --> 01:00:57,566
I want to talk to you about Phim.

713
01:00:58,246 --> 01:01:00,486
Phim? What about her?

714
01:01:03,511 --> 01:01:06,206
That day at the hospital, I know you still doubt me.

715
01:01:07,046 --> 01:01:08,406
I wasn't

716
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:11,446
able to prove I never hooked up with Phim

717
01:01:11,846 --> 01:01:13,286
before I met you.

718
01:01:16,246 --> 01:01:18,606
I don't want to leave it unsaid.

719
01:01:19,824 --> 01:01:21,466
I want to make it clear

720
01:01:21,939 --> 01:01:23,686
so you can feel at ease.

721
01:01:30,543 --> 01:01:31,966
Our wedding...

722
01:01:33,638 --> 01:01:36,086
Do you still want to marry me?

723
01:01:36,976 --> 01:01:40,926
(How long does it take?)

724
01:01:41,057 --> 01:01:44,846
(You're keeping your heart shut...)

725
01:01:46,926 --> 01:01:48,446
You told me to keep this ring

726
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:53,326
for someone who deserves it.

727
01:01:54,926 --> 01:01:56,046
I think

728
01:01:57,096 --> 01:01:59,726
there's nobody else that

729
01:02:00,369 --> 01:02:02,526
deserves it more than you do.

730
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,846
(I'm willing to prove it all my life.)

731
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:11,686
(Every time I look into those eyes,)

732
01:02:12,006 --> 01:02:14,406
(please believe me.)

733
01:02:15,303 --> 01:02:20,686
(I will never leave your side.)

734
01:02:20,846 --> 01:02:24,646
(You're the one who touched my heart.)

735
01:02:24,766 --> 01:02:28,566
(No one else comes above you.)

736
01:02:28,682 --> 01:02:32,286
(You're my precious thing.)

737
01:02:32,439 --> 01:02:36,076
(I'll keep you well, close to my heart.)

738
01:02:36,246 --> 01:02:39,366
(Only you are the one.)

739
01:02:46,515 --> 01:02:48,635
How could you do this to me, Rit?

740
01:02:48,737 --> 01:02:50,737
I never betrayed you.

741
01:02:50,932 --> 01:02:54,246
Mek told me the police questioned him at home.

742
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,886
About him driving his boat to pick you up that night.

743
01:02:57,449 --> 01:02:59,006
I don't know anything.

744
01:02:59,212 --> 01:03:00,806
How could you not know?

745
01:03:01,108 --> 01:03:02,686
The only people who know this

746
01:03:02,896 --> 01:03:05,806
are you, me, and Mek!

747
01:03:08,174 --> 01:03:11,086
I don't care how. You need to take care of this.

748
01:03:11,546 --> 01:03:14,406
Mek and I won't be anyone's scapegoat.

749
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,638
I'll stay at my dad's tonight.

750
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:22,686
Nam. Please calm down.

751
01:03:23,313 --> 01:03:24,566
Let me go.

752
01:03:25,198 --> 01:03:26,486
You're telling me to calm down

753
01:03:26,572 --> 01:03:29,606
when you blame it on my family?

754
01:03:30,548 --> 01:03:32,326
If you're doing this,

755
01:03:33,406 --> 01:03:35,086
I'll tell Mek

756
01:03:35,289 --> 01:03:37,806
to tell the whole truth about Mr. Noot.

757
01:03:38,933 --> 01:03:41,606
I'll tell the police you scammed the company!

758
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:44,406
Are you threatening me?

759
01:03:50,472 --> 01:03:52,670
I told Mek to come and pick me up.

760
01:03:54,686 --> 01:03:56,366
If I don't come down,

761
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,486
Mek will tell the police immediately.

762
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:10,435
Then just go!

763
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,406
Go wherever you want!

764
01:04:16,655 --> 01:04:17,886
Get out!

765
01:04:37,984 --> 01:04:39,446
Have you had dinner?

766
01:04:39,805 --> 01:04:41,006
We have.

767
01:04:43,277 --> 01:04:46,286
Don't worry about Gade. She's had dinner.

768
01:04:47,326 --> 01:04:48,446
Why?

769
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:50,926
She's sitting here and won't go anywhere.

770
01:04:51,255 --> 01:04:52,566
I'm still glad, though.

771
01:04:52,783 --> 01:04:55,366
She could eat food and drink water on her own.

772
01:04:55,744 --> 01:04:57,926
Otherwise, I'd have to feed her via an IV.

773
01:04:59,136 --> 01:05:01,046
This is how she is when she's focusing on her job.

774
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:03,526
I'll take my leave then.

775
01:05:04,206 --> 01:05:06,206
I'll get Gade out of there myself.

776
01:05:06,406 --> 01:05:09,446
You don't have to, because I'm done!

777
01:05:13,325 --> 01:05:17,006
Do you want to leave because you saw something that hurt your eyes?

778
01:06:13,424 --> 01:06:14,486
Un.

779
01:06:17,111 --> 01:06:18,566
I've done what you asked me to do.

780
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:21,766
I marked the number that was edited in the rest of the files.

781
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,686
Here.

782
01:06:26,407 --> 01:06:27,646
Thank you.

783
01:06:58,735 --> 01:06:59,846
Hello?

784
01:07:01,995 --> 01:07:03,326
Who's that?

785
01:07:03,674 --> 01:07:04,886
Wait a sec.

786
01:07:06,886 --> 01:07:08,046
That was Phim.

787
01:07:09,286 --> 01:07:11,446
She can't sleep, so she called to prank you?

788
01:07:11,951 --> 01:07:13,526
That's a pregnant woman's hormone talking.

789
01:07:34,621 --> 01:07:35,686
What do you want?

790
01:07:36,784 --> 01:07:38,566
Can you come out and talk to me?

791
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:41,286
We can talk on the phone right now.

792
01:07:41,417 --> 01:07:43,086
I don't have to come out and see you.

793
01:07:44,846 --> 01:07:46,686
I have a favor to ask.

794
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:49,921
I'd rather say it to you in person.

795
01:07:51,093 --> 01:07:53,566
Fine. I'll bring my friend with me.

796
01:07:53,766 --> 01:07:55,526
I want to talk about my baby.

797
01:07:56,223 --> 01:07:58,126
I don't want anyone else to hear.

798
01:07:58,366 --> 01:07:59,846
I beg you, Un.

799
01:08:00,961 --> 01:08:03,606
I'm pregnant. I can't harm you.

800
01:08:07,947 --> 01:08:09,606
Can you come alone?

801
01:08:10,485 --> 01:08:12,246
I mean no harm.

802
01:08:14,246 --> 01:08:15,806
I just want to talk.

803
01:09:02,153 --> 01:09:03,606
Where is Un right now?

804
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:06,088
If you want to know where she is, why don't you call her?

805
01:09:06,231 --> 01:09:07,766
Why would you call me?

806
01:09:13,326 --> 01:09:16,206
Promise me, Mr. Kuer, that you will give your statement

807
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:17,846
to save Mek.

808
01:09:17,977 --> 01:09:20,766
If you help me, I promise I'll help you.
