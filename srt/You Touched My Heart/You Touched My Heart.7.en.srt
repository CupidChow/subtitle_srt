1
00:01:45,326 --> 00:01:47,166
It probably got on me when Kuer took his shirt off.

2
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,726
Please give it back to him.

3
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:51,726
- Let me go!  - You can hate me,

4
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:53,446
but you must live with me.

5
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:57,286
The Jangwangprawas family is not just some rich people.

6
00:01:57,453 --> 00:01:59,046
They have powers.

7
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:04,246
I'll be staying with you tonight.

8
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,006
Thank you.

9
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:09,140
Can you at least tell me what you're mad about?

10
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,454
I'm not mad.

11
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:12,714
Phim. Stop! Won't you stay home for a night?

12
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:15,566
I don't even want to breathe the same air as you.

13
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:18,566
Will you divorce me, then?

14
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:20,806
Phim. Noot.

15
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:23,166
Did you get back from Bangkok already?

16
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:30,206
Where are you going again?

17
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:34,886
I'm heading to the resort.

18
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:39,006
I've been in Bangkok for days. I don't know what's going on there.

19
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:41,086
So I want to go and have a look.

20
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:45,586
That's good. Traveling at night is dangerous. You should hurry.

21
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:47,766
Yes.

22
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:54,006
Noot.

23
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,158
We need to talk.

24
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:01,686
Yes.

25
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:19,086
Is everything alright?

26
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,646
Yes.

27
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:25,766
We're just waiting for their senior executives' approval.

28
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:27,846
There shouldn't be a problem.

29
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:29,686
We can't trust them.

30
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:33,326
Because they already went behind our backs once.

31
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:37,086
We can only trust them once we have their signatures.

32
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:44,446
Both Kuer and Un are quite a handful, Grandfather.

33
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:46,966
I know that well.

34
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:54,286
Why don't you bring Un to JP?

35
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:57,846
She won't go back on her word.

36
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:01,246
If you talk to her,

37
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:02,726
- I think...  - Enough about her.

38
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:04,446
Just shut up.

39
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,406
Un is talented.

40
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:09,246
She's smart.

41
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,726
But she's ungrateful.

42
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,046
We don't know when she will betray us.

43
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:19,398
I'm not sure if we should stay close to someone like that

44
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:21,726
or stay away from her.

45
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,366
Yes, Grandfather.

46
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:30,486
If that's all, I'll be excused.

47
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,246
Wait, Noot.

48
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:37,566
It looks like our accounting staff made some miscalculations.

49
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:42,086
Miscalculations?

50
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:45,726
Rit showed me some documents this morning.

51
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:47,974
You should review them tomorrow.

52
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:50,966
Yes.

53
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:53,166
Excuse me.

54
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:29,486
What now?

55
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:31,926
I said you could have the apartment. What do you want now?

56
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:35,566
You need to come back now. If you don't, I'll go to you myself.

57
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:40,246
So you and Kuer are not

58
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:42,926
getting busy under the sheet?

59
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,894
Getting busy under the sheet, my butt!

60
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:47,606
Come up here right now.

61
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:49,646
I told him to sleep on the couch.

62
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:54,486
Great. If I'm really eating until dawn, I'd surely throw up.

63
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:58,166
Bill, please!

64
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:36,966
Miss Gade.

65
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:38,966
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,526
Did I wake you up, Mr. Kuer?

67
00:06:43,723 --> 00:06:44,723
No.

68
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,046
I need your help.

69
00:06:52,606 --> 00:06:53,726
Okay.

70
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,166
I have been waiting for you for so long.

71
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:06,206
You took too long.

72
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,126
Won't you take a shower?

73
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,366
I have something to tell you.

74
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:24,526
Hey! What's wrong with you?

75
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:30,606
It's lonely outside.

76
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:33,011
Can I sleep with you tonight?

77
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,086
No!

78
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:37,686
Gade is coming.

79
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:40,486
She's not.

80
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:42,006
Believe me.

81
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:45,526
I got a free penthouse.

82
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:48,956
Why would I say no?

83
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,246
Tonight, can you

84
00:07:51,446 --> 00:07:53,006
stay at my place?

85
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:57,718
Are you sure?

86
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:01,677
Well,

87
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:06,686
I had a fight with Un. I don't know what she's mad about.

88
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,766
You want to make up with her.

89
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,486
That's right.

90
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:16,886
If she doesn't reconcile with him tonight,

91
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:19,086
then when?

92
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,646
Did you send Gade to your place?

93
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:34,646
I need time to talk to you.

94
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:37,526
I don't want you to stay mad until tomorrow.

95
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:41,566
You're freaking stubborn.

96
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,686
You're freaking stubborn too.

97
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,406
Un.

98
00:08:52,286 --> 00:08:53,686
I'm sorry.

99
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:56,486
I don't know what you're mad about,

100
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:59,726
but I feel uneasy about how you've been mad.

101
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,486
Look.

102
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:07,286
Phim gave this to me.

103
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:12,726
It's your shirt's button.

104
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:20,526
Can you explain to me why this ended up with Phim?

105
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:53,246
He's up early.

106
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:57,446
Or he couldn't sleep?

107
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:04,966
(It's your shirt's button.)

108
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:07,726
Can you explain to me why this ended up with Phim?

109
00:10:33,526 --> 00:10:35,086
So you've been tense because

110
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:37,646
you're jealous?

111
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:45,206
Well, yeah.

112
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:52,766
I went to my room to take a shower. Phim followed me.

113
00:10:52,982 --> 00:10:55,606
I told her my girlfriend wouldn't be okay with that.

114
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:58,246
I really don't know

115
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:00,806
how this button ended up with her.

116
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:05,406
I promised you I wouldn't let her think

117
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:07,366
I was more than friends with her.

118
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:12,566
I don't want her to get the wrong idea.

119
00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:16,726
I don't want you to get the wrong idea either.

120
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:36,766
(How long does it take?)

121
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:40,606
(You're keeping your heart shut.)

122
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:42,246
Now,

123
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:46,782
can you stop being mad at me?

124
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:51,766
(What exactly does it take)

125
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:56,006
(for you to trust in me?)

126
00:11:57,813 --> 00:12:01,886
(I'm willing to prove it all my life.)

127
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:07,606
(Every time I look into those eyes,)

128
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:10,846
(please believe me.)

129
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:16,686
(I will never leave your side.)

130
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:20,526
(You're the one who touched my heart.)

131
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:23,686
(No one else comes above you.)

132
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:26,446
You were mad at him, Un. How did you end up like that?

133
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,766
(I'll keep you well, close to my heart.)

134
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:35,886
(Only you are the one.)

135
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,566
(Nobody else means a thing.)

136
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,406
(Only you are in my heart.)

137
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:45,766
(No matter how long,)

138
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:51,326
(my love is only for you.)

139
00:12:56,766 --> 00:13:00,499
(What kind of person would be so mean)

140
00:13:00,686 --> 00:13:05,030
(that they could hurt their own heart?)

141
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:10,326
(You wouldn't think that I'm that guy.)

142
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:15,766
(Whenever I see your tears,)

143
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:19,966
(the pain in my heart is too much to bear.)

144
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:25,526
(You mean everything to me.)

145
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:31,406
(Every time I look into those eyes,)

146
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:34,526
(please believe me.)

147
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:40,363
(I will never leave your side.)

148
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:44,326
(You're the one who touched my heart.)

149
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:48,206
(No one else comes above you.)

150
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:51,886
(You're my precious thing.)

151
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:55,566
(I'll keep you well, close to my heart.)

152
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,006
Are you still asleep?

153
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:03,286
(Nobody else means a thing.)

154
00:14:03,438 --> 00:14:07,006
(Only you are in my heart.)

155
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:09,246
(No matter how long,)

156
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:14,486
(my love is only for you.)

157
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,046
(You're the one who touched my heart.)

158
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,686
(No one else comes above you.)

159
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,606
(You're my precious thing.)

160
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,446
(I'll keep you well, close to my heart.)

161
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:45,266
(Only you are the one.)

162
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:49,166
(Nobody else means a thing.)

163
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,795
(Only you are in my heart.)

164
00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:55,366
(No matter how long,)

165
00:14:55,476 --> 00:15:00,206
(my love is only for you.)

166
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:14,486
You want the case files about Un's father?

167
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:16,526
Yeah. Why are you surprised?

168
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:19,926
Why wouldn't I be? It's not easy, you know?

169
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:22,866
Nothing is hard for you.

170
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:24,886
You're such a flatterer.

171
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,286
I flatter you because I know you can do it.

172
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:30,926
- Really?  - Stop!

173
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,680
Were you going to drag that until tomorrow?

174
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,406
I was. You know what?

175
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:38,286
What you're asking me to do

176
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:41,486
means I need to reopen the case.

177
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:43,686
I didn't know that.

178
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:45,526
No, you didn't.

179
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:49,406
I'd be reopening the case without any new evidence.

180
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:52,206
I don't even know if the case has gone cold or not.

181
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,646
Sa, that's too suspicious.

182
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:57,646
If you can't even do that as an inspector,

183
00:15:57,869 --> 00:15:59,726
just quit and sell some noodles.

184
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:02,006
If I do this, I won't even get to quit.

185
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,190
They're going to fire me.

186
00:16:05,037 --> 00:16:06,166
You suck.

187
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:07,646
Suck at what?

188
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:12,286
Suck at doing your job. You can't even do me a small favor.

189
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,406
Is this my fault?

190
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:22,246
I reviewed this.

191
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:24,126
There were really some miscalculations.

192
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:29,766
Our accounting double checked it with these documents.

193
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:32,206
There were none.

194
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:34,606
I'm sure I didn't miss anything.

195
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:37,486
The expenditures went up by 30%.

196
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:40,046
It's not just 10%.

197
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:52,046
Did you want to see me, Grandfather?

198
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:55,806
If I didn't, why would I ask for you?

199
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:01,726
Talk to Noot about these accounts.

200
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:06,366
Noot is sure the numbers were wrong.

201
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:12,806
Work it out and report it to me ASAP.

202
00:17:13,654 --> 00:17:14,886
Yes.

203
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,246
Noot.

204
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:28,477
Did I miscalculate anything?

205
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:31,686
There's no way the expenditures went up by 30%.

206
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:36,286
I need to see your calculations first.

207
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,806
Maybe I was the one who miscalculated.

208
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,086
This joint venture is a handful for all of us, right?

209
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:45,845
Yes.

210
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:50,966
How was your meeting in Bangkok with Mr. Kuer?

211
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:52,646
Did it go well?

212
00:17:53,582 --> 00:17:56,026
They seemed fine with our new offer.

213
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,566
I think we'll be closing the deal soon.

214
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:03,846
I'll check these and tell you what I find.

215
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:06,166
Call me if you need anything.

216
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:51,166
Should we take a break? Have some lunch and come back.

217
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:52,646
Nam.

218
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,926
I'm glad I made copies.

219
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:22,006
He just wouldn't give me the information I needed.

220
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:31,806
Good morning.

221
00:19:32,949 --> 00:19:37,206
If you want evidence, this is the place to breach.

222
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:47,726
Mister.

223
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:50,646
- Yes?  - I'm here to see Mr. Chanoot.

224
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:54,238
Mr. Chanoot Jangwangprawas. Where is he?

225
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,366
Are you here to see Noot?

226
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,446
Do you have an appointment?

227
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:02,126
I don't.

228
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:04,846
You should make an appointment next time.

229
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,126
Okay.

230
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:12,406
I'll come again with an appointment.

231
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:23,046
Breach in for evidence?

232
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,838
No way he'd agree to meet me.

233
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:26,486
"What's your meeting about?"

234
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:28,838
"I want to stick my nose into your personal matters."

235
00:20:37,814 --> 00:20:39,886
By the way, who was that staff back there?

236
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:43,086
He just calls Mr. Chanoot "Noot."

237
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,646
It's crowded here.

238
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,646
See you at the restaurant tonight.

239
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:20,846
You disappeared last night.

240
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:23,846
I got to stay in a guy's apartment.

241
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,846
When the guy wasn't there.

242
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:28,486
But he's here.

243
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:30,686
His place is fab, I'll tell you.

244
00:21:30,846 --> 00:21:32,686
It felt like a five-star hotel.

245
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,206
What about you?

246
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:38,086
I gave you two a chance to work it out.

247
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:39,686
Did you?

248
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:49,086
How did it go? You did more than work it out, didn't you?

249
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,686
You told me once

250
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:58,686
that Phim intentionally tried to gain Kuer's sympathy.

251
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:01,406
She's a freaking liar.

252
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:03,846
I saw it with my own eyes. I remember.

253
00:22:04,463 --> 00:22:07,086
She even went into his room.

254
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,326
I didn't know how she got that button of his.

255
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,206
She was probably trying to get in my head.

256
00:22:13,325 --> 00:22:15,006
That's why she asked me to return it to Kuer.

257
00:22:15,949 --> 00:22:18,926
She's such a witch! So cunning.

258
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,346
If I see her, I'll surely give it to her.

259
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:26,926
That's what he explained to me.

260
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:31,926
You were okay with that explanation, right?

261
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:34,606
What did you do after that?

262
00:22:34,877 --> 00:22:40,126
Did you talk like a couple on the same page and get touchy-feely?

263
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,046
Gade!

264
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:48,366
What? Did he push you like you just pushed me?

265
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:50,285
Is Kuer a sadist?

266
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:53,161
Gade! You're fantasizing too much.

267
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:56,246
Did he touch you like this?

268
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,422
That sort of thing didn't happen. You're crazy.

269
00:23:15,598 --> 00:23:16,766
I'm ready.

270
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:19,926
If you're ready, let's go. We need to catch the flight.

271
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:22,846
"If you're ready, let's go. We need to catch the flight."

272
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:26,286
I'll follow you there.

273
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,166
You said that last time.

274
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:31,486
Yet you were stuck with your computer and didn't go.

275
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,493
This time, I will.

276
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:36,286
I think getting stuck with my computer at the beach is better, right?

277
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,526
Please come soon.

278
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:42,366
I don't have any friends there. I'm lonely.

279
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:47,926
You don't have friends, but you got a boyfriend. You won't be lonely.

280
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,246
Gade! You talk too much!

281
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:55,326
Okay. I won't tease you anymore. Just go catch your flight.

282
00:23:56,766 --> 00:23:58,046
I'm off.

283
00:23:58,446 --> 00:23:59,566
Let's go.

284
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:04,326
See you there.

285
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:10,846
I'm jealous. They're holding hands.

286
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:13,686
I told you I'm getting a divorce.

287
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:18,046
I know you want to, but you should think carefully.

288
00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:22,566
He promised you to stop fooling around. Things should be getting better.

289
00:24:23,758 --> 00:24:25,606
You need to give him a chance, don't you?

290
00:24:26,206 --> 00:24:27,686
Isn't it too late?

291
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:29,206
Too late?

292
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:30,566
How so?

293
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:35,886
You don't love him anymore, do you?

294
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:43,406
I think I never loved him in the first place.

295
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,886
It was more like I got excited by a rich man's life.

296
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:50,366
Kuer was never poor, was he?

297
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,446
You're right.

298
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:56,926
Back then, Noot never had a problem with what I wanted.

299
00:24:57,052 --> 00:24:59,052
He bought them for me no matter how expensive they were.

300
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:02,286
He doesn't ask for reasons. He doesn't need anniversaries.

301
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,166
So Noot is a sugar daddy?

302
00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:12,006
And also,

303
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:15,331
my mom wanted me to marry Noot.

304
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:16,606
Why?

305
00:25:20,334 --> 00:25:23,806
Why didn't you get any of my smartness, Phim?

306
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:25,566
I'm dating Kuer, Mom.

307
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:28,326
Kuer didn't do anything wrong.

308
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:29,972
He did.

309
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:33,606
He has to share his inheritance with three siblings.

310
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:35,766
But Noot

311
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:39,846
is the grandson who will inherit all of Jangwangprawas' wealth.

312
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,166
He's so rich you can't spend all his fortune in ten lifetimes.

313
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:46,186
So that's why you wanted me to date Noot?

314
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,046
I want you to have a good life, Phim.

315
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:55,686
I know how suffering it is to be poor.

316
00:25:56,085 --> 00:25:58,046
I only have one daughter.

317
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:01,406
I did everything for you to have the best life.

318
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:05,126
I worked hard to give you the best education and social life.

319
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:07,278
That's for your own future.

320
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,926
You have the right to choose now.

321
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:13,126
Are you not choosing what's best for you?

322
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,766
Did you tell your mom how unhappy you are with this marriage?

323
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:23,326
I did.

324
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:26,646
So your mom is okay with you getting a divorce?

325
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:28,326
She's not.

326
00:26:30,364 --> 00:26:32,166
She said I was stupid.

327
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:34,486
She told me to bear with it.

328
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:40,406
So are you getting a divorce?

329
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:50,006
What you told me the other night...

330
00:26:52,702 --> 00:26:54,366
If you don't want me to be a murderer,

331
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:56,446
stop this behavior.

332
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,526
I think

333
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:01,206
Noot probably won't do it.

334
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:03,926
Who knows?

335
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:05,646
We still need to watch out.

336
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,246
Let's get something to eat after we unpack.

337
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,006
What do you want?

338
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,366
Anything.

339
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,846
The team that's coming from Bangkok,

340
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:20,766
when are they arriving? What time?

341
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:23,526
They will inform us later.

342
00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:25,126
Okay.

343
00:27:28,238 --> 00:27:30,006
When will we get to sleep in the same room?

344
00:27:33,294 --> 00:27:36,926
When Gade comes, she can have a room.

345
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:40,966
Let's talk about this when she gets here.

346
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:50,526
See you downstairs.

347
00:28:01,728 --> 00:28:05,846
You called me out for a drink but haven't looked at my face.

348
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:09,966
Someone else is more interesting.

349
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:12,086
Is someone else more interesting?

350
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,886
Tell me who. Who would be more interesting than me?

351
00:28:15,086 --> 00:28:16,566
That table over there.

352
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:26,966
Wait. That's just an office worker.

353
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:29,093
You wouldn't want to date an office worker.

354
00:28:29,213 --> 00:28:30,653
That's not your type.

355
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,366
It's not like that. I saw him this morning.

356
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:37,646
Are you here to see Noot?

357
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,486
Do you have an appointment?

358
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:42,366
I'll come again with an appointment.

359
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:49,326
Thevarit Suwanphanu.

360
00:28:57,356 --> 00:29:00,046
(Thevarit Suwanphanu)

361
00:29:01,717 --> 00:29:03,006
So that's it.

362
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:07,246
He's a grandson of JP's Prawit.

363
00:29:07,406 --> 00:29:10,086
That's why he calls Mr. Noot "Noot."

364
00:29:13,246 --> 00:29:15,246
Why is his name not Jangwangprawas, then?

365
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:17,526
He's a Jangwangprawas too.

366
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:20,886
Maybe he's using his father's last name.

367
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:23,566
Mr. Prawit has two children.

368
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:27,246
His son is already dead. The other one is a daughter.

369
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:30,486
He might be the son of the chairman's daughter.

370
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:35,046
Why doesn't he use his mother's last name, then? He can brag anywhere.

371
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:37,286
That's what you think.

372
00:29:55,078 --> 00:29:57,326
Do you want to meet Sa and San there?

373
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:00,526
If you want to rest, we can go home. I'll tell them.

374
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:01,966
I can go.

375
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,046
You can go, but do you want to?

376
00:30:06,189 --> 00:30:08,189
I do.

377
00:30:08,294 --> 00:30:09,846
San and Sa are funny.

378
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,486
Listening to them is relaxing.

379
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:14,165
Let's go.

380
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,566
Eat it.

381
00:30:52,204 --> 00:30:54,846
He doesn't have a woman, and he's meeting a man at a bar?

382
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,486
Is he gay?

383
00:30:56,702 --> 00:30:58,766
Don't go around judging people.

384
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:00,766
Even if he's gay,

385
00:31:00,982 --> 00:31:02,246
what's that got to do with you?

386
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:03,646
It does have something to do with me.

387
00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:07,606
- How?  - I'll be his wife. I need to know.

388
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,686
Do you even know him?

389
00:31:15,246 --> 00:31:18,726
No, but maybe in the future, right?

390
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:20,246
Well...

391
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:22,006
Your future

392
00:31:22,686 --> 00:31:24,526
might be uncertain.

393
00:31:25,262 --> 00:31:26,806
What are you talking about?

394
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:32,806
You...

395
00:31:33,046 --> 00:31:34,246
I what?

396
00:31:34,446 --> 00:31:37,406
Just keep stuttering. I don't want to hear it now.

397
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:34,646
Is this the place?

398
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:36,326
San said it's here.

399
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:53,721
Un, don't come out! It's dangerous!

400
00:32:53,948 --> 00:32:56,646
Come here, Un! Get down!

401
00:32:59,806 --> 00:33:01,006
Stay back.

402
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:09,621
Kuer.

403
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:13,046
Sa, call the police!

404
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:16,326
Kuer, are you okay?

405
00:33:17,965 --> 00:33:19,446
Someone shot me.

406
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:12,006
- Stop!  - Take this!

407
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:38,686
- You can go give your statement.  - Thank you.

408
00:35:41,688 --> 00:35:42,879
Are you okay, Kuer?

409
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,166
I'm fine.

410
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:46,781
It's done, sir.

411
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:51,046
Good, lieutenant. Write a report to me. I'll handle this case myself.

412
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,526
Copy that, sir.

413
00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:57,486
You're lucky.

414
00:35:57,806 --> 00:35:59,486
Someone saved you.

415
00:35:59,646 --> 00:36:03,206
Otherwise, I'd have to take your fingerprint at the morgue.

416
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:11,606
Kuer, do you have enemies or something?

417
00:36:12,926 --> 00:36:16,406
He doesn't have any problem with anyone since we got here.

418
00:36:18,646 --> 00:36:21,366
What are you thinking about? There's someone, isn't it?

419
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:24,726
If there is, tell me. We'll see if it's them or not.

420
00:36:30,302 --> 00:36:31,686
Be careful.

421
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:35,926
Noot.

422
00:36:37,646 --> 00:36:38,646
Noot?

423
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:42,509
Do you mean Mr. Chanoot Jangwangprawas?

424
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,559
How is that possible?

425
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:48,234
You're doing business together, aren't you?

426
00:36:48,447 --> 00:36:50,126
When did you get on his wrong side?

427
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:55,206
Kuer.

428
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:01,446
Did you get back together with Phim?

429
00:37:04,206 --> 00:37:06,046
I thought you'd get that idea.

430
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:09,326
I didn't. How can I get back together with her?

431
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,886
I have Un now.

432
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:16,366
I was never more than friends with Phim.

433
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:20,646
That couple is fighting because of you.

434
00:37:21,915 --> 00:37:26,286
Don't tell me you're the troublemaker that I was looking for.

435
00:37:28,157 --> 00:37:29,766
I think Noot's jealous.

436
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:32,026
He should be.

437
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,046
Why would he be jealous?

438
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:35,926
You're quick with this.

439
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,406
Stop!

440
00:37:37,606 --> 00:37:40,206
Just take me home. I want to get some rest.

441
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,926
I want to know.

442
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:43,726
Sa!

443
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:46,838
Kuer, you should tell them.

444
00:37:47,326 --> 00:37:49,366
I wonder if something's going on too.

445
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:58,206
During the trip to Bangkok recently,

446
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:01,052
Noot somehow followed us.

447
00:38:01,766 --> 00:38:03,326
He probably thought

448
00:38:04,461 --> 00:38:05,966
I slept with Phim.

449
00:38:06,277 --> 00:38:07,566
If you don't stop,

450
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,326
I'll stop you myself.

451
00:38:09,646 --> 00:38:11,966
Noot! Stop!

452
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,080
Is that why you guys fought at the golf resort?

453
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:31,286
Do you think it's him?

454
00:38:31,438 --> 00:38:33,006
I think it's him.

455
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:34,606
So it must be. Hey!

456
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:36,166
Stop that!

457
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:38,166
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

458
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:43,205
Kuer looked like he didn't want to talk.

459
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:45,580
Maybe because Un was there.

460
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:47,286
Do you think

461
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:49,326
Kuer might be

462
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:52,086
so close with Phim that this happened?

463
00:38:56,593 --> 00:38:59,147
Phim's husband looks like he loves her so much.

464
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:00,566
Even if they're fighting,

465
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,419
old sparks can still ignite.

466
00:39:02,534 --> 00:39:05,454
(Waiting to be lit.)

467
00:39:05,578 --> 00:39:08,926
Hey! Stop it! This is not funny.

468
00:39:09,294 --> 00:39:11,086
They shot him.

469
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,926
Of course, it's not funny.

470
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,206
What will the police do?

471
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:21,326
We're collecting evidence and witnesses.

472
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:23,302
I ordered them to set checkpoints

473
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:25,886
to look for the bike the shooter rode.

474
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:30,486
If it's really Mr. Noot,

475
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:33,486
it's possible since he has local influences.

476
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:35,398
We have to be careful.

477
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:37,486
We need solid evidence.

478
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:41,486
You can't issue a warrant for him with just suspicion.

479
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:47,326
Can we use this as the reason to reopen his father's case?

480
00:39:48,116 --> 00:39:49,206
Sa.

481
00:39:49,446 --> 00:39:52,846
You won't stop until you get it, right?

482
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:54,835
- I want to know.  - We can't!

483
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:57,030
It's not linked at all right now.

484
00:39:58,341 --> 00:40:00,766
Shut up. It's almost dawn now.

485
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:03,486
I'm taking a shower and going to bed, okay?

486
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:06,309
- You're quick with this.  - Yeah.

487
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:09,246
Just stop thinking.

488
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:12,946
I want to know!

489
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:15,366
If Mr. Noot is really behind this case,

490
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:19,126
I will get the ringside news.

491
00:40:21,606 --> 00:40:22,806
Wait.

492
00:40:23,446 --> 00:40:25,926
Does Phim know about this?

493
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,646
(He fought Noot before he went up the elevator.)

494
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:42,166
I'm on my way.

495
00:40:43,614 --> 00:40:45,806
What's going on?

496
00:40:48,263 --> 00:40:49,326
Noot?

497
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:53,026
(Kuer's button got stolen by Phim before he took a shower and saw me.)

498
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:56,366
(That meant Kuer went up the elevator with her.)

499
00:40:56,646 --> 00:40:59,046
(Are they really just friends, as he said?)

500
00:41:06,846 --> 00:41:10,298
- What is it?  - You went up the elevator with Phim, didn't you?

501
00:41:11,308 --> 00:41:14,886
I told you she followed me to my room.

502
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:18,726
Are you sure nothing happened back then?

503
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:23,126
Were you in a rush to ask me?

504
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,126
I was in a rush? What? I wasn't.

505
00:41:27,806 --> 00:41:32,206
If you weren't, why did you show up like this?

506
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:44,166
Is there anything else you want to ask me?

507
00:42:45,078 --> 00:42:47,078
I'll dress your wound.

508
00:42:48,022 --> 00:42:49,406
Give me.

509
00:43:04,926 --> 00:43:06,486
I think you should take off your shirt.

510
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:08,846
- Take it off?  - Yeah.

511
00:43:10,486 --> 00:43:12,886
You just want to dress my wound, right?

512
00:43:13,526 --> 00:43:14,766
Yeah.

513
00:43:16,354 --> 00:43:21,998
You showed up in your towel and told me to take my shirt off.

514
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,126
I thought you wanted to...

515
00:43:28,081 --> 00:43:30,966
Hey! That hurts!

516
00:43:31,346 --> 00:43:34,886
Are you dressing my wound, or are you here to hurt me, Un?

517
00:43:35,342 --> 00:43:38,366
You're hurt, but that didn't stop your mouth.

518
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:39,766
Are you mad?

519
00:43:41,326 --> 00:43:42,686
Am I bleeding?

520
00:43:43,293 --> 00:43:46,046
A little. I'm sorry.

521
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:50,526
- Stay still.  - Don't pull a prank on me.

522
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:53,572
Don't do anything indecent, then.

523
00:43:54,526 --> 00:43:55,966
How was I indecent?

524
00:44:02,342 --> 00:44:03,526
Give me your hand.

525
00:44:04,901 --> 00:44:07,646
- It hurts.  - Hold my hand tightly.

526
00:44:12,046 --> 00:44:13,366
Why are you wincing?

527
00:44:13,452 --> 00:44:14,686
Because you're hurt.

528
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,126
There.

529
00:44:18,846 --> 00:44:20,686
- Just a little.  - Easy!

530
00:44:25,822 --> 00:44:30,006
You finished dressing my wound. Can we do something else now?

531
00:44:31,598 --> 00:44:34,086
We can't. Put your shirt on now. Here.

532
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,446
I thought you were hitting my wound.

533
00:44:36,926 --> 00:44:38,926
- Put your shirt on now.  - Be careful.

534
00:44:39,317 --> 00:44:41,406
Okay. Take it easy.

535
00:44:47,525 --> 00:44:49,286
- Are you okay?  - It feels so stiff.

536
00:44:51,366 --> 00:44:52,766
Please button the shirt for me.

537
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:56,646
I can't raise my arm.

538
00:45:05,814 --> 00:45:07,046
Is this okay?

539
00:45:15,021 --> 00:45:16,806
I'll talk to Noot tomorrow.

540
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:19,406
I want to know if he did this.

541
00:45:20,566 --> 00:45:21,966
If he did, he wouldn't tell you.

542
00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:24,446
At least he needs to know that I suspect him.

543
00:45:24,877 --> 00:45:26,526
So this doesn't happen again.

544
00:45:28,678 --> 00:45:30,046
Are you worried about me?

545
00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:34,566
I don't want my boyfriend to die.

546
00:45:38,286 --> 00:45:40,086
Get some rest.

547
00:45:40,566 --> 00:45:41,846
Are you leaving?

548
00:45:42,732 --> 00:45:44,566
I think I'm going to have a fever.

549
00:45:44,925 --> 00:45:46,166
Take your pills, then.

550
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,006
- Where are they?  - In the box.

551
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:50,846
- Take it now.  - I can't find them.

552
00:46:08,606 --> 00:46:09,606
Phim.

553
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:13,926
I think your husband did this.

554
00:46:15,037 --> 00:46:18,046
(Young businessman shot and hurt revealed to be C-Itsara's heir)

555
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,446
Get a boat to drive me home and come with me.

556
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,646
Phim!

557
00:46:31,646 --> 00:46:32,806
He's here.

558
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,080
What are you doing here so early?

559
00:46:41,094 --> 00:46:42,926
We found the shooter from last night.

560
00:46:43,213 --> 00:46:44,366
Come in.

561
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:48,766
Where did you find him?

562
00:46:49,117 --> 00:46:50,606
Have you interrogated him?

563
00:46:51,062 --> 00:46:52,446
Interrogated who?

564
00:46:52,597 --> 00:46:54,086
Good morning, San and Sa.

565
00:46:54,685 --> 00:46:56,486
San found the shooter from last night.

566
00:46:56,686 --> 00:46:57,886
I can't interrogate him.

567
00:46:58,086 --> 00:46:59,846
We found him dead in an alley in town.

568
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,726
- Dead?  - Yeah.

569
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:04,086
I think you need to be careful, Kuer.

570
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:07,166
I think he was killed off for failing.

571
00:47:08,549 --> 00:47:10,446
This is all just speculation.

572
00:47:11,126 --> 00:47:12,246
Kuer.

573
00:47:12,726 --> 00:47:15,246
I think you should watch your back.

574
00:47:16,886 --> 00:47:21,286
Chanoot Jangwangprawas, the one you have beef with,

575
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:23,326
holds local influences here.

576
00:47:24,646 --> 00:47:26,006
You need to come to the station with me.

577
00:47:26,126 --> 00:47:28,326
We need your statement about the dead shooter,

578
00:47:28,566 --> 00:47:30,766
and we need you to ID the body.

579
00:47:32,086 --> 00:47:33,326
You guys go ahead.

580
00:47:33,596 --> 00:47:34,966
There's something I need to do.

581
00:47:37,077 --> 00:47:39,966
Don't worry. I'll go with Un.

582
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:50,686
Thanks.

583
00:47:51,558 --> 00:47:54,726
C-Itsara told us their team is arriving today.

584
00:47:54,966 --> 00:47:56,886
They will come to work next week.

585
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:02,006
Can we trust them?

586
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:04,453
We let them see our information last time.

587
00:48:04,605 --> 00:48:07,486
Yet they ended up betraying us and talking to those small docks owners

588
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:10,126
just because they didn't like our offer.

589
00:48:10,566 --> 00:48:12,846
Mrs. Kamalas called me directly.

590
00:48:14,214 --> 00:48:15,686
She said they're signing with us.

591
00:48:15,846 --> 00:48:19,246
C-Itsara's team is bringing us all of their documents.

592
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:22,366
They're Kuerkhun's team.

593
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:26,966
Nothing will be signed

594
00:48:29,246 --> 00:48:32,446
until we find out who ordered the hit on Kuer last night.

595
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:36,686
I'll get that person to prison no matter what.

596
00:48:37,628 --> 00:48:39,628
You're saying that as if you know who did it.

597
00:48:40,326 --> 00:48:41,846
I'm just suspecting.

598
00:48:44,497 --> 00:48:45,726
Who are you suspecting?

599
00:48:48,446 --> 00:48:49,606
Was it you, Noot?

600
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:52,246
You ordered the hit on Kuer, didn't you?

601
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:11,857
Noot!

602
00:49:17,095 --> 00:49:18,646
What are you thinking?

603
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:20,966
Telling them I sent someone to kill Kuer?

604
00:49:21,566 --> 00:49:22,846
You told me yourself.

605
00:49:23,006 --> 00:49:26,326
If I don't want you to be a murderer, I have to stop seeing Kuer.

606
00:49:26,742 --> 00:49:30,966
I didn't do it. Someone hired the shooter. I don't know who.

607
00:49:31,422 --> 00:49:35,686
Is that an excuse? Nobody would admit they ordered a hit on someone.

608
00:49:36,078 --> 00:49:37,566
If you don't believe me, fine.

609
00:49:37,781 --> 00:49:39,606
I can assure you it wasn't me.

610
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:41,406
If it's not you, then who?

611
00:49:58,965 --> 00:50:00,206
Rit?

612
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:04,596
What are you doing?

613
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,966
Phim said Noot ordered the hit on Kuer last night.

614
00:50:09,285 --> 00:50:11,766
Noot ordered the hit on Kuer?

615
00:50:38,278 --> 00:50:39,566
What are you looking at?

616
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:41,326
Who is looking at what?

617
00:50:41,692 --> 00:50:44,846
You are. You're staring at me. What's wrong?

618
00:50:45,158 --> 00:50:46,726
Was I staring at you?

619
00:50:48,662 --> 00:50:51,926
If you weren't, your eyes would have a problem. You're obviously looking.

620
00:50:54,566 --> 00:50:55,606
Okay.

621
00:50:55,821 --> 00:50:57,182
I admit I was looking.

622
00:50:57,263 --> 00:51:00,886
I wonder who you are. Why are you here with Phim?

623
00:51:01,206 --> 00:51:02,646
Are you her friend?

624
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:21,046
What did she say?

625
00:51:23,142 --> 00:51:25,486
Did she tell me her name?

626
00:51:25,926 --> 00:51:27,486
Is her name "Rosy"?

627
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:34,246
Posy? Cozy? Ozzy? Nosy?

628
00:51:36,198 --> 00:51:38,526
Nosy! Darn it!

629
00:51:38,917 --> 00:51:40,686
Did she say I'm nosy?

630
00:51:42,006 --> 00:51:44,286
Is she already in the car? If she's still here,

631
00:51:44,422 --> 00:51:45,882
I'll give it to her.

632
00:51:46,212 --> 00:51:47,526
She's a mean witch.

633
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:53,766
Phim!

634
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:57,166
- How did it go?  - He won't admit it.

635
00:51:58,085 --> 00:51:59,766
But I think it's definitely him.

636
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:03,886
So, are you not staying here?

637
00:52:05,575 --> 00:52:07,126
I'm going back to the resort.

638
00:52:12,326 --> 00:52:13,686
To the resort?

639
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,526
Why would she stay there?

640
00:52:18,662 --> 00:52:20,662
Noot ordered the hit on Kuer?

641
00:52:21,644 --> 00:52:24,766
I'm not sure. He apparently denies it.

642
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,806
Is that so?

643
00:52:29,486 --> 00:52:31,046
What did they do to you?

644
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:32,526
It's Noot, Mom.

645
00:52:33,302 --> 00:52:34,526
Why? What did he do?

646
00:52:34,925 --> 00:52:36,166
What did he do?

647
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:40,446
He reviewed the accounts

648
00:52:41,206 --> 00:52:43,326
and said I stole the company's money.

649
00:52:44,637 --> 00:52:45,637
Hey.

650
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:48,766
You don't have anything to do with it, right?

651
00:52:48,868 --> 00:52:52,886
Mom, I didn't know. I just found out when Un got here.

652
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,706
Is Un here too?

653
00:52:54,863 --> 00:52:59,286
Yes. She was there when it happened. She's talking to Grandfather.

654
00:52:59,942 --> 00:53:02,126
Apparently, if we don't find out who did it,

655
00:53:02,406 --> 00:53:04,086
the contract won't be signed.

656
00:53:07,006 --> 00:53:09,566
It's hard to find out who did something like this.

657
00:53:10,112 --> 00:53:13,246
Hey! Who asked for your opinion?

658
00:53:13,797 --> 00:53:15,806
Father won't be able to do anything about it.

659
00:53:18,222 --> 00:53:21,806
Even when his beloved son, Pravee, died,

660
00:53:23,446 --> 00:53:24,846
he couldn't find out who killed him.

661
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:27,751
Vee died in an accident.

662
00:53:27,846 --> 00:53:28,846
Really?

663
00:53:37,733 --> 00:53:39,966
You can't drag this into our business deal.

664
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:41,766
Why can't I?

665
00:53:41,933 --> 00:53:44,126
You can't always protect Noot like this.

666
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:46,006
I'm not protecting anyone!

667
00:53:46,214 --> 00:53:48,746
You do it so much that you don't notice.

668
00:53:48,919 --> 00:53:51,846
Noot is never wrong, no matter what he does.

669
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:53,166
Un!

670
00:53:53,286 --> 00:53:54,365
Is it not true?

671
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:55,966
If I were born as a boy,

672
00:53:56,086 --> 00:53:58,057
I wouldn't have had to struggle and make it on my own.

673
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:00,366
You would have given me a higher priority.

674
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,926
Are you doing your job to get my attention, then?

675
00:54:03,637 --> 00:54:05,271
You're no different than me.

676
00:54:05,381 --> 00:54:07,326
You're using personal feelings to decide on work matters.

677
00:54:09,086 --> 00:54:10,746
If you really think it's not Noot,

678
00:54:10,926 --> 00:54:14,126
can you please use your influence to find out who did it?

679
00:54:25,821 --> 00:54:27,006
Un.

680
00:54:28,126 --> 00:54:30,526
Are you okay, dear? Are you hurt?

681
00:54:31,029 --> 00:54:32,286
I'm not.

682
00:54:32,709 --> 00:54:33,846
Kuer is.

683
00:54:33,981 --> 00:54:35,606
What happened?

684
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,670
They wanted him dead.

685
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:41,726
He's lucky someone saved him. He's not badly hurt.

686
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:58,326
Un.

687
00:54:59,446 --> 00:55:00,966
You have to be careful.

688
00:55:02,669 --> 00:55:04,669
The same thing happened to your dad before.

689
00:55:06,814 --> 00:55:08,566
Did this happen to Dad?

690
00:55:19,285 --> 00:55:20,966
I'm here for Mr. Pravee Jangwangprawas.

691
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,206
Wan?

692
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:26,246
Are you okay?

693
00:55:26,453 --> 00:55:28,926
I'm fine. Don't worry. I'm not badly hurt.

694
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,006
Thanks to Korn.

695
00:55:33,086 --> 00:55:35,086
Korn tried to escape, and we crashed.

696
00:55:35,317 --> 00:55:38,646
The shooter didn't get a clear shot. Otherwise, I'd have been in trouble.

697
00:55:40,846 --> 00:55:42,206
Thank you so much, Korn.

698
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:47,406
It's okay. Don't freak out.

699
00:55:49,565 --> 00:55:51,286
It's okay.

700
00:55:51,646 --> 00:55:53,886
After that, another accident happened.

701
00:55:56,606 --> 00:55:58,486
Your dad didn't make it this time.

702
00:56:01,246 --> 00:56:03,286
Then Dad's death wasn't an accident?

703
00:56:05,389 --> 00:56:07,206
That was the police's conclusion.

704
00:56:08,685 --> 00:56:10,046
I didn't believe it.

705
00:56:11,206 --> 00:56:13,206
Korn, your dad's driver,

706
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:15,326
took excellent care of his cars.

707
00:56:15,486 --> 00:56:17,246
He always checked his cars carefully.

708
00:56:17,597 --> 00:56:20,646
The accident couldn't have happened due to a dry brake.

709
00:56:25,662 --> 00:56:27,486
No one investigated it.

710
00:56:28,573 --> 00:56:30,046
The case got closed.

711
00:56:31,606 --> 00:56:33,766
Nobody talked about it ever again.

712
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,086
What about Grandfather?

713
00:56:40,006 --> 00:56:43,566
I first met your grandfather months after your dad died.

714
00:56:44,222 --> 00:56:48,166
Your grandfather took me here along with Noot's mom.

715
00:56:51,398 --> 00:56:53,046
Ever since that day,

716
00:56:53,964 --> 00:56:56,926
I never saw your grandfather speak of this incident.

717
00:58:13,478 --> 00:58:16,286
(Mr. Noot)

718
00:58:24,366 --> 00:58:26,406
- Hello?  - Where are you?

719
00:58:27,006 --> 00:58:28,326
Come out and meet me.

720
00:58:30,686 --> 00:58:31,886
Where?

721
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,766
I didn't see his face. He was wearing a helmet.

722
00:58:42,157 --> 00:58:43,966
I think that's the clothes the shooter was wearing.

723
00:58:45,213 --> 00:58:48,046
I want to know who shot him.

724
00:58:48,646 --> 00:58:49,766
Me too.

725
00:58:50,717 --> 00:58:52,686
He was sent to kill you.

726
00:58:52,886 --> 00:58:55,246
You saw another bike following him.

727
00:58:56,126 --> 00:58:57,926
When police arrived at the scene,

728
00:58:58,126 --> 00:59:00,206
they found the shooter's bike.

729
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:02,246
But his body was found

730
00:59:02,422 --> 00:59:04,206
on the other side of the fence.

731
00:59:04,948 --> 00:59:06,214
That doesn't make sense.

732
00:59:06,327 --> 00:59:10,206
I know. I think this is not as it seems.

733
00:59:10,597 --> 00:59:13,286
We found another trace of blood near the bike.

734
00:59:13,613 --> 00:59:16,686
I tested the blood. It's not from the dead shooter.

735
00:59:33,406 --> 00:59:35,966
Kuer and San said they'd come after they were done.

736
00:59:36,701 --> 00:59:37,742
Let's go.

737
00:59:52,566 --> 00:59:54,686
- Here, Sa.  - Thanks.

738
00:59:55,846 --> 00:59:59,126
I saw Phim with her friend today.

739
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:00,926
Really?

740
01:00:01,228 --> 01:00:05,006
She said she was going to some resort.

741
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:07,486
Do you know where that is?

742
01:00:07,718 --> 01:00:10,206
My grandfather assigned Phim to run a resort on Phiman Island.

743
01:00:10,781 --> 01:00:12,166
I think that's the place.

744
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,486
Really?

745
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,486
What about it?

746
01:00:16,494 --> 01:00:19,686
Nothing. I just overheard them talking.

747
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,966
I was just curious.

748
01:00:26,846 --> 01:00:29,686
Un, can I ask you something?

749
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,286
San said that

750
01:00:33,686 --> 01:00:36,406
your father's case wasn't an accident.

751
01:00:36,534 --> 01:00:38,166
Do you know about this?

752
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:41,686
It's so long ago.

753
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:43,966
I was in my mom's womb when it happened.

754
01:00:45,397 --> 01:00:48,166
But why would San ask about this?

755
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:49,489
I'm wondering the same.

756
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:51,126
That's why I asked.

757
01:00:51,437 --> 01:00:54,446
He said his seniors were talking about it.

758
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,526
They're here.

759
01:00:59,006 --> 01:01:01,246
Don't tell him I told you. He'd be mad at me.

760
01:01:03,086 --> 01:01:06,286
Guys, how did it go? Did it go well?

761
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:09,686
He can't say?

762
01:01:10,518 --> 01:01:11,886
So he knows?

763
01:01:12,374 --> 01:01:13,646
I'm not sure.

764
01:01:13,806 --> 01:01:17,646
As far as I know, I think Noot knows, but he won't say.

765
01:01:18,278 --> 01:01:19,926
And you're letting it go just like this?

766
01:01:21,246 --> 01:01:23,966
No. I won't let this go.

767
01:01:24,446 --> 01:01:25,726
So what will you do?

768
01:01:35,126 --> 01:01:36,806
What did the police say?

769
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:38,766
They say it's either an affair or a business.

770
01:01:39,526 --> 01:01:42,246
I think it's probably about an affair.

771
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:43,726
Why?

772
01:01:43,846 --> 01:01:45,686
Because if it were about a business,

773
01:01:45,846 --> 01:01:47,566
Noot would have done it long ago.

774
01:01:47,806 --> 01:01:50,246
He wouldn't have waited until you were on the verge of signing.

775
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:54,606
I just closed the deal with him. I don't think it's about business.

776
01:01:55,526 --> 01:01:56,966
Who knows?

777
01:01:57,429 --> 01:02:00,206
They probably don't want to proceed with this offer.

778
01:02:00,991 --> 01:02:02,886
They offered me this deal themselves.

779
01:02:03,221 --> 01:02:04,766
Those guys can do anything

780
01:02:04,998 --> 01:02:06,886
because they want that joint venture with you.

781
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:10,326
Are they just trying to scare you off?

782
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,046
We can't be sure that Noot did it.

783
01:02:14,365 --> 01:02:16,006
We don't have any evidence.

784
01:02:16,261 --> 01:02:19,526
We only have your word that he threatened you.

785
01:02:19,726 --> 01:02:21,326
Now the shooter is dead too.

786
01:02:21,486 --> 01:02:24,526
There's no witness. We can't ask anyone.

787
01:02:25,046 --> 01:02:26,526
What should we do next?

788
01:02:26,646 --> 01:02:29,146
We're interrogating suspects soon.

789
01:02:29,422 --> 01:02:31,006
We might know more then.

790
01:02:46,467 --> 01:02:48,486
- Let's go.  - Can you drop me off at the port?

791
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:53,606
- Where are you going?  - To Phiman Island. I want to find out about Phim.

792
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,446
How did you find out Phim is there?

793
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:59,786
I overheard her talking to her friend about going to a resort there.

794
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:03,846
Didn't you see Kuer?

795
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,566
What happened to him for messing with those guys?

796
01:03:07,686 --> 01:03:09,806
Please! I want to find out.

797
01:03:10,141 --> 01:03:13,521
You know what? If I find out anything, I'll share it with you.

798
01:03:13,606 --> 01:03:15,126
I'm not saving it all for my page.

799
01:03:17,557 --> 01:03:19,886
Will you still go even if I say no?

800
01:03:22,054 --> 01:03:23,646
- Let's go.  - Sa.

801
01:03:23,789 --> 01:03:26,166
Quick! I need to catch a boat.

802
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:28,366
You're too nosy.

803
01:04:01,406 --> 01:04:02,846
Are you here alone?

804
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:07,406
What are you panicking about?

805
01:04:08,654 --> 01:04:11,766
Did you send the shooter last night?

806
01:04:13,126 --> 01:04:14,326
Shooter?

807
01:04:14,846 --> 01:04:16,006
Do you mean the one who shot Kuer?

808
01:04:16,087 --> 01:04:17,087
Yes.

809
01:04:21,606 --> 01:04:23,166
You're the only one I hired.

810
01:04:33,446 --> 01:04:36,286
Can you tell me now? What happened last night?

811
01:04:36,502 --> 01:04:39,166
You were following Kuer. Surely you saw what happened.

812
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:58,806
I want to talk to Rit alone.

813
01:05:00,373 --> 01:05:01,806
Everyone else leaves.

814
01:05:04,286 --> 01:05:05,606
Yes, Father.

815
01:05:47,046 --> 01:05:48,639
Did you talk to your cousin?

816
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:51,846
We only talked about work.

817
01:05:52,894 --> 01:05:54,726
I'm in the wrong for everything.

818
01:05:55,886 --> 01:05:57,406
Will you divorce me, then?

819
01:05:57,774 --> 01:05:59,774
Did you talk about anything personal?

820
01:06:00,966 --> 01:06:02,086
Not at all.

821
01:06:02,206 --> 01:06:05,646
We have those accounting errors. Work was all we talked about.

822
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:08,606
What did Noot say about that?

823
01:06:09,046 --> 01:06:11,406
He said he needed to review it again.

824
01:06:13,285 --> 01:06:14,526
Is that so?

825
01:06:15,486 --> 01:06:17,686
I think I didn't make any mistakes.

826
01:06:17,886 --> 01:06:20,566
The accounting department probably got it wrong.

827
01:06:21,326 --> 01:06:23,366
I asked Noot to review it again.

828
01:06:24,806 --> 01:06:27,686
We work as a company. Everyone involved must be informed.

829
01:06:29,053 --> 01:06:30,806
We can't hide information.

830
01:06:33,886 --> 01:06:35,126
Yes, Grandfather.

831
01:06:46,862 --> 01:06:48,966
Aunt Nee, Nok.

832
01:06:49,285 --> 01:06:51,137
Go up to my room and look at it.

833
01:06:51,296 --> 01:06:53,726
How did you guys mop the floor? There is dust all over the room.

834
01:06:57,351 --> 01:06:59,351
Please help Wing with her room.

835
01:07:01,237 --> 01:07:02,566
Both of you.

836
01:07:03,246 --> 01:07:04,446
Yes.

837
01:07:17,142 --> 01:07:18,686
Do you want to talk to me?

838
01:07:22,102 --> 01:07:23,486
I want to know.

839
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:25,526
Why did you say

840
01:07:25,646 --> 01:07:27,846
Vee's death wasn't an accident this morning?

841
01:07:30,232 --> 01:07:32,206
I'm the one who should ask you

842
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:34,846
why that accident happened.

843
01:07:35,388 --> 01:07:36,806
What are you talking about?

844
01:07:42,355 --> 01:07:44,566
You didn't know Vee had a wife and a kid.

845
01:07:48,755 --> 01:07:50,086
So what?

846
01:07:52,606 --> 01:07:54,086
You thought that if he died

847
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:56,406
without an heir,

848
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:58,366
who'd get his share of the inheritance

849
01:07:59,232 --> 01:08:01,446
if not you and your only son?

850
01:08:02,853 --> 01:08:04,486
What have I got to do with this?

851
01:08:04,621 --> 01:08:06,846
My brother died in an accident.

852
01:08:08,116 --> 01:08:09,406
He did,

853
01:08:09,871 --> 01:08:13,846
but that accident happened right when you got divorced and moved here.

854
01:08:14,636 --> 01:08:17,126
You even benefited from his death.

855
01:08:18,192 --> 01:08:19,606
Wasn't that too convenient?

856
01:08:21,926 --> 01:08:23,646
Do you even think before you speak?

857
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:27,166
If I did, why would I raise Noot ever since he was a kid?

858
01:08:27,366 --> 01:08:29,086
I could have killed him anytime.

859
01:08:29,274 --> 01:08:34,046
Please think before you speak. Don't just talk

860
01:08:34,206 --> 01:08:36,966
and keep defaming everyone else!

861
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:38,806
I'm wondering myself

862
01:08:39,591 --> 01:08:42,206
how Noot is still breathing to this day.

863
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:47,917
Mom.

864
01:08:53,427 --> 01:08:54,526
What is it, son?

865
01:08:54,686 --> 01:08:57,286
Did you talk to your grandfather? What did he say?

866
01:09:05,813 --> 01:09:07,046
Let's go.

867
01:09:14,728 --> 01:09:16,606
He asked me if I had talked to Noot.

868
01:09:16,863 --> 01:09:20,006
I said I didn't, and he got upset. He got pissed about the accounts.

869
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:21,886
Seriously, Mom.

870
01:09:22,006 --> 01:09:23,886
He never saw what I had done well.

871
01:09:24,086 --> 01:09:25,286
He only trusts Noot.

872
01:09:25,446 --> 01:09:27,606
It's okay. Just calm down.

873
01:09:27,781 --> 01:09:29,726
How does he not trust you?

874
01:09:29,853 --> 01:09:31,566
Don't speak like that.

875
01:09:31,671 --> 01:09:34,086
Why else would he let you be in charge of purchasing?

876
01:09:34,223 --> 01:09:38,966
Look. You're a Jangwangprawas. You're an heir.

877
01:09:39,267 --> 01:09:40,526
Noot is never wrong.

878
01:09:40,628 --> 01:09:42,366
Grandfather always takes his side.

879
01:09:42,504 --> 01:09:45,606
Even when Noot has no alibi about Kuer's shooting.

880
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:48,966
From what Un said, it's possible.

881
01:09:49,086 --> 01:09:50,646
Noot is jealous of Phim and Kuer.

882
01:09:50,766 --> 01:09:53,846
He ordered the hit on Kuer. It's simple. The police will see it.

883
01:09:54,007 --> 01:09:56,326
His beloved grandson might be going to jail.

884
01:09:57,195 --> 01:10:00,446
Don't let anyone hear you say this, especially your grandfather.

885
01:10:00,555 --> 01:10:04,686
Look. I'll tell you what. If Noot did anything wrong

886
01:10:04,828 --> 01:10:06,766
and got locked up in jail,

887
01:10:06,926 --> 01:10:10,366
it's just about Noot. It's got nothing to do with you.

888
01:10:11,009 --> 01:10:12,406
If that happens,

889
01:10:12,528 --> 01:10:15,326
you will see,

890
01:10:15,452 --> 01:10:17,086
as a Jangwangprawas,

891
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,846
how you can replace Noot.

892
01:10:20,766 --> 01:10:22,366
Do you understand, son?

893
01:10:25,817 --> 01:10:27,206
I'll go out for a bit, Mom.

894
01:10:27,297 --> 01:10:28,471
Wait.

895
01:10:28,567 --> 01:10:31,166
Will you come home tonight?

896
01:11:02,786 --> 01:11:04,286
I think he recognizes me.

897
01:11:04,428 --> 01:11:05,686
What is Rit planning to do?

898
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:08,886
I want to have a meal with your mother tomorrow, Un.

899
01:11:10,027 --> 01:11:12,326
I told you I was serious.

900
01:11:14,141 --> 01:11:16,046
At least I love you, Phim.

901
01:11:16,512 --> 01:11:19,166
Do you still love me?

902
01:11:19,834 --> 01:11:21,606
Will you marry me?

903
01:11:21,838 --> 01:11:23,046
Yes.
