1
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:47,766
This is not the first time, Noot.

2
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:49,074
How many times have you done this?

3
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:51,126
If I had chosen Kuer back then,

4
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,806
I wouldn't have been hurt like this.

5
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:58,566
Is he

6
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,133
Mrs. Kamalas' grandson?

7
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:02,166
Can I stay here tonight?

8
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:03,686
I think you should go home.

9
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:05,886
Work things out with him.

10
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:12,526
Whose earring is this?

11
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:16,286
Is it your girlfriend's?

12
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:19,326
It's not.

13
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,646
Does your girlfriend mind me coming to see you like this?

14
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:32,686
I don't have a girlfriend.

15
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,646
I think this earring is my sister's.

16
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:48,445
Come and sit down. I'll dress your wound.

17
00:02:48,526 --> 00:02:49,526
Okay.

18
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:21,046
These cost a few months' worths of my salary.

19
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,739
You're the owner's son.

20
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,966
I'm just an intern.

21
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,086
I make as much as anyone else.

22
00:03:32,006 --> 00:03:33,006
Do they look good?

23
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:34,799
Thank you.

24
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,006
I think

25
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:40,566
they will look really beautiful on you.

26
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,110
Here.

27
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,086
I'll put it on you.

28
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:45,566
Give me your ear.

29
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:52,366
That is for me putting it on you.

30
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,686
- Morning.  - Morning.

31
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:27,006
I'm meeting my friend today.

32
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:30,526
He just came back from Singapore. Will you go with me, Phim?

33
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:36,606
I have a headache. I'd rather get some rest.

34
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:39,766
I might come home a bit late.

35
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:43,076
Take care of your business. Don't worry about me.

36
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,366
Call me if you need anything.

37
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:38,086
(It's been eight years now.)

38
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:41,230
If you can't handle this little thing,

39
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:42,686
in the future,

40
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:46,846
how can I trust you to take care of our hundreds of employees?

41
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:49,446
(I'll give you time to decide.)

42
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,406
(By tonight.)

43
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:05,284
Come in.

44
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,366
What's up?

45
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:13,406
Are you here to give me your answer?

46
00:06:14,226 --> 00:06:15,286
Yes.

47
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:24,606
- What is it?  - I'll go down to Phuket.

48
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:30,806
Come in.

49
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:36,646
Ma'am, Dr. Ann is here to see you.

50
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:43,326
Dr. Ann is our new adviser.

51
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:47,006
This joint venture is her first project.

52
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:50,126
It's good that you're here. You need to meet her.

53
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:53,446
Yes, Grandmother.

54
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:56,366
This way, please.

55
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,046
Ann?

56
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:31,566
- Good morning.  - Good morning.

57
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:33,326
This is Dr. Ann,

58
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,206
our new adviser.

59
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:37,592
This is Kuerkhun, my grandson.

60
00:07:38,086 --> 00:07:41,326
He's in charge of the joint venture project with JP.

61
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,806
Good morning.

62
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:51,606
We will have to go to Phuket soon.

63
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:53,999
You're going too, Ann.

64
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:55,566
Of course.

65
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,966
You said you would be starting next week.

66
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:02,486
Why did you come by? Have you changed your mind?

67
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:06,206
I want to study the joint venture papers before I start.

68
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:07,406
That's why I came by.

69
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,126
That's good.

70
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:15,406
Dr. Ann, please come to my office.

71
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,286
This way, please.

72
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:25,686
After you, doctor.

73
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,486
Turn right.

74
00:08:56,652 --> 00:09:00,892
Hey doctor, do you really not know I work here?

75
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:02,806
How would I know?

76
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:07,686
Hey. When you apply for a job, you need to study the company.

77
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:12,446
I'm an executive. You should have seen me around.

78
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:16,086
I was more focused on Mrs. Kamalas.

79
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,086
So I didn't recognize you.

80
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:21,926
You knew, but you pretended not to recognize me, right?

81
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:25,686
If I knew, I wouldn't have insulted you that much.

82
00:09:26,838 --> 00:09:29,846
Your face is not on any posters here, is it?

83
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:32,606
There's nothing here that says you're an executive.

84
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:37,046
As your adviser,

85
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:39,406
this is my first piece of advice.

86
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:42,606
Make a poster of yourself and place it all over the building

87
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:44,206
if you want to be recognized.

88
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:52,948
Also, don't forget your title of "Senior" Vice President.

89
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:58,246
- Hey!  - I think we should go to your office.

90
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:02,966
It's not good to stand when your leg is hurt.

91
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:10,766
This way, please, doctor.

92
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:19,566
This is the offer from JP.

93
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,566
Thank you. I have to go.

94
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,766
I think the papers aren't enough.

95
00:10:25,586 --> 00:10:27,726
We need to talk before we go to Phuket.

96
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:31,446
Go to Phuket?

97
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:34,686
My grandmother has told you.

98
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:39,366
If you're the adviser for this project, you need to travel.

99
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:42,366
She did, and I have no problem with that.

100
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:47,566
Before we go to Phuket, we need to talk about JP.

101
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:49,126
Talk?

102
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:52,352
In your schedule,

103
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:57,126
you'll be starting next week. It'll be too late because we will be leaving.

104
00:10:58,646 --> 00:10:59,926
So I think

105
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,086
if you're free tonight, please come to my place.

106
00:11:04,406 --> 00:11:05,457
Why would I go to your place?

107
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:07,326
Do you want me to come to your place?

108
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:09,766
You coming to my place?

109
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:13,926
Where will it be, then? Not my place, not yours?

110
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:16,046
We can talk about work at the office.

111
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:17,846
Doctor.

112
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:21,486
Tomorrow is Saturday. The office is closed.

113
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:27,726
Just come to my place tonight.

114
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:31,726
You can dress my wound, and we can talk right after.

115
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:35,372
Okay.

116
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:38,086
When are you going to Phuket?

117
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,486
On Sunday afternoon, I think.

118
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:44,886
Okay.

119
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:48,166
See you tonight at 7 pm, at your place.

120
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:51,246
I want to get some dinner.

121
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:52,706
Let's eat and

122
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,126
discuss work.

123
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,726
Do you want anything specific?

124
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:09,816
(Phim)

125
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:20,086
(Phim)

126
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:43,266
- Good afternoon, sir.  - Good afternoon.

127
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:47,566
I want to leave something for Mrs. Pimrata Jangwangprawas.

128
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:50,646
Sure, sir. Do you know her room number?

129
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:54,846
It's the same room as Mr. Chanoot Jangwangprawas.

130
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:04,246
Kuer.

131
00:14:07,924 --> 00:14:08,924
Phim.

132
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:24,726
Why didn't you call first?

133
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:30,366
You left this at my place last night.

134
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:39,246
If I lose this,

135
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:41,646
I'd be very sad.

136
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:46,126
It's just a diamond earring.

137
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,006
As the wife of JP's executive, you can easily buy a new pair.

138
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:54,366
Nothing can replace this pair.

139
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:59,846
You intentionally left it at my place, didn't you?

140
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:08,446
Why did you think I would do that?

141
00:15:09,406 --> 00:15:11,006
I know you well.

142
00:15:19,113 --> 00:15:20,246
You do know, right?

143
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,766
That we would never be like how we used to be.

144
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:35,496
Yes.

145
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:39,406
I want you to stop this.

146
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:41,406
You and I

147
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:44,446
were done eight years ago.

148
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,082
Phim!

149
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:14,521
Phim!

150
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:31,006
Sending in my work is more satisfying than getting a date!

151
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:32,966
Hooray!

152
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:35,806
Hey, Un!

153
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,006
Let's go out to dinner tonight to celebrate!

154
00:16:40,146 --> 00:16:42,446
I can't. I have a meeting with Kuer.

155
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:47,806
What's wrong with you?

156
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:48,905
Why are you meeting him?

157
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:50,463
There's a quick spark, right?

158
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:53,286
You just came here, and you're claiming our husband?

159
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:58,286
It's about work, not a date.

160
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,246
Work is work.

161
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:03,926
If you date him, I'll make fun of you until your kid grows up.

162
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:09,166
You should brush your teeth. Your breath stinks!

163
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:15,566
I haven't showered or brushed my teeth in two days.

164
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:27,766
I'll just eat alone like

165
00:17:27,926 --> 00:17:31,606
a loner because my friend is with a man.

166
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:34,526
- Hey!  - Having dinner with a man.

167
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:36,126
Just go!

168
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:53,828
Okay, Mrs. Pimrata.

169
00:17:53,936 --> 00:17:55,646
From what I can tell,

170
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:59,486
you have been diagnosed with this twice in 12 months.

171
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:09,486
Please stay with me for now.

172
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,056
Looking at your history,

173
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,383
you need to take a pap smear test.

174
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:21,486
It's to check your cervix for any abnormalities.

175
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,059
Please stay strong, Mrs. Pimrata.

176
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,486
The variant of HPV that you have

177
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,532
cannot be prevented.

178
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:33,006
That's why you have been reinfected.

179
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:36,739
You might have difficulty urinating

180
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:39,725
because it's blocking your urinal tract

181
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:41,446
and causing you to bleed.

182
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:47,006
You have your usual doctor for this, right?

183
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:48,218
I do.

184
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:54,246
I want you to get it checked again.

185
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:58,326
I'll write a prescription for you in the meantime.

186
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,387
I'll also give you a doctor's note

187
00:19:01,486 --> 00:19:05,806
recommending an urgent colposcopy.

188
00:20:03,824 --> 00:20:04,966
Phim, have some water.

189
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,326
Thank you.

190
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:14,926
Kuer, do you have a minute to talk?

191
00:20:34,913 --> 00:20:37,566
You must be wondering why I'm acting this way, right?

192
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:54,406
Everyone sees me as a billionaire's daughter-in-law.

193
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:56,646
They think my life is good and happy.

194
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,126
All of it is just an appearance.

195
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:05,206
Does Chanoot have someone else?

196
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:16,606
He fools around a lot.

197
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:21,806
Thankfully, he doesn't have a serious girlfriend.

198
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:24,046
That's all.

199
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:29,766
Why would you tolerate this? Why don't you get a divorce?

200
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:35,846
Divorce?

201
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:43,566
He has nothing to lose.

202
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:50,086
He can still fool around like he's doing now.

203
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:54,566
I am the one who has something to lose.

204
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:08,946
How will everyone judge me?

205
00:22:14,072 --> 00:22:18,486
Am I getting divorced because my husband can't keep it in his pants?

206
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:31,846
Many girls will wish to be me.

207
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:34,486
They want to be a lawful wife

208
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:36,959
so they can get a big inheritance.

209
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:39,286
I won't allow it.

210
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:46,966
Don't think about that, Phim.

211
00:22:48,152 --> 00:22:49,726
I think you should

212
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:52,006
take care of yourself.

213
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:55,406
Get your test done.

214
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:57,246
Doctors these days are so good.

215
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,566
You will recover.

216
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:16,166
If I had chosen you back then,

217
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:20,966
my life wouldn't have sucked so badly.

218
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:42,747
Phim.

219
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:48,406
Don't forget to take your pills.

220
00:25:49,307 --> 00:25:51,166
Okay. Thank you.

221
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:05,679
(Ann)

222
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,606
You went to see Kuer, didn't you?

223
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:47,006
Let me go.

224
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,326
I won't.

225
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:51,246
I saw Kuer drove you here.

226
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:52,806
Where did you go with him?

227
00:26:55,512 --> 00:26:57,606
Don't forget to take your pills.

228
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,286
Thank you.

229
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,446
Ouch!

230
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:12,566
From the way you look,

231
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:14,406
you've hooked up with him, didn't you?

232
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:20,126
I don't fool around as you do.

233
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:23,686
Why?

234
00:27:25,446 --> 00:27:28,627
Why can't I fool around when you do?

235
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:39,126
Did you really hook up with him?

236
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:45,686
If you keep this up,

237
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,846
I won't be in the wrong if I do what you do.

238
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:52,566
If you aren't stopping,

239
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:56,286
why should I stop for a man like you?

240
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:00,326
Darn it!

241
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:06,686
You didn't even answer me.

242
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,486
Where did you go with him?

243
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,406
Where are you going?

244
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:20,086
I said, where are you going?

245
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:22,126
I'm going back to Phuket.

246
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:15,846
Hey.

247
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:20,006
Hey.

248
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:28,286
I'm sorry I'm a bit late.

249
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:32,046
A bit? It was over an hour.

250
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:35,203
Let's get something to eat.

251
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,919
We can talk about work later. It's my treat.

252
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:39,926
I'm not hungry.

253
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:41,926
Let's get this over with.

254
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:47,966
Your stomach is growling.

255
00:30:57,286 --> 00:31:00,616
I waited for C-Itsara's executive for over an hour,

256
00:31:00,752 --> 00:31:02,446
and all I got was noodles with wontons?

257
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:05,406
You got extra wontons.

258
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:07,206
You got a few more than I did.

259
00:31:11,698 --> 00:31:12,705
I'm sorry.

260
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,406
I didn't think I would be late.

261
00:31:15,526 --> 00:31:16,566
It's just...

262
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,566
I had a minor issue.

263
00:31:24,392 --> 00:31:27,046
I read JP's offer.

264
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:30,846
I think we need to demand more.

265
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,686
They will have to beg us.

266
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,566
I think so too.

267
00:31:39,752 --> 00:31:43,446
Honestly, I would advise against doing a joint venture with JP.

268
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:47,686
Judging from their offer, they're sharks.

269
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:51,006
They offer a deal benefiting themselves when they are at a disadvantage.

270
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:56,126
- What do you think?  - I think you're right to go and see what they do.

271
00:31:56,485 --> 00:31:57,686
From what I know,

272
00:31:57,812 --> 00:32:01,326
they don't just own the businesses. They have some local influences.

273
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:03,766
Chanoot is not the one you need to look out for.

274
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:06,446
The biggest threat

275
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:08,766
is Prawit Jangwangprawas,

276
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:11,086
JP's chairman.

277
00:32:21,246 --> 00:32:25,086
I'll be there one day earlier than scheduled.

278
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,726
Don't inform JP about me.

279
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:28,846
Just inform them of your flight.

280
00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:32,206
Why are we not going together?

281
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:38,876
I want to do some reconnaissance for you first.

282
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:49,276
I texted you a list of things to buy.

283
00:32:49,378 --> 00:32:52,581
Tell the messenger to deliver it by tomorrow

284
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,686
- before eight o'clock.  - Okay.

285
00:32:54,832 --> 00:32:57,246
We have a guest leaving early tomorrow.

286
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:58,446
Okay.

287
00:32:58,527 --> 00:32:59,966
More importantly...

288
00:33:04,505 --> 00:33:05,505
Phim?

289
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:40,566
Did you fight with Noot again?

290
00:33:47,352 --> 00:33:48,886
Who is the girl this time?

291
00:33:55,486 --> 00:33:57,286
A prostitute in Bangkok.

292
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:09,126
I'm not trying to stir things up,

293
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:11,526
but enough is enough.

294
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,886
Stop caring about your businessman's wife's image.

295
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,246
I can't.

296
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:29,086
I need to bear with it no matter what.

297
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,366
If I get divorced now,

298
00:34:32,665 --> 00:34:34,286
I'll get nothing.

299
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:47,326
If I have a child,

300
00:34:49,557 --> 00:34:51,806
everything that belongs to JP

301
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:56,046
will be mine and my child's.

302
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:59,326
Do you still want to have a kid with him?

303
00:35:02,306 --> 00:35:03,446
Yes.

304
00:35:03,806 --> 00:35:05,206
I will.

305
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:09,086
I will have a son.

306
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:29,686
Mom, I'm at a hotel near our home.

307
00:35:29,786 --> 00:35:31,086
I'm going to you.

308
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:34,606
Can you wait for me out front?

309
00:35:34,845 --> 00:35:36,446
I don't want to see my grandfather.

310
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:39,286
Okay. See you.

311
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,126
Here you go. Your room is 1022.

312
00:35:43,293 --> 00:35:44,406
Okay.

313
00:35:45,006 --> 00:35:46,126
- Thank you.  - Thank you, sir.

314
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,918
- Please take my luggage to my room.  - Yes, sir.

315
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:51,606
- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

316
00:36:24,526 --> 00:36:25,526
Mom.

317
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:28,006
Un.

318
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:52,366
I miss you so much.

319
00:36:52,765 --> 00:36:54,606
I miss you more than anyone.

320
00:36:55,285 --> 00:36:57,072
Can you come and stay with me tonight?

321
00:36:57,432 --> 00:36:59,086
Why are you not staying at home?

322
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,446
What happened to your hand?

323
00:37:06,806 --> 00:37:08,086
I fell down the stairs.

324
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:10,046
How?

325
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:17,366
Where is Wan?

326
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:19,086
What would you like, Mrs. Wing?

327
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:23,166
Tell Wan to make salted fried chicken. I want it now.

328
00:37:27,252 --> 00:37:29,221
Can Nee make it instead?

329
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,646
Are you deaf?

330
00:37:30,846 --> 00:37:32,446
I said to tell Wan to make it.

331
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,686
She keeps asking for Mrs. Wan when she's hurt.

332
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:45,406
She keeps ordering her to fetch things and do all sorts of things.

333
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:50,999
Where is Mrs. Wan today, Nok?

334
00:37:51,172 --> 00:37:53,526
I didn't walk carefully, and I tripped.

335
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,886
I'm old. I'm not like all you young girls.

336
00:37:57,606 --> 00:38:00,126
You have to walk carefully from now on.

337
00:38:00,605 --> 00:38:02,286
Thankfully it's not broken.

338
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:03,577
Yes.

339
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:05,846
Mrs. Wan.

340
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:07,326
Mrs. Wan.

341
00:38:10,753 --> 00:38:12,726
Miss Un.

342
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,726
Why didn't you go inside?

343
00:38:20,266 --> 00:38:22,566
I'm just here to see my mom. I'll be going.

344
00:38:22,932 --> 00:38:24,526
Are you not staying here:?

345
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,846
Is there anything you need?

346
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:35,086
Mrs. Wing ordered you to make salted fried chicken.

347
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:38,798
Why can't Nee make it?

348
00:38:38,913 --> 00:38:40,286
My mom's hand is hurt.

349
00:38:47,206 --> 00:38:49,286
I have to stay with your grandfather.

350
00:38:49,513 --> 00:38:51,246
I can't go and be with you.

351
00:38:53,406 --> 00:38:54,846
- Please get some chicken for me.  - Okay.

352
00:38:56,486 --> 00:38:58,406
See you later, sweetie.

353
00:38:58,726 --> 00:38:59,766
Okay, Mom.

354
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:10,526
Miss Un.

355
00:39:10,752 --> 00:39:13,046
Please come home soon.

356
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:15,446
Someone needs to stand up for Mrs. Wan.

357
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,006
What happened?

358
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:19,126
Mrs. Wan didn't tell you, right?

359
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:22,726
She fell from the stairs and fractured her wrist

360
00:39:22,825 --> 00:39:26,206
because Mrs. Wing ordered her to make food offerings

361
00:39:26,312 --> 00:39:28,206
when she had a fever.

362
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:31,468
She collapsed and fell down the stairs.

363
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:35,086
Miss Un, please come home soon.

364
00:39:35,226 --> 00:39:36,686
I have to go now.

365
00:39:44,406 --> 00:39:47,326
(I'll make these guys pay for what they did to you, Mom.)

366
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:18,326
Hey, Ann!

367
00:40:19,306 --> 00:40:22,926
Hi! You said you would be coming tomorrow afternoon.

368
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:25,326
I think I'm

369
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:29,566
making you work too much on this, so I

370
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:32,046
decided to change my flight and come to help you.

371
00:40:34,086 --> 00:40:36,766
What are you doing here?

372
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:41,366
I'm heading to a cafe near the hotel.

373
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:45,046
I want to try some local stuff, but I can't find the cafe.

374
00:40:46,086 --> 00:40:47,566
Me too.

375
00:40:47,726 --> 00:40:50,446
That woman just now said there's a good place.

376
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:51,766
Do you want to go?

377
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:54,206
Let's go. It's this way.

378
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:03,486
(Jangwangprawas Residence)

379
00:41:24,218 --> 00:41:25,806
- Hey, Kuer!  - Whoa!

380
00:41:29,996 --> 00:41:32,069
How are you? It's been a long time.

381
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:34,179
I'm fine. Everything is good.

382
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,926
It's just quite lonely.

383
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,460
So is that why you rushed here?

384
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,680
- Did I get here quickly?  - Yeah.

385
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,126
You didn't even tell me before you came.

386
00:41:43,245 --> 00:41:45,926
You just came and suddenly called me out here.

387
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:50,086
How long are you staying here?

388
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:52,646
- Quite long.  - Quite long? Great!

389
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:54,886
Since I got a job out here,

390
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:57,281
none of my friends has come to see me.

391
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,686
- You seem really lonely.  - Yeah.

392
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:04,606
Look, San.

393
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:07,366
Do you know JP Corporation?

394
00:42:07,606 --> 00:42:08,766
I do.

395
00:42:09,045 --> 00:42:12,686
They own all the businesses around here.

396
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,584
- Mr. Kuer's order.  - Whoa!

397
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:18,726
Thank you for this...

398
00:42:19,192 --> 00:42:20,512
- Look at the name.  - It says "Kuer."

399
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,725
- Yeah, and what about this?  - It says "Kuer" too.

400
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,046
Is there a "San"?

401
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:25,538
Order it yourself.

402
00:42:25,632 --> 00:42:26,686
That cup wasn't for me?

403
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,112
Order it yourself, and pay for mine.

404
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:35,046
I want an iced Americano.

405
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:36,806
What's with him?

406
00:42:42,463 --> 00:42:43,463
San!

407
00:42:44,246 --> 00:42:45,246
Is she your girlfriend?

408
00:42:46,806 --> 00:42:48,886
No. She's my adviser.

409
00:42:49,205 --> 00:42:50,926
- I'll hit on her then.  - Whoa!

410
00:42:51,872 --> 00:42:55,166
She's not my girlfriend yet, but maybe in the future.

411
00:42:57,078 --> 00:42:58,562
Do you have a crush on her?

412
00:43:02,532 --> 00:43:04,006
Hey, Ann.

413
00:43:04,272 --> 00:43:06,565
This is San. San, this is Ann.

414
00:43:06,658 --> 00:43:08,406
- Good morning, Ann.  - Good morning.

415
00:43:08,766 --> 00:43:10,406
Whoa! San!

416
00:43:11,012 --> 00:43:12,092
You sit over there.

417
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,766
Hey, San!

418
00:43:13,952 --> 00:43:15,526
I can't sit there?

419
00:43:16,106 --> 00:43:17,366
You're still the same.

420
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:19,126
I'm sorry about that, Ann.

421
00:43:19,586 --> 00:43:23,286
My friend San is a detective inspector here.

422
00:43:23,966 --> 00:43:27,766
I called him out here because he's a local.

423
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:29,606
He can tell us

424
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:31,766
how JP is doing its business.

425
00:43:36,086 --> 00:43:37,966
I trusted you.

426
00:43:38,806 --> 00:43:42,366
You couldn't even get them to sign the contract.

427
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:46,086
I'm sorry, Grandfather.

428
00:43:47,486 --> 00:43:50,006
Kuer is already in Phuket.

429
00:43:50,112 --> 00:43:51,606
He's staying at our hotel.

430
00:43:51,886 --> 00:43:54,206
I believe he will sign it if he sees

431
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,726
how big we are over there.

432
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:02,409
If all you can do is give reports,

433
00:44:03,879 --> 00:44:05,446
don't even bother!

434
00:44:17,246 --> 00:44:19,166
Invite him to a welcoming party.

435
00:44:19,593 --> 00:44:20,966
I'll talk to him myself.

436
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,686
Yes, sir. I'll arrange that.

437
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:28,086
Where is Phim?

438
00:44:28,446 --> 00:44:29,846
Why is she not back with you?

439
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:35,286
Did you guys argue again?

440
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,046
Phim went to see her friend at the resort.

441
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:07,406
When will you move to the big office in town?

442
00:45:07,752 --> 00:45:09,726
You've been nesting yourself here.

443
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:13,406
I don't know who to turn to when I have problems.

444
00:45:14,026 --> 00:45:16,366
You're the one who got me here.

445
00:45:18,252 --> 00:45:19,806
I did.

446
00:45:20,253 --> 00:45:22,444
I didn't think you would be here all the time.

447
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,084
I thought I would get to see you on your days off.

448
00:45:26,006 --> 00:45:29,086
You're always here. You don't go to the town on your days off.

449
00:45:33,065 --> 00:45:34,651
I'll go to town next week.

450
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,606
I need to sort out the accounting.

451
00:45:37,926 --> 00:45:40,646
What about you? How long are you staying?

452
00:45:40,985 --> 00:45:45,086
Until I feel like going back.

453
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:55,539
Noot.

454
00:45:55,926 --> 00:45:56,926
Not now.

455
00:45:57,579 --> 00:45:58,846
I'm not in the mood.

456
00:46:00,186 --> 00:46:02,145
I wanted to say I got a car for Mr. Kuer...

457
00:46:02,252 --> 00:46:03,726
I know!

458
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:11,766
Uh...

459
00:46:14,046 --> 00:46:15,246
I'm sorry, Rit.

460
00:46:16,998 --> 00:46:18,246
Thank you so much.

461
00:46:52,028 --> 00:46:54,126
Why would Grandfather suck up to him?

462
00:47:15,726 --> 00:47:19,566
So that means JP executives have some influences around here.

463
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:23,326
Of course. Everyone wants to get close to their wealth.

464
00:47:25,814 --> 00:47:28,326
I think you can't avoid doing a joint venture with JP.

465
00:47:28,986 --> 00:47:31,566
We just need to score the most beneficial deal.

466
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:45,766
Hello?

467
00:47:47,766 --> 00:47:49,006
Hello.

468
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:52,126
My staff said you're already there.

469
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:56,006
I want to see it for myself.

470
00:47:56,426 --> 00:47:57,966
So that I can tell you

471
00:47:58,153 --> 00:48:00,726
why I don't want to do a joint venture with JP.

472
00:48:06,479 --> 00:48:08,366
Let's talk about that later.

473
00:48:08,592 --> 00:48:10,046
You're our guest.

474
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:12,446
We want to host a welcoming party.

475
00:48:13,486 --> 00:48:16,566
My grandfather wants to invite you to dinner. I hope you won't mind.

476
00:48:18,326 --> 00:48:20,046
If this is an invitation from your grandfather,

477
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:22,606
I can't refuse.

478
00:48:23,992 --> 00:48:25,366
Tomorrow at six.

479
00:48:26,293 --> 00:48:27,406
Okay.

480
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:40,526
JP's chairman invited me to dinner tomorrow.

481
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:58,006
- Kuer.  - What?

482
00:48:58,239 --> 00:48:59,846
Where are they hosting the dinner?

483
00:49:00,082 --> 00:49:01,246
Right here.

484
00:49:03,612 --> 00:49:05,846
They must really want to do that joint venture.

485
00:49:07,326 --> 00:49:08,806
Why do you think so?

486
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:12,206
They can host their dinner anywhere,

487
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,526
but they choose to come to you themselves.

488
00:49:17,813 --> 00:49:20,166
How many people are coming?

489
00:49:21,546 --> 00:49:23,166
I'm not sure.

490
00:49:25,325 --> 00:49:26,406
Well...

491
00:49:27,072 --> 00:49:30,046
Do you want me to go with you? I can help to listen.

492
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:37,406
Many of them are coming.

493
00:49:38,012 --> 00:49:39,686
With me, you won't feel so outnumbered.

494
00:49:43,453 --> 00:49:46,846
At least I can enhance your executive image.

495
00:49:51,842 --> 00:49:54,566
Can you go as my girlfriend?

496
00:50:10,854 --> 00:50:13,486
(Can you go as my girlfriend?)

497
00:50:32,566 --> 00:50:34,686
Why are you asking me this?

498
00:50:38,292 --> 00:50:39,446
I like you.

499
00:50:58,926 --> 00:50:59,926
Okay.

500
00:51:01,752 --> 00:51:03,166
Okay, what?

501
00:51:05,966 --> 00:51:09,366
I'll be your girlfriend.

502
00:51:29,303 --> 00:51:30,566
You're my girlfriend.

503
00:51:31,926 --> 00:51:33,286
I can hold your hand, right?

504
00:52:03,173 --> 00:52:04,926
I don't like him.

505
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:07,126
Why would I be excited?

506
00:52:20,486 --> 00:52:23,646
I said yes to him so easily. Would he think I'm an easy girl?

507
00:52:26,292 --> 00:52:28,292
You just said yes to me,

508
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:30,606
and you're sighing this much?

509
00:52:33,098 --> 00:52:35,846
How long have you been there?

510
00:52:35,979 --> 00:52:38,726
Since you opened your door.

511
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:51,046
Ann, I ordered a dress for you for tomorrow.

512
00:52:52,038 --> 00:52:53,166
When did you order it?

513
00:52:53,366 --> 00:52:55,846
Just now, when you opened the door.

514
00:52:57,653 --> 00:52:59,046
Let's have dinner together tonight.

515
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:14,486
She's cute when she's agreeable.

516
00:53:37,486 --> 00:53:38,647
Hello?

517
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:46,046
Tell him to wait in the lobby. I'll be there.

518
00:53:57,566 --> 00:53:58,566
Phim!

519
00:53:59,246 --> 00:54:00,606
Did you see the gossip?

520
00:54:00,886 --> 00:54:05,326
No. I'm stressed enough. I don't want to know about others.

521
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:08,606
I mean, it's about you.

522
00:54:10,746 --> 00:54:11,966
What is it?

523
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:15,450
I read it.

524
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:17,366
"A socialite named C from Phuket

525
00:54:17,526 --> 00:54:21,366
has been fooling around so much that his wife, Mrs. P, has had enough.

526
00:54:21,447 --> 00:54:24,406
She attacked her husband's mistress."

527
00:54:25,006 --> 00:54:26,486
I think it's alluding to you and Chanoot.

528
00:54:44,092 --> 00:54:45,366
Phim!

529
00:54:47,779 --> 00:54:50,846
Please take care of the place. It's a holiday, so it's quite crowded.

530
00:54:50,926 --> 00:54:52,046
Yes, sir.

531
00:54:52,446 --> 00:54:53,606
Miss Un is here.

532
00:54:59,086 --> 00:55:00,566
How do you know I'm here?

533
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:03,886
Why didn't you tell me you were in Phuket?

534
00:55:05,526 --> 00:55:07,286
How do you know I'm here?

535
00:55:08,526 --> 00:55:11,446
You're staying at JP's hotel. How could I not know?

536
00:55:12,837 --> 00:55:15,171
How did you handle Miss Un's booking?

537
00:55:15,284 --> 00:55:18,366
She paid in advance.

538
00:55:18,846 --> 00:55:20,846
If Miss Un needs anything, you can bill it to me.

539
00:55:20,939 --> 00:55:22,206
Yes, sir.

540
00:55:22,638 --> 00:55:23,898
Thank you.

541
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:28,846
Since you're here,

542
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:31,232
let's find somewhere to talk, shall we?

543
00:55:44,486 --> 00:55:45,486
Chanoot?

544
00:55:48,046 --> 00:55:49,046
Good morning.

545
00:55:49,127 --> 00:55:53,526
We'd like a hot Americano and iced cocoa, please.

546
00:55:53,646 --> 00:55:56,512
Okay. A hot Americano and iced cocoa.

547
00:55:56,612 --> 00:55:57,806
Please wait.

548
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:19,286
(He fools around a lot.)

549
00:56:19,566 --> 00:56:23,206
Thankfully, he doesn't have a serious girlfriend.

550
00:56:25,086 --> 00:56:26,246
How are you?

551
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:29,166
Were your eight years in New York better than here?

552
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:33,446
A lot better. I worked hard, but I felt comfortable.

553
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:38,126
You should have called me. I could have helped.

554
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:40,046
I didn't need it.

555
00:56:43,646 --> 00:56:44,846
Are they arguing?

556
00:56:47,086 --> 00:56:49,606
If you want me to come home, forget it.

557
00:56:50,413 --> 00:56:51,606
I'm not going home.

558
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:54,006
I'm just here to see my mom.

559
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,286
When are you going back?

560
00:56:59,772 --> 00:57:01,052
I won't be here for long.

561
00:57:19,086 --> 00:57:22,126
Did she ask to come with me to rub it in Chanoot's face

562
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:25,639
and to show off her boyfriend to Phim?

563
00:57:37,466 --> 00:57:38,886
Mr. Kuer is here, sir.

564
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:43,662
Good morning. Please wait a bit, Mr. Kuer.

565
00:57:43,766 --> 00:57:44,766
Okay.

566
00:57:45,886 --> 00:57:47,246
Good morning, Mr. Kuer.

567
00:57:48,846 --> 00:57:52,406
- Good morning.  - I brought a car for you to use while you're here.

568
00:57:52,738 --> 00:57:53,738
Oh.

569
00:57:54,692 --> 00:57:55,766
Thanks.

570
00:57:57,366 --> 00:57:58,366
Here.

571
00:58:00,238 --> 00:58:02,286
Mr. Thevarit.

572
00:58:02,446 --> 00:58:03,446
Yes, sir.

573
00:58:03,606 --> 00:58:04,866
- Thank you.  - Yes, sir.

574
00:58:05,052 --> 00:58:08,286
If you need anything, you can call me anytime.

575
00:58:09,206 --> 00:58:10,926
- Okay.  - I have to go now.

576
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:14,326
Here you are, Mr. Kuer.

577
00:58:15,045 --> 00:58:16,846
- Thank you.  - Thank you, sir.

578
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:32,966
Phim.

579
00:59:03,388 --> 00:59:06,486
My grandfather asked about you today.

580
00:59:07,406 --> 00:59:08,726
I miss you so much.

581
00:59:11,585 --> 00:59:13,006
What's wrong with you, Phim?

582
00:59:13,959 --> 00:59:16,886
Are you proud of what you've done?

583
00:59:17,232 --> 00:59:18,646
Are you?

584
00:59:22,406 --> 00:59:24,046
Don't be mad like this, Phim.

585
00:59:28,406 --> 00:59:29,486
You keep fooling around.

586
00:59:29,606 --> 00:59:32,606
You sleep with everyone like a stray dog.

587
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:34,719
How much of our reputation is ruined?

588
00:59:37,806 --> 00:59:38,966
I'm sorry.

589
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:40,846
You're sorry.

590
00:59:41,686 --> 00:59:43,006
And then you do it again the next day.

591
00:59:43,886 --> 00:59:45,926
Do you think I'm stupid?

592
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:48,606
I'm not stupid.

593
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,206
I just kept my mouth shut.

594
00:59:50,312 --> 00:59:52,926
I kept my mouth shut for a selfish man like you.

595
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,286
It's over.

596
00:59:56,412 --> 00:59:57,846
It was just one night.

597
00:59:58,073 --> 01:00:00,073
I told you I wouldn't do it again.

598
01:00:00,173 --> 01:00:01,819
What would you have me do?

599
01:00:09,759 --> 01:00:11,006
Just do anything

600
01:00:11,326 --> 01:00:13,206
to make this rumor go away.

601
01:00:17,726 --> 01:00:20,346
I'll try to fix it.

602
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,286
I'll sleep in another room.

603
01:00:46,806 --> 01:00:48,406
You want me to delete it?

604
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:50,126
(How much do you want?)

605
01:00:51,672 --> 01:00:52,846
Three hundred thousand.

606
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:55,886
Isn't that too much?

607
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:58,286
If you don't delete it, I'll sue you.

608
01:00:59,046 --> 01:01:02,406
Sue me, then. You wouldn't have called me if it wasn't true.

609
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:04,886
(Listen.)

610
01:01:05,006 --> 01:01:07,286
How much do you think I pay for my sources?

611
01:01:07,439 --> 01:01:09,046
I have to bear the cost of this.

612
01:01:11,192 --> 01:01:12,846
I'll text you my account number.

613
01:01:44,473 --> 01:01:46,566
- Hello, Sa.  - You're in Phuket, right?

614
01:01:46,772 --> 01:01:48,486
I want to go there to dig up some news.

615
01:01:48,646 --> 01:01:50,646
Come here then. Kuer is here too.

616
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:52,806
What is Kuer doing there? Is he on vacation?

617
01:01:52,939 --> 01:01:57,119
No. He said he had a joint venture on a dock with JP.

618
01:01:57,233 --> 01:01:59,686
That's good. We can have a reunion.

619
01:01:59,986 --> 01:02:02,286
I'll also get some information there.

620
01:02:02,606 --> 01:02:03,606
What news are you after?

621
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:05,606
It's about a couple around there.

622
01:02:05,687 --> 01:02:07,006
I'll send it to you.

623
01:02:07,106 --> 01:02:09,286
- Okay.  - See you.

624
01:02:20,526 --> 01:02:22,083
(Socialite couple P and C,)

625
01:02:22,164 --> 01:02:23,686
(big business owners in Phuket, to break up?)

626
01:02:29,565 --> 01:02:32,486
(San: Have you seen this?)

627
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:42,686
(San: Have you seen this?)

628
01:02:46,013 --> 01:02:47,726
The news that broke out

629
01:02:48,606 --> 01:02:50,166
made Noot come to see Un.

630
01:02:51,446 --> 01:02:52,846
And they fought.

631
01:02:57,765 --> 01:03:01,446
(Un: Has the dress been delivered?)

632
01:03:13,566 --> 01:03:16,148
(Un: Has the dress been delivered?)

633
01:03:16,246 --> 01:03:17,566
He read it but isn't replying?

634
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:22,566
(Un: If you're not bringing the dress to me, I'm going to bed.)

635
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:48,206
Why aren't you replying?

636
01:03:51,506 --> 01:03:53,126
I...

637
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:55,326
Are you angry?

638
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:57,166
No.

639
01:03:57,966 --> 01:03:59,926
Then what's wrong?

640
01:04:01,233 --> 01:04:03,986
Can you come in?

641
01:04:17,185 --> 01:04:19,726
Can you stop pacing and tell me what's wrong?

642
01:04:22,106 --> 01:04:23,286
I was wondering.

643
01:04:23,546 --> 01:04:24,766
Wondering about what?

644
01:04:33,526 --> 01:04:36,326
You and Chanoot...

645
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:45,366
What's your relationship with him?

646
01:04:49,126 --> 01:04:51,886
Where did this thought of yours come from?

647
01:04:54,132 --> 01:04:56,286
I saw you argue with him and walk away.

648
01:04:59,126 --> 01:05:00,446
Is it about this?

649
01:05:12,392 --> 01:05:14,766
Don't tell me you believe news like this?

650
01:05:30,805 --> 01:05:32,206
I have a boyfriend.

651
01:05:32,592 --> 01:05:33,966
I won't cheat on him.

652
01:05:38,786 --> 01:05:40,994
I'll try this dress on.

653
01:05:41,094 --> 01:05:43,573
If it doesn't fit, I can return it tomorrow.

654
01:05:57,106 --> 01:05:58,646
You said yes to him so easily.

655
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:00,686
And then you kissed him!

656
01:06:02,686 --> 01:06:04,366
Un, you fool!

657
01:06:22,752 --> 01:06:25,726
I think Mr. Kuer is quite smart.

658
01:06:28,058 --> 01:06:29,246
Really?

659
01:06:29,879 --> 01:06:33,126
Will he accept the joint venture with JP?

660
01:06:34,386 --> 01:06:35,606
I don't know.

661
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:37,766
If he's as smart as I think,

662
01:06:38,212 --> 01:06:40,366
he won't cooperate with JP.

663
01:06:42,573 --> 01:06:43,886
We'll find out tomorrow.

664
01:06:44,485 --> 01:06:46,206
Grandfather wants me to drive him.

665
01:06:46,499 --> 01:06:48,426
I think he will let me join the meeting.

666
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:34,406
I dealt with it for you.

667
01:07:43,739 --> 01:07:45,046
That's good.

668
01:07:45,972 --> 01:07:47,972
I don't have to be so humiliated.

669
01:07:49,779 --> 01:07:51,926
My grandfather wants you to attend tonight's dinner.

670
01:07:54,246 --> 01:07:55,406
For what occasion?

671
01:07:55,726 --> 01:07:57,086
It's a meeting with clients.

672
01:07:58,566 --> 01:08:00,246
They're from C-Itsara.

673
01:08:23,286 --> 01:08:24,566
Good evening, Mr. Prawit.

674
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:27,246
Good evening. Please sit down.

675
01:08:35,846 --> 01:08:37,006
Good evening.

676
01:08:40,012 --> 01:08:41,766
It's been a few years.

677
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,646
Did you miss me?

678
01:08:53,065 --> 01:08:55,286
You're not screwing my wife, are you?

679
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,486
You're the one who did that to me eight years ago.

680
01:09:00,306 --> 01:09:01,526
Un!

681
01:09:02,486 --> 01:09:04,846
Tonight, I'm here as Mr. Kuer's girlfriend.

682
01:09:05,926 --> 01:09:07,926
Please be respectful, Grandfather.

683
01:09:08,053 --> 01:09:09,366
Were you using me?

684
01:09:09,665 --> 01:09:10,766
Yes.

685
01:09:11,639 --> 01:09:15,526
But I didn't lie when I said I liked you.

686
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,046
You can drop your facade.
