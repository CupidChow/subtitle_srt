1
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,286
Don't ever get back together with Kuer.

2
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:49,584
If you start dating him again,

3
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:51,510
even if you work for our company,

4
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,149
I'll fire you.

5
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:56,386
Can you give me a chance?

6
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,766
I followed him to an alley, where they found him dead.

7
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,998
I didn't kill him, though.

8
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,766
Didn't you say you gave up on him?

9
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:11,281
Yet you're still anxiously worried about him.

10
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:12,806
Are you sure you want to do this?

11
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:16,446
Thank you so much.

12
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:18,086
Please come in.

13
00:02:29,462 --> 00:02:33,566
You again? Do you want to be kicked out like a dog and embarrass yourself?

14
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:37,526
Try kicking me out, then.

15
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,966
Kicking out a pregnant woman is outrageous to the guests.

16
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,486
Pregnant?

17
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:46,566
Are you pregnant?

18
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:49,806
- Whose baby is it?  - Do you even care?

19
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:51,966
You won't even

20
00:02:52,142 --> 00:02:54,566
let me pay respect to Noot's casket.

21
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:57,445
Whose baby I'm having,

22
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:01,446
whether or not the baby is an heir of Jangwangprawas,

23
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,326
you don't even have to care at all.

24
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:14,246
Hey, she's approaching you.

25
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:27,486
It's Kuer's.

26
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,646
If you're not letting me pay respect to Noot's casket,

27
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:50,566
I'll be excused.

28
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:59,814
Wait. Phim!

29
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:03,566
Good afternoon, sirs.

30
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:06,126
Good afternoon.

31
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,766
That's just too messed up.

32
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,446
How shameless must she be?

33
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:31,726
She announced her pregnancy at a funeral.

34
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:33,702
Yeah!

35
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:39,086
What did she say to you before she left?

36
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:42,606
Did she say whose baby it was?

37
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:48,566
- It's Kuer's.  - What?

38
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:50,446
Is it Kuer's baby?

39
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,646
So the rumors of their affairs

40
00:04:55,006 --> 00:04:56,246
were true?

41
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:01,366
I told you I would find evidence to prove my innocence.

42
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:05,726
But so far, I haven't been able to figure out what can prove it to you

43
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:09,046
or make you understand that Phim and I are just friends.

44
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:13,726
With what happened, every accusation makes sense.

45
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:16,486
But it was never true.

46
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:18,966
I never slept with Phim.

47
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,846
Not even once.

48
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:28,926
If you check the timeline,

49
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,966
it's been about two months since the golf resort incident.

50
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:35,126
If she slept with him back then,

51
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,406
it would make sense if she's pregnant now.

52
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:39,326
I saw her at the apartment.

53
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:42,046
That was before you went to the golf resort.

54
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:44,006
The timeline does make sense.

55
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:51,606
We'll have to see what happens.

56
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:55,366
Grandfather will surely talk to me about this tomorrow.

57
00:05:56,677 --> 00:05:58,406
What if Kuer finds out?

58
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:01,446
He'll probably say it's not true.

59
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:06,126
If you know he'd deny it, why would you say that to embarrass yourself?

60
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,246
I don't need to say anything. I'll just do nothing.

61
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,646
Un was the only one I told.

62
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:16,246
If someone finds out, it's only because of her.

63
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:20,526
I can still say she's lying.

64
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,826
I would say that I told her it was Noot's baby

65
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:26,686
and that she wanted to discredit me because she had beef with Kuer and me.

66
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:33,606
When the time comes,

67
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:37,366
if Mr. Chairman finds out it's Noot's baby,

68
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:41,366
that it's an heir of Jangwangprawas, he'll surely take your side.

69
00:07:01,998 --> 00:07:03,406
Who are you calling?

70
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:04,646
(Hello?)

71
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:06,406
San?

72
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:07,806
I'm sorry for calling at this hour.

73
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,766
It's okay. What's up, Un?

74
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:13,846
(I need your help.)

75
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:15,926
How can I help you?

76
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:18,606
Can I see you tomorrow?

77
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:21,926
Yes. At my place or the station?

78
00:07:22,246 --> 00:07:23,406
At your place.

79
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,590
Please send me your location.

80
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:28,486
Okay. I'll share the location after we hang up.

81
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,806
Thank you.

82
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:33,286
San!

83
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:34,766
What did she say?

84
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,766
Did something happen to Un? I'm coming with you.

85
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:39,766
I'll drive. When we get there,

86
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:41,526
you two just jump out and rush.

87
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,166
- Wait!  - What?

88
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:45,086
I'm getting myself a glass of water.

89
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:53,726
San, what did Un say? Tell me!

90
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:58,086
Hang on. You two are assaulting a police officer.

91
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:03,166
Okay. I'll tell you. I will.

92
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:04,486
What did she say?

93
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:12,886
Are you sure you're going alone?

94
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:19,646
What about Kan?

95
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:28,766
Kan.

96
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,566
Yes, Mrs. Wan.

97
00:08:30,662 --> 00:08:32,662
Can you go out and buy some things for me?

98
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:36,206
Nok took a few days off. Nobody else runs the kitchen.

99
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:38,206
I can't go out myself.

100
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:40,566
What do you need me to buy?

101
00:08:41,046 --> 00:08:42,246
Here's the list.

102
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,806
Please tell Miss Un I'll be back soon.

103
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:52,646
She's going to work early this morning.

104
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:54,486
Okay.

105
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:03,646
Is your mom in on this too?

106
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:07,286
Kan has just left.

107
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:09,126
Thank you, Mom.

108
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:12,086
- I have to go now. I'll tell you when I get back.  - Go.

109
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,646
Gade, do you know where she's going so early?

110
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:20,853
Why doesn't she want Kan with her?

111
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,526
- Un is...  - Where could she be going?

112
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:27,646
I don't think it would be hard to guess.

113
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:30,806
She's probably sneaking out to see Kuer.

114
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,526
What? Where is your friend going?

115
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:39,006
- She...  - She's going to the market.

116
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:43,966
Nok is not here. I need someone to buy groceries.

117
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:48,206
Don't tell me

118
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:51,566
you're covering up for your daughter.

119
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,726
If Father finds out his granddaughter is still a fool for Kuer,

120
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:58,246
he will never be okay with that.

121
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:02,343
I have to go now.

122
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:10,446
I'll prepare breakfast. Father can't be late.

123
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:31,926
Are you looking for Kuer?

124
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:34,366
I'm not.

125
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:39,606
What do you want to talk to me about, Un?

126
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:43,806
I found out something from the last person who saw Kuer's shooter.

127
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:51,046
Why do I need to come out with you?

128
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:54,366
Because you want to find out what San and Un are talking about.

129
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,166
Why do I have to sit so close to him?

130
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:03,726
I want to see her.

131
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,686
So you're planning to walk to her

132
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:09,837
when she walks out of there, right?

133
00:11:10,222 --> 00:11:12,222
This is the only way I can get to see her.

134
00:11:12,317 --> 00:11:13,766
You're a stalker.

135
00:11:14,664 --> 00:11:16,846
I know, but what can I do?

136
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,126
(We're done.)

137
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:30,926
What the heck? Leaving me all of a sudden?

138
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,150
Okay, okay! Just go.

139
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:35,629
I need to do my job.

140
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,086
What's wrong with you?

141
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,326
What's wrong with me?

142
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:40,846
You two are sitting at my lucky spot.

143
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:43,022
You make people disappear.

144
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:45,446
How can I do my job then?

145
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:47,486
This is a public place, mister.

146
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:48,806
Anyone can be anywhere.

147
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:52,766
I can be here. He can be there. You can be here. It's none of my business.

148
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:55,086
The problem is I was sitting here first.

149
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,214
You two took my spot!

150
00:11:57,406 --> 00:12:00,206
You scared off those taking out the trash. Understand?

151
00:12:00,882 --> 00:12:02,829
- Well...  - Sa, are you staying here?

152
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,126
I'm not staying!

153
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:07,046
- I'm in a hurry. Otherwise...  - Just go!

154
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:09,206
This place is already taken.

155
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:10,686
She's crazy.

156
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:13,326
Getting lovey-dovey with her boy at a dumpster?

157
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:18,566
If the culprit is still out there, Kuer needs to watch his back.

158
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:20,166
I need you to deal with this, please.

159
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:21,886
- Okay.  - Thank you.

160
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:23,246
By the way, Un.

161
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,486
Well, it's

162
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,246
- nothing.  - I have to go.

163
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:51,766
I wanted to say I was heading to the station.

164
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,899
I need to follow the lead you gave me.

165
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:58,286
Sa, are you busy? Can you drive me there?

166
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:01,646
Please drive me there.

167
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:06,486
Let's go!

168
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:10,846
Un.

169
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,966
Is something the matter?

170
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:16,534
Phim showed up at the funeral yesterday.

171
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:18,926
She said she was pregnant.

172
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,326
Did she say that herself?

173
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,910
Are you surprised?

174
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,190
She said she wanted to keep it a secret.

175
00:13:27,926 --> 00:13:31,326
Keep it a secret? So I could be a fool and forgive you easily?

176
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:33,486
Wait, Un.

177
00:13:33,677 --> 00:13:35,006
What do you mean?

178
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:36,926
Phim said it was your baby.

179
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:39,486
It's not, Un.

180
00:13:39,614 --> 00:13:40,886
It's not my baby.

181
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,030
If it's not yours, then whose is it?

182
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:45,766
Before Noot died, he told me himself

183
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,246
that he hadn't slept with Phim for a long time.

184
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:52,846
Un.

185
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:56,966
What I said I couldn't tell you,

186
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,766
I'll tell you now.

187
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:10,246
Is she here again?

188
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,566
You sure date a lot of boys.

189
00:14:14,757 --> 00:14:16,366
You change your boys like your underwear.

190
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:18,446
How many have you brought here?

191
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:20,886
Hey, let me ask you this.

192
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:23,286
- Did you have any problem with this old man?  - Yeah.

193
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:26,446
I thought so. That's why you seemed odd.

194
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:28,678
I was sitting here with Kuer earlier.

195
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,926
- Is that all?  - No.

196
00:14:31,197 --> 00:14:33,006
The old man said I sat at his spot.

197
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:35,074
- Was he talking to himself?  - No, I responded.

198
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:38,006
See? I knew it, Sa.

199
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:43,406
Just sit here. We can see who gets in and out of the house.

200
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:46,846
When Kuer and Un finish talking, we can ask him what they talked about.

201
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:50,286
Well, well. You sure are catching up to the news, Sa.

202
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,886
My page, "Gossip with Sa," didn't happen with luck, you know?

203
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:56,206
Yeah, I know.

204
00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:59,766
"Gossip with Sa," you know everything.

205
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,533
- Was that a compliment?  - It was.

206
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:07,211
Whoa! It's so hot. When can we get back in?

207
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:09,326
Wait for Un to come out first.

208
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:10,526
Hey.

209
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:13,886
Are you two leaving or what?

210
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:16,166
If you aren't, I'll leave.

211
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:18,326
Flirt all you want.

212
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:20,446
I hope you have a lot of kids.

213
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:23,566
I hope you grow old together, in sickness and in health.

214
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:25,606
Till death do you part, right?

215
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,846
- Okay?  - Till death do us part.

216
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:30,606
He gave us his blessing.

217
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,886
- Yeah!  - He did.

218
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:35,846
- Thank you, mister.  - Yeah!

219
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:39,286
Hey.

220
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:44,566
Don't you want to have a lot of kids, as he said?

221
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:46,886
I need sex before I can have kids, right?

222
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:49,486
That's right. Let's go!

223
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:51,966
- Go where?  - To make babies.

224
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:54,166
- San!  - Sorry, I forgot.

225
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:55,598
- We need to see this first.  - Yeah!

226
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:57,646
Okay, okay.

227
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:03,446
Why are you telling me this right now?

228
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:06,366
Phim said it first.

229
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:08,646
I think it's time I can say it too.

230
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:11,546
I don't want you to get the wrong idea

231
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:14,446
that I got Phim pregnant.

232
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,886
So the baby is Noot's,

233
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:22,078
but she can't say it because of cancer?

234
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:25,406
She's deciding whether to keep the baby.

235
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:28,446
She told me

236
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:30,966
her cervical cancer

237
00:16:31,374 --> 00:16:33,846
was caused by Noot's womanizing behaviors.

238
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:37,126
They didn't use protection, and Phim received carcinogens.

239
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,510
I feel sorry for Phim

240
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:44,806
because she went through a lot.

241
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:48,246
She's not happy in her life, Un.

242
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:51,686
She has no right to destroy others' happiness.

243
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,926
Can you forgive me now?

244
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:06,421
You still need to prove it anyway.

245
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:11,206
Un.

246
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:15,526
I miss you, Un.

247
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:35,926
Can you give me a chance to make you smile,

248
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:38,446
to make you happy again?

249
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:26,886
Mrs. Wan.

250
00:18:27,516 --> 00:18:30,046
These are the groceries you need.

251
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:31,806
Thanks.

252
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:43,846
Where is Miss Un?

253
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:50,086
She said she needed to go to work and had left.

254
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:55,262
Eat breakfast first. You can follow her later.

255
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:58,822
Okay.

256
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:06,726
Have you been here long, Mrs. Wan?

257
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,686
Since Un was born.

258
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:12,526
Miss Un is smart,

259
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:14,446
probably like her father.

260
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:17,526
And she's kind and strong like you.

261
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,246
Un is smart like Vee.

262
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:26,126
If he were still here, he would have been very proud.

263
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,886
It's a shame he died too soon.

264
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:37,166
I heard he died in an accident.

265
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:43,286
I don't believe it was an accident.

266
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,806
Korn, Vee's driver,

267
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:50,014
took very good care of his cars.

268
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:52,966
He wouldn't have left a problem unfixed in his car,

269
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,606
especially a broken brake hose that led to the accident.

270
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:02,046
I think

271
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:05,166
someone wanted Vee dead.

272
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,526
It might even have been someone close.

273
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,246
I have to go now.

274
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,646
Rit, my dear.

275
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:38,886
Are you sure the board meeting today will change your grandfather's mind?

276
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,613
I talked to the board members.

277
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:43,606
Several of them are pushing for me.

278
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:47,926
At least your grandfather should listen.

279
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:51,446
And by the way,

280
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:55,606
what's going on with Phim?

281
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:57,806
Phim?

282
00:20:58,437 --> 00:20:59,622
What about her?

283
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:02,166
She announced her pregnancy at the funeral.

284
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:04,926
Is the baby Noot's?

285
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:09,166
I don't know.

286
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:11,326
She didn't say whose baby it was.

287
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,134
Is that so?

288
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:16,206
If it's really Noot's baby,

289
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:19,326
do you think Grandfather will take her back?

290
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:23,726
Let's wait until we can find out more.

291
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:25,966
Deal with that later.

292
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:29,246
Go do your job, my son.

293
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,606
Yes.

294
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:53,686
I need to go back to work at the resort.

295
00:21:55,477 --> 00:21:57,086
Can't you take any more days off?

296
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:01,645
How can you be here alone?

297
00:22:04,638 --> 00:22:06,406
I'm fine by myself.

298
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,446
When will we know the gender of the baby?

299
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:11,166
At four months.

300
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:13,046
How many months in are you now?

301
00:22:18,494 --> 00:22:22,486
It's been over three months now.

302
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,486
You should think about this.

303
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:32,278
If you speak the whole truth,

304
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:34,286
don't even think about Kuer.

305
00:22:34,598 --> 00:22:36,846
Live the rest of your life, and raise your kid.

306
00:22:38,101 --> 00:22:40,406
Will that make you happy enough?

307
00:22:42,998 --> 00:22:45,406
And let Un have everything?

308
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:49,366
She's getting the guy and the position in the company.

309
00:22:49,773 --> 00:22:53,366
I think after Un, and if your kid is a boy,

310
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:56,497
he's the next in line to succeed her anyway.

311
00:22:56,781 --> 00:22:59,126
Your kid will get rich no matter what.

312
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:04,066
Everyone labeled me unfaithful.

313
00:23:04,613 --> 00:23:06,613
They blamed Noot's death on me too.

314
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,166
Do you think Grandfather will accept my kid and me?

315
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:17,246
If I don't have Kuer,

316
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:19,286
I'll have nothing.

317
00:23:22,726 --> 00:23:25,326
I'll get the door. You pack up.

318
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,326
Kuer.

319
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:43,909
Why did you tell Un the baby was mine?

320
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:48,486
You know it's not true.

321
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:52,526
What do you want by doing this, Phim?

322
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:55,166
I never said that.

323
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:58,173
Did Un assume that herself?

324
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:01,789
I know she doesn't like me,

325
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:04,646
but it's not right to blame it on me like this.

326
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:07,134
I'm just here, minding my own business.

327
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:11,366
It's true. I haven't been fine.

328
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:13,726
My husband just died.

329
00:24:15,318 --> 00:24:17,886
My family thought I had an affair with you.

330
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:22,726
Do you think I was stupid enough to say that to Un,

331
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,206
basically confirming the rumors

332
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,766
and taking my kid out of Jangwangprawas' inheritance?

333
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:30,526
Why would Un lie, then?

334
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:34,726
She wants to get rid of my kid and me.

335
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:39,886
I heard her grandfather is appointing Un as Vice President in Noot's place.

336
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:44,366
Perhaps, greed has changed Un.

337
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:49,326
If you insist that way,

338
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:53,046
I'll need a doctor's note

339
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:57,206
stating it's impossible that I slept with you.

340
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:01,886
Okay.

341
00:25:02,926 --> 00:25:04,646
Are you here to ask

342
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:10,406
for evidence to prove your innocence to Un to get back with her?

343
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:13,453
Do you think I'd give that to you?

344
00:25:14,717 --> 00:25:17,006
Aren't you too selfish, Kuer?

345
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:19,966
I won't give you that. Go home.

346
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:46,286
Who was it?

347
00:25:46,886 --> 00:25:48,006
Kuer.

348
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:51,046
Did he come to take you back?

349
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:55,566
Take me back?

350
00:25:57,821 --> 00:26:00,046
He wanted a doctor's note

351
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:05,686
to prove to Un he didn't sleep with me.

352
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:22,046
I think you should consider what I said.

353
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,326
Mek.

354
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:17,886
I'll take that call.

355
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,286
Yes, Dad.

356
00:27:39,654 --> 00:27:40,654
Hello?

357
00:27:41,198 --> 00:27:42,726
This is Artit speaking.

358
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:45,726
Lastly,

359
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:48,446
the vacant Vice President position.

360
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:53,846
I'm giving it to Un.

361
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:59,606
Unyamanee Jangwangprawas, my granddaughter, will take Chanoot's place.

362
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,430
Miss Un is too green.

363
00:28:05,837 --> 00:28:07,837
She has never worked here before.

364
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:10,246
If you appoint her as VP straight away,

365
00:28:10,476 --> 00:28:11,886
is that okay?

366
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:14,933
I agree with Mr. Chan.

367
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:17,766
Why don't we promote one of our own?

368
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:23,046
Yes, sir. Mr. Thevarit has been here for a long time. He has potential.

369
00:28:31,446 --> 00:28:35,766
I'll have Un on trial for three months.

370
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:38,246
We'll see the KPI.

371
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:42,446
If Un is not good enough for the job, we will talk again.

372
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:46,166
I'll do my best.

373
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,726
Why didn't Mr. Chairman just pick you in the first place?

374
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:07,206
If he wanted her,

375
00:29:07,406 --> 00:29:09,246
even if the whole board disagreed,

376
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:11,454
he would have insisted anyway.

377
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,886
What do we do now?

378
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:15,886
You have the senior executives' support.

379
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:19,606
Yet Mr. Chairman still insisted on giving Un a trial run.

380
00:29:20,653 --> 00:29:23,366
If she doesn't get in my way, I'd be okay.

381
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:29,166
But in an ideal world, that position should be yours.

382
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:34,966
We're lucky Grandfather only give her a three-month trial.

383
00:29:35,644 --> 00:29:37,126
If she makes a mistake,

384
00:29:37,518 --> 00:29:39,366
I'll have my chance next.

385
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:48,526
Mek.

386
00:29:49,437 --> 00:29:51,086
I'll be away for a couple of days.

387
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:52,766
Where are you going, Dad?

388
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:54,126
I'm visiting my friend.

389
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,526
Please take care of the house.

390
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,806
Will you be back in time for our next boat trip?

391
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,446
I will.

392
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:04,526
How can I let you go alone? I'm off.

393
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,126
I'll help you, Dad.

394
00:30:19,573 --> 00:30:21,766
- Don't sneak away.  - Yes, Dad.

395
00:30:30,198 --> 00:30:32,966
That's odd. He never spoke of his friends.

396
00:30:39,502 --> 00:30:40,966
Phim is pregnant with Noot's baby.

397
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:43,052
I went to the hospital with Phim

398
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,686
because she was diagnosed with cervical cancer.

399
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:48,726
Repeated HPV infections caused it.

400
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:51,866
How did Phim get repeated HPV?

401
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:53,726
Noot slept with other women.

402
00:30:53,957 --> 00:30:55,406
They have HPV.

403
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:57,166
He didn't use protection.

404
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,366
He infected Phim.

405
00:30:59,782 --> 00:31:02,286
Why does Phim keep this a secret?

406
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:04,446
Grandfather wants Noot's baby.

407
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,550
I'm not sure, either.

408
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:11,486
Phim told me she wasn't sure if she'd keep the baby.

409
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:15,006
If she's getting treatment, she has to choose.

410
00:31:15,412 --> 00:31:17,046
The treatment can affect the baby.

411
00:31:18,838 --> 00:31:21,246
Also, Phim doesn't want anyone to find out.

412
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:23,949
If people knew she had cancer,

413
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:27,926
everyone would realize her family life was not as good as it seemed.

414
00:31:30,397 --> 00:31:33,006
Appearance? Is that all she cares about?

415
00:31:34,854 --> 00:31:37,166
This is why I feel sorry for her.

416
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:41,326
She has a scar from a dysfunctional family

417
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:43,686
and tries to keep it to herself.

418
00:31:44,046 --> 00:31:46,326
She tries to act like she's happy.

419
00:32:19,926 --> 00:32:23,486
I talked to the board. There should be no opposition next time.

420
00:32:24,302 --> 00:32:27,886
I just want to know if you're good enough to carry the company.

421
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:32,646
I'm the Vice President. I'm still second to the President.

422
00:32:33,006 --> 00:32:35,006
Aren't they worried about it too much?

423
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:42,406
You have three months to gain their trust.

424
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,366
That should be enough.

425
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:47,566
Yes.

426
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:53,646
Now, we deal with Phim.

427
00:32:57,606 --> 00:32:59,126
What did she say to you yesterday?

428
00:32:59,797 --> 00:33:01,797
Did she tell you whose baby it was?

429
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,526
Is it Noot's or Kuer's?

430
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,966
She didn't tell me anything.

431
00:33:13,062 --> 00:33:15,606
What are you trying to hide?

432
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,326
I saw her talking to you.

433
00:33:21,837 --> 00:33:23,606
I didn't hear what she said.

434
00:33:27,893 --> 00:33:29,206
She...

435
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:31,446
What if your grandfather asks you

436
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,686
what Phim said to you?

437
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:36,206
What will you say to him?

438
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:41,686
You haven't thought about that, have you?

439
00:33:46,477 --> 00:33:48,477
You're good at everything except lying.

440
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:49,720
If you're a criminal,

441
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,246
you'd have been caught even before you committed the crime.

442
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,046
You suck so bad at lying.

443
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,726
That's too much.

444
00:33:58,406 --> 00:33:59,726
Then tell me.

445
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,126
What will you tell your grandfather?

446
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:07,126
I'll say Phim told me she was leaving.

447
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:09,413
Are you her friend or what?

448
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:11,366
Yeah, he'll believe you.

449
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,046
What should I say then?

450
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:17,966
Tell him

451
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:20,846
she came to insult you.

452
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:23,686
Will he believe that?

453
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:25,686
Just try it.

454
00:34:27,054 --> 00:34:29,446
Phim insulted me.

455
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,606
I think she was upset that she wasn't allowed to pay respect to Noot.

456
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:37,566
She doesn't dare curse at you. That's why she came to me.

457
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:41,206
Is that so?

458
00:34:45,638 --> 00:34:49,006
What if the child is Noot's kid,

459
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:52,886
and it turns out to be a boy?

460
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:59,106
I trust you to take care of the one thing I love the most in my life.

461
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:00,686
That's JP.

462
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:05,806
Can you promise me that you would never betray me,

463
00:35:06,268 --> 00:35:08,268
that you would never date Kuer again?

464
00:35:08,518 --> 00:35:13,126
Because he was the reason you and I lost a loved one.

465
00:35:21,726 --> 00:35:23,206
Did you promise him?

466
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:25,366
I did.

467
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:27,726
Can you keep that promise?

468
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:34,606
I told you. You're the worst at lying.

469
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,629
Who can lie as well as you do, then?

470
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,446
I'm not like you. I don't make stuff up for a living.

471
00:35:43,382 --> 00:35:44,846
Was that an insult?

472
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:53,046
You're thinking about making up with Kuer, aren't you?

473
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,446
Are you keeping a straight face?

474
00:35:58,028 --> 00:35:59,326
Tell me this, then.

475
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:01,206
What did he say?

476
00:36:01,446 --> 00:36:03,126
What made you waver?

477
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:05,606
He told me about him and Phim.

478
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:08,846
Did he tell you all of Phim's secret?

479
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:13,566
I still need to see something to prove that it's true.

480
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:18,766
Did you call me out for ice cream just to tell me this?

481
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:20,926
No.

482
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:24,286
I need your opinion on something.

483
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:25,726
What?

484
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:30,846
Yesterday, I said to Tony

485
00:36:32,086 --> 00:36:34,366
I'd give him a chance.

486
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:38,326
Gade!

487
00:36:38,757 --> 00:36:42,166
He chased you for what? Seven or eight years? And he's just got his chance!

488
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:45,646
And he will get heartbroken because Kuer turned himself around?

489
00:36:47,766 --> 00:36:49,486
I feel sorry for the man.

490
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,006
I didn't call him here.

491
00:36:58,526 --> 00:36:59,806
I did.

492
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,918
Who are you choosing?

493
00:37:03,197 --> 00:37:05,197
What should I say to Tony?

494
00:37:05,478 --> 00:37:09,086
Do I tell him I'd give him a chance yesterday because my hormones swung?

495
00:37:11,957 --> 00:37:13,053
Let's go.

496
00:37:20,055 --> 00:37:21,311
Don't worry.

497
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,366
I'm heading out to get some food.

498
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:26,686
You can do your job.

499
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:28,526
I'm fine by myself.

500
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:33,846
I'll be here for a few days, and then I'll go to the office to see you.

501
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:36,199
Thank you.

502
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:39,886
Whatever you do, be careful. Take your time, and don't fall over.

503
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:41,406
I'll let you get back to work.

504
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,966
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman.

505
00:38:32,806 --> 00:38:33,806
Gade.

506
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:36,126
Thank you.

507
00:38:37,286 --> 00:38:39,646
About Un giving you a chance?

508
00:38:41,135 --> 00:38:42,406
Good for you.

509
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:47,766
How did you choose this restaurant? Is no one here? Is it good?

510
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:49,806
I rented the whole place to ourselves.

511
00:38:53,452 --> 00:38:57,406
He's giving it his all. His effort and his money.

512
00:38:57,718 --> 00:39:00,166
He doesn't even know he's getting dumped.

513
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:11,646
(Phim)

514
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:15,679
(Phim)

515
00:39:17,806 --> 00:39:19,326
Won't you take my call?

516
00:39:19,438 --> 00:39:22,686
Your grandfather won't cremate Noot until the case is closed?

517
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:27,446
That's why at the end of the ceremony last night,

518
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:29,406
your grandfather didn't talk about cremation at all.

519
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:30,686
Really?

520
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,366
Will you be here until the cremation?

521
00:39:39,472 --> 00:39:40,646
(Phim)

522
00:39:51,149 --> 00:39:52,149
What is it, Phim?

523
00:39:52,294 --> 00:39:55,646
Kuer, do you want to eat out with me?

524
00:39:59,462 --> 00:40:02,206
Si just went back to work.

525
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,726
No one is eating with me.

526
00:40:13,926 --> 00:40:15,086
Phim.

527
00:40:15,286 --> 00:40:16,606
What happened, Phim?

528
00:40:30,286 --> 00:40:31,606
(Phim!)

529
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,166
(Hello.)

530
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:04,082
It's a woman.

531
00:41:04,197 --> 00:41:05,622
I can't open the door.

532
00:41:10,497 --> 00:41:11,886
Miss?

533
00:41:11,998 --> 00:41:13,686
Can you call an EMT?

534
00:41:16,637 --> 00:41:17,702
Miss?

535
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:19,766
Un, watch out.

536
00:41:25,423 --> 00:41:27,086
Be careful of the glasses.

537
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,646
Miss?

538
00:41:47,357 --> 00:41:49,606
There's an accident on the beach-side road.

539
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,126
We called an EMT.

540
00:41:51,311 --> 00:41:53,606
Okay. I'll be there soon.

541
00:42:12,453 --> 00:42:15,006
Is there anything else you want to review?

542
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,286
You're Phim's best friend, right?

543
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:38,766
Un.

544
00:42:41,078 --> 00:42:42,326
Phim?

545
00:42:44,486 --> 00:42:45,766
Did she hit the brake?

546
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:48,446
The traffic was light. Why did she hit the brake?

547
00:42:48,757 --> 00:42:50,206
Take photos of everything.

548
00:42:50,732 --> 00:42:52,406
Did anyone see what happened?

549
00:42:52,965 --> 00:42:58,646
We didn't. We were in the restaurant and heard the crash, so we came out.

550
00:42:59,061 --> 00:43:00,886
Is there any other vehicle involved?

551
00:43:01,086 --> 00:43:03,726
We didn't see one. We only saw this car when we came out.

552
00:43:06,606 --> 00:43:10,606
Do you know that the car's owner in that accident

553
00:43:11,062 --> 00:43:12,366
is Phim?

554
00:43:12,837 --> 00:43:14,837
I just realized when I rushed in.

555
00:43:15,669 --> 00:43:17,669
Do you think my friend did it?

556
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:19,815
No. I just asked based on what I see.

557
00:43:19,926 --> 00:43:22,086
You seem to think my friend is involved somehow.

558
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:24,726
You ask such a leading question.

559
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:29,166
Why?

560
00:43:29,421 --> 00:43:32,126
This is just like a show I wrote. You will end up doing it.

561
00:43:32,326 --> 00:43:35,006
You two fight for a guy, and you get rid of your rival.

562
00:43:35,382 --> 00:43:36,726
That's the plot.

563
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:43,086
The guy is here too. Who wrote this scene?

564
00:43:51,246 --> 00:43:52,806
Excuse me. Is the victim alright?

565
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:54,726
She seems to be fine, sir.

566
00:43:54,878 --> 00:43:56,846
She's just knocked out cold.

567
00:43:57,102 --> 00:44:00,206
- We need to examine her thoroughly.  - It's getting complicated.

568
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,446
I might need to take a statement from you guys later.

569
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:04,686
Okay, sir.

570
00:44:04,863 --> 00:44:06,166
You got it.

571
00:44:09,204 --> 00:44:11,486
- Oh, San?  - Yeah, it's me.

572
00:44:11,638 --> 00:44:13,766
How do you find out about Phim's accident?

573
00:44:14,157 --> 00:44:16,846
I was on the phone with her when it happened.

574
00:44:17,086 --> 00:44:18,446
Un was at the scene.

575
00:44:18,606 --> 00:44:19,846
Where is she?

576
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:23,966
I'll talk to Un.

577
00:44:24,653 --> 00:44:27,046
Is anyone coming with the victim?

578
00:44:38,646 --> 00:44:40,486
- I will.  - This way, please.

579
00:44:41,022 --> 00:44:45,006
(If all I have is love, would that be enough?)

580
00:44:45,127 --> 00:44:49,366
(I don't know what it will take.)

581
00:44:49,494 --> 00:44:53,486
(My heart feels frustrated.)

582
00:44:53,622 --> 00:44:57,206
(I'm afraid I'd be left with no one.)

583
00:44:57,334 --> 00:45:01,406
(I know I love you with all my heart.)

584
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:05,046
(I don't know if that will be enough for you.)

585
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:09,166
(If someday that doesn't matter,)

586
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:11,526
(will I be able to live...)

587
00:45:11,678 --> 00:45:12,758
Un.

588
00:45:13,397 --> 00:45:14,846
Shall we go back to eat?

589
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,726
I'm not hungry anymore.

590
00:45:18,797 --> 00:45:21,973
Then let's find a place to hang out.

591
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:28,524
I need to go back to finish my work.

592
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:30,406
Can you walk with me to the car?

593
00:45:30,542 --> 00:45:32,086
I'll drive Un's car home.

594
00:45:32,342 --> 00:45:33,526
Okay.

595
00:45:33,684 --> 00:45:37,646
(I know I love you with all my heart.)

596
00:45:37,766 --> 00:45:41,072
(I don't know if that will be enough for you.)

597
00:45:41,213 --> 00:45:45,126
(If someday that doesn't matter,)

598
00:45:45,262 --> 00:45:48,486
(will I be able to live)

599
00:45:48,591 --> 00:45:52,566
(a life without you?)

600
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:56,606
- (Is it enough?)  - (The love I have for you.)

601
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,006
(Kuer)

602
00:45:59,209 --> 00:46:02,246
- (I love you with all my heart.)  - (Is it enough?)

603
00:46:02,398 --> 00:46:05,166
If you don't feel comfortable talking, don't take the call.

604
00:46:05,398 --> 00:46:10,332
- (Is it enough?)  - (Because love is never easy.)

605
00:46:10,454 --> 00:46:14,326
(Can I make it work to the end?  - Is it enough?)

606
00:46:14,486 --> 00:46:19,526
(I'm afraid for the day I'd be left with no one.)

607
00:46:20,741 --> 00:46:24,366
(Is it enough?)

608
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:51,046
I think you understand what I said.

609
00:46:52,148 --> 00:46:53,198
Yes.

610
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:56,086
You have the opportunity to grow in management.

611
00:46:56,844 --> 00:46:59,966
If you refuse, I can take away your opportunity.

612
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,566
Think about it.

613
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,606
Are you thinking about him?

614
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:19,606
I don't mind

615
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:22,486
if you still think about him sometimes.

616
00:47:24,566 --> 00:47:25,766
I understand.

617
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:29,846
It's impossible to forget all the good feelings you had.

618
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,606
He repeats the same mistake over and over.

619
00:47:33,758 --> 00:47:36,526
Does that mean he doesn't care about you?

620
00:47:40,381 --> 00:47:42,381
I think you should ask yourself

621
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,766
if you want to keep getting hurt for the same thing.

622
00:47:46,758 --> 00:47:49,306
Nobody wants to keep getting hurt for the same thing, Tony.

623
00:47:50,726 --> 00:47:52,166
Then just walk away.

624
00:47:52,758 --> 00:47:55,446
At least, keep your distance to mend your own heart.

625
00:47:58,406 --> 00:48:00,566
I don't want to see you feel this way.

626
00:48:03,174 --> 00:48:04,366
Honestly,

627
00:48:04,725 --> 00:48:06,725
when I see you feeling bad,

628
00:48:07,405 --> 00:48:09,086
I feel uneasy.

629
00:48:14,646 --> 00:48:19,966
You know what? Call in sick today. I'll show you in one day.

630
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,366
- I can't.  - You can.

631
00:48:22,478 --> 00:48:25,206
You calling in sick for a day won't ruin the company.

632
00:48:26,086 --> 00:48:27,326
Let's go.

633
00:48:37,535 --> 00:48:40,766
They say BBQ solves everything.

634
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,726
Did you really just come back from America?

635
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:46,686
I heard this from someone.

636
00:48:46,806 --> 00:48:48,166
I want to try it out with you.

637
00:48:48,366 --> 00:48:50,726
We'll see if the theory is true.

638
00:48:51,046 --> 00:48:53,926
Did you make me call in sick for BBQ?

639
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:56,206
I heard this place is great.

640
00:48:56,838 --> 00:48:58,246
Do you mean the sauce?

641
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,766
Of course, it's great.

642
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:02,246
At least it made you smile.

643
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:06,718
I paid a ton more for the place earlier, but you didn't smile this much.

644
00:49:16,952 --> 00:49:19,766
Maybe BBQ does solve everything, as they say.

645
00:49:22,206 --> 00:49:23,857
Here. Try this.

646
00:49:23,974 --> 00:49:25,206
Thanks.

647
00:49:26,806 --> 00:49:28,206
I promise it's good.

648
00:49:31,624 --> 00:49:33,566
- How is it?  - Great.

649
00:49:46,701 --> 00:49:48,006
Doctor, how is the victim doing?

650
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:50,006
She has some external injuries.

651
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,166
She didn't suffer a concussion.

652
00:49:52,766 --> 00:49:55,006
What about the baby?

653
00:49:55,237 --> 00:49:57,237
An ob-gyn will check that.

654
00:49:57,382 --> 00:50:00,926
I think the victim has her usual doctor.

655
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:02,246
Yes.

656
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,286
She needs to stay in the hospital to monitor her condition tonight.

657
00:50:05,526 --> 00:50:08,166
The staff will inform you of the details.

658
00:50:12,757 --> 00:50:13,886
Doctor.

659
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:18,006
May I ask for her medical record

660
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,406
in case she wants to move to another hospital?

661
00:51:03,886 --> 00:51:05,646
You girls stay here for now.

662
00:51:06,005 --> 00:51:07,926
You will get your own place after you give birth.

663
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,806
We will see when the time comes.

664
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,406
Father, a handkerchief.

665
00:51:20,157 --> 00:51:21,606
I can't believe

666
00:51:22,036 --> 00:51:24,606
my brother would be such a stud.

667
00:51:25,406 --> 00:51:29,606
He has two women at once, and both are pregnant.

668
00:51:32,933 --> 00:51:34,933
From what I see so far,

669
00:51:36,181 --> 00:51:38,406
I guess your kids are both girls.

670
00:51:45,886 --> 00:51:49,286
Come here. Let's take a photo.

671
00:51:56,326 --> 00:51:59,286
It's a shame we got a boy and a girl each.

672
00:52:08,189 --> 00:52:10,286
Are you reminiscing about the past?

673
00:52:12,357 --> 00:52:13,686
Did you regret

674
00:52:14,141 --> 00:52:15,726
having a daughter?

675
00:52:16,686 --> 00:52:18,326
I didn't regret anything.

676
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:20,766
I didn't want anyone else's wealth.

677
00:52:20,926 --> 00:52:23,366
Really? You don't want it at all?

678
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:27,766
Yet you hope your daughter becomes Vice President.

679
00:52:28,029 --> 00:52:31,326
That's because my daughter is capable of the task.

680
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:35,606
If Noot were still here, I'd never let my daughter take his place.

681
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:43,006
But you have a son.

682
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:45,526
I wonder why.

683
00:52:45,747 --> 00:52:47,006
Why what?

684
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:49,277
Why do I want my son to be Vice President?

685
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:52,686
Why would you think about that?

686
00:52:52,797 --> 00:52:55,846
My son belongs to another family, not ours.

687
00:52:56,246 --> 00:52:59,086
Father doesn't even let him use the Jangwangprawas name.

688
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,846
What can I expect?

689
00:53:03,158 --> 00:53:05,158
Do you still expect something, then?

690
00:53:10,773 --> 00:53:11,926
Wan!

691
00:53:13,563 --> 00:53:16,286
I'd be a fool if I didn't want my son to make it big.

692
00:53:17,366 --> 00:53:18,806
And now,

693
00:53:19,406 --> 00:53:23,046
Father doesn't even have a grandson in this family.

694
00:53:23,941 --> 00:53:27,046
Even if my son is an outsider,

695
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:29,206
he still has a chance.

696
00:53:37,406 --> 00:53:38,526
I'm not sure

697
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:40,046
whether the accident today

698
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,286
has anything to do with Mr. Chanoot's death.

699
00:53:44,813 --> 00:53:46,246
Is it an act of revenge, sir?

700
00:53:46,509 --> 00:53:48,006
It's a possibility, sir.

701
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:50,646
Miss Un used to date Mr. Kuer.

702
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:54,686
She's probably upset about Phim stealing her boyfriend. That's jealousy.

703
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:59,086
The tire tracks on the road

704
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:09,006
don't look like it's from Miss Un's family's car.

705
00:54:20,246 --> 00:54:23,286
I think Miss Un has nothing to do with this.

706
00:54:24,646 --> 00:54:28,406
Miss Un probably just happened to be there.

707
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:30,566
The traffic was light.

708
00:54:31,062 --> 00:54:32,926
Why would Mrs. Phim turn her car like that?

709
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:37,126
I think there must have been another vehicle.

710
00:54:42,662 --> 00:54:44,286
We will talk about this later.

711
00:54:44,493 --> 00:54:47,086
You guys take some officers to examine the road.

712
00:54:47,271 --> 00:54:48,846
Check all possible exits.

713
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:50,195
Examine the areas nearby as well.

714
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:52,806
There might be a place for the suspect to hide.

715
00:54:57,886 --> 00:54:59,606
Hello? What is it, Kuer?

716
00:55:03,525 --> 00:55:09,006
What's the matter? You told me to come straight here after work.

717
00:55:09,502 --> 00:55:10,982
Have some coffee.

718
00:55:11,087 --> 00:55:12,166
Thanks.

719
00:55:12,606 --> 00:55:14,246
I need your help.

720
00:55:14,486 --> 00:55:15,726
What is it?

721
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:18,026
Please issue a warrant for a medical record for me.

722
00:55:21,148 --> 00:55:24,326
Are you out of your mind, Kuer?

723
00:55:26,267 --> 00:55:28,766
Dealing with Sa alone is killing me.

724
00:55:28,878 --> 00:55:31,846
I can't handle you going crazy too.

725
00:55:32,182 --> 00:55:34,766
Sa wants me to reopen Un's father's case.

726
00:55:34,876 --> 00:55:38,886
And you want me to issue a warrant for a medical record?

727
00:55:40,388 --> 00:55:42,006
You guys are such good friends.

728
00:55:42,543 --> 00:55:46,006
Why does Sa want to dig up Un's father's case? What's the matter?

729
00:55:47,397 --> 00:55:50,006
I don't know, either. That case was before I got here.

730
00:55:50,237 --> 00:55:53,366
The case happened even before Un was born.

731
00:55:56,486 --> 00:56:00,006
Un's father had a meeting in Bangkok.

732
00:56:00,783 --> 00:56:03,886
His driver was doing his job as usual.

733
00:56:09,246 --> 00:56:10,806
Before the day of the accident,

734
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:14,006
Mrs. Prawing called in a mechanic to examine the car.

735
00:56:15,054 --> 00:56:18,246
The mechanic said the car was fine and ready to travel.

736
00:56:18,957 --> 00:56:22,486
They drove out a few miles, and the accident happened.

737
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,646
Mr. Pravee and his driver both died.

738
00:56:26,949 --> 00:56:29,046
Everyone thought it was an accident.

739
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,566
But there was something strange.

740
00:56:32,406 --> 00:56:36,526
Mr. Prawit is a cunning businessman.

741
00:56:37,206 --> 00:56:39,206
His competitors wanted payback.

742
00:56:39,837 --> 00:56:41,486
It's possible,

743
00:56:42,342 --> 00:56:45,166
but there was no evidence suggesting it was murder.

744
00:56:45,963 --> 00:56:47,446
Except

745
00:56:48,326 --> 00:56:51,406
there was one person the police couldn't find.

746
00:56:52,574 --> 00:56:53,766
Who was it?

747
00:56:53,902 --> 00:56:55,486
The mechanic from the previous day.

748
00:56:55,886 --> 00:56:57,286
Why couldn't they find him?

749
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,430
Mrs. Prawing gave them his number.

750
00:56:59,686 --> 00:57:01,846
The police couldn't reach him no matter what they did.

751
00:57:02,038 --> 00:57:03,406
They couldn't find him.

752
00:57:03,534 --> 00:57:04,727
Even in the garage,

753
00:57:04,853 --> 00:57:06,726
they said the mechanic didn't work there.

754
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:10,726
And this car was usually examined at a service center.

755
00:57:10,966 --> 00:57:12,206
They were in a rush that day,

756
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:15,246
so Mrs. Prawing called in a mechanic.

757
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:18,606
The police suspected that mechanic.

758
00:57:19,806 --> 00:57:21,686
Yet they couldn't find him.

759
00:57:22,165 --> 00:57:24,046
They had no evidence.

760
00:57:24,406 --> 00:57:26,286
They concluded that those two

761
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:28,646
died in an accident.

762
00:57:30,165 --> 00:57:33,166
Why do you know so much about a case from so long ago?

763
00:57:34,342 --> 00:57:38,126
Sa mentioned it to me, so I looked at the files.

764
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:41,926
I wonder if the rumors were true.

765
00:57:43,229 --> 00:57:45,766
Don't talk about it. It's old news.

766
00:57:49,581 --> 00:57:50,926
What about you?

767
00:57:51,516 --> 00:57:52,646
What are you doing?

768
00:57:57,526 --> 00:57:59,726
It's not like I didn't try

769
00:58:00,126 --> 00:58:01,846
before I asked for your help.

770
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:03,846
Doctor.

771
00:58:05,086 --> 00:58:08,069
May I ask for her medical record

772
00:58:08,149 --> 00:58:10,206
in case she wants to move to another hospital?

773
00:58:13,542 --> 00:58:16,406
I need the patient to sign it off herself.

774
00:58:18,237 --> 00:58:20,286
Oh, okay.

775
00:58:20,862 --> 00:58:23,566
- Excuse me.  - Thank you.

776
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,646
I took a ride in that ambulance for that piece of paper.

777
00:58:34,972 --> 00:58:38,006
I forgot it needs to be signed off by the patient.

778
00:58:38,436 --> 00:58:41,366
This is why I was surprised.

779
00:58:41,622 --> 00:58:44,165
I wondered why you jumped in there with Phim.

780
00:58:44,327 --> 00:58:46,166
Un was just right there.

781
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:48,766
Part of me is worried about Phim.

782
00:58:50,357 --> 00:58:54,006
I want Phim's medical record to prove my innocence.

783
00:58:57,885 --> 00:59:00,166
I can't issue that warrant for you.

784
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:03,086
But as your friend,

785
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:05,686
I think I can help you.

786
00:59:12,356 --> 00:59:15,406
You just left, didn't you?

787
00:59:15,814 --> 00:59:19,686
My friend wanted to visit her, and I tagged along.

788
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:23,486
I want to find out what the ob-gyn said.

789
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,446
- Please wait a minute.  - Okay.

790
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:30,726
- I'm going to get some water. Do you need anything?  - No.

791
00:59:37,966 --> 00:59:39,005
The baby is fine, sir.

792
00:59:39,086 --> 00:59:40,446
Nurse.

793
00:59:40,534 --> 00:59:42,646
I bought food for the patient.

794
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:44,798
Can I have some plates and bowls?

795
00:59:44,966 --> 00:59:46,167
- Of course, sir.  - Thank you.

796
00:59:46,246 --> 00:59:47,726
- I will fetch some for you.  - Okay.

797
00:59:52,646 --> 00:59:54,086
Take photos of those papers now!

798
01:00:02,005 --> 01:00:04,470
- Quick!  - Yeah. Cover me.

799
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:11,277
She's here.

800
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,686
- Did you get it?  - I did.

801
01:00:16,726 --> 01:00:18,326
Here are some plates and cutlery.

802
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,186
- Thank you so much.  - Thank you.

803
01:00:23,046 --> 01:00:24,246
Please wait.

804
01:00:30,486 --> 01:00:31,766
You forgot your food.

805
01:00:31,901 --> 01:00:33,926
Oh! Yeah.

806
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:35,480
- San.  - I forgot.

807
01:00:35,606 --> 01:00:38,646
- I'm sorry.  - Thank you so much.

808
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:57,646
How are you doing?

809
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:04,246
It hurts a little.

810
01:01:06,015 --> 01:01:09,326
I told you to walk carefully, but you drove off the road.

811
01:01:19,461 --> 01:01:22,006
I didn't drive off the road myself.

812
01:01:24,046 --> 01:01:26,646
Someone was trying to hit me.

813
01:01:28,294 --> 01:01:30,766
Did you see the person's face? Who was it?

814
01:01:31,205 --> 01:01:33,569
I only saw it at a glance,

815
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:37,086
but if I saw that person again, I'd recognize him.

816
01:01:43,455 --> 01:01:46,006
How did you find out?

817
01:01:46,173 --> 01:01:47,806
Kuer called me.

818
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,686
What did the doctor say about...

819
01:01:59,024 --> 01:02:00,606
Your baby?

820
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:03,846
It's still breathing.

821
01:02:17,286 --> 01:02:18,766
I bought food for you.

822
01:02:19,384 --> 01:02:21,126
- Thank you.  - Here are some plates.

823
01:02:21,286 --> 01:02:22,286
Yes.

824
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:25,200
Phim.

825
01:02:25,335 --> 01:02:27,502
I brought San here to ask about the accident.

826
01:02:29,694 --> 01:02:32,846
I want you to tell me what happened.

827
01:02:54,669 --> 01:02:56,046
Do you feel better now?

828
01:03:18,998 --> 01:03:20,486
I do feel better now.

829
01:03:38,422 --> 01:03:39,646
Thank you.

830
01:03:40,006 --> 01:03:43,366
I'm the one who should thank you.

831
01:03:46,046 --> 01:03:47,326
See you later.

832
01:03:49,566 --> 01:03:50,686
Un.

833
01:03:52,566 --> 01:03:55,186
If you continue living in Thailand,

834
01:03:55,661 --> 01:03:57,286
if you'll stay and work here,

835
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,046
I'll resign from my job.

836
01:04:02,702 --> 01:04:05,686
I think you shouldn't think about that for now.

837
01:04:14,606 --> 01:04:18,046
I mean, I don't know whether I will like it here or not.

838
01:04:20,469 --> 01:04:24,566
Please let me know when you decide.

839
01:04:27,606 --> 01:04:29,318
- I have to go now.  - Okay.

840
01:04:58,206 --> 01:04:59,206
Kan.

841
01:04:59,557 --> 01:05:01,126
Where have you been, Miss Un?

842
01:05:01,966 --> 01:05:03,366
I went out for BBQ.

843
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:05,206
Since the morning?

844
01:05:06,758 --> 01:05:09,206
Look, Kan. I'm your boss.

845
01:05:09,437 --> 01:05:12,126
Should you be my boss if you're asking this much?

846
01:05:12,501 --> 01:05:14,086
I work for Mr. Chairman.

847
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:17,566
He told me to report everything you do, and everywhere you go.

848
01:05:17,798 --> 01:05:20,246
You intentionally avoided me today.

849
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:21,786
So I think

850
01:05:22,014 --> 01:05:25,326
you were doing something you don't want him to find out.

851
01:05:26,838 --> 01:05:29,306
I'll tell my grandfather myself where I was.

852
01:05:36,382 --> 01:05:38,286
- He sent this to me.  - Whoa!

853
01:05:38,965 --> 01:05:40,326
What an effort.

854
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:44,086
He said he didn't come to talk to me at the scene

855
01:05:44,246 --> 01:05:46,966
because the officer asked someone to accompany the victim.

856
01:05:47,638 --> 01:05:49,806
He thought that if he had gone with her,

857
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:52,446
he would have had a chance to get this proof.

858
01:05:53,246 --> 01:05:55,726
I was wondering why he went with her.

859
01:05:56,414 --> 01:05:57,686
You wondered too, didn't you?

860
01:05:57,798 --> 01:05:59,798
I did. It killed my mood for the whole afternoon.

861
01:06:02,886 --> 01:06:04,806
The doctor wrote that

862
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,806
HPV infections caused Phim's cancer.

863
01:06:07,028 --> 01:06:08,766
She's 15 weeks into her pregnancy.

864
01:06:08,926 --> 01:06:10,926
We went to the golf resort

865
01:06:11,109 --> 01:06:12,746
just over two months ago.

866
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:18,286
That means the baby is Noot's, as Kuer said.

867
01:06:18,822 --> 01:06:21,366
Hey, did you see this?

868
01:06:22,134 --> 01:06:25,266
The doctor wrote she needed to decide on her treatment.

869
01:06:25,646 --> 01:06:28,846
So does that mean Phim hasn't begun the treatment yet?

870
01:06:29,628 --> 01:06:30,966
I heard this from Kuer.

871
01:06:31,141 --> 01:06:34,766
The treatment could affect the baby.

872
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,206
I don't know what Phim will choose.

873
01:06:39,238 --> 01:06:41,326
What she chooses is none of your business.

874
01:06:41,566 --> 01:06:45,086
All this just means Kuer was telling the truth.

875
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:51,486
What will you do about Tony?

876
01:06:58,404 --> 01:06:59,926
Your grandfather wants to talk.

877
01:07:08,686 --> 01:07:10,366
You took a day off. Where have you been?

878
01:07:11,366 --> 01:07:13,006
I went out with Gade and Tony.

879
01:07:14,052 --> 01:07:16,406
I heard Gade followed you later.

880
01:07:16,893 --> 01:07:18,566
I went to see Tony first.

881
01:07:21,653 --> 01:07:23,086
Are you dating Tony?

882
01:07:24,886 --> 01:07:26,086
Yes.

883
01:07:27,261 --> 01:07:29,046
Do you still keep in touch with Kuer?

884
01:07:29,749 --> 01:07:31,086
No.

885
01:07:36,694 --> 01:07:37,966
That's all.

886
01:07:44,044 --> 01:07:45,486
I don't believe her.

887
01:07:47,046 --> 01:07:48,686
Keep a close eye on her.

888
01:07:49,526 --> 01:07:50,766
Yes, sir.

889
01:07:53,534 --> 01:07:54,686
I want to explain.

890
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:56,286
I have evidence about Phim.

891
01:07:56,462 --> 01:07:57,926
Why would I listen to you?

892
01:07:58,166 --> 01:08:00,246
You can't even listen to your own family!

893
01:08:00,415 --> 01:08:02,206
I want you to listen to Kuer, Grandfather.

894
01:08:02,429 --> 01:08:04,034
He has nothing to do with Noot's death.

895
01:08:04,142 --> 01:08:06,646
You want him as your husband. You can say anything.

896
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:21,726
Grandfather?

897
01:08:22,511 --> 01:08:23,766
Father!
