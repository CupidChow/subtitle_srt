1
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:35,106
Oh! Mom!

2
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:37,472
Mom! I won the scholarship!

3
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,526
- Oh!  - How many times have I told you?

4
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:44,263
My child likes orange curry!

5
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,246
Orange curry, not soup! And yet you keep making soup!

6
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:48,565
How stupid are you?

7
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:50,525
This is why Dad won't accept you!

8
00:00:51,105 --> 00:00:52,606
I'll tell you what.

9
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:56,966
With a stupid mother like you, no matter how smart Un is,

10
00:00:57,173 --> 00:00:59,166
she'll always be the maid's kid!

11
00:01:00,504 --> 00:01:01,504
Mom!

12
00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:05,154
Mom! Are you alright?

13
00:01:05,258 --> 00:01:06,286
What's wrong?

14
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:09,966
What's wrong? It's just some soup. It doesn't hurt.

15
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:12,806
Look. You've been here this long.

16
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:15,366
Surely you would have grown some thick skin.

17
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,726
Why would I leave?

18
00:01:16,912 --> 00:01:18,846
Un is one of the master's grandchildren.

19
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:20,966
- Mom.  - See? This is why.

20
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:23,558
Your kid is smart.

21
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:27,246
She knows she shouldn't argue with me.

22
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:31,606
How is this, then?

23
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:35,126
The rice has gone cold. It doesn't hurt, right?

24
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,806
How dare you!

25
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:42,926
What arrogance! You're smart but uncivilized.

26
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:44,766
You're just the maid's kid!

27
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,886
You really are a parasite.

28
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,686
You're not even my niece, yet I have to raise you.

29
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:51,646
Let me tell you something.

30
00:01:52,126 --> 00:01:53,926
If you were a boy,

31
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:56,766
your mom would have already been married.

32
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:58,366
But you're not!

33
00:01:58,526 --> 00:02:00,006
You're just a troublemaker!

34
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:02,492
It's a shame that my dad is dead.

35
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:06,926
Someone like you, who got married to a fraud who scammed you for money,

36
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,726
wouldn't have been on such a pedestal.

37
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:10,526
You dare to mock me?

38
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,006
Mom, let's go.

39
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:21,126
You can get in trouble for fighting with Wing like that.

40
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:24,486
I don't care. She has no right to do that to you.

41
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,826
Mom, let's leave this house.

42
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:30,726
Where would you go?

43
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:33,806
- We're here...  - I won a scholarship abroad.

44
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:39,766
- Really?  - Yes.

45
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:45,526
The university covers all the tuition fees.

46
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:47,206
They're also giving me a place to stay.

47
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:50,166
I have saved up some cash.

48
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:51,646
I think...

49
00:02:58,046 --> 00:02:59,566
What's wrong, Mom?

50
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:01,966
Why the long face?

51
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:16,726
I'm happy

52
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,726
that you won the scholarship.

53
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,966
But you need your money to spend there.

54
00:03:27,446 --> 00:03:31,006
How long would your savings last?

55
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,326
It's not a problem.

56
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:35,452
I'll just get a job there.

57
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:38,326
It can't be any more exhausting than this house.

58
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:42,926
You're the master's granddaughter.

59
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,646
Your grandfather would give you some money.

60
00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:57,686
Why would you go there? Just study here.

61
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:59,566
I won a scholarship.

62
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:01,406
Won't you let me go?

63
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:06,166
Why would you study economics? Just be an assistant and help the company.

64
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,526
If by helping the company,

65
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:10,206
you mean working for your grandson,

66
00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:12,166
you can just say that.

67
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:14,013
Let her speak.

68
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:16,127
If you still value boys more than girls,

69
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,446
I will always be an assistant, no matter how good I am.

70
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,166
You will never look at me.

71
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:23,126
I want to move forward,

72
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:26,246
not stay where I am forever like you want me to.

73
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:30,646
I never asked for anything.

74
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:32,566
Can I ask you just this once?

75
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:34,846
Just cover her rent and allowance, so she doesn't have to work.

76
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:36,766
She won't even listen to me!

77
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:38,966
Why would I even send her to school?

78
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:42,006
I apologize on my daughter's behalf.

79
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:46,006
If she studies here, I'll pay for everything.

80
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:50,366
Don't bother, Grandfather.

81
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:53,206
Keep all your money for your grandson.

82
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:55,926
I don't want anything from you.

83
00:04:58,452 --> 00:05:00,046
Mom!

84
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:07,206
Keep your money for your funeral.

85
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:12,006
Go!

86
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:14,859
Go wherever you want!

87
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:29,966
Mom, you should come with me.

88
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:36,086
I can't, Un.

89
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,966
When will you be back?

90
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:07,126
I'll be back once I'm ready.

91
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:13,246
My grandfather will know that girls are not meant to stay under men.

92
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:10,966
Phim.

93
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:15,019
Sit down.

94
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:16,966
Please.

95
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:23,046
Sorry that I'm late.

96
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:25,846
I had some business to take care of.

97
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,366
It's okay, Phim.

98
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:46,852
I miss you so much.

99
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:53,086
I'll get your chair.

100
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:55,126
Sit down.

101
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,886
Kue, I have something to tell you.

102
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:04,726
I have something to tell you too.

103
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:34,206
Let's break up.

104
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,486
What do you mean?

105
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,646
I'm sorry.

106
00:08:49,392 --> 00:08:52,246
I hope we can stay friends.

107
00:10:58,109 --> 00:10:59,366
Darn it!

108
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:02,366
When did they hook up?

109
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:20,846
How would I live, Phim?

110
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:23,319
Did he get dumped?

111
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:48,326
(Don't forget your worth. I hope you start a good new life.)

112
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,166
I love you, girl.

113
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:32,046
I love you too.

114
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:38,246
I have to go.

115
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,966
Okay, get in.

116
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,046
An umbrella?

117
00:13:46,162 --> 00:13:52,144
(Don't forget your worth. I hope you start a good new life.)

118
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:26,526
I guessed you'd take this umbrella.

119
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:30,646
I'm going to win the lottery with my guessing ability.

120
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,486
You're making fun of me.

121
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:34,846
Don't you have any work to do?

122
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:37,258
Come in.

123
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:41,686
Mr. Kuer, you're summoned to the meeting room.

124
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:45,566
Do I have a meeting with Grandmother today?

125
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,166
How would I know?

126
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:51,086
She said it was urgent.

127
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:25,206
You still can't wear your tie straight.

128
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:36,366
I didn't wake up to tie it for you this morning.

129
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,886
Have you been wearing a crooked tie all day?

130
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:41,366
It's not a problem.

131
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:43,846
Please

132
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:46,126
take it off for me.

133
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:26,586
Phim,

134
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:30,166
what are you doing here?

135
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:38,126
I found out Noot has a meeting with you.

136
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:40,926
I asked to tag along.

137
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:43,286
Noot?

138
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:45,726
A meeting with me?

139
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,726
How are you these days?

140
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:58,086
I have to go.

141
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,006
Good morning, Kuer.

142
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:33,366
Sit down, Kuer.

143
00:17:52,432 --> 00:17:54,432
Do you have something urgent, Grandmother?

144
00:17:54,886 --> 00:17:55,886
Yes.

145
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,126
This is Chanoot Jangwangprawas from JP Company.

146
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,086
They're interested in doing a joint venture with us at C-Itsara.

147
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:09,412
A joint venture?

148
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:12,166
What do you mean?

149
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:14,326
I'm building a dock in Phuket.

150
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:17,145
JP heard the news. They're specialized in this.

151
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,629
So they sent Chanoot to talk with us.

152
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:21,773
A joint venture is possible.

153
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:28,406
I just learned about this project, so I didn't prepare anything.

154
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:31,452
It's okay.

155
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:33,666
We can just sit here and talk.

156
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:36,526
Please take a look at my offer.

157
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:47,206
I'll leave the two of you to discuss.

158
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:20,686
Good morning, ma'am.

159
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:25,246
Why are you here?

160
00:19:26,286 --> 00:19:28,046
I tagged along with Noot.

161
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:30,046
That's all?

162
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:34,286
I miss Kuer too.

163
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:38,846
I see you're still as friendly as ever.

164
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:44,246
But a married woman

165
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:47,606
is friendly with another man,

166
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:50,686
that's not nice.

167
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:12,726
Do you think Kuer will be okay with that deal, Grandmother?

168
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:14,762
Don't underestimate your brother, Kob.

169
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:18,366
You sent him to do a big project with his ex's bitter husband.

170
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:21,053
- You're just bullying him.  - Hey!

171
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:23,366
Why do you think that?

172
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:32,246
I think Kuer doesn't have feelings for Phim anymore.

173
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:35,606
If he sees her, he might be bothered a bit.

174
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:37,926
But he should know that business is business.

175
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,366
Or...

176
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:45,566
Are you testing Kuer?

177
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,686
I'm at an age where I don't have time for fun.

178
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:51,766
If I die today,

179
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,046
I must ensure that Kuer is strong enough.

180
00:20:56,166 --> 00:21:01,006
Moreover, there is no one better to handle a big name like JP's Chanoot

181
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,126
than Kuer himself.

182
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:10,079
Your offer is interesting.

183
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:12,766
But truthfully,

184
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:16,286
I don't want to waste my time with your company.

185
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:20,966
Also,

186
00:21:22,126 --> 00:21:25,206
I don't like to work with someone who doesn't play by the rules.

187
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,206
I do like you.

188
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,766
You're a discreet person.

189
00:21:38,152 --> 00:21:39,486
Let's just say

190
00:21:40,486 --> 00:21:43,126
you'd better not rush your decision.

191
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:47,126
I want you to come to Phuket and see what we do

192
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:49,726
before you decide.

193
00:21:56,726 --> 00:21:58,246
Is the meeting done?

194
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,126
Are you hungry?

195
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:08,966
Shall we go?

196
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:13,366
Sure. I'm hungry.

197
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:15,846
Phim.

198
00:22:16,486 --> 00:22:17,806
This is Kuer.

199
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:20,606
Kuer, this is Phim.

200
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,806
She's my wife.

201
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:27,326
Yes.

202
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:31,806
Phim and I knew each other.

203
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:35,806
Really?

204
00:22:36,706 --> 00:22:37,886
Yes.

205
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:40,685
Kuer and I met in college,

206
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:42,586
even before I met you.

207
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,166
It's good to see you today.

208
00:22:50,366 --> 00:22:51,606
If you have time,

209
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:53,086
let's catch up.

210
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,806
What were you trying to pull?

211
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:30,686
You introduced me to Kuer

212
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:33,566
when you already knew we knew each other.

213
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:34,885
You knew we used to date

214
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:36,326
before I...

215
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:42,366
Before you marry me?

216
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:47,779
Right.

217
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,486
I want him to know.

218
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:53,766
You're my wife now.

219
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:56,532
He has no right to fall for you.

220
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,726
Even if he does,

221
00:23:59,992 --> 00:24:01,486
he should already know

222
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:02,966
it's too late.

223
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:09,846
That was eight years ago.

224
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:12,486
You're the one who's taking it personally.

225
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:14,806
Don't even think that I don't know.

226
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:17,406
You wanted to see Kuer, right?

227
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,966
That's why you came along.

228
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,292
Just think what you want.

229
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:38,765
Why does it have to be me, Grandmother?

230
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:40,406
I wonder too.

231
00:24:42,046 --> 00:24:44,046
Kob travels a lot.

232
00:24:44,725 --> 00:24:49,046
Kej is too green to deal with a big name like JP.

233
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:51,006
That leaves only you.

234
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:59,328
Grandmother, I'm willing to work on any project,

235
00:24:59,449 --> 00:25:00,846
but not this.

236
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:02,606
Why?

237
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:07,806
So this means

238
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:09,566
you can't separate work from life.

239
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,406
It's been eight years now.

240
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:14,526
Why would you dwell on the past?

241
00:25:15,525 --> 00:25:18,526
If you can't handle this little thing,

242
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:19,886
in the future,

243
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:24,206
how can I trust you to take care of our hundreds of employees?

244
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:28,846
I'll give you time to decide.

245
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:30,686
Tonight,

246
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:33,166
sleep on it

247
00:25:33,372 --> 00:25:35,006
and give me your answer.

248
00:25:40,618 --> 00:25:45,406
Kob, what about our company adviser?

249
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:47,926
Dr. Ann should be in Thailand by now.

250
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:04,526
Who's Dr. Ann?

251
00:26:06,593 --> 00:26:07,966
I have a friend in New York.

252
00:26:08,106 --> 00:26:10,406
He introduced me to Dr. Ann.

253
00:26:10,646 --> 00:26:12,886
They say she's a great economist.

254
00:26:13,326 --> 00:26:16,046
Big companies abroad all want her service.

255
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:20,606
She's interested in our company.

256
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:24,126
It'd be a shame if we don't hire someone of this caliber.

257
00:26:24,806 --> 00:26:26,246
When will she be here?

258
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:27,806
Tomorrow.

259
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:48,806
Un!

260
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:07,086
Vitamins.

261
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:12,566
I love this one! Thank you!

262
00:27:15,773 --> 00:27:17,366
Why did you come back all of a sudden?

263
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:19,446
You were away for eight years.

264
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:22,966
Could it be

265
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:27,486
you got a fiance? Did you come back to get married?

266
00:27:27,585 --> 00:27:29,766
- Does your mom know?  - Stop right there!

267
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:32,806
Your imagination is great for a writer.

268
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:35,406
I came back

269
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,806
for a job interview at C-Itsara tomorrow.

270
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,352
What do you mean?

271
00:27:44,926 --> 00:27:46,326
My friend abroad

272
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,806
said C-Itsara was interested in me.

273
00:27:49,046 --> 00:27:50,846
So they introduced me to them.

274
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:53,686
C-Itsara sent an email to me.

275
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:59,086
They're deciding on a dock project in Phuket.

276
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:00,806
So I replied immediately.

277
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,286
If C-Itsara is doing business in Phuket,

278
00:28:03,772 --> 00:28:06,326
JP Company will surely be interested.

279
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:09,446
So you really came back to get back at your grandfather?

280
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,246
(It's good to see you today.)

281
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:35,086
If you have time, let's catch up.

282
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:42,246
If you can't handle this little thing,

283
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:43,726
in the future,

284
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:47,846
how can I trust you to take care of our hundreds of employees?

285
00:29:45,606 --> 00:29:46,806
Are you busy?

286
00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:49,626
Yeah, my editor is chasing me.

287
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:51,772
Okay. I'll be back.

288
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:54,086
I want to go for a walk and get something to eat.

289
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:57,245
Sorry that I can't go with you.

290
00:29:57,326 --> 00:29:59,168
I'm still busy with this.

291
00:29:59,272 --> 00:30:00,272
It's fine.

292
00:30:00,773 --> 00:30:03,486
There's a noodle place below the building. Please get some for me.

293
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:05,272
Okay. The usual?

294
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,366
Un, be careful.

295
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:13,366
The news said there was someone who liked to expose himself to women.

296
00:30:13,592 --> 00:30:14,686
Really?

297
00:30:15,786 --> 00:30:18,086
These vile men should have their penises cut off!

298
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:19,886
You're still the same.

299
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,646
When I talk about men, whether it's good or bad,

300
00:30:21,872 --> 00:30:23,286
you always get worked up.

301
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:25,566
Okay. I'll be back.

302
00:30:33,213 --> 00:30:35,179
Thank you. Here you go.

303
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:53,206
The news said there was someone who liked to expose himself to women.

304
00:31:16,806 --> 00:31:20,526
- What? Hey!  - Oh, crap!

305
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:29,286
My food!

306
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:34,846
Take this!

307
00:31:37,966 --> 00:31:39,246
Why did you kick me?

308
00:31:51,725 --> 00:31:52,966
You pervert!

309
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:55,366
I'm a pervert?

310
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:57,406
Why did you follow me?

311
00:31:57,879 --> 00:32:00,126
Wait. Who followed you?

312
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:04,286
I was just jogging. I wasn't following you at all.

313
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:07,446
You kicked me and threw the hot noodle soup on my face.

314
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:11,086
I can report you for assault and defamation.

315
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:14,966
Report me? Do it, then! I'll report you too.

316
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,046
What a psycho. You were running after me.

317
00:32:17,206 --> 00:32:20,246
Only a thief and a pervert run like that.

318
00:32:21,126 --> 00:32:22,766
- I'm a thief?  - Yeah.

319
00:32:24,646 --> 00:32:26,366
- You need to fix this.  - No!

320
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:29,726
No!

321
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:32,726
Wait! Miss Noodle!

322
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:49,166
What's this?

323
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,566
Your noodle.

324
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:58,406
A pervert was running after me.

325
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:00,646
This is all that's left.

326
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,046
You really ran into that pervert?

327
00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:05,166
Yeah. I'm glad I ran away into the building.

328
00:33:05,326 --> 00:33:09,126
He was about to strip himself! That gives me the creeps!

329
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:13,046
This gives me the creeps too.

330
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,806
If I could turn back time,

331
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:20,471
I would have stayed single.

332
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:22,246
He's a burden.

333
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:26,326
I have to share whatever money I make with him.

334
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,138
You can say that now.

335
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:30,326
But you go out hunting every night.

336
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:32,407
- I'm cute.  - She still does.

337
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:33,732
Yeah, still.

338
00:33:33,813 --> 00:33:35,806
- She's hot.  - I'm in the spotlight.

339
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:39,606
Phim is the lucky one.

340
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:43,486
Noot loves her so much.

341
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:45,446
It's been years since they got married.

342
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:47,326
He never did anything wrong.

343
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:49,606
He's so good, right?

344
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:53,166
You girls shouldn't be too hard on your men.

345
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,886
You're lucky they're here for you to whine about every night and day.

346
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:59,406
Phim, that's easy for you to say.

347
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:02,726
You have a great guy but look at my husband.

348
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:28,366
Noot?

349
00:34:48,966 --> 00:34:50,446
A meeting?

350
00:34:53,532 --> 00:34:55,406
A meeting until ten?

351
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:16,766
Excuse me. I booked two rooms.

352
00:35:16,886 --> 00:35:20,166
My husband took the other key card with him.

353
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,606
What's your room number?

354
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:24,406
I forgot.

355
00:35:24,506 --> 00:35:28,046
I don't remember the other room, but it's under the same name.

356
00:35:28,646 --> 00:35:31,138
Tell me the room number you remember and your name, please.

357
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:34,046
Chanoot Jangwangprawas, room 3641.

358
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,292
Phim!

359
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,886
Well...

360
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:02,701
I'm really sorry.

361
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,126
He paid me for my service. Please don't hurt me.

362
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:06,606
I know it's not your fault.

363
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:10,526
My husband's a womanizer. He sleeps with everyone like a stud.

364
00:37:10,613 --> 00:37:12,126
You're a fool.

365
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:14,246
I know my husband well enough.

366
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:17,286
Phim, stop that.

367
00:37:20,992 --> 00:37:23,766
This is my advice if you want to find a husband.

368
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:27,486
Find a good one. Don't get a man like mine.

369
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,366
It's karma.

370
00:37:33,486 --> 00:37:34,601
Phim.

371
00:37:35,273 --> 00:37:38,566
I'm the one who should say stop!

372
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,726
This is not the first time, Noot. How many times have you done this?

373
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,486
Phim.

374
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:53,018
You won't sleep with me, so I...

375
00:37:53,112 --> 00:37:56,086
I don't sleep with you because you sleep with everyone!

376
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,766
Phim.

377
00:37:59,406 --> 00:38:00,766
Don't be mad.

378
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,566
I promise I won't do it again if...

379
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:06,766
If you get in bed with me.

380
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:09,086
I'm not mad.

381
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:12,926
But I

382
00:38:13,946 --> 00:38:15,206
hate...

383
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:18,725
I hate cheating men

384
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:21,206
who sleep with everyone when they already have a wife.

385
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:28,086
I shouldn't have married you in the first place.

386
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:32,046
Don't follow me!

387
00:39:15,406 --> 00:39:17,606
If I had chosen Kuer back then,

388
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:25,366
I wouldn't have been hurt like this.

389
00:39:36,526 --> 00:39:37,646
Thank you so much

390
00:39:37,772 --> 00:39:40,166
for choosing to work with C-Itsara.

391
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:43,006
I'm really happy to do so, Mrs. Kamalas.

392
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,686
I think you've read the email.

393
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:48,246
We're about to launch a new dock in Phuket.

394
00:39:48,939 --> 00:39:54,126
Yes, but I believe Phuket already has JP as the big name.

395
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:55,366
That's right.

396
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:00,446
That's why we sent our staff to work with five other small companies.

397
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:04,726
Those five companies are happy to work with us

398
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:06,806
if we were to build a new dock.

399
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:13,006
I guess JP has already sent someone to offer a joint venture.

400
00:40:13,865 --> 00:40:16,766
Because if JP doesn't get to work with C-Itsara,

401
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:19,926
we will become a real threat to them as a competitor.

402
00:40:21,446 --> 00:40:22,806
Now I see

403
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:25,926
why the big companies want you.

404
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:36,046
I want you to serve as the adviser for this project.

405
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:38,446
I'm honored.

406
00:40:40,452 --> 00:40:43,772
You might need to travel from time to time. Are you comfortable with that?

407
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:47,646
- I am.  - My grandson is in charge of this project.

408
00:40:48,185 --> 00:40:50,606
You will meet him when you start working.

409
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:52,598
Alright.

410
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:54,966
When will you be ready to start?

411
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:57,886
As soon as next week.

412
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:29,486
Okay. Let's talk in my apartment.

413
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:32,679
Okay.

414
00:41:46,459 --> 00:41:47,766
Did I hit someone?

415
00:41:51,332 --> 00:41:52,486
Hey!

416
00:41:54,046 --> 00:41:55,526
Are you alright?

417
00:41:59,006 --> 00:42:01,686
You pervert!

418
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,326
Hey, you!

419
00:42:03,645 --> 00:42:05,166
You hit me!

420
00:42:05,346 --> 00:42:08,006
Where were your eyes when you were driving?

421
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:10,766
I drove very slowly.

422
00:42:10,873 --> 00:42:12,973
You're the one who didn't look out for cars.

423
00:42:14,336 --> 00:42:15,336
Hey, you!

424
00:42:16,646 --> 00:42:19,846
You hit me and blame me for that?

425
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,126
I'm

426
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:28,926
- sorry.  - What?

427
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,566
- I'm sorry.  - Say it nicely.

428
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:33,926
I'm sorry.

429
00:42:34,192 --> 00:42:36,366
Are you hurt?

430
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:42,406
I'm not sure.

431
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:47,806
I think I should see a doctor.

432
00:42:48,019 --> 00:42:49,326
- Really? - Yeah.

433
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:52,606
Please wait.

434
00:43:04,178 --> 00:43:05,526
For your treatment fees.

435
00:43:06,526 --> 00:43:08,406
What? I don't want that.

436
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:12,006
Please take it. I'm trying to fix this.

437
00:43:12,153 --> 00:43:13,286
- Hey!  - No!

438
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:16,206
I tried to be nice.

439
00:43:16,326 --> 00:43:17,366
I think

440
00:43:18,526 --> 00:43:20,286
I would rather have your number.

441
00:43:22,652 --> 00:43:23,726
My number?

442
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:25,825
Why would you want that?

443
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:30,686
Look. If you prank calls me or asks for phone sex, I'll curse at you.

444
00:43:31,806 --> 00:43:34,486
Listen, Miss Noodle.

445
00:43:34,732 --> 00:43:37,766
I think you should stop panicking, please.

446
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:40,366
I asked for your number because

447
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:44,166
if my leg got seriously hurt,

448
00:43:44,326 --> 00:43:46,486
I could ask you to treat it.

449
00:43:57,292 --> 00:44:00,606
Or you won't take responsibility?

450
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,846
You want my number, right?

451
00:44:32,472 --> 00:44:33,472
Hey!

452
00:44:33,886 --> 00:44:36,206
Here you go. Take it.

453
00:44:40,326 --> 00:44:41,526
Is this an eight?

454
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:46,286
Call me if you need anything.

455
00:44:47,126 --> 00:44:48,366
I won't hide.

456
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:51,766
- Yes, ma'am.  - I have to go.

457
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:04,806
I'm sorry.

458
00:45:07,152 --> 00:45:08,446
Please move.

459
00:45:18,246 --> 00:45:21,526
What? A woman hit you at the parking lot?

460
00:45:23,712 --> 00:45:25,006
Are you sure you're okay?

461
00:45:27,113 --> 00:45:28,766
She doesn't know you?

462
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:32,526
Wait! Miss Noodle!

463
00:45:36,832 --> 00:45:37,966
No.

464
00:45:38,926 --> 00:45:40,286
But I want to get to know her.

465
00:46:00,526 --> 00:46:02,566
I got in trouble on my first day at work.

466
00:46:03,486 --> 00:46:05,486
I'm glad he didn't sue me for damages.

467
00:46:06,926 --> 00:46:09,086
I'm glad my car is fine.

468
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:12,726
Who is he anyway?

469
00:46:13,393 --> 00:46:15,966
He's the pervert from last night.

470
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:20,526
I think he works at C-Itsara.

471
00:46:21,638 --> 00:46:22,872
Really?

472
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,359
Hang on.

473
00:46:33,326 --> 00:46:34,686
Whose number is this?

474
00:46:37,845 --> 00:46:39,206
Hello?

475
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:43,846
Is this Ann?

476
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:46,446
You...

477
00:46:46,926 --> 00:46:49,206
You ran over me this afternoon.

478
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,086
Ran over you?

479
00:46:56,305 --> 00:46:58,406
Tell him I'm not here. I already went to bed.

480
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:03,112
Ann is in the bathroom.

481
00:47:03,552 --> 00:47:05,206
Would you like to leave a message?

482
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:13,806
Please tell Ann to have a look at my wound.

483
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,406
It suddenly hurts.

484
00:47:18,772 --> 00:47:20,766
He wants to see you.

485
00:47:20,873 --> 00:47:21,873
No!

486
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:23,606
Where?

487
00:47:26,126 --> 00:47:29,326
If he lives in Pak Kret, I would have to drive so far!

488
00:47:31,945 --> 00:47:34,006
M-Condo?

489
00:47:34,206 --> 00:47:36,286
Room number 3906.

490
00:47:36,426 --> 00:47:38,766
(Mr. Kuer, room number 3906.)

491
00:47:38,926 --> 00:47:40,606
I'm not going. I'm not!

492
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:41,926
She will be there.

493
00:47:42,972 --> 00:47:44,726
Would you like Ann's number?

494
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:46,446
So you can call her directly.

495
00:47:46,926 --> 00:47:48,566
Is this not Ann's number?

496
00:47:48,925 --> 00:47:50,286
It's not.

497
00:47:50,446 --> 00:47:52,846
Ann just came back from abroad.

498
00:47:53,006 --> 00:47:54,966
She just got a new number, and she can't remember it.

499
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,246
This is Ann's number, 089...

500
00:48:04,126 --> 00:48:06,286
Okay. Thank you.

501
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,366
Gade, why did you give him my number?

502
00:48:13,006 --> 00:48:15,041
Why did you give him my number?

503
00:48:15,122 --> 00:48:18,046
- Well...  - This is for the best.

504
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:20,579
He can call you himself.

505
00:48:21,086 --> 00:48:22,326
Miss Ann.

506
00:48:31,406 --> 00:48:32,846
Is this not too much of a coincidence?

507
00:48:32,972 --> 00:48:34,766
He lives in the same building.

508
00:48:36,952 --> 00:48:38,726
Did he follow me?

509
00:48:41,206 --> 00:48:44,606
Kuer has been living here for ages.

510
00:48:44,753 --> 00:48:46,406
He didn't just move in.

511
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:48,292
How do you know?

512
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,406
Kuer is

513
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:54,406
the most wanted person as a husband by every woman in this building.

514
00:48:54,487 --> 00:48:56,126
Girl, he's hot,

515
00:48:56,259 --> 00:48:58,366
like I can see how good he looks from the moon.

516
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:01,726
Go!

517
00:49:02,152 --> 00:49:03,526
Get dressed

518
00:49:03,886 --> 00:49:05,766
and see him at his apartment.

519
00:49:10,005 --> 00:49:11,286
Go!

520
00:49:51,459 --> 00:49:52,566
Do you

521
00:49:53,173 --> 00:49:54,486
need anything?

522
00:49:55,006 --> 00:49:56,006
No.

523
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:58,966
Do you want me to dress your wound? I'll do it and go back.

524
00:50:03,725 --> 00:50:05,446
I need to go to the bathroom first.

525
00:50:07,626 --> 00:50:08,766
Please wait here.

526
00:50:51,852 --> 00:50:54,526
Is he Mrs. Kamalas' grandson?

527
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:13,406
Does it hurt so much that you can't walk?

528
00:51:14,486 --> 00:51:16,526
Just a bit. It doesn't hurt much.

529
00:51:18,032 --> 00:51:19,286
I'm sorry.

530
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:20,566
It's okay.

531
00:51:20,685 --> 00:51:24,935
I just need you to dress my wound.

532
00:51:35,745 --> 00:51:36,846
Okay.

533
00:52:00,232 --> 00:52:01,766
I'll start then.

534
00:52:02,088 --> 00:52:03,126
Yes.

535
00:52:18,713 --> 00:52:20,806
- Does it hurt?  - I was pretending.

536
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:24,246
It does hurt. Look how red it is.

537
00:52:26,492 --> 00:52:28,006
Please bear with it.

538
00:52:55,579 --> 00:52:56,966
Can you move?

539
00:52:58,679 --> 00:52:59,886
I can.

540
00:53:09,299 --> 00:53:12,366
What were you doing at C-Itsara?

541
00:53:12,713 --> 00:53:14,046
I had a business meeting.

542
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:17,406
It's done.

543
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,686
Thank you.

544
00:53:25,326 --> 00:53:26,526
You're welcome.

545
00:53:43,046 --> 00:53:45,926
I'll go home now.

546
00:53:47,865 --> 00:53:52,286
If you need me to dress your wound again tomorrow, call me.

547
00:53:56,129 --> 00:54:01,606
Well, I need you to dress my wound tomorrow morning.

548
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:04,846
Okay.

549
00:54:47,366 --> 00:54:49,926
She said just to call her if I need her tomorrow.

550
00:54:52,293 --> 00:54:53,646
What did you say?

551
00:54:55,218 --> 00:54:57,218
I asked her to come, of course.

552
00:54:58,606 --> 00:55:02,086
You jumped at the first chance. Why do you like her so much?

553
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:05,406
She's cute.

554
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:08,566
(She seems like a harsh person,)

555
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:11,926
but she's actually not.

556
00:55:13,132 --> 00:55:14,886
Does she seem unapproachable?

557
00:55:15,366 --> 00:55:16,606
No.

558
00:55:17,806 --> 00:55:19,006
I don't know.

559
00:55:22,446 --> 00:55:23,926
Someone is here.

560
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:27,086
Did Ann forget something?

561
00:55:28,052 --> 00:55:29,446
I have to go now.

562
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:32,526
Okay. That's fine. Let's talk later. Deal with that first.

563
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,366
Did you forget something?

564
00:55:52,846 --> 00:55:53,846
Phim.

565
00:55:54,846 --> 00:55:56,606
I didn't forget anything.

566
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:00,046
I just miss you.

567
00:56:11,926 --> 00:56:14,006
Won't you let me in?

568
00:56:49,926 --> 00:56:51,886
You dressed his wound in his room

569
00:56:52,006 --> 00:56:53,286
and came back with a smile.

570
00:56:53,412 --> 00:56:55,726
See? He's cute, right?

571
00:56:56,206 --> 00:56:57,206
Yes!

572
00:56:57,311 --> 00:56:59,086
- Do you like him?  - I do.

573
00:56:59,286 --> 00:57:00,846
I like him a lot.

574
00:57:01,926 --> 00:57:03,406
Really?

575
00:57:04,606 --> 00:57:05,606
Yeah.

576
00:57:06,206 --> 00:57:08,246
He's an executive at C-Itsara.

577
00:57:08,352 --> 00:57:10,446
He deals with those from JP Corp.

578
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,806
Is he an executive of C-Itsara?

579
00:57:12,966 --> 00:57:15,166
Yeah. That's why I like him.

580
00:57:16,406 --> 00:57:17,486
Wait.

581
00:57:17,746 --> 00:57:19,246
What are you trying to pull?

582
00:57:19,759 --> 00:57:21,006
Think about it.

583
00:57:21,726 --> 00:57:23,806
No matter how successful I am,

584
00:57:24,393 --> 00:57:25,966
my grandfather won't ever be happy for me.

585
00:57:28,726 --> 00:57:29,886
And?

586
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:34,686
If my grandfather sees me as Kuer's girlfriend,

587
00:57:35,046 --> 00:57:36,886
those at JP Corp must sweet talk to me

588
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:38,886
and ask me to do business with them.

589
00:57:40,146 --> 00:57:42,886
I want to see the look on my grandfather's face then.

590
00:58:05,072 --> 00:58:06,072
Why...

591
00:58:07,345 --> 00:58:08,806
Why are you here, Phim?

592
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,045
I have a little problem.

593
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:20,333
I don't know who to talk to.

594
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:01,766
If you don't mind, can I stay here tonight?

595
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:06,966
I can sleep on the couch.

596
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:58,006
Does he know you're here?

597
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:03,726
He wouldn't want to know.

598
01:00:18,766 --> 01:00:20,126
I think you should go home.

599
01:00:20,353 --> 01:00:22,366
Work things out with him.

600
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:24,612
- But...  - I'll drive you home.

601
01:01:00,779 --> 01:01:02,286
Thank you.

602
01:01:04,919 --> 01:01:07,406
But I don't want to see him right now.

603
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:11,966
I think this is your family's problem.

604
01:01:12,379 --> 01:01:15,086
You should figure it out with him.

605
01:01:25,539 --> 01:01:26,568
Okay.

606
01:02:30,965 --> 01:02:32,446
Where have you been, Phim?

607
01:02:44,752 --> 01:02:47,246
I have a headache. I went to get some pills.

608
01:02:48,526 --> 01:02:50,019
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

609
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:53,526
Where are your pills?

610
01:03:13,072 --> 01:03:14,286
Here they are.

611
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:20,206
Kuer, can you stop by a drugstore?

612
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:30,686
Why?

613
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,326
Why? Do you think I lied to you?

614
01:03:39,966 --> 01:03:42,446
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

615
01:03:44,499 --> 01:03:47,206
I'm not a cheater like you!

616
01:03:56,753 --> 01:03:58,326
Don't you think that

617
01:03:58,533 --> 01:04:00,533
I am what I am because of you?

618
01:04:01,453 --> 01:04:04,046
You used to always sleep with me.

619
01:04:05,332 --> 01:04:07,046
So you're blaming me?

620
01:04:07,439 --> 01:04:10,326
I made you become a cheater like this?

621
01:04:11,399 --> 01:04:13,606
I may have said no sometimes.

622
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:15,926
But sometimes it is not always, right?

623
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:17,806
Stop it, Phim.

624
01:04:19,586 --> 01:04:20,846
I said this

625
01:04:20,986 --> 01:04:22,606
because I feel guilty.

626
01:04:23,445 --> 01:04:24,686
I want to apologize.

627
01:04:24,846 --> 01:04:26,926
I want to ask for a chance.

628
01:04:29,572 --> 01:04:30,826
A chance?

629
01:04:32,299 --> 01:04:34,526
A chance for us to be a family again.

630
01:04:36,966 --> 01:04:39,566
A cheater like you want a family?

631
01:04:41,319 --> 01:04:42,566
Phim.

632
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,446
My grandfather wants great-grandchildren.

633
01:04:46,999 --> 01:04:48,846
If you can have a baby for him,

634
01:04:49,393 --> 01:04:52,486
he will let you run the resort. All of it.

635
01:05:00,992 --> 01:05:03,366
If my kid has a cheating father,

636
01:05:04,246 --> 01:05:05,566
why would I want to have it?

637
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:12,406
I promise I won't cheat anymore.

638
01:05:17,132 --> 01:05:20,046
After you give birth,

639
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,326
I'll sign a will to bequeath everything I have

640
01:05:23,766 --> 01:05:25,126
for our kid.

641
01:06:25,805 --> 01:06:28,566
Did you work all night?

642
01:06:29,306 --> 01:06:31,086
I'm two days past my deadline.

643
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:33,386
They chased me so much that I had to turn off my phone.

644
01:06:42,426 --> 01:06:45,726
Do you have to dress up like this to go dress his wound?

645
01:06:47,465 --> 01:06:49,846
I have to go out after.

646
01:06:54,586 --> 01:06:55,806
Drive safely, will you?

647
01:06:57,258 --> 01:06:59,406
Don't hit anyone again.

648
01:06:59,487 --> 01:07:01,646
Okay, I won't. I have to go.

649
01:07:03,046 --> 01:07:04,526
The first aid box is there.

650
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:07,006
I can see it.

651
01:07:27,279 --> 01:07:28,766
Is she coming?

652
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,206
Please come in.

653
01:07:55,659 --> 01:07:56,766
Please.

654
01:08:02,896 --> 01:08:05,246
Please sit on the couch.

655
01:08:12,726 --> 01:08:14,046
So,

656
01:08:14,766 --> 01:08:17,166
has your wound gotten better?

657
01:08:18,006 --> 01:08:19,206
It's getting better.

658
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:20,646
Okay. That's good.

659
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:24,606
Hey, you!

660
01:08:25,366 --> 01:08:27,566
Are you okay? Don't touch it!

661
01:08:27,846 --> 01:08:29,526
- Those pieces will cut your hands.  - I'm sorry.

662
01:08:29,732 --> 01:08:33,286
- I'll take care of it.  - It's okay. Don't touch it.

663
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:35,766
You didn't get any cuts, right?

664
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:37,086
I didn't.

665
01:08:38,265 --> 01:08:40,547
You know what? You go and sit down. I'll take care of this.

666
01:08:40,665 --> 01:08:42,846
- I don't want you to cut your hands.  - Okay.

667
01:08:43,213 --> 01:08:45,566
- I'm sorry.  - It's totally fine.

668
01:08:46,486 --> 01:08:49,446
Be careful. Take a long step like that.

669
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:54,526
It's totally fine.

670
01:08:54,879 --> 01:08:56,879
Just sit comfortably. I'll take care of it.

671
01:09:09,972 --> 01:09:12,046
You can prepare your first aid kit.

672
01:09:12,246 --> 01:09:13,686
I'll sweep these pieces up.

673
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:37,526
Whose earring is this?

674
01:09:48,396 --> 01:09:50,396
I saw Kuer drove you here!

675
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,926
Were you with him?

676
01:09:52,046 --> 01:09:53,406
You hooked up with him, didn't you?

677
01:09:55,118 --> 01:09:56,886
My grandfather wants to invite you to dinner.

678
01:09:56,999 --> 01:09:58,726
If this is an invitation from your grandfather,

679
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:00,846
I can't refuse.

680
01:10:00,986 --> 01:10:02,366
Do you want me to go with you?

681
01:10:02,467 --> 01:10:05,126
Can you go as my girlfriend?

682
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,646
Good evening, Mr. Prawit.

683
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:11,446
Good evening. Please come in.

684
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:14,846
It's been a few years.

685
01:10:15,525 --> 01:10:16,766
Do you miss me?
