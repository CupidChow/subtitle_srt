1
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:55,126
Just find the person who murdered my grandson.

2
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,855
These are the photos I took

3
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:02,326
while tailing Mr. Kuer on Mr. Noot's order.

4
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,646
Are you going to keep her waiting here?

5
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:11,406
I'm here to get the things I need.

6
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:14,886
Nok will come for the rest of it later.

7
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:20,566
Come with me to the house.

8
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:25,326
I unpacked my bags just now.

9
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:27,126
And I'm packing it again.

10
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:43,665
Gade.

11
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:45,766
Pack your bags.

12
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:54,006
Why would you have me here as a third wheel?

13
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:55,358
Un.

14
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:58,846
Please talk to me.

15
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:01,006
There's nothing between Phim and me.

16
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,126
Nothing? Like back at the golf resort?

17
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,686
What did I do at the golf resort?

18
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,406
You slept with her.

19
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:10,846
Do I need to tell you how you did it?

20
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:17,006
Gade, stay here.

21
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,990
So you can find out that men can't be trusted, just like I thought.

22
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:25,326
Good guys only exist in K-dramas.

23
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:30,286
I think I should wait outside.

24
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,086
Gade!

25
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:33,886
Hey!

26
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:44,366
Un.

27
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:48,366
Please calm down and listen to me.

28
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,886
I think I've listened enough.

29
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:57,366
I was a fool for you for a long time.

30
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:00,806
Noot warned me several times.

31
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:04,206
He kept telling me that I couldn't trust men.

32
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,846
I didn't think you'd be a scoundrel like other men.

33
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,286
I was wrong.

34
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:15,606
- Let me go.  - Where are you going?

35
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:17,406
I'm staying with my mom.

36
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:30,686
Un.

37
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:51,726
Keep it for a stupid woman

38
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:54,606
or an evil woman who deserves you.

39
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,286
Un.

40
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:01,266
Are you okay?

41
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,126
The house is quiet.

42
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:37,006
I think everyone already went to bed.

43
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,926
Are you still up, Mom?

44
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:46,686
I heard the car.

45
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,086
Your grandfather has prepared your room.

46
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,166
We prepared a guest room for Gade too.

47
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:54,966
My room?

48
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:57,046
I'm staying with you.

49
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,869
You can stay in your own room.

50
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,086
Nok is cleaning it up.

51
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:04,166
Let's get inside.

52
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:14,246
Miss Un.

53
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:21,506
I prepared a room for Miss Gade.

54
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:24,486
Should I bring her to the room?

55
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,206
I get my own room?

56
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:27,726
Am I sleeping alone tonight?

57
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:30,166
You're staying in the guest room.

58
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,606
Nok, please take Gade to her room.

59
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:34,486
- Yes.  - No!

60
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:38,246
If you want me to sleep alone, I'd rather get a hotel.

61
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:42,886
You should sleep in your own room. Gade can stay with you.

62
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:45,966
Right. Don't make it awkward.

63
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,846
I'm here for the first time. It'll be awkward if I sleep alone.

64
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:54,086
Okay.

65
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,246
Did everyone already go to bed?

66
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,086
Everyone is in their own room.

67
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:06,246
They went to bed early. No one had dinner.

68
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,726
I'd like a cup of coffee, please.

69
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:13,967
Alright.

70
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,886
May I get one too?

71
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,006
Please bring the coffee to my room, Nok.

72
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,566
Are you sure you're okay?

73
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:51,046
I'm really not.

74
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:56,126
I didn't think he'd be like other guys.

75
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:15,606
Well, you said he was nice earlier.

76
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:18,046
He was nice at everything.

77
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:21,406
The only problem is Phim.

78
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:26,126
The only one,

79
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:29,126
but it's a huge deal.

80
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,246
Un.

81
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:46,046
Tony still calls me every week.

82
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:51,366
You still won't give him your number?

83
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:59,286
I know you've had a long day,

84
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:04,066
but you should make it clear to Tony.

85
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,836
You let him keep calling me,

86
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,206
and you won't give him your number.

87
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,486
I had made it clear.

88
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:16,846
It's obvious I don't want to keep in touch or talk to him.

89
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:19,646
If I want to talk to him, I'll call him myself.

90
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,046
That's why I don't give him my number.

91
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:24,686
I gave him your number just for emergencies.

92
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:29,566
He should only call you about work or anything urgent.

93
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:34,806
Tony is such a small problem compared to everything else right now.

94
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:36,125
I understand.

95
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:38,806
If you do, don't talk about Tony right now.

96
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
(We do)

97
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:58,606
(know how much we are in love.)

98
00:10:58,814 --> 00:11:02,486
(Yet deep inside, we're still insecure)

99
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:07,926
(if the two of us will make it to the end.)

100
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:10,606
(Sometimes,)

101
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:14,886
(I ask myself whether I overthink.)

102
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,726
(You're better than many other guys.)

103
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,886
(Why am I afraid?)

104
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:24,526
(Or do I just want more?)

105
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:28,721
(If all I have is love, would that be enough?)

106
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:33,126
(I don't know what it will take.)

107
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:37,206
(My heart feels frustrated.)

108
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,846
(I'm afraid I'd be left with no one.)

109
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,095
(I know I love you with all my heart.)

110
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:50,846
(I don't know if that will be enough for you. If someday...)

111
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:56,646
Guys.

112
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:59,806
I heard Mrs. Phim is having an affair.

113
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:02,310
Who is the man? That's huge.

114
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:07,766
I have something to tell you. I know someone who has a friend

115
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,086
working at Mrs. Phim's resort.

116
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,966
The other night, Mrs. Phim brought a guy there.

117
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,286
Oh!

118
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:16,846
- Who is it?  - I wonder.

119
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,006
I don't know who he is, either.

120
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:20,606
Mr. Chairman, do you need my help with anything?

121
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:22,502
Prang, your assistant, is not here yet.

122
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:26,766
No.

123
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:29,926
You can do what you want.

124
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:39,966
Why is he so early today?

125
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:49,724
Rit.

126
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,406
Mr. Chairman is already here.

127
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:53,046
I don't know why he came so early.

128
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:28,886
"Grandfather asked to see me at the office today.

129
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,486
I left early.

130
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:32,286
I didn't want to wake you.

131
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:34,806
Call me if you need anything."

132
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,166
Dear me!

133
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:40,517
They're staying in the same house,

134
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:42,406
but they're talking at the office.

135
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:45,446
How can I not be awkward?

136
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:48,846
I need to go downstairs to have breakfast.

137
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:57,206
Whoa! It's nearly breakfast time.

138
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,893
Is she late the first day she came back?

139
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,686
Rit, go straight to the office after breakfast. Grandfather might need you.

140
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,286
Yes, Mom.

141
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:33,646
They might as well line up to welcome us! Who can eat like this?

142
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:46,846
Do we still need to wait for someone?

143
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:50,646
Who are you waiting for?

144
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,566
Is Un not coming down yet?

145
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:56,606
Oh! Un said she's meeting her grandfather at the office.

146
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:58,566
She left early this morning.

147
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:01,446
Do you know what it's about?

148
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,526
Gade, do you want to eat with me in the kitchen?

149
00:16:06,702 --> 00:16:08,166
It's awkward in here.

150
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,766
Excuse me, then.

151
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:21,166
Father probably needs Un's help personally.

152
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:24,206
That's why he called her in early in the morning.

153
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:33,486
Rit, you said your grandfather left early.

154
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:35,126
Un is with him. That means

155
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,606
they're talking about something important.

156
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:42,246
Get up.

157
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,486
We're not eating now. Get up!

158
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:49,926
Head to the office right now.

159
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:52,446
I don't know what your grandfather is talking to Un about.

160
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:53,926
Noot is not here anymore.

161
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,096
You'll be the only heir of Jangwangprawas.

162
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:58,246
Go!

163
00:16:58,486 --> 00:16:59,686
Yes.

164
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:08,726
I don't want to talk about this at home.

165
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,406
What are you and Kuer doing next?

166
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,126
I think that's private between us.

167
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:21,166
I shouldn't have to report my decision to anyone.

168
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:23,566
It's better if you two break up.

169
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,606
Do you remember the guy we met together the other day?

170
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:31,366
I do.

171
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:33,286
I'm hiring him to protect you.

172
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:36,006
Are you hiring him to tail me?

173
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:40,046
You used to date Kuer. Even if you broke up, I'm still worried.

174
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:43,726
Come in.

175
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:54,846
Can I say no?

176
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:56,166
You can't.

177
00:18:13,286 --> 00:18:15,126
I know it's Mr. Chairman's order.

178
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:16,766
You can't refuse it.

179
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:19,566
But you don't really need to follow me every step like this.

180
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:21,446
Okay.

181
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,926
I'm heading outside.

182
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:29,526
You can wait here, Kan.

183
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:31,726
Please go to the front of the building.

184
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:33,526
I prepared a car for you.

185
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:35,366
Thanks.

186
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:44,326
I said you could wait here.

187
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:45,686
I heard that,

188
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,806
but it's my duty to go with you.

189
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:51,286
Mr. Chairman insisted.

190
00:18:51,654 --> 00:18:54,046
I'm just following orders.

191
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:56,486
If you want to change anything,

192
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:59,046
you should talk to Mr. Chairman, Miss Un.

193
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,326
Grandfather is not even here,

194
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:11,726
but I already feel chills down my spine.

195
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,206
I can see that.

196
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,406
How is Un doing?

197
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:22,966
- About...  - Mr. Kuer?

198
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:27,006
She's still coping with it.

199
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:28,926
She's staying strong.

200
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:35,486
Why don't you try talking to her?

201
00:19:35,694 --> 00:19:37,446
She'll probably tell you something.

202
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:40,206
She doesn't tell me anything.

203
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:06,966
I'll call you when I'm done here.

204
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,046
How did it escalate that much, Kuer?

205
00:20:18,286 --> 00:20:22,046
Un's probably meeting Grandmother today to talk about this.

206
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:26,166
I guess so.

207
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:29,446
Un is not the type to leave things unsaid.

208
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,246
I'll try talking to her.

209
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:36,766
We just talked about getting married.

210
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:56,726
Good morning.

211
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:11,686
Kob and Kuer, you guys wait outside.

212
00:21:18,022 --> 00:21:19,166
Let's go.

213
00:21:42,253 --> 00:21:43,886
What did Un say, Grandmother?

214
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:46,246
It's as you thought.

215
00:21:47,093 --> 00:21:48,686
Did she really ask to resign?

216
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,126
I'm sorry for causing problems at work, Grandmother.

217
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:58,006
We were about to close the deal with JP.

218
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:02,166
We can deal with that later. We need to deal with our problem first.

219
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:06,326
I'm heading back to Bangkok. Are you coming with me?

220
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:10,606
If the police need anything, we'll fly back here.

221
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:16,606
San said I was a possible suspect.

222
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:18,446
He doesn't want me out of his jurisdiction.

223
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,733
That's nothing.

224
00:22:19,886 --> 00:22:22,446
Just tell them nicely. The police will understand.

225
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:25,846
You're not a flight risk. You're just going back to work in Bangkok.

226
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:30,646
That's right. I don't want you here alone. It's dangerous.

227
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:34,166
Chanoot is dead, and you're a suspect.

228
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:37,806
I don't trust JP's chairman at all.

229
00:22:38,486 --> 00:22:40,206
He'll do something about it.

230
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:48,966
You don't want to go back because of Un, right?

231
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:54,326
That's right.

232
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,846
You should give up.

233
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:59,926
Perhaps, she's not your soulmate.

234
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,926
My flight is tomorrow. Let me know if you change your mind.

235
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:17,126
From what Grandmother said,

236
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:20,126
I think Un has made it clear to her.

237
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:27,646
You should think carefully. Maybe,

238
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:30,606
it's easier to give up.

239
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,566
I understand you.

240
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:47,006
If you really like her,

241
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:49,406
don't stop trying.

242
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:54,406
Try talking to her before she leaves this hotel.

243
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,446
Okay. I'm going.

244
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:15,886
- Yes, Miss.  - I called you a while ago. Why are you not here yet?

245
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:18,286
A car is blocking me.

246
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:22,486
I'll be waiting in the lobby. Call me when you can get out.

247
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:33,726
Can I have five minutes, please?

248
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:37,806
Un.

249
00:24:38,006 --> 00:24:39,286
Un.

250
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:46,406
I don't know how you get that idea about me.

251
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:48,286
- But...  - Un!

252
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:50,286
Un!

253
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,606
I miss you so much.

254
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,886
Tony? Why are you here?

255
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,566
Do you know him?

256
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:06,926
I'm sorry.

257
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,046
I got too excited to see Un.

258
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:12,606
You guys can talk.

259
00:25:13,006 --> 00:25:14,326
I'll wait.

260
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:16,046
It's okay, Tony.

261
00:25:16,653 --> 00:25:17,966
We've just done talking.

262
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:21,446
Excuse me.

263
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,886
Un. Un!

264
00:25:30,525 --> 00:25:33,366
What are you doing in Phuket?

265
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:37,086
Gade didn't tell you I was coming?

266
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,966
She didn't.

267
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:41,646
I couldn't reach you.

268
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,126
You only gave me Gade's number.

269
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:47,206
Gade only told me that you're moving to Phuket to work.

270
00:25:47,406 --> 00:25:49,566
Gade said she had a flight to Phuket the other day.

271
00:25:49,806 --> 00:25:51,406
I decided to follow.

272
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:54,046
What about your work?

273
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:55,886
I took a few days off.

274
00:25:56,246 --> 00:25:59,046
Does Gade know you're already here?

275
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:00,326
She doesn't.

276
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,366
I only told her I'd come to Phuket.

277
00:26:02,486 --> 00:26:07,886
At first, I'd ask Gade to bring me to you. I guess I don't need her now.

278
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:09,926
I'm lucky to have run into you.

279
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:12,406
Excuse me.

280
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:16,086
Are you here?

281
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:18,846
Okay. I'm on my way.

282
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:21,966
Are you leaving?

283
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,166
My driver is waiting.

284
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:32,166
I miss you, Un.

285
00:26:37,343 --> 00:26:38,886
Can I please have your number?

286
00:26:39,317 --> 00:26:42,286
I'll call you after I check in. Let's have dinner.

287
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:46,606
Okay.

288
00:26:50,286 --> 00:26:51,446
Here.

289
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:53,966
I have to go now.

290
00:26:54,086 --> 00:26:56,006
Okay. See you tonight.

291
00:26:59,806 --> 00:27:02,446
Mr. Tony, you're checked in, sir. Please sign here.

292
00:27:02,606 --> 00:27:03,766
Okay.

293
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:08,886
Is he the reason you're breaking up with me?

294
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:12,646
Phim was just an excuse, wasn't she?

295
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:19,254
Phim wasn't just an excuse. She was the reason I broke up with you.

296
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:42,426
This is a big deal. You can't expect them to let you in the house.

297
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:44,606
Expect what?

298
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:46,566
I didn't do anything wrong.

299
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:53,126
What's with that look?

300
00:27:59,806 --> 00:28:01,406
As your best friend,

301
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,366
can you tell me honestly?

302
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:05,646
What are you talking about?

303
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:07,926
That night when you were coming to the resort,

304
00:28:08,677 --> 00:28:11,086
why did you ask Man to head out and buy things?

305
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:15,701
If Man weren't

306
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:20,286
at the harbor, no one would see you and Kuer,

307
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:22,086
what you were doing,

308
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:24,726
and with whom.

309
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:29,126
Do you think Kuer and I murdered Noot?

310
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:30,966
It's possible.

311
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:37,646
Did you tell the police

312
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:40,006
that I asked Man to go buy things?

313
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:41,446
I didn't.

314
00:28:43,158 --> 00:28:44,621
But did you do it?

315
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:46,598
I didn't do it.

316
00:28:49,343 --> 00:28:52,086
I just wanted to win.

317
00:28:53,294 --> 00:28:56,686
I wanted Kuer to come to the resort with me. But if Man was there,

318
00:28:56,886 --> 00:28:58,886
and if we had a driver,

319
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:02,166
he would never have come with me.

320
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:07,286
That's why I told you to get Man away.

321
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:09,566
That's all?

322
00:29:10,764 --> 00:29:12,086
Yes.

323
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:16,446
He didn't even want to give me a ride to the harbor.

324
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,806
He was afraid Un would be angry.

325
00:29:19,837 --> 00:29:21,446
I was jealous.

326
00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:25,406
That's why I made him come to the island with me.

327
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:32,446
And you were lucky the storm hit. He couldn't go back.

328
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:34,686
Lucky or unfortunate?

329
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:38,366
I'm society's scapegoat now.

330
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:43,206
It was unfortunate.

331
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:45,126
If you want to get with Kuer,

332
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:48,926
this might be a blessing in disguise.

333
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,086
Mr. Chairman didn't see anyone since the morning except Un?

334
00:29:56,204 --> 00:29:57,267
That's right.

335
00:29:57,374 --> 00:30:00,926
After Miss Un arrived in the morning, he didn't let anyone in the office.

336
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:07,086
Even his assistant couldn't serve him coffee.

337
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:13,926
Rit, why don't you try going in?

338
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:26,366
Come in.

339
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:32,566
Your coffee, Grandfather.

340
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:35,086
Thanks.

341
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:41,886
Do you need my help with anything?

342
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:45,966
Did Noot leave behind any work that I can do?

343
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:01,926
I've been thinking that I need to replace Noot at work.

344
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:04,486
Yes.

345
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:07,846
I still can't figure out who can take his place.

346
00:31:09,886 --> 00:31:12,126
Should I be doing his work in the meantime?

347
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:18,046
I'll think about it.

348
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:20,406
You already have a hard job.

349
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,333
I don't want to give you too much to do.

350
00:31:25,646 --> 00:31:28,166
If I need anything, I'll call you.

351
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:08,286
How is Mr. Chairman doing?

352
00:32:09,358 --> 00:32:12,606
His beloved grandson is dead. Of course, he's sad.

353
00:32:12,735 --> 00:32:14,926
Miss Un, good morning. Please come in.

354
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:23,126
After Mr. Noot died, Miss Un has been seeing Mr. Chairman often.

355
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:25,286
She used to work here for months,

356
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:27,326
and she saw him only once or twice.

357
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:34,246
Did you talk to them?

358
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:35,646
Yes.

359
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:38,326
I have resigned from C-Itsara.

360
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:45,406
Tell me about it.

361
00:32:47,686 --> 00:32:49,046
Sit down.

362
00:32:56,326 --> 00:32:58,526
I asked to see Mrs. Kamalas.

363
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:00,686
I asked to resign.

364
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:02,694
Why would you resign?

365
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:08,206
I don't think I can continue working with Kuer.

366
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:13,406
What if I reassign you as my personal adviser?

367
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:15,566
Will you change your mind?

368
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,766
Thank you

369
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:22,526
for caring about me.

370
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:25,926
I'm just not ready right now.

371
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,206
If you change your mind,

372
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,286
I'll always be waiting.

373
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,686
Are you sure you won't change your mind?

374
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,726
If I offer you to replace Noot as the Vice President,

375
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:00,606
will you accept?

376
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:08,006
Are you hesitating?

377
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:12,126
You're becoming JP's Vice President and President-to-be,

378
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:14,406
yet you're hesitating?

379
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:20,765
I need time to think about it.

380
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:22,846
What do you need to think about?

381
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:28,726
This is the best offer you have received in your life, Un.

382
00:34:29,726 --> 00:34:32,806
I didn't want a position in JP in the first place.

383
00:34:33,526 --> 00:34:36,686
I admit it's attractive to many people,

384
00:34:36,926 --> 00:34:41,166
but working with someone who doesn't listen like you, is like getting hung.

385
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,006
No matter how big my position is,

386
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:47,566
working without showing what I can do is still nothing.

387
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,406
If I were to really work here,

388
00:34:51,766 --> 00:34:53,806
I want to have a say in the company's decision.

389
00:35:04,629 --> 00:35:05,886
Fine.

390
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:10,726
I'll give you three days to decide.

391
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:15,006
Good opportunities don't come every day.

392
00:35:17,606 --> 00:35:19,726
Don't you want to avenge Noot?

393
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,166
Noot died because of those two.

394
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:29,406
The police won't believe what we believe.

395
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:32,326
We need to deal with both of them.

396
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:34,886
We can't let Noot die in vain.

397
00:36:41,606 --> 00:36:42,846
Yes?

398
00:36:43,149 --> 00:36:46,206
Un, where should I pick you up tonight?

399
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,886
I'm attending Noot's funeral tonight.

400
00:36:50,637 --> 00:36:53,326
That's right. I just saw the news.

401
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:55,326
I'm sorry for your loss.

402
00:36:56,454 --> 00:36:57,508
Thank you.

403
00:36:57,589 --> 00:37:00,417
I'll see you at the funeral, then.

404
00:37:00,606 --> 00:37:02,726
Okay. See you there.

405
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:12,766
Do you miss Noot?

406
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:20,006
We were just talking about serious stuff,

407
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:24,206
and he died just like that. It's too convenient.

408
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,926
What did Noot tell you?

409
00:37:30,446 --> 00:37:31,686
He told me

410
00:37:33,446 --> 00:37:34,886
about him and Phim.

411
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,726
Noot probably couldn't take it anymore if it's about Phim.

412
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:44,046
Do you believe what the police say?

413
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:46,286
What do you believe, then?

414
00:37:46,596 --> 00:37:48,686
I don't believe Noot committed suicide.

415
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:55,566
Why?

416
00:37:57,246 --> 00:37:58,926
From what he said,

417
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,326
Noot was not suicidal at all.

418
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:07,806
Then who do you think killed him?

419
00:38:11,886 --> 00:38:13,166
I don't know.

420
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:18,166
What did Grandfather say?

421
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:21,286
He offered me a job here.

422
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,326
What did you say? Did you accept it?

423
00:38:42,717 --> 00:38:45,126
If you conclude that Mr. Chanoot committed suicide,

424
00:38:45,246 --> 00:38:47,606
Kuer will become a scapegoat to the public.

425
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:50,486
He's lucky if that's all he becomes.

426
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:52,966
I'm afraid he'd become a defendant.

427
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:54,326
Why?

428
00:38:54,837 --> 00:38:56,563
Do you remember the video

429
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:59,326
that you took of Phim and Noot arguing?

430
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:05,406
- The video I sent you when someone tried to kill Kuer?  - Yeah!

431
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:06,691
That's the video.

432
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:09,486
- It's now evidence proving that Kuer is a homewrecker.  - What?

433
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:13,886
- That video proves a motivation for Kuer to kill Noot.  - What?

434
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,526
Stop saying what to me!

435
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,126
- Sorry. Go on.  - Yeah!

436
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:24,486
When Kuer was with Phim at the harbor,

437
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,926
nobody saw anything. We have no witnesses.

438
00:39:27,046 --> 00:39:29,566
The boat driver went out to buy things.

439
00:39:29,774 --> 00:39:32,126
The period when Kuer and Phim

440
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,726
were at the harbor

441
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:38,766
was right about the time Noot told the boat driver to get a boat for him.

442
00:39:42,122 --> 00:39:46,646
You know Kuer can't kill anyone, don't you?

443
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:49,726
I know, but what about others?

444
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:52,781
What should we do now?

445
00:39:52,894 --> 00:39:55,686
He's still lucky, though. We have no evidence

446
00:39:55,813 --> 00:39:58,286
proving Kuer was on Noot's boat, so we can't arrest him.

447
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:00,806
He's still a suspect, though.

448
00:40:01,344 --> 00:40:05,086
If we find any evidence, he'd surely get arrested.

449
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:06,966
What the heck?

450
00:40:07,134 --> 00:40:10,446
He killed himself just because his wife had an affair?

451
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:13,486
Hold on, lady!

452
00:40:13,765 --> 00:40:15,126
He was alone on that boat.

453
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:18,086
There's no evidence proving someone else was there.

454
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,926
He died like that.

455
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,766
Who could have killed him then?

456
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:28,686
Have you ever watched "Detective Conan"?

457
00:40:30,286 --> 00:40:32,526
A murder in a closed room.

458
00:40:32,686 --> 00:40:33,966
Seriously?

459
00:40:34,326 --> 00:40:35,526
I have.

460
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:37,206
That's it.

461
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:41,726
I don't think it was a suicide, either.

462
00:40:42,477 --> 00:40:44,766
There are so many theories.

463
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:47,326
We just don't have evidence.

464
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:49,806
This is why the investigators reached this conclusion.

465
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:52,966
What about the witnesses? What did they say?

466
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:58,086
- Are you a cop?  - No.

467
00:41:05,126 --> 00:41:06,486
Why are you not telling me?

468
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:11,446
You're not a cop. You don't have to know everything.

469
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:14,526
Some things are classified, understand?

470
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:17,366
Are you hiding a secret from me?

471
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:20,966
No! You're just not a cop.

472
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:24,606
Enough! Don't ask...

473
00:41:27,182 --> 00:41:29,726
San, what prank are you pulling now?

474
00:41:31,715 --> 00:41:34,046
San? San!

475
00:41:34,262 --> 00:41:35,846
- Are you joking?  - No...

476
00:41:36,656 --> 00:41:38,766
I can't breathe...

477
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:41,526
- What's wrong, San?  - I can't breathe...

478
00:41:43,078 --> 00:41:44,846
San? San! Where does it hurt?

479
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:46,686
It's a heart attack.

480
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,046
Heart attack? What should I do?

481
00:41:54,127 --> 00:41:56,406
Check his heart?

482
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,366
- It's still beating.  - I can't breathe.

483
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,846
You can't breathe?

484
00:42:07,846 --> 00:42:11,406
Hey! Stay with me! Don't die! What should I do?

485
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,766
Fine! I'll do it!

486
00:42:23,906 --> 00:42:25,566
Are you okay now?

487
00:42:27,126 --> 00:42:29,286
Are you feeling better?

488
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:32,406
It's okay. You're okay.

489
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:34,126
It's my heart. It's

490
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:38,806
only for you. You're the only one in there.

491
00:42:39,445 --> 00:42:41,886
Stop! We should get to the funeral.

492
00:42:43,782 --> 00:42:46,926
It's your funeral, then! Go already!

493
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:49,188
- San!  - Hey!

494
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,606
What?

495
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,926
Give that to me.

496
00:42:56,695 --> 00:42:59,726
You don't deserve just to hold my hand.

497
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:02,566
I'll drag you by the neck!

498
00:43:02,909 --> 00:43:06,406
She's mean because she loves me. I'm a masochist.

499
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,686
Should I really do that?

500
00:43:14,486 --> 00:43:15,806
Of course.

501
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:19,366
The whole town will be talking about you anyway.

502
00:43:19,574 --> 00:43:21,366
At least make the conversations useful.

503
00:43:29,886 --> 00:43:31,326
Are you going to the funeral?

504
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:32,686
Yes.

505
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:34,326
Are you not going?

506
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,766
I don't think I will.

507
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:39,006
Because of the rumors?

508
00:43:42,526 --> 00:43:46,766
If you don't go, people will think you're afraid to show your face.

509
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:51,086
They will probably think the rumors are true.

510
00:43:52,606 --> 00:43:56,086
At least, if you go, you have a chance to correct the news.

511
00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:01,446
You go with Si.

512
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:03,326
I'll be there later.

513
00:44:14,806 --> 00:44:17,886
(Everyone, this is the first night of Mr. Chanoot Jangwangprawas' funeral.)

514
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,846
(He was an heir to the JP corporation.)

515
00:44:20,005 --> 00:44:25,206
(He was found dead yesterday morning. There is no progress on the case.)

516
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:29,054
(The Jangwangprawas family has yet to comment on anything.)

517
00:44:35,183 --> 00:44:36,406
(Nam)

518
00:44:36,736 --> 00:44:37,806
(Nam)

519
00:45:35,726 --> 00:45:36,886
Grandfather.

520
00:45:47,046 --> 00:45:48,446
I'm here to oversee the preparation

521
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,646
before guests arrive.

522
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,166
Okay.

523
00:45:54,726 --> 00:45:56,366
The flower girl just left.

524
00:45:57,093 --> 00:45:58,286
Thank you so much

525
00:45:58,486 --> 00:46:00,646
for arranging Noot's funeral.

526
00:46:04,206 --> 00:46:07,886
It's a shame I won't see Noot as JP's president.

527
00:46:11,446 --> 00:46:13,046
He would have made a good president.

528
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,966
There's only one thing he chose wrong.

529
00:46:20,973 --> 00:46:22,406
He chose the wrong wife.

530
00:46:25,206 --> 00:46:26,646
Why are the guests here so early?

531
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,846
What are you doing here?

532
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:38,797
This is my grandson's funeral!

533
00:46:39,645 --> 00:46:43,206
Noot was my husband. Why can't I attend his funeral?

534
00:46:43,398 --> 00:46:45,686
You can still call Noot your husband?

535
00:46:46,013 --> 00:46:47,646
You left him for Kuer!

536
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,526
Get out!

537
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:56,086
Get her out of here!

538
00:46:57,406 --> 00:46:58,806
This way, please.

539
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,486
Why are you back already?

540
00:47:20,886 --> 00:47:22,406
You can leave me here.

541
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,566
Grandfather won't let me in.

542
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:29,566
You can't attend his funeral?

543
00:47:30,046 --> 00:47:31,326
What's going on, Phim?

544
00:47:31,862 --> 00:47:33,862
Mr. Chairman won't let Phim in.

545
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:38,166
Let's go back.

546
00:47:38,646 --> 00:47:41,806
You shouldn't go in. They'll kick you out anyway.

547
00:48:01,366 --> 00:48:02,366
Rit!

548
00:48:02,862 --> 00:48:04,862
How did it go? Did you see him?

549
00:48:05,237 --> 00:48:06,446
I did.

550
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:09,006
Why do you look tense, then?

551
00:48:09,126 --> 00:48:12,566
This should be a celebration for you.

552
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:17,126
Who told you that? Grandfather offered Un a job today.

553
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,229
He offered her a job?

554
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:23,646
For what position?

555
00:48:23,806 --> 00:48:25,086
I don't know.

556
00:48:27,526 --> 00:48:28,766
Don't tell me

557
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:32,046
she's going to be the Vice President.

558
00:48:33,086 --> 00:48:34,366
What's wrong?

559
00:48:35,606 --> 00:48:38,366
Why can't Un be the Vice President?

560
00:48:40,197 --> 00:48:41,766
You know it yourself.

561
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,390
The one who deserves to be Vice President

562
00:48:44,597 --> 00:48:47,566
is the future President of JP.

563
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:52,046
Father will never let a woman fill that position.

564
00:48:54,678 --> 00:48:56,286
The world has changed.

565
00:48:56,861 --> 00:48:58,861
Men and women are equal now.

566
00:48:59,406 --> 00:49:01,886
I think Father can change.

567
00:49:04,013 --> 00:49:06,686
Someone who betrayed Jangwangprawas like Un

568
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,486
is never a good choice.

569
00:49:11,886 --> 00:49:13,726
- We should go. We're going to be late.  - Let's go.

570
00:49:14,726 --> 00:49:16,446
Everything is up to Father.

571
00:49:18,006 --> 00:49:19,406
It's his choice.

572
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:36,326
Whoa! Am I in a drama show?

573
00:49:39,886 --> 00:49:41,646
I'm writing a soap opera,

574
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:44,446
but it's nowhere near as good as this family's drama.

575
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:50,726
I'm deleting it.

576
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,166
I should write down what I saw just now.

577
00:50:05,307 --> 00:50:07,966
You went out for coffee, but you were busy spying on others.

578
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,646
You forgot your coffee, Gade.

579
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:14,766
Are you still okay?

580
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,206
Tony?

581
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,686
What now?

582
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:29,126
Does your family own a cell phone service?

583
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:30,566
You keep calling me every day.

584
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:33,806
I'm at the temple. Is Un here yet?

585
00:50:36,246 --> 00:50:39,126
She gave you her number. Just call her yourself!

586
00:50:39,374 --> 00:50:42,111
(Un and I are not Siamese twins.)

587
00:50:42,196 --> 00:50:45,566
We're Un and Gade, not Eng and Chang, you know?

588
00:50:46,022 --> 00:50:49,366
Are you out of your mind? Did you call me to ask if Un is at the temple?

589
00:50:51,806 --> 00:50:53,566
I'm too afraid to call her.

590
00:50:58,729 --> 00:51:00,166
I'm sorry.

591
00:51:00,566 --> 00:51:01,966
I was a bit heated.

592
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:04,606
Un left for work early this morning.

593
00:51:04,806 --> 00:51:06,326
Tonight is the first night of the funeral.

594
00:51:06,526 --> 00:51:07,926
I think she'll be there early.

595
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:10,846
And are you not attending?

596
00:51:11,494 --> 00:51:12,886
I don't have a black dress.

597
00:51:13,046 --> 00:51:14,246
Oh.

598
00:51:14,547 --> 00:51:17,286
Would you like to go shopping with me tomorrow?

599
00:51:18,101 --> 00:51:20,926
It's fine. I think I'm going with Un.

600
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:25,406
If you need help, you can tell me.

601
00:51:25,901 --> 00:51:27,726
You've helped me a lot.

602
00:51:29,126 --> 00:51:30,686
Okay.

603
00:51:31,149 --> 00:51:33,886
But right now, you need to take care of yourself.

604
00:51:34,406 --> 00:51:35,646
Okay.

605
00:51:36,129 --> 00:51:40,406
By the way, if I go shopping tomorrow, I'll let you know.

606
00:51:40,726 --> 00:51:42,406
You can come to see Un.

607
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,366
Thank you so much. If we meet tomorrow, I'll treat you to a meal.

608
00:51:46,653 --> 00:51:49,366
I'm going with Un. You're treating her anyway.

609
00:51:50,405 --> 00:51:52,766
I have to go now. I have work to do.

610
00:51:53,006 --> 00:51:54,246
Okay.

611
00:52:06,246 --> 00:52:07,566
Mr. Kuer is here.

612
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:11,926
I just kicked Phim out, and Kuer comes here?

613
00:52:12,925 --> 00:52:14,925
Those two just have no shame.

614
00:52:15,051 --> 00:52:17,086
How dare they show up here?

615
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:18,926
Grandfather.

616
00:52:19,086 --> 00:52:20,366
I'll deal with him myself.

617
00:52:31,326 --> 00:52:32,446
Un.

618
00:52:33,454 --> 00:52:35,454
I'm asking you both. Please

619
00:52:35,926 --> 00:52:37,486
don't come to Noot's funeral again.

620
00:52:39,534 --> 00:52:41,126
Our family doesn't welcome you

621
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:44,006
and doesn't want your condolences.

622
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:48,526
If you truly loved him, there would have been no funeral today.

623
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:51,686
You're practically an outsider. What do you know?

624
00:52:53,422 --> 00:52:54,631
I know.

625
00:52:55,702 --> 00:52:58,766
I know you and Kuer have been having an affair behind my brother's back.

626
00:53:02,957 --> 00:53:04,406
Behind my back.

627
00:53:07,846 --> 00:53:10,446
Phim and I were never more than friends, Un.

628
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:15,766
At this point,

629
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,030
what you say doesn't even matter.

630
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:20,006
Please go back.

631
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:22,766
Be happy together. Live your lives together.

632
00:53:23,046 --> 00:53:25,166
You can even get married. No one will stop you.

633
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:30,646
The two of you will be murderers for the rest of your lives.

634
00:53:32,526 --> 00:53:34,246
I don't believe Noot committed suicide.

635
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:38,206
I think someone's involved somehow.

636
00:53:40,046 --> 00:53:41,726
If you ask me right now,

637
00:53:43,252 --> 00:53:45,686
both of you are suspects.

638
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:50,246
Nobody would want Noot dead except for his wife and her lover.

639
00:53:54,126 --> 00:53:55,726
I'll find evidence

640
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:58,606
to prove to you I have nothing to do with this.

641
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:00,286
Un.

642
00:54:04,206 --> 00:54:06,566
I was afraid I wouldn't find a parking spot if I arrived late.

643
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:17,846
You have a new guy. That's why you want to get rid of Kuer.

644
00:54:20,117 --> 00:54:21,846
That's none of your business.

645
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,726
I break up, and I date.

646
00:54:26,405 --> 00:54:28,405
At least I don't date two people at once.

647
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,750
I don't fool around as you do.

648
00:54:32,693 --> 00:54:35,326
By the way, Phim and Kuer used to date before.

649
00:54:36,317 --> 00:54:38,317
They're old friends.

650
00:54:38,502 --> 00:54:42,406
It's normal for them to be closer than just acquaintances.

651
00:54:43,886 --> 00:54:45,326
Can you answer this for me, then?

652
00:54:46,173 --> 00:54:49,526
Why were you two together on the island the night Noot died at the harbor?

653
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:56,246
If you guys don't know anything, who else could have done it then?

654
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,686
Sita, you're a suspect too.

655
00:55:01,323 --> 00:55:03,019
If I have evidence

656
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:08,926
or any witness statement that you lied to help Phim,

657
00:55:10,749 --> 00:55:13,046
I will hand you a termination letter myself.

658
00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:23,206
Let's go back, Si.

659
00:55:34,011 --> 00:55:36,062
- Un.  - Let's get inside.

660
00:55:50,566 --> 00:55:52,326
That man was your boyfriend, wasn't he?

661
00:55:54,028 --> 00:55:55,726
Did you break up because of that woman?

662
00:55:57,966 --> 00:55:58,966
Un.

663
00:56:01,286 --> 00:56:02,446
Are you okay?

664
00:56:15,382 --> 00:56:17,126
If I have a chance as he did,

665
00:56:19,366 --> 00:56:21,806
you will never regret it.

666
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:39,126
Phim.

667
00:56:41,046 --> 00:56:43,486
You said Un had nothing to do with the company.

668
00:56:43,678 --> 00:56:46,126
How could she threaten to fire me?

669
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,406
She's using this chance to approach Grandfather.

670
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:54,846
She's sucking up to him because she wants a job.

671
00:56:55,014 --> 00:56:57,526
She wants to get back in House Jangwangprawas.

672
00:56:59,686 --> 00:57:01,486
Should I be worried, then?

673
00:57:02,438 --> 00:57:03,806
If she's back,

674
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:05,886
she'll surely shake up the resort management.

675
00:57:06,566 --> 00:57:08,726
I'll probably get fired.

676
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:10,310
Don't overthink for now.

677
00:57:12,077 --> 00:57:13,526
If you help me,

678
00:57:13,941 --> 00:57:15,941
I'll help you no matter what.

679
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,846
(Mek)

680
00:58:18,806 --> 00:58:20,326
(Mek)

681
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:26,726
Rit, I need to take this call.

682
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:44,806
Why do you keep calling me?

683
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,446
I'm busy today.

684
00:58:46,573 --> 00:58:48,926
I told you I need to help my boss at the funeral.

685
00:58:49,133 --> 00:58:50,766
Someone died, Nam.

686
00:58:52,149 --> 00:58:54,866
I know. We have nothing to do with this.

687
00:58:55,491 --> 00:58:57,886
Are you sure we have nothing to do with this?

688
00:58:58,414 --> 00:59:01,046
We don't. We don't have anything to do with it at all.

689
00:59:02,766 --> 00:59:04,286
The boat you asked me to pick up

690
00:59:04,486 --> 00:59:05,966
wasn't broken, was it?

691
00:59:07,286 --> 00:59:08,686
Don't ask too much.

692
00:59:09,014 --> 00:59:10,326
It's better if you don't know.

693
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,126
You'll be in danger if you know too much.

694
00:59:14,678 --> 00:59:16,006
I have to go now.

695
00:59:16,246 --> 00:59:17,646
Is anything wrong?

696
00:59:19,846 --> 00:59:21,126
It's nothing.

697
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:23,806
Rit, why are you out here?

698
00:59:24,502 --> 00:59:25,766
It's awkward inside.

699
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,726
My mom keeps convincing me

700
00:59:27,822 --> 00:59:30,006
that the vacant position should be mine.

701
00:59:30,973 --> 00:59:32,973
But it should be yours.

702
00:59:33,534 --> 00:59:35,726
I have a feeling that I won't get it.

703
00:59:35,926 --> 00:59:37,566
Your mom won't accept that.

704
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:39,686
You're the only grandson now.

705
00:59:39,878 --> 00:59:41,406
Who else can take that position?

706
00:59:43,806 --> 00:59:46,846
Let's head back inside before Mr. Chairman notices.

707
00:59:58,486 --> 01:00:01,126
Thank you so much.

708
01:00:06,459 --> 01:00:08,846
Who's that person at the back?

709
01:00:11,534 --> 01:00:13,006
The man or the woman?

710
01:00:14,197 --> 01:00:15,966
The man in the black suit.

711
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:23,686
He's a new driver.

712
01:00:23,973 --> 01:00:25,973
Mr. Chairman assigned him to Miss Un.

713
01:00:27,966 --> 01:00:30,206
Can you check his record for me?

714
01:00:30,806 --> 01:00:32,086
Check his record?

715
01:00:35,117 --> 01:00:37,117
We have to be careful of everyone who gets close.

716
01:00:37,294 --> 01:00:39,006
We don't know who to trust.

717
01:00:39,222 --> 01:00:41,886
Look at Phim. She betrayed Noot.

718
01:00:44,109 --> 01:00:46,646
Okay. I'll do it.

719
01:01:25,334 --> 01:01:26,846
What happened at the funeral?

720
01:01:27,326 --> 01:01:29,726
It's a funeral. It's sad.

721
01:01:29,966 --> 01:01:31,966
It's like a funeral in here too.

722
01:01:32,366 --> 01:01:33,846
It's sad.

723
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,317
Un was there with a man.

724
01:01:38,013 --> 01:01:40,013
Why didn't you ask us to come over?

725
01:01:40,494 --> 01:01:42,006
Why are you meeting us out here?

726
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:45,326
I don't want to see Phim.

727
01:01:45,573 --> 01:01:48,346
You can just tell her to move out.

728
01:01:48,756 --> 01:01:50,966
Why are you burdening yourself with her?

729
01:01:56,173 --> 01:01:58,173
I know you guys have questions.

730
01:01:59,038 --> 01:02:01,726
I can only tell you that I feel sorry for her.

731
01:02:02,711 --> 01:02:04,711
I don't think of her as more than a friend.

732
01:02:05,845 --> 01:02:07,726
What is it that you can't tell us?

733
01:02:07,926 --> 01:02:09,470
It can't get any worse.

734
01:02:09,597 --> 01:02:12,246
Noot is dead. You're accused as Phim's lover.

735
01:02:12,398 --> 01:02:15,046
Is this not bad enough for you to say something?

736
01:02:17,085 --> 01:02:18,606
I promised Phim.

737
01:02:18,973 --> 01:02:20,486
I don't want to break it.

738
01:02:20,662 --> 01:02:22,046
You don't want to break it,

739
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:24,206
but you're taking the blame?

740
01:02:31,893 --> 01:02:33,166
Aren't you hungry?

741
01:02:33,534 --> 01:02:35,006
- Yeah.  - Order something.

742
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:36,806
I'm fricking hungry.

743
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:41,526
I didn't eat at the funeral. It's bad luck for my birth year to eat there.

744
01:02:43,206 --> 01:02:44,846
Where are the waiters?

745
01:02:45,086 --> 01:02:46,606
Just order at the counter, then.

746
01:02:46,813 --> 01:02:48,086
It's easier.

747
01:02:48,502 --> 01:02:50,086
- Okay. I'll be back.  - Yeah.

748
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:58,326
Sa is really worried about you.

749
01:02:59,326 --> 01:03:00,366
I know.

750
01:03:00,757 --> 01:03:02,606
What she said made sense.

751
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:06,126
Why are you burdening yourself with this? I don't understand.

752
01:03:06,326 --> 01:03:08,486
Just because you promised her?

753
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:12,926
If it's not that important, just tell us.

754
01:03:13,726 --> 01:03:16,006
It might help your situation.

755
01:03:16,878 --> 01:03:19,566
Your project is ruined. You lost your girlfriend.

756
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,406
If any evidence shows up,

757
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:25,726
you might even lose your freedom.

758
01:03:27,318 --> 01:03:28,526
What do you mean?

759
01:03:28,646 --> 01:03:31,726
I mean, somebody is going to suspect what I suspect.

760
01:03:31,966 --> 01:03:35,406
You and Phim might be involved in Chanoot's death.

761
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:46,206
You have motivation because of that woman.

762
01:03:47,581 --> 01:03:49,581
When you guys were at the harbor,

763
01:03:49,766 --> 01:03:51,326
nobody was there.

764
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:53,566
The one person who works there

765
01:03:53,686 --> 01:03:57,886
was ordered to go out by Sita, Phim's best friend.

766
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,766
At the same time,

767
01:03:59,926 --> 01:04:01,806
Noot arrived at the harbor.

768
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:04,086
If the timeline matches,

769
01:04:04,286 --> 01:04:06,846
nobody else was at the harbor.

770
01:04:07,662 --> 01:04:09,366
Anything could have happened.

771
01:04:11,933 --> 01:04:13,726
It's also possible

772
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,966
that you attacked Noot

773
01:04:17,806 --> 01:04:19,206
and attempted to cover it up.

774
01:04:20,797 --> 01:04:23,686
You knew the boat would only end up ashore at the resort.

775
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:25,886
You and Phim were staying there.

776
01:04:27,213 --> 01:04:28,486
Who were the witnesses there?

777
01:04:29,764 --> 01:04:32,206
They're all Phim's resort employees.

778
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:33,566
Who reported it to the police?

779
01:04:34,382 --> 01:04:35,606
Sita did.

780
01:04:38,591 --> 01:04:40,591
Now that you hear this,

781
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,086
who's in trouble?

782
01:04:48,406 --> 01:04:50,126
I ordered a lot.

783
01:04:50,341 --> 01:04:53,446
Please help me eat. You can still eat more, right?

784
01:05:19,126 --> 01:05:21,486
Your driver is a good man.

785
01:05:21,878 --> 01:05:22,886
How so?

786
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:24,726
He follows you everywhere.

787
01:05:24,918 --> 01:05:26,438
I think he's afraid you'd get lost.

788
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,100
Probably.

789
01:05:29,207 --> 01:05:30,846
Is he waiting until we go home?

790
01:05:31,117 --> 01:05:33,926
Yes. He does a good job without being paid overtime.

791
01:05:35,445 --> 01:05:36,686
Please.

792
01:05:41,606 --> 01:05:44,246
- Eat a lot.  - The food here is good.

793
01:05:44,467 --> 01:05:46,566
- Good evening. How many seats?  - Two, please.

794
01:05:47,246 --> 01:05:49,486
- Please come in.  - I'm waiting for my friend.

795
01:05:51,006 --> 01:05:53,326
- Oh!  - Kuer.

796
01:05:59,006 --> 01:06:01,406
Good evening. This way, please.

797
01:06:22,495 --> 01:06:24,246
Let's eat!

798
01:06:26,326 --> 01:06:27,886
We can go home if you want.

799
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:29,433
I ate enough.

800
01:06:29,621 --> 01:06:30,901
It's okay.

801
01:06:31,845 --> 01:06:33,206
I'm fine.

802
01:06:34,295 --> 01:06:36,806
Why does Un have a new boyfriend so soon?

803
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:40,206
Was she always dating two persons at once?

804
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:43,966
Nonsense. Kuer wouldn't have run into that a second time.

805
01:06:46,742 --> 01:06:48,966
I saw that guy this morning at the hotel.

806
01:06:49,821 --> 01:06:52,166
I saw him again at the funeral in the afternoon.

807
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:55,406
I think she knows him from aboard.

808
01:06:55,765 --> 01:06:57,765
Did he follow her to Thailand?

809
01:06:58,726 --> 01:07:00,166
Where are they?

810
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,566
Eleven o'clock.

811
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:08,606
They seem close.

812
01:07:13,068 --> 01:07:15,686
I'm going to the bathroom.

813
01:07:20,326 --> 01:07:23,206
Don't stare. They will notice us.

814
01:07:28,846 --> 01:07:30,246
Why did you have to trigger him?

815
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:31,350
Trigger what?

816
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:35,886
"They seem close"? See? He's worked up. He's going. What now?

817
01:07:56,749 --> 01:07:57,966
Un.

818
01:07:58,878 --> 01:08:00,006
Un.

819
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:01,446
Can we talk, please?

820
01:08:01,637 --> 01:08:02,926
I have said all I needed to say.

821
01:08:03,197 --> 01:08:04,812
I have no more things to say to you.

822
01:08:04,967 --> 01:08:06,126
But I do.

823
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,646
Please stop following me.

824
01:08:10,573 --> 01:08:13,526
The more I see you, the more it hurts to be fooled by you.

825
01:08:13,645 --> 01:08:14,815
I didn't fool you, Un.

826
01:08:14,926 --> 01:08:16,286
I never did.

827
01:08:17,645 --> 01:08:18,926
Let me go.

828
01:08:19,118 --> 01:08:20,566
You think I killed Noot, don't you?

829
01:08:25,453 --> 01:08:27,606
I don't know what you did.

830
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:31,206
If you did kill him, I'd let the law deal with you.

831
01:08:33,006 --> 01:08:34,446
- I said let me go.  - Un, listen.

832
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:35,686
- Hey, Kuer!  - Un!

833
01:08:35,814 --> 01:08:38,326
The woman said to let her go. Don't you hear?

834
01:08:38,546 --> 01:08:40,846
You should give her some time.

835
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,637
It's only been a couple of days, and a guy is already following her around.

836
01:08:43,813 --> 01:08:45,966
If I give her more time, I'll have nothing left to explain.

837
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:47,843
If I still act like I fool around like this,

838
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:51,046
Un will never understand that I don't have any feelings for you.

839
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,286
Can you give me a chance?
