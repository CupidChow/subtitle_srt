1
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:47,806
An accounting guy noted some abnormalities in our annual reports.

2
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:49,566
Today, you'll help Noot

3
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,526
to review our past annual reports.

4
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:55,486
Before I go to Bangkok, I have somewhere I want to go with you.

5
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:57,286
I want to apologize

6
00:01:57,526 --> 00:01:59,086
for not coming here sooner.

7
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,046
I'm dating Un.

8
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:10,326
Phim is just my friend.

9
00:02:11,613 --> 00:02:13,613
Can I stay here?

10
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:17,926
You take the bedroom, Phim.

11
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:20,686
What about you?

12
00:02:21,277 --> 00:02:22,846
I'll take the couch.

13
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:25,006
It's not comfortable.

14
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:29,206
I don't mind you sharing the bed with me.

15
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,166
We used to do way more...

16
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,270
Phim.

17
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:34,446
It's over between us.

18
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:39,886
I don't want you to think we could ever be the same.

19
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,406
When you return, I want you to talk to Noot and figure it out.

20
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:48,846
As for your illness,

21
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:52,406
it's up to you when to tell your husband.

22
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:58,686
I know we will never be the same.

23
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:03,406
I know I was wrong that day.

24
00:03:04,246 --> 00:03:06,246
If I could turn back time,

25
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:07,966
I wouldn't have done it.

26
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:12,686
Kuer.

27
00:03:15,726 --> 00:03:19,126
I know I had chosen the wrong guy.

28
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:24,366
If I get a divorce,

29
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:27,126
will you get back together with me?

30
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:30,526
Please?

31
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:01,406
Where is everyone? Is there nobody home?

32
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:07,107
Mrs. Wan has been sick since afternoon, sir.

33
00:04:07,218 --> 00:04:09,806
Mr. Rit and Mr. Noot are not back yet.

34
00:04:09,944 --> 00:04:13,052
Mrs. Phim went out in the afternoon.

35
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,486
- And...  - Okay! Enough!

36
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:18,806
Where they all go has nothing to do with me.

37
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,526
- Set the table.  - Yes, sir.

38
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:35,446
Father, is Noot not back yet?

39
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:37,646
Sit down.

40
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:52,486
Noot seems very busy these days.

41
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:55,046
He's been coming home late every day.

42
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:06,166
Eat your meal.

43
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:08,302
Good evening.

44
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:16,486
Get another plate.

45
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:32,366
I want to talk to you as my granddaughter,

46
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:35,206
not as C-Itsara's adviser.

47
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:18,886
Father, are you full?

48
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:24,166
Or is there some unwanted person

49
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,486
who has killed your appetite?

50
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:30,326
What about you?

51
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,766
I'm full.

52
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,606
If you're full, just leave.

53
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:45,286
I want to talk to Un.

54
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:51,966
Yes, Father.

55
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:02,366
Clean up the plates.

56
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,326
Did you think carefully before joining C-Itsara?

57
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:20,086
I did.

58
00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:24,686
At least they saw my worth and made me their adviser.

59
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:29,126
They trusted me with an important project like this joint venture with JP.

60
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:34,406
If someone else asks you to join them

61
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:37,926
with an even better offer...

62
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:43,166
I'm not looking to change jobs now.

63
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,390
I don't like to betray people.

64
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:50,126
Unless something is forcing me to change.

65
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:53,046
Is it because you're grateful,

66
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:55,326
or is it because of Mr. Kuer?

67
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:58,366
It's neither.

68
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:01,846
I want to work in a company where I can express my thoughts

69
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:03,486
and show what I can do.

70
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:09,366
If I work for a company whose chairman is so full of himself,

71
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:11,726
it's no use.

72
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,446
My work won't mean a thing.

73
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:15,366
Are you talking about me?

74
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:18,406
Yes.

75
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:20,926
If I worked for JP today,

76
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:25,486
you wouldn't see my worth and wouldn't want to talk to me.

77
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:27,246
Isn't that right?

78
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:31,206
If you're done talking, I'll go and see my mom.

79
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:42,206
Rit, look at this.

80
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,126
Since 2017,

81
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,686
the expenditure has been increasing

82
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:49,246
by many percent year by year.

83
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:52,206
We haven't invested or expanded.

84
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:03,726
It's still possible.

85
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,446
The cost of living has been going up.

86
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:08,766
Everything is getting more expensive.

87
00:09:09,941 --> 00:09:11,286
Look at this.

88
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:13,406
In 2021,

89
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:16,766
it was up by 30%.

90
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:20,966
If it were just by a few percent, I'd understand.

91
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,926
Thirty percent is way too much.

92
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:28,886
We were making more profits, so we looked at it overall and didn't notice.

93
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:30,846
We weren't focused on this.

94
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:34,366
I think I should go into each department's details.

95
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:39,246
I'll talk to Grandfather about this tomorrow.

96
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:41,206
Noot.

97
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:43,806
Do you want that joint venture with C-Itsara?

98
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:51,446
I don't want it, Rit.

99
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:54,806
But we have to satisfy them with our offer.

100
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:57,109
Our company is not a pushover.

101
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:01,846
Why don't you tell Grandfather

102
00:10:02,014 --> 00:10:03,766
that you disagree with this project?

103
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:06,766
If I could,

104
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:10,406
I wouldn't be revising our offer to satisfy them.

105
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:17,486
You mean you don't want to, but you have to?

106
00:10:18,646 --> 00:10:20,166
I have to.

107
00:10:32,446 --> 00:10:34,006
Why are you in bed so early, Mom?

108
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:36,686
I'm not feeling well.

109
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,446
Have you had dinner?

110
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:40,806
I have. Let me see.

111
00:10:41,678 --> 00:10:44,606
You're burning up.

112
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:48,175
Let's go to the doctor. They can give you an injection.

113
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:50,086
I took my pills. I'll be better.

114
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:52,446
Did you see Grandfather?

115
00:10:53,262 --> 00:10:54,646
Of course, I did.

116
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,926
Don't even ask how it went.

117
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:01,494
You should agree with him sometimes.

118
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:03,872
He thinks he's right about everything.

119
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:06,966
He never cares about anything but himself and his profit.

120
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:09,086
He never changes.

121
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:12,046
He asked me about you.

122
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:15,486
He was the one who told me to ask you to come home.

123
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:19,406
- I think he might be...  - He doesn't actually miss me, Mom.

124
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:22,806
He just wants to find out what C-Itsara is up to.

125
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:32,166
Come. Give me a hug.

126
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,246
What happened to your foot?

127
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,411
I stepped on a broken glass.

128
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:00,726
It's nothing.

129
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,558
- Nok.  - Yes, Miss Un.

130
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,334
What happened to my mom's foot?

131
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:16,126
Was it Aunt Wing?

132
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:19,686
I'm not sure myself.

133
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:22,686
I heard a glass shatter. I ran out to see.

134
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:25,166
When I got there, Mrs. Wan was already sitting on the floor.

135
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:27,646
I saw Mrs. Wing's back,

136
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:30,143
but I'm not sure what had happened.

137
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:32,966
Mrs. Wan wouldn't tell me either.

138
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:43,926
Who is it?

139
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:46,086
Who is it?

140
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:54,726
Un, what do you want? It's late at night. Don't you have any manners?

141
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:56,406
I'm trying to sleep.

142
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:59,326
If my mom can't sleep, you shouldn't sleep.

143
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,566
Your mom can't sleep? What does it have to do with me?

144
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,686
You made my mom step on that glass, didn't you?

145
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:13,246
She did it herself.

146
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:15,846
I've got nothing to do with that.

147
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:20,326
I'll find out what you did to my mom.

148
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:24,766
I know people like you, and my mom is not that careless.

149
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:26,726
I just don't have evidence.

150
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:32,366
If something like this happens again, I'll hurt you even worse.

151
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,926
You're a nobody in this house,

152
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:37,406
yet you dare talk to me like this.

153
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:41,766
I do.

154
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,686
You'll see whether my threat is empty or not.

155
00:13:47,382 --> 00:13:48,382
You...

156
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:58,713
Un.

157
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:07,686
What are you doing here?

158
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:10,126
I'm staying with my mom for a few days.

159
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:14,966
That's good. Aunt Wan misses you. She keeps talking about you.

160
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:20,326
Did you just get back from work?

161
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:23,646
We had a little problem.

162
00:14:23,957 --> 00:14:25,486
I needed to review the documents.

163
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:28,686
Un.

164
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:34,062
I need to talk to you.

165
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:51,806
Is Kuer a good man?

166
00:14:53,286 --> 00:14:54,806
He's been good to me so far.

167
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:56,646
Why are you asking?

168
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:08,606
Can I talk to you as siblings?

169
00:15:10,965 --> 00:15:12,206
Yeah.

170
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:14,206
Is there something on your mind?

171
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:19,766
What can I do to help?

172
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:27,766
Is it about Phim?

173
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:11,966
Are you still working?

174
00:16:15,094 --> 00:16:17,966
I need to prepare the documents for a meeting with my grandmother tomorrow.

175
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:30,926
You should go to bed.

176
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:49,966
I can't sleep.

177
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:56,326
I'm worried about seeing the doctor tomorrow.

178
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,926
Don't worry about it.

179
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:01,286
Ask the doctor tomorrow what you should do.

180
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:04,046
Can you hold me?

181
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:10,966
We talked about this already.

182
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:12,566
Just hold me.

183
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,806
Phim...

184
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:23,126
I'll head to the office to see my grandmother in the morning,

185
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:25,806
and then I'll drive you to the hospital in the afternoon.

186
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:28,286
Okay.

187
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:41,086
I haven't been good to Phim.

188
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:43,206
I know that.

189
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,126
I love Phim

190
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:54,486
so much.

191
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:57,446
What has Phim done to make you think she's changed?

192
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:13,889
Phim won't

193
00:18:14,846 --> 00:18:16,406
sleep with me.

194
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,486
Not even once?

195
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:27,750
Not at all.

196
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:31,406
We haven't even been in the same bedroom lately.

197
00:18:33,471 --> 00:18:35,366
I know she's trying to avoid me.

198
00:18:36,341 --> 00:18:40,086
Sometimes, she stays at the resort she's managing on Phiman Island.

199
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:46,886
Did something happen before this?

200
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:58,206
I can't stop sleeping with other women.

201
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:01,446
I want to stop, but I can't.

202
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,286
Especially

203
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,046
when Phim refuses to sleep with me. It's getting worse.

204
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:11,406
I see you two getting along well.

205
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:14,166
Everyone is jealous of you two.

206
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:19,126
Phim doesn't want anyone to find out about our problems.

207
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:23,526
She's keeping up the appearance, I guess.

208
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,446
The reality is completely different.

209
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:34,246
So,

210
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:37,246
how can I help?

211
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,766
I don't know how you can help.

212
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:53,726
I just wonder

213
00:19:55,781 --> 00:19:57,886
how serious you and Kuer are.

214
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:01,822
You don't have to worry about Kuer.

215
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:04,286
He won't mess with Phim.

216
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:14,166
Thank you.

217
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:18,366
Thanks for listening to this nonsense.

218
00:20:21,141 --> 00:20:22,301
Are you serious?

219
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:24,846
It's not nonsense.

220
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:04,829
- Nok.  - Yes?

221
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,533
What is the usual menu for breakfast?

222
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,886
Mrs. Wan is still recovering, isn't she?

223
00:21:10,022 --> 00:21:11,700
I can do it alone.

224
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:13,326
You should take care of Mrs. Wan.

225
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:15,046
It's okay. I'll help.

226
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:17,806
- Miss Un.  - Come on. It's all right.

227
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:19,726
I cook for myself all the time.

228
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:28,486
- Four eggs?  - Yes, please.

229
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:38,526
- Nok.  - Yes?

230
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,526
Are you here alone? Where is Wan?

231
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,726
She's living off the company's money.

232
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,846
Can't she just come down to make breakfast for her family?

233
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:49,486
It won't kill her.

234
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:53,286
What do you do then?

235
00:21:53,461 --> 00:21:55,206
What do you do in a day?

236
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:57,566
Un!

237
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:02,526
Eight years ago,

238
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:05,366
I threw rice in your face.

239
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,246
I should be able to do more than that now.

240
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:10,406
Do you want to find out?

241
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:22,206
That was awesome, Miss Un! Brilliant!

242
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:27,366
Does she pick on my mom like this every day?

243
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:55,326
She hasn't told me where she goes since she got a boyfriend.

244
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,846
You can't escape me, Un.

245
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:05,686
Are you not picking up my calls?

246
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:15,086
This is Kuer's apartment, 3906.

247
00:23:29,137 --> 00:23:31,686
I'm sorry. I got the wrong apartment.

248
00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:41,526
Who was that?

249
00:23:46,485 --> 00:23:48,646
What should I do?

250
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:56,246
If Un calls me back, what should I tell her?

251
00:23:56,872 --> 00:23:59,406
Gade, you shouldn't have done that!

252
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:42,877
Hello?

253
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:45,726
What's up? There were a few missed calls.

254
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,926
I saw Kuer at the apartment. I thought you had come back.

255
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:53,806
I didn't. I'm working here.

256
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:56,326
Kuer will be back here in a few days.

257
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:59,326
(Oh. Okay.)

258
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:02,253
Is that all you want to talk about?

259
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:07,446
I thought you came back and didn't tell me.

260
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:11,886
I went to Kuer's apartment to surprise you.

261
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:13,606
And then what?

262
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:18,366
And I saw an even more shocking surprise.

263
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,926
A woman answered the door.

264
00:25:24,286 --> 00:25:25,886
(I don't know who she was.)

265
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:41,383
- Good afternoon.  - Good afternoon.

266
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:43,126
We're here to see Dr. Panida.

267
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:44,486
Okay.

268
00:25:44,614 --> 00:25:47,286
Mrs. Phimrata, right? This way, please.

269
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,328
Look at the departments with high expenditures.

270
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:51,646
Okay.

271
00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:55,671
- I'll look at this.  - Just as Mr. Noot said.

272
00:26:17,406 --> 00:26:19,486
(Kuer is with Phim in Bangkok.)

273
00:26:19,717 --> 00:26:21,926
(They're at the hospital to see an ob-gyn.)

274
00:26:43,206 --> 00:26:44,926
(Kuerkhun)

275
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:47,726
- Un.  - Noot, what's up?

276
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:49,606
Kuer is in Bangkok with Phim.

277
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:05,206
(Un)

278
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:12,806
Hello, Un.

279
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:15,846
What are you doing?

280
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:17,806
Are you busy?

281
00:27:18,773 --> 00:27:20,406
Didn't I tell you?

282
00:27:20,575 --> 00:27:22,566
I don't want anyone else to find out.

283
00:27:24,198 --> 00:27:27,006
I'm working at the office. I'm not busy. I can talk.

284
00:27:31,222 --> 00:27:33,606
I did what you asked me to do.

285
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:35,446
What did they say?

286
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:40,486
I will

287
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:45,326
email you the details.

288
00:27:46,188 --> 00:27:47,806
Okay. That's good.

289
00:27:50,022 --> 00:27:53,046
Un, I have to go. I have a meeting.

290
00:28:00,636 --> 00:28:03,326
What did he say? Did he tell the truth?

291
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,126
Is it all done?

292
00:28:08,326 --> 00:28:09,526
Yeah.

293
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:11,182
She will be in a bit of pain.

294
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:13,086
It will get better after some rest.

295
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:15,646
The doctor prescribed some painkillers.

296
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,726
When the results come back, we will call you.

297
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:23,806
- Okay.  - I'll push you to the cashier.

298
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:26,726
It's okay. I'll push her myself. Thank you.

299
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:33,886
You told me not to worry.

300
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:35,966
Why are they in Bangkok together?

301
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:37,766
I don't know either.

302
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:39,686
They're not just there together.

303
00:28:39,862 --> 00:28:42,326
They're there to see an ob-gyn.

304
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:46,406
How will you handle this?

305
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,046
Is Noot here?

306
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:12,766
He's not here yet.

307
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:15,046
Why don't you go to see him out front?

308
00:29:18,566 --> 00:29:19,846
I'd rather not.

309
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:21,646
We'll see him when he gets back.

310
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,526
Follow them.

311
00:29:54,246 --> 00:29:55,806
Tell me everything you see.

312
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:13,526
Thank you.

313
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:18,246
We're done, Phim. I'll drop you off at the apartment.

314
00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:20,566
I'm hungry, Kuer.

315
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,926
Can we get something to eat before we head back?

316
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:27,286
I need to go to the office. There's something I need to do.

317
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:31,566
You can order some food when you get back.

318
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:02,446
Be careful.

319
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,495
Phim, can you walk on your own?

320
00:31:15,766 --> 00:31:18,606
I don't think so. It hurts.

321
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:24,126
I'll go up with you, then.

322
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:38,726
Where is the messenger? I have other works to do.

323
00:31:53,653 --> 00:31:55,293
Why don't you just fuse your bodies here?

324
00:31:55,502 --> 00:31:57,166
He used to be admirable.

325
00:31:57,326 --> 00:31:59,166
I could see how good he looked from the moon.

326
00:31:59,406 --> 00:32:02,246
But seeing how bad he is now, I can see it from far out in the universe.

327
00:32:09,446 --> 00:32:11,086
Please sit on the couch, okay?

328
00:32:16,886 --> 00:32:19,486
Don't forget your pills after your meal. You'll feel better.

329
00:32:22,678 --> 00:32:25,126
Kuer, will you come home late?

330
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:28,326
I'm not sure, Phim.

331
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,846
If you're tired, go to bed. Don't wait for me.

332
00:32:47,214 --> 00:32:48,686
He doesn't pay me any attention.

333
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:52,006
He doesn't even have time for a meal with me.

334
00:32:52,726 --> 00:32:54,766
How long can he keep avoiding me?

335
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,966
Quite a few departments spent over the budget limit.

336
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:14,446
We will need to look at the details.

337
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:17,526
Should I stay and help?

338
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:23,206
That's good. There's a lot to go through. I can't do it alone.

339
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:28,366
Let me stay instead. If I go home, I will do nothing anyway.

340
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:33,126
That's great. We can all lend a hand.

341
00:33:52,606 --> 00:33:53,966
So late.

342
00:33:56,973 --> 00:33:58,253
Yeah?

343
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,846
Have you arrived here?

344
00:34:02,525 --> 00:34:04,526
Please come up to Apartment 3906.

345
00:34:17,944 --> 00:34:20,126
- I'm sorry...  - Mrs. Phim.

346
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:25,046
You're in another man's apartment when your husband is at home.

347
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:27,206
Don't you have any shame?

348
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,046
I don't.

349
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:34,326
Is there any shame in staying with a friend?

350
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:38,726
There's no shame if you think of Kuer as a friend.

351
00:34:39,102 --> 00:34:42,246
But I can guess from what I see.

352
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:45,606
It's more likely you're trying to catch Kuer.

353
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:49,366
Why would I catch him?

354
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:55,246
I have money. I'm not in any need,

355
00:34:55,382 --> 00:34:56,926
unlike you.

356
00:34:57,726 --> 00:34:58,966
What about me?

357
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:01,046
You're like a tumor.

358
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:04,046
You're a tumor your family got rid of.

359
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:08,336
You came from a great family. You were wealthy.

360
00:35:08,447 --> 00:35:12,006
But they kicked you out and made you homeless abroad.

361
00:35:12,966 --> 00:35:16,766
You returned here because you want to get back to House Jangwangprawas.

362
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:18,526
Think again.

363
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:20,606
I chose to leave on my own,

364
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:22,846
unlike you.

365
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:25,886
You married into the house because you wanted to get rich.

366
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:30,054
Though being rich doesn't stop your promiscuity.

367
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,806
Hey!

368
00:35:35,141 --> 00:35:37,726
Un ex should stay in the past.

369
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:42,806
You'd better learn to know what "the past" is.

370
00:35:44,886 --> 00:35:46,326
I may be in the past,

371
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:48,966
but I'm unforgettable.

372
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:55,046
I've slept in this apartment before.

373
00:35:55,302 --> 00:35:57,606
Why can't I come back here?

374
00:35:58,774 --> 00:36:00,526
You don't know yet.

375
00:36:01,446 --> 00:36:05,126
Kuer didn't date anyone after me.

376
00:36:20,566 --> 00:36:23,806
I think he's still not over me even now.

377
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:51,446
And then you just walked back?

378
00:36:55,531 --> 00:37:00,086
Loser. What a loser! How did you let her beat you?

379
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:06,526
What if Kuer really asked her to come back?

380
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:12,606
Hey! I think that woman is not your average girl.

381
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:16,406
How so?

382
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:19,406
She's a liar!

383
00:37:23,526 --> 00:37:24,726
Don't you believe me?

384
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:27,686
I saw it with my own eyes.

385
00:37:32,366 --> 00:37:33,646
Phim?

386
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,446
Are you okay?

387
00:37:37,806 --> 00:37:39,166
I'm alright.

388
00:37:39,453 --> 00:37:41,086
Shouldn't you walk slowly?

389
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,086
Okay.

390
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:48,166
Crap!

391
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:49,926
That wench!

392
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,229
Is she pretending or what?

393
00:37:52,677 --> 00:37:54,326
Did she do that?

394
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:01,806
I saw them embracing in that photo.

395
00:38:03,303 --> 00:38:05,766
It's impossible for Kuer not to notice it.

396
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:10,326
She made it look like they embraced and took that photo.

397
00:38:10,574 --> 00:38:13,366
Your boyfriend had no clue.

398
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,766
If he did, he'd have turned to the camera,

399
00:38:15,903 --> 00:38:19,966
smiled, posed, or made a cute mini-heart, right?

400
00:38:35,006 --> 00:38:36,446
It's the same!

401
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:38,254
Did you take that just now?

402
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:42,646
Yeah! Do you believe me now? She's not your average girl.

403
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:46,926
Are you letting her steal your boyfriend so easily?

404
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:07,846
Your food is here.

405
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:10,766
Wait a minute, please.

406
00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:21,126
I'm here for delivery to Apartment 3906.

407
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:23,326
Apartment 3906?

408
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,326
The elevator is this way.

409
00:39:29,846 --> 00:39:32,126
Is that the delivery for Apartment 3906?

410
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:35,446
- Yes. - That's good. I came down to get it myself.

411
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,366
- How much is it?  - It's 980 baht, sir.

412
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:38,701
Here you go.

413
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:45,446
Keep the change.

414
00:39:45,718 --> 00:39:47,086
Thank you so much.

415
00:40:40,493 --> 00:40:42,406
I asked you to leave nicely.

416
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:46,566
What are you doing?

417
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,326
I said what are you doing?

418
00:40:49,966 --> 00:40:51,486
Hey, you!

419
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:53,846
Where are you going?

420
00:41:02,814 --> 00:41:04,206
What are you doing?

421
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,686
I'm kicking you out.

422
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:24,406
Remember, I'm Kuer's new girlfriend.

423
00:41:24,726 --> 00:41:27,246
You have no right to stay here.

424
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,326
Hey!

425
00:41:30,981 --> 00:41:33,526
The owner of this apartment welcomed me.

426
00:41:36,366 --> 00:41:38,526
Should I call him to ask?

427
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,886
If you're not sick,

428
00:41:41,022 --> 00:41:42,662
would he let you stay?

429
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:48,566
You didn't think I'd know you got to stay here

430
00:41:48,846 --> 00:41:50,526
because you pretended to be sick.

431
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:55,646
Maybe Kuer didn't even notice you took that photo.

432
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,886
Am I right?

433
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:06,366
If you leave on your own now,

434
00:42:06,846 --> 00:42:09,046
I won't tell Kuer you lied.

435
00:42:11,013 --> 00:42:13,926
Do you want him to find out how fake you are?

436
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:35,966
This is the list of people I want to bring to our Phuket office.

437
00:42:47,286 --> 00:42:49,166
How is the work there?

438
00:42:49,598 --> 00:42:51,598
Is Dr. Ann doing a good job?

439
00:42:53,229 --> 00:42:54,526
She is.

440
00:42:58,246 --> 00:42:59,246
Grandmother.

441
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:04,846
There are two things I haven't told you.

442
00:43:06,566 --> 00:43:07,566
What?

443
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:11,221
Dr. Ann Chang's

444
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,966
real name is Unyamanee Jangwangprawas.

445
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,086
Didn't you wonder

446
00:43:21,214 --> 00:43:24,566
why I sent her on a big project like that

447
00:43:24,694 --> 00:43:26,366
when she had just joined us?

448
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:31,646
So you knew?

449
00:43:32,773 --> 00:43:34,686
I want to discover

450
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:36,726
how much a granddaughter like Unyamanee

451
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:39,006
can influence Mr. Prawit.

452
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:41,446
As far as I see it,

453
00:43:41,926 --> 00:43:44,006
she's not a pushover herself.

454
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:50,606
You two work with them. Why don't you know where they go?

455
00:43:54,502 --> 00:43:56,246
I know that Kuer went to Bangkok.

456
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:57,766
What about Un?

457
00:44:00,493 --> 00:44:02,493
I saw her here this morning.

458
00:44:03,749 --> 00:44:08,006
After that, we were busy reviewing past annual reports.

459
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:09,406
So...

460
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:14,566
If you two want to make it big, you need to be smart.

461
00:44:15,846 --> 00:44:17,526
Don't just know some things.

462
00:44:17,861 --> 00:44:19,406
You need to know everything.

463
00:44:20,798 --> 00:44:22,886
It's not just about the numbers in the account.

464
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:26,006
You have to know what your competitors are up to.

465
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,366
Personally, I can't trust those two just yet.

466
00:44:32,734 --> 00:44:35,206
I don't know when they will stab us in the back.

467
00:44:40,414 --> 00:44:42,366
We're joining forces soon.

468
00:44:43,077 --> 00:44:45,406
Aren't they allies to us?

469
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:48,686
Un is also your granddaughter.

470
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:50,446
She's not going to betray us.

471
00:44:51,346 --> 00:44:52,686
Joining forces?

472
00:44:53,438 --> 00:44:55,886
Do you think you can trust someone like her?

473
00:44:56,606 --> 00:44:59,566
Un is just looking out for herself.

474
00:45:02,757 --> 00:45:06,406
I want that joint venture with C-Itsara

475
00:45:06,886 --> 00:45:10,606
because I want to turn competitors into partners.

476
00:45:12,101 --> 00:45:13,926
We'll get a share of their profit.

477
00:45:16,406 --> 00:45:19,086
Maybe Un went home to see Aunt Wan?

478
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:22,606
You sure are optimistic, Rit.

479
00:45:25,846 --> 00:45:27,606
Un is an adviser.

480
00:45:28,614 --> 00:45:30,614
She disappears all of a sudden.

481
00:45:31,317 --> 00:45:35,966
I built the empire of businesses to be what it is today

482
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,206
because I'm not careless!

483
00:45:44,606 --> 00:45:45,966
I'm sorry, Grandfather.

484
00:45:46,428 --> 00:45:48,126
I'll get that information for you.

485
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:53,246
What about those accounts? Did you get anywhere?

486
00:45:55,405 --> 00:45:56,846
We're going through the reviews.

487
00:45:59,175 --> 00:46:04,486
When I find out who has been leeching off our company, I'll punish them!

488
00:46:08,813 --> 00:46:10,966
What about the other thing?

489
00:46:15,758 --> 00:46:17,126
I'm

490
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:20,726
dating Un, Grandmother.

491
00:46:23,206 --> 00:46:26,966
Why do you seem more surprised by this?

492
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:28,726
I think

493
00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:30,886
Unyamanee

494
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:32,806
is smart.

495
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:34,186
She's pretty.

496
00:46:34,302 --> 00:46:35,781
She's interesting.

497
00:46:35,982 --> 00:46:39,846
I just didn't think you were looking for someone.

498
00:46:42,118 --> 00:46:43,526
Grandmother.

499
00:46:43,694 --> 00:46:45,694
It's not that I'm not looking for someone.

500
00:46:46,158 --> 00:46:48,766
I just didn't find the right one.

501
00:46:49,549 --> 00:46:51,109
So is she the one?

502
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:58,086
I have nothing more to talk about.

503
00:46:59,846 --> 00:47:03,757
You're done here. Just go back to Un in Phuket.

504
00:47:05,817 --> 00:47:09,286
Well, are you rushing me out?

505
00:47:27,006 --> 00:47:29,206
How did you know that Mr. Kuer is in Bangkok?

506
00:47:31,735 --> 00:47:35,086
Grandfather asked me to tail him a while ago.

507
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:37,326
Is that so?

508
00:47:38,926 --> 00:47:41,046
How do we find out where Un is?

509
00:47:43,669 --> 00:47:45,286
How will you handle this?

510
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:47,661
You shouldn't be letting Kuer do this.

511
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,406
They may have a history.

512
00:47:50,893 --> 00:47:54,206
It doesn't mean they can get back together anytime they want.

513
00:47:55,878 --> 00:47:57,766
What can I do then?

514
00:47:58,005 --> 00:48:00,195
Phim doesn't say no to Kuer.

515
00:48:00,315 --> 00:48:02,165
She even started it herself.

516
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,480
That's just how Phim is.

517
00:48:06,245 --> 00:48:07,966
I can't stop her.

518
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:10,326
That's why I'm asking you to do something.

519
00:48:11,926 --> 00:48:13,646
I'm Phim's husband.

520
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:19,046
It's been killing me to see those two in the office together.

521
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:23,846
And now I find out they're in Bangkok together.

522
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:26,926
How do you think that makes me feel?

523
00:48:29,798 --> 00:48:31,686
How did you get this photo?

524
00:48:36,982 --> 00:48:38,982
My friend saw Phim with another man.

525
00:48:39,437 --> 00:48:41,006
He took photos and sent them to me.

526
00:48:43,981 --> 00:48:45,366
For someone like Phim,

527
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:47,532
if she wants it,

528
00:48:47,846 --> 00:48:49,846
I know she will go for it.

529
00:49:05,822 --> 00:49:07,822
(I saw Miss Un at Mr. Kuer's apartment.)

530
00:49:08,006 --> 00:49:09,006
(Mrs. Phim)

531
00:49:09,118 --> 00:49:11,926
(has left Mr. Kuer's apartment and checked into a hotel.)

532
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:22,357
Un won't tell us where she is.

533
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:26,110
We need to wait and see

534
00:49:26,854 --> 00:49:28,486
whose side she is on.

535
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:52,079
Un.

536
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:57,126
Where is Phim?

537
00:50:12,366 --> 00:50:14,086
When did you get here?

538
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,166
Have you eaten? Do you want to get something to eat?

539
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,246
I did all the work you asked me to do.

540
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,326
We need to stay at the golf resort for a night or two.

541
00:50:24,414 --> 00:50:25,846
As for Phim,

542
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:27,966
I told her to get a hotel.

543
00:50:37,046 --> 00:50:38,486
Well...

544
00:50:40,421 --> 00:50:43,726
Phim wasn't feeling well, so she asked to stay here.

545
00:50:46,006 --> 00:50:47,246
Really?

546
00:50:47,766 --> 00:50:49,446
Why didn't you tell me?

547
00:50:50,686 --> 00:50:52,686
I don't want you to feel upset.

548
00:50:54,126 --> 00:50:56,486
So it's better to lie?

549
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:01,726
It's not like that, Un. Phim went to a doctor and...

550
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:14,286
It's fine.

551
00:51:15,446 --> 00:51:17,206
I know you can't tell me.

552
00:51:22,326 --> 00:51:23,606
Un.

553
00:51:24,653 --> 00:51:26,086
I'm sorry.

554
00:51:29,126 --> 00:51:31,246
(Phim)

555
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:38,286
Take the call.

556
00:51:39,477 --> 00:51:42,006
I think you want to know where Phim is.

557
00:51:58,766 --> 00:51:59,766
Hello?

558
00:52:04,317 --> 00:52:08,166
Did I cause trouble between you and Un?

559
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:11,046
Not at all.

560
00:52:11,493 --> 00:52:12,846
She understands.

561
00:52:17,006 --> 00:52:19,006
It's good that she understands.

562
00:52:19,758 --> 00:52:21,646
I don't want her to get the wrong idea.

563
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,566
I have to go, Phim.

564
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,726
Aren't they arguing, at least?

565
00:52:43,582 --> 00:52:45,806
If they break up, that's even better.

566
00:52:50,886 --> 00:52:54,606
Phim is afraid you'd get the wrong idea.

567
00:52:55,526 --> 00:52:58,206
She called to ask.

568
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:03,765
I think I didn't get the wrong idea.

569
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,206
See you tomorrow at seven in the lobby.

570
00:53:07,534 --> 00:53:08,766
Un.

571
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,166
Where are you going?

572
00:53:13,005 --> 00:53:14,526
I'm staying with Gade.

573
00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:29,886
What is it?

574
00:53:33,606 --> 00:53:34,926
Are you staying at the resort?

575
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:37,566
Yes.

576
00:53:38,877 --> 00:53:41,606
When will you come back? Should I go pick you up?

577
00:53:42,556 --> 00:53:43,612
Don't.

578
00:53:43,709 --> 00:53:45,807
(Don't come to pick me up. When I finish my stuff,)

579
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:47,446
I'll go home on my own.

580
00:53:49,846 --> 00:53:51,206
I miss you.

581
00:54:06,446 --> 00:54:09,046
Mr. Noot, would you like some coffee?

582
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:29,806
Mr. Noot.

583
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,206
Rit is in there.

584
00:55:00,246 --> 00:55:01,446
Here are some snacks.

585
00:55:04,326 --> 00:55:05,606
Here's some water, Mr. Noot.

586
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:13,286
Here's some water, Rit.

587
00:55:16,054 --> 00:55:17,286
Thanks.

588
00:55:28,806 --> 00:55:30,446
Would you like some coffee, Rit?

589
00:55:30,646 --> 00:55:32,046
A cup would be nice.

590
00:55:32,206 --> 00:55:34,326
What about you, Mr. Noot?

591
00:55:34,973 --> 00:55:37,406
No, thank you.

592
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,046
Rit.

593
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,646
How was the account review with Noot today?

594
00:56:27,013 --> 00:56:28,526
We couldn't finish it, Grandfather.

595
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:37,046
Noot said he found the reason why expenses have been going up.

596
00:56:40,669 --> 00:56:42,326
I still stand by my word.

597
00:56:43,301 --> 00:56:46,886
If I find out who did this, I'll give them the most severe punishment.

598
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:49,766
Yes, Grandfather.

599
00:56:51,046 --> 00:56:53,766
You should have been the first one to find out, not Noot.

600
00:56:56,686 --> 00:56:58,006
What do you mean?

601
00:56:58,245 --> 00:57:00,566
I mean, you're in the purchasing department.

602
00:57:00,846 --> 00:57:03,686
All expenses, big or small, are made through you.

603
00:57:04,942 --> 00:57:06,766
You should have been the first to see

604
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:09,109
if something had gone wrong.

605
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:12,446
Didn't you notice it?

606
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,486
Several departments had overspent, Grandfather.

607
00:57:16,093 --> 00:57:18,926
We're checking to see the most suspicious ones.

608
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,430
If you're pointing the finger at the purchasing department,

609
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:23,726
I think that's not right, Grandfather.

610
00:57:28,006 --> 00:57:30,366
It was right for me to limit your duties!

611
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:34,646
Should I demote you for a while?

612
00:57:36,317 --> 00:57:38,180
If I let you work your way back up,

613
00:57:38,342 --> 00:57:40,566
maybe that will make you a bit smarter!

614
00:57:44,693 --> 00:57:46,766
What's going on, Father?

615
00:58:01,432 --> 00:58:03,766
What were you guys arguing about?

616
00:58:06,181 --> 00:58:07,526
It's nothing, Mom.

617
00:58:08,446 --> 00:58:10,726
Then why was he angry at you?

618
00:58:13,846 --> 00:58:15,766
He said I couldn't do my job.

619
00:58:16,816 --> 00:58:18,006
Why?

620
00:58:18,421 --> 00:58:20,086
The job you're doing

621
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,326
is going just fine, isn't it?

622
00:58:26,686 --> 00:58:28,046
There's a little problem, Mom.

623
00:58:31,677 --> 00:58:33,166
What is it?

624
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:39,246
Oh! Noot is back.

625
00:58:39,806 --> 00:58:42,080
You know what? When you have time,

626
00:58:42,247 --> 00:58:44,606
tell me about your problems.

627
00:58:45,053 --> 00:58:46,646
I'll ask Noot what's going on.

628
00:58:56,510 --> 00:59:00,806
Noot, how are you? You must be tired.

629
00:59:01,006 --> 00:59:02,486
- Yeah.  - Are you hungry?

630
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:05,677
- A little.  - Have you eaten?

631
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:10,886
I'll get something for you. Come.

632
00:59:16,629 --> 00:59:18,406
Why aren't you sleeping in your room?

633
00:59:18,566 --> 00:59:21,846
If you were a cute guy, I would have no problems.

634
00:59:22,173 --> 00:59:24,486
You won't even sleep in your boyfriend's apartment.

635
00:59:25,727 --> 00:59:28,006
I want to spend time with you too.

636
00:59:28,894 --> 00:59:32,566
I was in Phuket for a while. I have things for you to catch up on.

637
00:59:34,926 --> 00:59:36,406
Catching up with you?

638
00:59:36,565 --> 00:59:39,686
You've got so much going on. I can write a show about you.

639
00:59:40,566 --> 00:59:43,046
Tell me honestly. You're staying with me

640
00:59:43,326 --> 00:59:45,006
because you fought with Kuer, don't you?

641
00:59:45,283 --> 00:59:46,886
You wouldn't show your face here otherwise.

642
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:58,366
I don't know who I can talk to.

643
01:00:02,677 --> 01:00:04,406
How can I tell anyone

644
01:00:04,606 --> 01:00:07,686
that my boyfriend lied because he wanted his ex to stay in his apartment?

645
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,566
Your sister-in-law is lucky.

646
01:00:13,366 --> 01:00:14,526
How so?

647
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:18,766
She's lucky it was you.

648
01:00:19,093 --> 01:00:23,246
If I were you, I wouldn't have just kicked her out.

649
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:26,366
I'll slap the botox out of her.

650
01:00:28,366 --> 01:00:29,452
You're mad.

651
01:00:29,635 --> 01:00:31,166
I'll do it for real.

652
01:00:34,102 --> 01:00:35,886
If you're still mad at Kuer,

653
01:00:36,638 --> 01:00:39,246
how can you stay at the golf resort with him?

654
01:00:39,566 --> 01:00:41,166
You'll be there for a couple of nights.

655
01:01:03,846 --> 01:01:05,126
You're not mad at me anymore, right?

656
01:01:05,934 --> 01:01:07,486
If you're ready, let's go.

657
01:01:19,038 --> 01:01:20,166
I'll get it for you.

658
01:01:39,326 --> 01:01:41,926
I didn't tell you because I was afraid you'd get mad.

659
01:01:42,646 --> 01:01:44,606
You shouldn't have done it if you knew I'd get mad.

660
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,720
But,

661
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:50,166
- Phim needed...  - Should you think of me over Phim?

662
01:01:50,566 --> 01:01:52,806
I'm your girlfriend. She's your ex.

663
01:01:53,086 --> 01:01:55,086
And she's married.

664
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:58,406
She needed to go to the hospital, and

665
01:01:58,646 --> 01:02:00,646
she was afraid she would be in too much pain after that.

666
01:02:00,797 --> 01:02:03,206
Too much pain? And you believed that?

667
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:05,966
I pitied her.

668
01:02:08,437 --> 01:02:12,366
The way I saw her yesterday, seeing a hundred doctors wouldn't hurt her.

669
01:02:13,326 --> 01:02:14,646
Shall we go?

670
01:02:16,893 --> 01:02:19,006
I'm still mad at you.

671
01:02:19,134 --> 01:02:20,486
I love you.

672
01:02:22,445 --> 01:02:23,445
Hey!

673
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,726
Believe me.

674
01:02:25,406 --> 01:02:26,886
I keep my promise.

675
01:02:27,406 --> 01:02:28,886
I don't have feelings for Phim.

676
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:32,286
She begged to stay at my apartment.

677
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,406
I was sympathetic.

678
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:38,686
If I have to choose between you and her, I will choose you.

679
01:02:47,929 --> 01:02:49,033
What?

680
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:50,886
I understand now.

681
01:02:51,525 --> 01:02:52,846
Shall we go?

682
01:02:54,686 --> 01:02:56,366
I'll open it for you.

683
01:02:58,166 --> 01:02:59,166
Watch your head.

684
01:03:32,033 --> 01:03:33,406
Where is Wan?

685
01:03:33,526 --> 01:03:35,006
She's lazy, Father.

686
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:39,526
She probably overslept. I asked Nok to cook breakfast.

687
01:03:42,053 --> 01:03:43,487
Noot.

688
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:47,846
We have rice in shrimp soup this morning. It's your favorite.

689
01:03:48,126 --> 01:03:50,166
- Thank you.  - Let's go and eat it.

690
01:03:53,883 --> 01:03:56,806
Your mom takes care of Noot like he's still a kid.

691
01:03:57,735 --> 01:03:59,046
Yes.

692
01:04:03,404 --> 01:04:04,846
Won't you have some breakfast?

693
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:08,206
I better head to work. There are still documents to go through.

694
01:04:28,133 --> 01:04:29,406
Your vitamin, Father.

695
01:04:29,797 --> 01:04:31,797
It's good you're here. Where is your daughter?

696
01:04:33,253 --> 01:04:35,166
I don't know. She didn't come home last night.

697
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:38,446
Did she go away without even telling her mother?

698
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,546
What kind of mother are you?

699
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:45,566
- She didn't tell me.  - Why didn't you ask?

700
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:47,646
Are your lips sealed shut?

701
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:49,326
They're not, Father.

702
01:04:49,454 --> 01:04:53,086
She just likes to talk about others, not her own business.

703
01:04:53,638 --> 01:04:54,926
Please stop, Aunt Wing.

704
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:59,526
Aunt Wan, what happened to your foot?

705
01:05:00,246 --> 01:05:01,966
Nothing happened.

706
01:05:02,086 --> 01:05:05,926
She just woke up late and pretended to be hurt. That's all.

707
01:05:12,766 --> 01:05:14,286
I'm off to work, Grandfather.

708
01:05:17,214 --> 01:05:19,926
You've killed Noot's appetite.

709
01:05:20,773 --> 01:05:23,526
If you want to fight in front of me,

710
01:05:24,317 --> 01:05:25,606
leave.

711
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,366
I said leave!

712
01:05:39,213 --> 01:05:40,366
Yes.

713
01:05:57,917 --> 01:05:58,917
Wan!

714
01:06:00,733 --> 01:06:03,406
You intentionally let Father know about your foot, right?

715
01:06:04,886 --> 01:06:06,366
Are you afraid I'd tell him

716
01:06:06,573 --> 01:06:07,846
that you did it?

717
01:06:08,094 --> 01:06:10,806
If you think your life is not hard enough now,

718
01:06:11,365 --> 01:06:12,606
tell him then.

719
01:06:12,998 --> 01:06:14,366
Try telling him.

720
01:06:16,246 --> 01:06:17,686
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

721
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,206
Look. Ever since your kid came back,

722
01:06:22,453 --> 01:06:24,086
you've been talking big.

723
01:06:25,557 --> 01:06:28,846
Nobody can tolerate a bully forever.

724
01:06:30,813 --> 01:06:32,486
You don't tolerate bullies,

725
01:06:32,797 --> 01:06:35,726
yet you're in the kitchen all day.

726
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:37,726
If you do,

727
01:06:37,862 --> 01:06:41,206
you might have been a wandering homeless on the streets.

728
01:06:42,576 --> 01:06:44,246
Let me tell you something.

729
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:45,966
You can forget

730
01:06:46,134 --> 01:06:47,606
about your daughter coming back

731
01:06:47,781 --> 01:06:50,006
to make your life better.

732
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:51,806
Stop dreaming.

733
01:07:12,006 --> 01:07:13,046
Rit.

734
01:07:18,046 --> 01:07:21,406
These are the quotations we asked for from our suppliers.

735
01:07:21,567 --> 01:07:23,566
You asked me for these.

736
01:07:29,867 --> 01:07:30,867
Thanks.

737
01:07:34,766 --> 01:07:38,286
I need to handle the work from yesterday first.

738
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:39,429
Okay.

739
01:07:43,969 --> 01:07:46,786
Look. There was news a while ago.

740
01:07:46,973 --> 01:07:49,486
People guessed that it was you and Noot.

741
01:07:49,685 --> 01:07:51,086
The way I see it,

742
01:07:51,197 --> 01:07:52,526
it couldn't have been you guys.

743
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:55,166
How could it have been you guys?

744
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,445
Noot loves you much.

745
01:07:57,526 --> 01:07:59,926
- He loves you so much that I'm jealous.  - Right?

746
01:08:01,046 --> 01:08:04,766
Where is Noot, by the way? Why did you come to Bangkok alone?

747
01:08:07,526 --> 01:08:10,966
Noot thought I was bored. He told me to come and go shopping.

748
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:27,766
It's the hospital.

749
01:08:32,206 --> 01:08:33,406
Hello?

750
01:08:33,717 --> 01:08:35,606
Your blood results came back.

751
01:08:35,869 --> 01:08:38,726
(The doctor told me to inform you first.)

752
01:08:39,086 --> 01:08:42,406
Your biopsy is still on schedule.

753
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,132
What's the result?

754
01:08:45,302 --> 01:08:47,806
Congratulations, you're pregnant.

755
01:08:48,006 --> 01:08:51,206
(The doctor said to inform you so you can care for yourself properly.)

756
01:08:58,258 --> 01:08:59,258
Okay.

757
01:09:14,206 --> 01:09:16,094
If Kuer is not the father,

758
01:09:16,206 --> 01:09:17,686
I'd rather not have it.

759
01:09:17,934 --> 01:09:19,934
Did you go to an ob-gyn with Phim?

760
01:09:20,126 --> 01:09:22,406
You said she was sick, and her husband doesn't know.

761
01:09:22,574 --> 01:09:24,574
- How should I feel about this?  - How did you know?

762
01:09:24,726 --> 01:09:27,606
I told Un. I'm wondering the same.

763
01:09:27,926 --> 01:09:29,046
What's wrong with Phim?

764
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,286
I don't intend to steal anyone's woman.

765
01:09:31,686 --> 01:09:33,326
Only you know that for sure.

766
01:09:33,454 --> 01:09:35,454
If I were you, I wouldn't blame other people.

767
01:09:35,932 --> 01:09:38,166
I'd go back and see why

768
01:09:38,886 --> 01:09:40,846
my wife would want someone else.
