1
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:47,286
I want to have a meal with Un's mother tomorrow.

2
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:51,691
May I ask to see another person?

3
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:52,886
Who do you want to see?

4
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:53,989
Mr. Thevarit.

5
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:55,895
Did you see anything?

6
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,166
I didn't.

7
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,526
I think I left before the incident. I didn't see Mr. Kuer there.

8
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:02,205
Will you marry me?

9
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:03,526
Yes.

10
00:02:03,894 --> 00:02:06,446
Look at this! A man with real class

11
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:08,166
and intelligence

12
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:10,126
will choose an intelligent woman

13
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:12,686
deserving of his status, like my daughter.

14
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:15,446
She just had to interrupt our happy moment.

15
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,686
You're something else, Mom.

16
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,142
If I let her bully me as you think,

17
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:27,086
I wouldn't have survived this long, Un.

18
00:02:31,854 --> 00:02:35,446
By the way, when did he propose to you?

19
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:38,206
Just before I came here.

20
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:46,646
Mom.

21
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,526
When I get married,

22
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:50,694
can you move and live with us?

23
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:12,646
When you get married, I can't follow you there.

24
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:17,246
You will be Kuer's family.

25
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,046
I can stay here.

26
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:25,446
We've been living apart for years.

27
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:28,526
I want to take care of you.

28
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:34,926
I have a good life now. How can I let you suffer any longer?

29
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,366
But your dad's...

30
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,726
Mom.

31
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:43,606
They don't want to give it to us, and we don't want that.

32
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:47,126
What I have right now

33
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:50,606
is enough for both of us to live comfortably.

34
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:54,206
When I get married,

35
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,526
please live with me and let me take care of you.

36
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:04,886
We'll talk about that when the time comes.

37
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:08,046
But right now,

38
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:11,566
what should I wear to meet them?

39
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,486
What should you wear?

40
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,726
- Okay. I'll help you choose.  - Okay.

41
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,406
Let's see.

42
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:25,366
Aunt Wing.

43
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:28,766
Noot said he'd come back for dinner.

44
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:31,526
We won't be cooking at home today.

45
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:35,766
Did Noot tell you what he wanted? I'll order it for him.

46
00:04:36,054 --> 00:04:37,886
Is Aunt Wan not cooking today?

47
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:39,686
She has a plan.

48
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:44,678
Aunt Wan is having dinner with Mr. Kuer's family.

49
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,006
I saw Un just now, and I was like, "Whoa!"

50
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,446
I saw a huge diamond on her finger.

51
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:54,766
I think they're officially asking for blessings.

52
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:01,637
By the way,

53
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:05,806
did Noot tell you what he wanted? I can order it for him.

54
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:08,886
I'll order something myself.

55
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,558
Thank you, Aunt Wing.

56
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:12,086
Okay.

57
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:21,486
This one is good, Mom.

58
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:26,573
Isn't the color too pale?

59
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:28,846
It's not.

60
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:32,246
It's chic. I think you should dress like this often.

61
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:35,646
Where would I go in this? I'm always at home.

62
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,926
I should take a shower.

63
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:40,486
Okay.

64
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,166
What do you want?

65
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,686
We need to talk.

66
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,446
Did Kuer give you that ring?

67
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:16,877
Yes.

68
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:18,206
Why?

69
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,206
He proposed to me.

70
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,886
Why would Kuer propose to you?

71
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:30,526
Phim, are you asking because you really don't know?

72
00:06:30,814 --> 00:06:32,046
Or you can't accept it?

73
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:39,406
As Noot's sister, I'm warning you.

74
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,366
It's not your fault to love someone.

75
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:44,846
It's just wrong to desire more

76
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:46,566
because you already have a husband.

77
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,966
A scoundrel of a husband.

78
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:55,526
Whether good or bad, he's your husband.

79
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:58,886
If you want a new guy,

80
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,886
you need to divorce first.

81
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:04,486
Otherwise, the one who's at fault

82
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:06,326
is more likely the wife.

83
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:12,846
But if the man you want

84
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:14,966
is already taken,

85
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,366
you shouldn't mess with him even if you get a divorce.

86
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:24,046
Women who mess with someone else's husband are shameless and repulsive.

87
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:27,766
Look.

88
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:32,526
That also depends on what the man wants.

89
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:34,606
If he doesn't want me, fine.

90
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,022
But if he does,

91
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:41,406
will you be able to find out?

92
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:46,966
When I get married to Kuer, and you're still messing with him,

93
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:49,686
I won't allow that.

94
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,886
Just tell that to Kuer.

95
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:57,021
It's no use telling me.

96
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,254
Because it takes two

97
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:01,046
to tango.

98
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:22,326
If you're sure Kuer will have only you,

99
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:25,526
marry him.

100
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:46,773
Is Kuer marrying Un?

101
00:08:47,286 --> 00:08:49,806
Haven't they just met? How are they getting married?

102
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:11,726
Hello?

103
00:09:58,486 --> 00:09:59,766
Excuse me, sir.

104
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:01,486
Have you talked to him?

105
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:04,646
Well, you really have that nosy energy.

106
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:07,406
Just tell me. I want to know.

107
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:10,966
Why are you asking me right at the station?

108
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:14,126
Some things are classified. They can affect the case.

109
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:15,606
If you don't tell me,

110
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:17,406
you will get another case.

111
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:20,446
Sa!

112
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:25,286
Wait! Hey!

113
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:28,086
Spill it.

114
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:29,886
Miss Sa!

115
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:32,566
You dragged me into a room and closed the door?

116
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:34,662
Yeah! Spill it!

117
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:35,926
Seriously?

118
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:37,806
Do you just want me to tell you?

119
00:10:39,526 --> 00:10:40,526
You...

120
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:41,910
It's San!

121
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,366
- Yeah!  - Don't call me names.

122
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:47,006
If you don't spill it, I'll call you names.

123
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:50,566
You're always teasing me. Okay, fine!

124
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:53,846
I'm fine with that because we have "chemistease" as a couple.

125
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,446
Don't you mean "chemistry"?

126
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:57,806
Is this the time for a pun?

127
00:10:57,956 --> 00:11:00,726
It's not just a pun. I'm serious.

128
00:11:02,392 --> 00:11:07,086
Well? Are you embarrassed? You're touching your ear.

129
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:09,726
Tell me! Have you talked to Mr. Rit?

130
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,566
I have.

131
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:24,246
Well? Tell me what he said! Why do I need to ask everything?

132
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:26,006
Because when you ask me if I love you,

133
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:27,686
I'll say yes.

134
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:34,606
Hey! Wait! I'll tell you now.

135
00:11:36,158 --> 00:11:37,526
That's it.

136
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,406
When will I get to hold your child, Phim?

137
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:00,126
I think she's not ready, Grandfather.

138
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:02,326
She's not ready?

139
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:04,886
You've been married for years, and you're not ready?

140
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:07,526
Maybe Phim just doesn't want a child with you.

141
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:11,486
We've been trying.

142
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:13,006
We've just had no luck yet.

143
00:12:13,126 --> 00:12:15,326
If you've had no luck, why don't you see a doctor?

144
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:17,206
You've got all the money in the world.

145
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,686
Spend it.

146
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:25,006
When you return from Bangkok,

147
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:29,566
I hope to find out if you need to see a doctor

148
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:31,886
and how long it will take.

149
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:56,966
Noot, if you have problems with Phim, you can talk to me.

150
00:12:57,729 --> 00:13:01,446
Phim and I are fellow women. It might be easier when I talk to her.

151
00:13:10,678 --> 00:13:13,086
I'll ask Nok to clear the table.

152
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:16,326
Mom.

153
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:19,166
I need to talk to you.

154
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:33,246
I asked you out here tonight

155
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:35,006
because it has come to my attention

156
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:38,286
that Kuer loves your daughter, Mrs. Wan.

157
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,086
I'm formally letting you know.

158
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,086
If you don't mind,

159
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:45,859
I do want Kuer

160
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:48,446
to be the one who gets to care for Un.

161
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:53,006
Then they can start a happy family.

162
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:02,326
I'm willing to give my blessing.

163
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:12,766
How much do you want for the dowry?

164
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,406
If they really love each other,

165
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:24,846
all I need is

166
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,166
for Kuer to keep Un happy.

167
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:39,486
Then I'll arrange the dowry as I see fit.

168
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:41,806
Thank you.

169
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:54,366
What's wrong? You're smiling ear to ear.

170
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:59,406
I'm happy, Grandmother.

171
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:02,766
Thank you, Mother.

172
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,966
Thank you, Grandmother.

173
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:09,566
Have a baby soon. Grandmother's getting lonely.

174
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:15,286
You can have one first. I'm not in a rush.

175
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:22,651
If you're okay with it,

176
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:26,806
I'll officially ask for Mr. Prawit's blessing soon.

177
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:28,966
Yes.

178
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:49,926
San!

179
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:52,086
What?

180
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:56,486
Do you think the videos I took of Phim and Noot arguing

181
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:59,246
at the parking lot and the resort can be used as evidence?

182
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:02,486
The two of them fought, right? That made Noot resent Kuer.

183
00:16:02,686 --> 00:16:05,166
That can be a motivation for hiring a hit on him, right?

184
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:06,606
Can we do that?

185
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:10,366
Send those videos to me.

186
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:24,653
You can see me off here.

187
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:26,566
I'd rather walk with you to your room.

188
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:29,406
I'll be with my mom for a bit.

189
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,381
- Please wait here.  - Okay.

190
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:33,133
You can wait inside the house.

191
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:37,686
It's okay, Mother. I'll just be here.

192
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:40,526
Un, you should walk your mother in.

193
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:43,526
Mother, thank you so much.

194
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:53,526
Hi!

195
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:04,566
Are you out of your mind? How can you say that to Grandfather?

196
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:07,646
What I said was the truth.

197
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:10,126
You don't want to have my baby.

198
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:14,806
Why else have we not had a baby after this long?

199
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:16,246
Why would I not want one?

200
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:19,366
I did want it, but it didn't happen.

201
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:22,326
Right now, when I don't want it,

202
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:25,646
I unexpectedly get pregnant.

203
00:17:28,878 --> 00:17:30,246
Are you pregnant?

204
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:36,686
Phim, you're pregnant?

205
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:44,046
When did you get pregnant? Why didn't you tell me?

206
00:17:44,286 --> 00:17:45,844
I'm getting an abortion.

207
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:48,886
Are you mad?

208
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:50,485
I'm not mad.

209
00:17:50,582 --> 00:17:52,366
Why else would you get an abortion?

210
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:54,366
Because of you!

211
00:17:55,414 --> 00:17:57,686
This is all because of you.

212
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:02,526
Today,

213
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,974
the doctor called.

214
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,646
He said I have cancer.

215
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,534
I need chemotherapy.

216
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,926
But I'm pregnant!

217
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,886
I have to choose between the treatment

218
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,205
and the baby.

219
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:33,446
If I get chemo while pregnant,

220
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:37,166
I'll risk a miscarriage anyway.

221
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,966
If I don't get that chemo, I'll die!

222
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:47,486
Why do I have to risk my life

223
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,166
for a womanizing man like you?

224
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:51,846
Why?

225
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:56,926
Phim!

226
00:18:57,941 --> 00:19:01,006
Are you sure you have cancer?

227
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:05,966
Do you think I'd lie about this?

228
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:13,926
This afternoon, the hospital called and told me the biopsy results.

229
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:21,794
Phim.

230
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:24,126
Let's figure it out.

231
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:28,206
Let's find a way. We'll talk to doctors before we decide.

232
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:30,006
We'll get a second opinion.

233
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:34,134
Who will you choose?

234
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:39,566
Me

235
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:42,846
or the baby?

236
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,366
You deserve to pay for your womanizing ways.

237
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:08,646
Phim.

238
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:13,046
Phim!

239
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:16,806
Don't rush any decisions you might regret for the rest of your life.

240
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:19,286
Noot!

241
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,126
Regret?

242
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:32,086
You've never put me first, not once.

243
00:20:33,174 --> 00:20:35,086
And today,

244
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:39,006
the day I think you need to choose me,

245
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:43,926
you still don't get it.

246
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:54,646
Are you pregnant with Kuer's baby?

247
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:56,606
You're using it as an excuse.

248
00:20:58,086 --> 00:21:00,606
You're out of your mind. Noot!

249
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:02,861
You're hurting me.

250
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:04,766
And are you not hurting me?

251
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:07,766
What are you doing to our kid?

252
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:11,966
How long have we been trying for a baby?

253
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:15,366
And you're deciding this so easily?

254
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,286
I'll get an abortion.

255
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,166
And I'll never have your baby again.

256
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:33,646
I'll let you know

257
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:35,446
that everything is

258
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:37,126
because of you!

259
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:46,846
I'm getting a divorce.

260
00:22:39,486 --> 00:22:40,806
You raised Noot.

261
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,286
He respects you.

262
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:44,286
Please talk to him for me.

263
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,006
Talk about what?

264
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:48,006
The company accounting.

265
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,686
What about accounting?

266
00:22:49,926 --> 00:22:53,246
I told you Noot was reviewing the accounting.

267
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,686
Fine. I can talk to him about that accounting.

268
00:22:59,221 --> 00:23:04,166
We're family. We need to help and support each other. More importantly,

269
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:07,246
Noot cannot see his cousin as an enemy.

270
00:23:30,766 --> 00:23:31,846
That's Phim.

271
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:34,366
Where is she going this late?

272
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:36,326
Is she going back to the resort tonight?

273
00:23:36,462 --> 00:23:38,302
Is there any boat running this late?

274
00:23:38,726 --> 00:23:41,086
The owner is going. They'll send a boat somehow.

275
00:23:52,102 --> 00:23:53,286
Kuer.

276
00:23:57,172 --> 00:23:58,406
Phim.

277
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:10,366
What happened, Phim?

278
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:18,809
Phim.

279
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:24,326
Kuer.

280
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,846
Can you please give me a ride?

281
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:34,766
I can't.

282
00:25:36,598 --> 00:25:38,046
Phim.

283
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,366
Okay.

284
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:43,486
Phim.

285
00:25:45,523 --> 00:25:46,766
Okay.

286
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:50,086
I'll give you a ride.

287
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,166
But that's all.

288
00:26:00,046 --> 00:26:01,526
You can stand up, right?

289
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:15,246
Okay.

290
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:16,966
Can you stand?

291
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:21,406
I need to call Un and tell her.

292
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,726
Kuer.

293
00:26:26,606 --> 00:26:30,606
Please get me out of here first. I don't want to be here.

294
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,486
It's just a ride. Un won't have a problem with that.

295
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:45,966
I don't want to be here even a minute longer.

296
00:26:48,246 --> 00:26:49,486
Please.

297
00:26:52,253 --> 00:26:53,726
Okay.

298
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,926
Can you walk?

299
00:28:16,886 --> 00:28:18,166
What's wrong with him?

300
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,486
He's engaged to a woman.

301
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,486
Yet he's going out with someone else's wife.

302
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:27,166
Mom.

303
00:28:27,446 --> 00:28:29,886
Can you please talk to Noot right now?

304
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:34,566
Okay. Phim's gone. I can get to him. I will talk to him.

305
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:47,646
Noot, it's me, Aunt Wing.

306
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:51,206
I need to talk to you.

307
00:28:57,381 --> 00:28:58,726
Noot.

308
00:28:59,862 --> 00:29:01,166
Noot?

309
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,086
He's not answering.

310
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,406
I think he doesn't want to be disturbed.

311
00:29:19,046 --> 00:29:21,186
What a shame.

312
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:22,866
No one is home right now.

313
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:26,486
It's our chance to talk, but we can try again tomorrow.

314
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:29,606
Just go and take a shower. I'll take one too.

315
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:45,846
Is anything the matter, Rit?

316
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:49,566
I'm heading outside if it's not important.

317
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,926
I want to talk about accounting.

318
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:08,446
You said there were abnormalities. I checked them.

319
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:11,286
I think the accounting department got it wrong.

320
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:17,278
I'll give you one more chance to correct yourself.

321
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:21,126
Why?

322
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:46,526
Before I went to Bangkok,

323
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:48,486
I made copies of all the documents

324
00:30:48,662 --> 00:30:50,366
I was suspicious of.

325
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:52,726
When I returned,

326
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,550
the documents Grandfather asked me to check

327
00:30:55,805 --> 00:30:57,126
looked different.

328
00:30:57,838 --> 00:30:59,166
They had been forged.

329
00:30:59,414 --> 00:31:01,366
I didn't expect you'd do this.

330
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,806
Will you tell Grandfather yourself?

331
00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:26,326
If I asked the accounting department to send the documents again,

332
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,046
I believe they would be the versions I have.

333
00:31:30,942 --> 00:31:32,526
I'll give you some time to think about it.

334
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,726
I don't have time tonight. I'm going to see Phim at the resort.

335
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:58,166
I don't think Phim wants to see you.

336
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:03,446
She left with Kuer.

337
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:08,766
She probably doesn't want her husband to see her with another man.

338
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:31,415
Are you sure, Rit,

339
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:34,766
that Phim really went to the resort with Kuer?

340
00:32:35,406 --> 00:32:36,686
Noot!

341
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:39,006
You need to calm down.

342
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,406
You guys can just talk nicely.

343
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:45,926
You're husband and wife. If you're reckless, it will hurt you both.

344
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:48,246
Just mind your own problems.

345
00:32:48,606 --> 00:32:50,446
I'll mind mine.

346
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:16,326
(Phim: I'm on my way to the resort. Kuer is with me.)

347
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:17,846
Okay.

348
00:33:18,348 --> 00:33:19,766
Is this all?

349
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,606
Move this one here instead.

350
00:33:23,284 --> 00:33:24,752
And...

351
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:30,882
(Phim: Kuer is with me. Send the boat driver to buy the stuff.)

352
00:33:31,045 --> 00:33:33,045
- I'll leave this to you, Aom.  - Okay.

353
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:53,492
Man, I'll give you a list of things to buy. Please go out and buy them.

354
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:55,604
I'll ride a bike out and buy them.

355
00:33:56,055 --> 00:33:57,055
(Go now.)

356
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:59,166
I'll send you the list when you get to the store.

357
00:33:59,294 --> 00:34:02,046
Miss Si, it looks like there'll be a storm.

358
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:03,987
I don't think I can make it out tonight.

359
00:34:04,173 --> 00:34:07,126
Just go now and get back before the storm hits.

360
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:09,006
Okay, Miss Si. I'll head out now.

361
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:18,566
(He's going. Do you have a spare key?)

362
00:35:03,205 --> 00:35:04,966
The boat driver is not here.

363
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,646
How will you get to the island, then?

364
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:10,566
- Should we stay and wait?  - It's okay.

365
00:35:10,749 --> 00:35:12,526
I can go alone.

366
00:35:16,629 --> 00:35:18,456
The storm is coming, Phim.

367
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:21,486
If you drive the boat out now, it's suicide.

368
00:35:31,278 --> 00:35:32,966
How can you make it alone?

369
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:41,406
Nam, I'm on my way to the apartment.

370
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,806
What's wrong, Rit?

371
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:45,406
You don't sound happy.

372
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,966
There's a little problem.

373
00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:48,566
I'm on my way.

374
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:06,115
Phim.

375
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:08,366
I'm heading back.

376
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:12,646
Can you go in this condition?

377
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,446
I made it here. I can make it back.

378
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,486
Kuer, do I disgust you that much?

379
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:27,766
It's too risky, and you're still heading back.

380
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,806
I don't want Un to misunderstand us again.

381
00:37:25,406 --> 00:37:26,406
Phim.

382
00:37:27,438 --> 00:37:29,206
Did you really drive the boat here yourself?

383
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:33,206
Kuer drove me here.

384
00:37:34,446 --> 00:37:35,686
Where is he?

385
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:37,166
He's on his way back.

386
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:38,766
On his way back right now?

387
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:41,126
Can he make it to shore in this storm?

388
00:37:42,046 --> 00:37:45,366
He's more afraid of being with me than risking capsizing.

389
00:38:27,086 --> 00:38:28,406
Excuse me.

390
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:41,846
I'm sorry. I need you to stay in the same room.

391
00:38:42,037 --> 00:38:43,366
With the transformer exploded,

392
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:47,086
we would like our guests to stay in the same place. It's easier to manage.

393
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:48,766
It's okay.

394
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:50,350
I'll stay in the lobby.

395
00:38:52,606 --> 00:38:54,726
You should stay here.

396
00:38:54,886 --> 00:38:57,606
We don't have power in the lobby.

397
00:38:57,806 --> 00:38:59,646
I have to go now.

398
00:39:27,486 --> 00:39:29,006
Why did you come back?

399
00:39:32,063 --> 00:39:34,846
The storm is too strong. I couldn't make it.

400
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:56,926
(We do)

401
00:39:57,181 --> 00:40:01,246
(know how much we are in love.)

402
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:05,246
(Yet deep inside, we're still insecure)

403
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:07,126
(if the two of us)

404
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:10,726
(will make it to the end.)

405
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:17,446
(Sometimes I ask myself whether I overthink.)

406
00:40:17,971 --> 00:40:21,486
(You're better than many other guys.)

407
00:40:21,646 --> 00:40:23,646
(Why am I afraid?)

408
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:27,326
(Or do I just want more?)

409
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:31,562
(If all I have is love, would that be enough?)

410
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:35,726
(I don't know what it will take.)

411
00:40:35,886 --> 00:40:40,086
(My heart feels frustrated.)

412
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,766
(I'm afraid I'd be left with no one.)

413
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:48,206
(I know I love you with all my heart.)

414
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:51,606
(I don't know if that will be enough for you.)

415
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:55,726
(If someday that doesn't matter,)

416
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:58,792
(will I be able to live)

417
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:03,246
(a life without you?)

418
00:41:56,886 --> 00:41:59,286
It's normal when the storm hits.

419
00:41:59,701 --> 00:42:01,446
It feels like we're really cast away.

420
00:42:01,914 --> 00:42:02,914
Phim.

421
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:07,166
Can I use your mobile phone?

422
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:08,886
Sure.

423
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,326
My phone is dead too.

424
00:42:42,366 --> 00:42:45,126
(Gade)

425
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:54,246
Hello, my dear friend. You disappeared with your man.

426
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:02,526
Un, what's wrong?

427
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,115
Kuer proposed to me.

428
00:43:05,222 --> 00:43:07,959
What? Really? When?

429
00:43:08,173 --> 00:43:10,231
(This is not good. I need to lose weight.)

430
00:43:10,351 --> 00:43:11,926
I'll be the bridesmaid.

431
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:15,526
By the way, does Kuer have some handsome friends?

432
00:43:15,653 --> 00:43:18,846
I might get a boyfriend the day my friend gets married.

433
00:43:21,506 --> 00:43:23,166
Hey...

434
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,366
What about the guy in America?

435
00:43:29,245 --> 00:43:31,406
I never wanted to date Tony.

436
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:34,974
I always tell him we're just friends.

437
00:43:35,903 --> 00:43:40,617
Okay. Then about that proposal, did you say yes?

438
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:43,286
Surely. I can tell.

439
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:47,806
I did. He proposed to me a while ago.

440
00:43:49,206 --> 00:43:50,966
And I said yes,

441
00:43:52,158 --> 00:43:54,126
but now he has gone out with Phim.

442
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:55,446
Crap!

443
00:44:09,526 --> 00:44:11,326
Manager!

444
00:44:16,206 --> 00:44:18,166
Manager!

445
00:44:19,998 --> 00:44:22,821
- What's wrong?  - There's a boat at the harbor.

446
00:44:23,062 --> 00:44:24,886
That boat wasn't on schedule?

447
00:44:25,014 --> 00:44:28,086
No. I was on patrol as usual.

448
00:44:28,246 --> 00:44:29,766
I saw a boat parked there.

449
00:44:29,894 --> 00:44:32,586
At first, I thought it was our guest's boat.

450
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:34,406
I didn't pay attention to it.

451
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,246
On my way back, I saw that it was still there.

452
00:44:37,406 --> 00:44:39,086
So I went inside to check.

453
00:44:39,525 --> 00:44:41,134
What? Did you find anything?

454
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:42,646
Yes.

455
00:45:14,268 --> 00:45:17,526
Are you all right? I took the earliest flight.

456
00:45:18,932 --> 00:45:20,166
Thanks.

457
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:23,206
Kuer didn't come home last night?

458
00:45:28,174 --> 00:45:30,686
They left together, but where did they go?

459
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,006
I'm not sure.

460
00:45:34,286 --> 00:45:36,606
I can't reach him even now.

461
00:45:38,246 --> 00:45:40,806
It's okay. I'm here now.

462
00:47:02,446 --> 00:47:03,966
You should wait outside, Phim.

463
00:47:08,382 --> 00:47:11,686
I called the police. They will be here soon.

464
00:47:13,558 --> 00:47:14,846
Let's go.

465
00:47:31,021 --> 00:47:32,766
You said you came to comfort your friend.

466
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:34,766
I have work to do too.

467
00:47:34,957 --> 00:47:36,957
My boss is acting as if I owe him money.

468
00:47:37,077 --> 00:47:38,486
He chases me day and night.

469
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,766
Maybe he was a dog in his previous life.

470
00:47:48,477 --> 00:47:49,846
Good morning, San.

471
00:47:53,993 --> 00:47:57,566
I'll be there. See you at the harbor.

472
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:01,366
What's wrong?

473
00:48:01,526 --> 00:48:05,846
Kuer's friend said Noot was found dead in a boat.

474
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:14,886
(Prawing)

475
00:48:17,462 --> 00:48:18,686
What is it, Wing?

476
00:48:20,787 --> 00:48:22,006
Father.

477
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:26,926
The resort called and said Noot was found dead on Phiman Island.

478
00:48:31,046 --> 00:48:32,366
Is it really him?

479
00:48:33,526 --> 00:48:35,206
Yes, Father.

480
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,620
Prang.

481
00:48:50,948 --> 00:48:52,366
Get me the earliest flight.

482
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,166
Postpone all meetings today.

483
00:48:56,206 --> 00:48:59,486
Prepare a boat for me. I'm going to Phiman Island.

484
00:49:01,366 --> 00:49:02,606
Miss Sita.

485
00:49:29,686 --> 00:49:31,046
Are you Miss Sita?

486
00:49:32,526 --> 00:49:33,646
Yes.

487
00:49:33,925 --> 00:49:35,366
This way please, officer.

488
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,766
Whoa!

489
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,686
This is better than the show I'm writing.

490
00:49:45,925 --> 00:49:47,646
She's crying for her husband,

491
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:50,766
but deep inside, she wants to celebrate.

492
00:49:50,918 --> 00:49:52,666
She's looking forward to getting a new one.

493
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:15,126
Un.

494
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,566
I'm sorry about Noot.

495
00:50:24,406 --> 00:50:25,566
Okay.

496
00:50:28,646 --> 00:50:29,846
Last night,

497
00:50:30,206 --> 00:50:32,206
Phim asked me to drive her here.

498
00:50:32,486 --> 00:50:33,966
You don't have to explain.

499
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:36,846
Didn't I tell you

500
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,886
I don't want you to show a soft spot for her again?

501
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:41,326
You just couldn't bring yourself to say no.

502
00:50:42,726 --> 00:50:43,886
I did say no.

503
00:50:44,204 --> 00:50:46,806
I really wanted to go back to you last night.

504
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:50,128
The storm was very severe.

505
00:50:50,286 --> 00:50:51,606
So you couldn't come home?

506
00:50:54,869 --> 00:50:56,646
I think you should take care of Phim.

507
00:50:57,501 --> 00:50:59,501
Her husband died unexpectedly.

508
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:01,166
It's hard to cope with this.

509
00:51:01,956 --> 00:51:03,046
Un.

510
00:51:05,902 --> 00:51:07,026
Hey.

511
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:09,126
Is she mad?

512
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:14,246
I'd be mad too.

513
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:19,766
I know. I have to make up with her.

514
00:51:24,286 --> 00:51:25,646
Did he try to make up with you?

515
00:51:27,044 --> 00:51:28,686
Will you forgive him?

516
00:52:01,477 --> 00:52:02,477
Rit.

517
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:05,891
How did it go?

518
00:52:06,203 --> 00:52:07,886
Did you talk to Noot last night?

519
00:52:08,062 --> 00:52:09,926
- Did you?  - Just a little, Mom.

520
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:13,606
When you left, Noot opened the door. He was going out.

521
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,966
How was he acting?

522
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:19,966
He acted odd. He looked upset.

523
00:52:21,998 --> 00:52:23,998
I saw him carrying a gun.

524
00:52:24,734 --> 00:52:26,206
A gun?

525
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:29,331
- Yes.  - He said he was going to see Phim at the resort.

526
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,646
It was my fault.

527
00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:37,086
I told Noot I saw Phim and Kuer leave together.

528
00:52:38,758 --> 00:52:41,646
What? When Noot found out

529
00:52:42,014 --> 00:52:43,886
that Kuer left with Phim,

530
00:52:44,046 --> 00:52:46,806
he picked up a gun and followed them to the resort?

531
00:52:48,397 --> 00:52:49,486
Yes.

532
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,450
Is the boat ready?

533
00:53:02,581 --> 00:53:04,326
It's ready, Father.

534
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:14,006
You don't have an alibi on the other side.

535
00:53:14,174 --> 00:53:16,686
You're as much a suspect as Phim is.

536
00:53:17,116 --> 00:53:18,366
Also,

537
00:53:18,518 --> 00:53:21,086
you had problems with him before.

538
00:53:21,606 --> 00:53:23,486
That counts as motivation.

539
00:53:24,206 --> 00:53:27,766
Looking at the wounds and evidence at the scene, it's also possible

540
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:29,766
that he committed suicide.

541
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,150
- I didn't do it.  - I know.

542
00:53:34,934 --> 00:53:37,198
I want you out of this too.

543
00:53:37,526 --> 00:53:39,446
It depends on the evidence

544
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:41,606
and autopsy.

545
00:53:42,709 --> 00:53:43,886
Wait.

546
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:50,086
I need to see my grandson.

547
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,206
Noot!

548
00:54:16,691 --> 00:54:18,702
Noot!

549
00:54:44,726 --> 00:54:46,366
I don't care what you do.

550
00:54:47,437 --> 00:54:50,246
Just find the person who murdered my grandson.

551
00:54:58,846 --> 00:55:00,206
Yes.

552
00:55:26,326 --> 00:55:28,766
(Everyone, it was reported this morning)

553
00:55:28,847 --> 00:55:31,614
(that a senior executive and heir to JP Corporation,)

554
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:34,166
(Mr. Chanoot Jangwangprawas, was found dead)

555
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:36,046
(in his private yacht.)

556
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:39,446
(The police are investigating the cause of death.)

557
00:55:39,565 --> 00:55:41,966
(The public is paying attention to Chanoot's news)

558
00:55:42,134 --> 00:55:46,046
(since he is the heir to JP Corporation, a huge company.)

559
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:02,166
Yes, Mom.

560
00:56:03,406 --> 00:56:05,126
I'm heading home after I'm done at the station.

561
00:56:05,398 --> 00:56:06,926
How is your grandfather?

562
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,466
He's not well,

563
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,710
but he tries to hide it as always.

564
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:12,926
Please take care of your grandfather.

565
00:56:13,414 --> 00:56:15,606
I don't think he would want me to.

566
00:56:15,981 --> 00:56:18,566
It's fine. It's just for now.

567
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:20,926
At least, you're his granddaughter.

568
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:24,406
Yes, Mom.

569
00:56:28,149 --> 00:56:30,149
This is some of the deceased's belonging.

570
00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:35,246
The rest will be kept as evidence for now.

571
00:57:00,158 --> 00:57:01,766
How long will the forensics take?

572
00:57:01,902 --> 00:57:03,806
It should be a couple of days.

573
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,686
Thanks.

574
00:57:35,733 --> 00:57:39,966
It might be as the police suspected.

575
00:57:41,053 --> 00:57:43,053
Noot committed suicide.

576
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:52,766
I don't believe that he committed suicide.

577
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,366
Noot was alone on that boat.

578
00:57:56,093 --> 00:57:58,486
It's hard to point this at someone else.

579
00:58:08,246 --> 00:58:09,726
You two leave.

580
00:58:11,035 --> 00:58:12,926
- Yes.  - Yes.

581
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:02,326
Hey! Your man is the reason Noot died.

582
00:59:02,463 --> 00:59:04,886
And you still dare to show up here?

583
00:59:05,926 --> 00:59:07,966
We still don't know how Noot died.

584
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:10,126
We don't know whether it's murder or suicide.

585
00:59:10,301 --> 00:59:13,446
If you're accusing me, I'll sue you.

586
00:59:13,534 --> 00:59:15,011
- You!  - Mom.

587
00:59:15,316 --> 00:59:16,846
My mom is still upset.

588
00:59:17,126 --> 00:59:18,526
Don't mind her.

589
00:59:21,246 --> 00:59:22,528
How is your grandfather, Rit?

590
00:59:22,647 --> 00:59:24,647
He can't cope with it.

591
00:59:27,926 --> 00:59:29,926
Un, come with me.

592
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:35,126
Just go. I'll be with your mom.

593
00:59:35,637 --> 00:59:38,726
Please stay with Gade, Mom. I'll be back for you.

594
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:13,166
What do you think would help me with this?

595
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:19,366
These are the photos I took while tailing Mr. Kuer on Mr. Noot's order.

596
01:00:30,037 --> 01:00:31,326
I followed him

597
01:00:31,566 --> 01:00:33,086
and found that those two

598
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:35,486
had been seeing an ob-gyn in Bangkok.

599
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:39,086
I think Miss Un remembers this.

600
01:00:40,205 --> 01:00:41,406
I do.

601
01:01:03,189 --> 01:01:05,646
- What about this?  - It's from the golf resort.

602
01:01:10,446 --> 01:01:13,006
I want you to work for me. What do you say?

603
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:23,621
I don't think Noot committed suicide.

604
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,566
I talked to him the other day.

605
01:01:26,742 --> 01:01:29,086
He didn't seem suicidal at all.

606
01:01:29,213 --> 01:01:30,526
Is that so?

607
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:32,190
Yes.

608
01:01:32,565 --> 01:01:34,326
He said he would be a better man

609
01:01:34,447 --> 01:01:36,166
and win Phim back.

610
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,326
I heard those two argue.

611
01:01:42,253 --> 01:01:43,846
Phim wanted a divorce.

612
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:49,886
The one who caused problems between them is

613
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:53,606
Mr. Kuer, right?

614
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:55,486
Yes.

615
01:01:56,149 --> 01:02:00,046
Kuer and Phim are probably having an affair behind Noot's back.

616
01:02:12,286 --> 01:02:13,446
Yes.

617
01:02:13,583 --> 01:02:15,126
Thank you, Grandmother.

618
01:02:17,078 --> 01:02:18,486
What did she say?

619
01:02:18,948 --> 01:02:20,566
She's worried.

620
01:02:20,964 --> 01:02:23,406
I was shot last time.

621
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:26,086
Now Noot is dead.

622
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:34,726
My grandmother is also worried about

623
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:37,726
Un and me.

624
01:02:41,606 --> 01:02:44,086
Are you going to keep her waiting here?

625
01:02:50,614 --> 01:02:52,366
She can't go home.

626
01:02:53,054 --> 01:02:56,966
She can't step foot in Jangwangprawas' house right now.

627
01:02:57,782 --> 01:03:00,446
So are you letting her stay here?

628
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:22,846
Kuer.

629
01:03:25,078 --> 01:03:28,286
You know I have cervical cancer, right?

630
01:03:29,422 --> 01:03:31,166
The results came back.

631
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:36,646
I think you should get your treatment soon.

632
01:03:36,886 --> 01:03:38,486
You can't leave it like this.

633
01:03:45,726 --> 01:03:49,446
Do you know why I'm not getting the treatment yet?

634
01:03:58,085 --> 01:03:59,286
I'm...

635
01:04:04,486 --> 01:04:06,046
I'm pregnant.

636
01:04:38,486 --> 01:04:39,966
If I get the treatment,

637
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:43,286
I risk a miscarriage.

638
01:04:43,653 --> 01:04:46,086
If you don't, you risk dying.

639
01:04:55,206 --> 01:04:56,526
Have you told Noot?

640
01:05:01,254 --> 01:05:04,966
I did earlier, and then we fought.

641
01:05:09,646 --> 01:05:12,766
He even thought it was your baby.

642
01:05:17,326 --> 01:05:18,686
I'll talk to Noot.

643
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:21,166
Noot needs to understand you.

644
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,886
He needs to understand that we are nothing more than friends.

645
01:05:37,071 --> 01:05:39,166
I don't have anyone left, Kuer.

646
01:05:43,131 --> 01:05:45,846
Since I got married,

647
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:51,406
my mom has gone abroad and never returned.

648
01:05:53,718 --> 01:05:57,406
She thinks I'm married to a rich man and

649
01:05:59,014 --> 01:06:01,726
my life would be happy.

650
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:10,566
I only have you.

651
01:06:15,894 --> 01:06:18,286
If you're leaving me too,

652
01:06:19,413 --> 01:06:21,886
I'd have no one left.

653
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:43,966
When you're alone,

654
01:06:46,021 --> 01:06:48,446
the world is not worth living for.

655
01:06:56,926 --> 01:06:58,766
Hey, what will you do?

656
01:06:59,918 --> 01:07:01,166
I don't know.

657
01:07:02,161 --> 01:07:04,366
Kuer!

658
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:06,766
Hey.

659
01:07:07,302 --> 01:07:11,606
The forensics said Mr. Noot might have committed suicide.

660
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:15,166
If you're lucky, you won't be suspected anymore.

661
01:07:16,294 --> 01:07:18,686
There are other explanations too.

662
01:07:55,326 --> 01:07:56,966
I'm here to get the things I need.

663
01:07:57,941 --> 01:08:00,086
Nok will come for the rest of it later.

664
01:08:10,126 --> 01:08:12,006
Keep it for a stupid woman

665
01:08:13,046 --> 01:08:14,966
or an evil woman who deserves you.

666
01:08:15,238 --> 01:08:17,406
Noot died because of those two.

667
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:20,646
We need to deal with them both.

668
01:08:21,629 --> 01:08:23,566
We can't let Noot die in vain.

669
01:08:24,278 --> 01:08:25,526
Un.

670
01:08:30,246 --> 01:08:32,686
Be happy together. Live your lives together.

671
01:08:32,822 --> 01:08:34,566
You can even get married. No one will stop you.

672
01:08:34,806 --> 01:08:38,486
The two of you will be murderers for the rest of your lives.
