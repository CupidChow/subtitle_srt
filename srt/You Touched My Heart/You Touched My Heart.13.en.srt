1
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:47,086
What's going on with Phim?

2
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:48,566
I don't know.

3
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,606
She didn't say whose baby it was.

4
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,046
This is Artit speaking.

5
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:09,806
The doctor wrote that she's 15 weeks into her pregnancy.

6
00:02:09,948 --> 00:02:11,526
What will you do about Tony?

7
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:15,366
Your grandfather wants to talk.

8
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:22,886
(Phim is pregnant with Noot's baby.)

9
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:28,046
The doctor wrote that HPV infections caused Phim's cancer.

10
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,766
She's 15 weeks into her pregnancy.

11
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,006
We went to the golf resort

12
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:33,846
just over two months ago.

13
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:37,206
That means the baby is Noot's,

14
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:39,006
as Kuer said.

15
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:44,006
(We don't know the gender.)

16
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:47,886
Mrs. Wan?

17
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,646
Mrs. Wan, are you okay?

18
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,286
Get some bowls to serve the curry.

19
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:56,390
- I'll get this myself.  - Okay.

20
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:08,406
(If it's a boy,)

21
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:11,246
(Un will be left with nothing again.)

22
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:16,646
Mom, did you get cut?

23
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:19,006
What did your grandfather say?

24
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:21,206
It's nothing, Mom.

25
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:23,486
I'll clean it up for you.

26
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,566
From what I heard from Phim,

27
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,646
it looked like someone was trying to hurt her.

28
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:39,366
Who?

29
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:41,686
There are a few possibilities.

30
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,686
The first one is you.

31
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:46,446
You know I didn't do it.

32
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,153
I know. That's why I excluded you from the list.

33
00:03:49,957 --> 00:03:53,846
Who else do you think could have done it?

34
00:03:56,155 --> 00:03:57,206
Un.

35
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,286
But from the evidence,

36
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:02,526
it's very unlikely.

37
00:04:03,822 --> 00:04:05,822
Another one is JP's chairman.

38
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:08,286
He's upset about you and Phim.

39
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:23,246
What are you smiling about?

40
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,126
Do you know who did it?

41
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:29,446
You could ask her if she did it.

42
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:46,366
- Good evening.  - Un, good evening.

43
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:50,246
I'll head home.

44
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:51,526
Sa is waiting to eat with me.

45
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:53,243
Are you going home already, San?

46
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:55,871
Please ask her for me.

47
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,686
I'll need you to give him a ride home.

48
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,926
I have to go now. Bye.

49
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,526
Why did you agree to see me?

50
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:33,589
You kept your promise.

51
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,926
Actually, I believed you this morning.

52
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:44,926
If I told everyone you had nothing to do with Phim,

53
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,934
nobody would believe me without evidence.

54
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,126
I understand.

55
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:53,606
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:58,126
I didn't tell you when I jumped in the ambulance with her.

57
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:07,126
That actually shocked me.

58
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:19,286
I love you.

59
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:25,166
When I saw you with Tony,

60
00:06:26,373 --> 00:06:29,206
I got mad at myself that I couldn't keep you.

61
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:33,686
I just thought I'd do everything

62
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:36,126
to win you back.

63
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,846
(You're the one who touched my heart.)

64
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,766
(No one else comes above you.)

65
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:47,526
(You're my precious thing.)

66
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:51,166
(I'll keep you well, close to my heart.)

67
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:55,206
(Only you are the one.)

68
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:59,046
(Nobody else means a thing.)

69
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:02,806
(Only you are in my heart.)

70
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:04,975
(No matter how long,)

71
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:10,006
(my love is only for you.)

72
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:25,606
(You're the one who touched my heart.)

73
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:29,446
(No one else comes above you.)

74
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:32,168
(You're my precious thing.)

75
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,966
Thank you for giving me a ride home.

76
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,766
You're most welcome.

77
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:41,086
(Only you are the one.)

78
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,326
(Nobody else means a thing.)

79
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:46,911
(Only you are in my heart.)

80
00:07:47,094 --> 00:07:48,486
I have to head inside.

81
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:50,926
(No matter how long...)

82
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:52,326
Okay.

83
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,046
Why aren't you going in?

84
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,581
I want you to go in with me.

85
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,406
I can't. I need to go home tonight.

86
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:15,086
Okay.

87
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:20,886
Come.

88
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:27,566
Drive safely.

89
00:08:27,693 --> 00:08:29,046
Goodnight.

90
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:37,966
(Kuerkhun)

91
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:44,446
(Kuer.)

92
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,206
(Do you miss me?)

93
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:47,633
No.

94
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:50,886
I thought you'd make a U-turn and come back here.

95
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:54,326
(I forgot. What did San tell you to ask me?)

96
00:09:55,454 --> 00:10:00,366
Yeah. It's about Phim's accident when she drove off the road today.

97
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:06,246
She told San that someone was trying to chase her.

98
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:09,086
(She needed to dodge them. That's why she lost control.)

99
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,646
(San said someone was trying to hurt her.)

100
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:14,526
(I told him I'd ask you.)

101
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:16,166
(I know you didn't do it.)

102
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:18,566
Just drive safely, okay?

103
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:20,646
Okay.

104
00:10:26,555 --> 00:10:29,639
(- Just drive safely, okay?  - Okay.)

105
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,046
Miss Un snuck out to see Mr. Kuer.

106
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:36,566
Thanks.

107
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,926
Miss Sita.

108
00:11:21,677 --> 00:11:23,126
Have you decided?

109
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:25,966
Yes.

110
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:29,726
Tell me what happened.

111
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,406
Si.

112
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:48,326
Why are you so late today?

113
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:50,766
I was stuck at work a bit.

114
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:53,206
And I stopped by to buy some food.

115
00:11:53,318 --> 00:11:54,646
Let's eat, shall we?

116
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:58,406
This is from your favorite place. It's chocolate mousse cake. Want some?

117
00:12:00,228 --> 00:12:01,446
No.

118
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:07,766
When will the doctor let me leave?

119
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:11,429
They need to make sure you're okay before they let you go.

120
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,134
Why else would they keep you?

121
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:19,326
You're bored, right? You're in bed all day.

122
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:22,446
Should I roll you out in a wheelchair?

123
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:29,726
The doctor asked me about the treatment this morning.

124
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:35,926
I think you should get yourself treated.

125
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,904
You can have a baby later.

126
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:39,366
I asked the doctor

127
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:43,206
if I could avoid treatment to keep the baby.

128
00:13:12,664 --> 00:13:13,664
Nok.

129
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:15,411
Give me the key to Noot's room.

130
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:18,366
I want to see if the room needs cleaning up.

131
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:20,326
I don't have the key to that room, Mrs. Wing.

132
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,086
You don't? Ask for it from your boss, then.

133
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:24,846
What do you want, Mrs. Wing?

134
00:13:28,646 --> 00:13:31,406
I want the key to Noot's room.

135
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:34,846
I think it's time to clean it up.

136
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:38,846
The police told us to lock it up.

137
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:40,606
No one is allowed in.

138
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:43,966
Nobody has been there. You wouldn't mind a little dust, would you?

139
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,046
(Artit)

140
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:55,886
Suit yourself.

141
00:13:56,683 --> 00:13:59,446
You're the one in charge of cleaning, aren't you?

142
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,686
How did it go? Did the baby survive?

143
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,166
The baby is alive.

144
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,366
That wench sure is hard to kill.

145
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:15,126
Don't worry, Mrs. Wing.

146
00:14:15,398 --> 00:14:17,398
I don't leave my job unfinished.

147
00:14:17,518 --> 00:14:18,806
Just do it quickly.

148
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,446
Yes.

149
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:39,766
Thanks.

150
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:42,126
Your mind is made up.

151
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:43,886
What else can I say?

152
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:48,006
I just need you not to turn your back on me.

153
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:52,486
Did you tell your mom about this?

154
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,470
I didn't.

155
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,926
Do you think you'll tell her?

156
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:16,006
Noot will make you rich for the rest of your life, Phim.

157
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:17,966
You would realize that

158
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,006
if you think with your brain.

159
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,157
Kuer is nice to me, Mom.

160
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,246
This is grade two maths.

161
00:15:33,286 --> 00:15:34,886
A hundred million divided by three,

162
00:15:35,374 --> 00:15:37,086
that's over 30 million.

163
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:40,086
If there's no one to split that 100 million with,

164
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:42,046
you'll get the whole 100 million.

165
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:47,486
If you choose Kuer, who has to share his inheritance,

166
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:51,086
and leave Noot, the only heir to Jangwangprawas,

167
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:54,406
if that's not stupid, I don't know what is.

168
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:58,046
Do you prefer Noot just because he's richer?

169
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,366
It's not just wealth.

170
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:05,726
I know

171
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,966
how scary it is to be poor.

172
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,206
I've lived through poverty all my life.

173
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:14,868
I don't want my only daughter,

174
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:19,046
whom I raised, to suffer the same fate.

175
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:25,846
Okay, Mom.

176
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:36,726
Trust me.

177
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:39,806
Love can't feed you.

178
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:49,045
Do I have to tell her just to get scolded?

179
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:53,126
Also, my mom has moved abroad permanently.

180
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:55,086
She's never coming back.

181
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:57,366
I think she'll definitely come.

182
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,166
She loves you so much.

183
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:07,646
Phim, tell your mother.

184
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,406
At least you will have someone to fight for you.

185
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,007
Have some cold orange juice.

186
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:23,246
Thanks.

187
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:33,526
I think my grandfather suspects that I've been seeing you.

188
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:36,014
Should we tell him honestly?

189
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:38,806
Do you want me to tell him honestly?

190
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,046
He thinks you had an affair with Phim. That's the reason Noot died.

191
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:46,846
Do you think he would change his mind?

192
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,326
We won't know until we try.

193
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,806
He asked me about you yesterday.

194
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:00,886
He asked if I was dating you again.

195
00:18:02,326 --> 00:18:03,526
And

196
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:06,446
what did you say to him?

197
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:18,926
Un.

198
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:21,446
Come with me now.

199
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,886
Un left early this morning.

200
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,926
She seemed okay yesterday.

201
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:41,486
But today, it feels like she's back to where she was.

202
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:44,726
Why?

203
00:18:44,854 --> 00:18:46,286
I don't know.

204
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,086
I think you need to ask Un.

205
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,766
I myself

206
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:54,766
don't want to go back to being just a friend to her.

207
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:00,966
I'm off.

208
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:07,846
Tony.

209
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,166
Let's go see Un.

210
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,406
You brought me to JP's office?

211
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:30,126
I want to speak to your grandfather.

212
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,166
I have proof that I didn't sleep with Phim now.

213
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:35,886
I'm not Phim and Noot's homewrecker.

214
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:38,126
And I want to date you.

215
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,246
Are you hesitating?

216
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:11,006
I'm not hesitating at all.

217
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:13,126
Even if your grandfather kicks me out,

218
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:14,676
even if he won't listen,

219
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:17,206
I'll keep trying until he listens.

220
00:21:03,486 --> 00:21:04,806
Trust me.

221
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:19,166
Rit.

222
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,446
Mr. Kuer is here to see Mr. Chairman.

223
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:23,846
He came here with Miss Un.

224
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:28,686
Escort him out right now!

225
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:31,646
I want to explain.

226
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:33,126
I have evidence about Phim.

227
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,766
Why would I listen to you?

228
00:21:34,957 --> 00:21:37,126
You can't even listen to your own family!

229
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,126
I want you to listen to Kuer, Grandfather.

230
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:40,846
He has nothing to do with Noot's death.

231
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:43,661
You want him as your husband. You can say anything.

232
00:21:45,063 --> 00:21:50,086
At this point, I think you don't even remember what you promised me.

233
00:21:52,197 --> 00:21:53,686
I wasn't wrong.

234
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,726
A woman who lets emotion cloud her judgment

235
00:21:59,062 --> 00:22:00,686
is not suited to lead.

236
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:02,166
That has nothing to do with this.

237
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:03,726
Nothing?

238
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:06,566
It has everything to do with this!

239
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:10,006
The day you turned your back on Jangwangprawas,

240
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:11,966
you hated me.

241
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:15,006
You said you would never step foot here again.

242
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,606
Wasn't that because of emotion?

243
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:24,166
Your emotion when that man beside you betrayed you

244
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:28,086
made you turn back on your word and come back to work here

245
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:30,646
just to get payback against the man who betrayed you.

246
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:34,686
And then what?

247
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:36,846
You end up

248
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:39,766
believing him and getting back together with him.

249
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:44,046
If that's not emotion,

250
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,686
then this decision of yours,

251
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:49,246
what is it?

252
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:51,606
Is that all you're thinking?

253
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:56,046
You don't deserve to hold the future of JP Corporation.

254
00:22:56,629 --> 00:23:00,926
In the next meeting, I'll tell the board that you failed your trial!

255
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:04,126
We need to replace you with someone else!

256
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:08,246
I don't think you need to say anything.

257
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:45,406
What do you want?

258
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:47,598
I want to talk about the joint venture.

259
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:50,486
If this is not a good time, I'll come back later.

260
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,006
What joint venture?

261
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:55,726
We canceled the joint venture with C-Itsara.

262
00:23:55,918 --> 00:24:00,006
I think the five other small docks are interesting options.

263
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:01,670
We're a big business.

264
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:05,126
Everyone wants a joint venture with us. Don't mind those guys.

265
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:07,966
They just want a share of our clients.

266
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:10,566
There are advantages we overlooked.

267
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:13,646
What?

268
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:18,846
One of them owns a small dock not far from us.

269
00:24:19,198 --> 00:24:21,566
He wants to join a big business like ours

270
00:24:21,742 --> 00:24:25,006
to provide his clients with better facilities.

271
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:27,766
He wants to expand, but he can't.

272
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,526
That's why he wants to join us.

273
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,486
He's willing to give us a share of his profit.

274
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,566
How did I overlook that?

275
00:24:57,781 --> 00:25:01,486
Did you accept the Vice President position to get revenge against me?

276
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:06,166
Didn't you consider the possibility that I'm innocent?

277
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,213
Everything suggests that you and Phim...

278
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:09,662
Hooked up?

279
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:17,005
Do you still think that happened?

280
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:20,646
Do you still doubt it?

281
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,846
Do you still have doubts about Phim and me?

282
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:28,566
I'm sorry.

283
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:35,126
It's not your fault at all, Un.

284
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:37,926
I understand everything pointed to that idea.

285
00:25:38,934 --> 00:25:42,926
I just don't want anything to make you doubt me again.

286
00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:46,206
I don't want you to hate me.

287
00:25:58,534 --> 00:26:01,806
I'll try to talk to my grandfather tonight.

288
00:26:09,421 --> 00:26:11,421
What did Mr. Chairman say, Rit?

289
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,446
He's replacing Un

290
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:16,966
with me as Vice President.

291
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:19,486
Really?

292
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:23,286
Let's celebrate, shall we?

293
00:26:27,997 --> 00:26:30,566
Nam, about that night

294
00:26:33,182 --> 00:26:34,406
when Noot...

295
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:38,646
Trust me, please.

296
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:42,446
I would never get in your way.

297
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:06,006
I shouldn't have asked you to come.

298
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,806
I'm glad I saw that. I know now.

299
00:27:16,206 --> 00:27:19,526
Right? It's easier to get over her now.

300
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,006
Are you going back to America?

301
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:30,366
No, I'll be here for a bit.

302
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:34,566
You don't need to wait for Un anymore. Why would you stay?

303
00:27:36,773 --> 00:27:38,206
I'm done waiting.

304
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:41,165
I waited for Un for years.

305
00:27:41,607 --> 00:27:43,006
All I could do was wait.

306
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:47,766
Are you going to compete with Kuer?

307
00:27:47,974 --> 00:27:49,206
Yes.

308
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,166
It's better than giving up

309
00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:54,446
and leaving things unsaid and undone.

310
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,806
Just get some rest.

311
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:20,766
If I sleep too much, I won't be able to sleep tonight.

312
00:28:21,222 --> 00:28:22,366
Since you got pregnant,

313
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:25,486
you've been sleeping like a baby. There's no way you're staying up tonight.

314
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:36,886
Thank you.

315
00:28:38,702 --> 00:28:39,966
What are you thanking me for?

316
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:42,126
Why are you getting emotional?

317
00:28:43,118 --> 00:28:45,326
Thank you for not leaving me.

318
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,486
Without you, I'd have no one left.

319
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:08,206
You're lucky I'm still single.

320
00:29:08,422 --> 00:29:10,686
If I had a boyfriend, I wouldn't be here with you.

321
00:29:20,378 --> 00:29:24,206
You haven't told me what Grandfather said to you.

322
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:29,086
Tell me what happened.

323
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:31,086
It's true that Phim is pregnant.

324
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:34,406
Whose baby is it?

325
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:36,966
She didn't say.

326
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:41,166
That night, did Kuer and Phim stay at the resort? They didn't go anywhere?

327
00:29:43,254 --> 00:29:46,446
The power was out that night. No one was able to leave.

328
00:29:47,022 --> 00:29:51,166
I was at the front desk all night. I didn't see them leaving.

329
00:29:53,615 --> 00:29:55,486
Who is the father of the baby?

330
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:57,246
Is it a boy or a girl?

331
00:30:03,326 --> 00:30:05,726
I told him what you told me to say.

332
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:11,046
That will make him anxious. Believe me.

333
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:15,206
Mr. Chairman seems very interested in you.

334
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,406
He can't remain patient for long.

335
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,086
If it turns out to be a boy in a few weeks,

336
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:25,366
he will be even more anxious.

337
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,486
I was right

338
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:31,846
to forego the treatment and keep the baby.

339
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:36,966
At least I can hold the baby hostage.

340
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:39,086
It would allow me back into House Jangwangprawas.

341
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,286
I will be able to stay there without shame.

342
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:45,886
Kan.

343
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:51,046
Aren't you driving Un today?

344
00:30:51,326 --> 00:30:54,206
No. Miss Un is not at the office today.

345
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,046
Where is she?

346
00:30:56,237 --> 00:30:57,846
I don't know.

347
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,366
Mr. Chairman asked me to run an errand for him.

348
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:02,366
I see.

349
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:05,926
- Ma'am.  - Gade.

350
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,046
Where is Un?

351
00:31:12,013 --> 00:31:13,806
She's with Kuer.

352
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:22,966
Tell me what happened between Un and Kuer.

353
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:24,846
I don't know, ma'am.

354
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,366
Why not?

355
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:28,566
You said Un was with Kuer.

356
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:32,246
I just happened to see them at the office.

357
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:34,566
JP's office?

358
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:39,086
I saw Un walk in there.

359
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:41,908
I don't know why Kuer went there with her.

360
00:31:47,732 --> 00:31:51,366
I think JP's chairman won't stand for this.

361
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,806
- I know.  - Mr. Chanoot's case

362
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:57,366
has absolutely nothing to do with you, right?

363
00:31:57,518 --> 00:31:58,806
Nothing, Grandmother.

364
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:02,431
I think I need to talk to San.

365
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:03,886
I'll need to ask him

366
00:32:03,982 --> 00:32:07,846
if you can come to Bangkok for a few days.

367
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:11,446
That road leads to the fisherman's village?

368
00:32:11,582 --> 00:32:14,046
Yes, sir. It's a dead end.

369
00:32:14,413 --> 00:32:16,206
Very few people use that road.

370
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:19,726
What about the DNA on the hair?

371
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:21,326
We have preliminary results.

372
00:32:21,518 --> 00:32:25,166
The structure of the hair strand doesn't match the victim.

373
00:32:26,517 --> 00:32:29,846
- What else do you know?  - The hair strand has no root.

374
00:32:30,037 --> 00:32:32,246
We need to test for mitochondria DNA.

375
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:34,406
That will take some time.

376
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:38,726
That means someone else was on the boat with the victim.

377
00:32:39,606 --> 00:32:40,926
We need to figure out who it was.

378
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:44,606
Should we summon all suspects and get their DNA?

379
00:32:44,806 --> 00:32:46,126
Don't do that yet.

380
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:49,958
I don't want the culprit to find out about this piece of evidence.

381
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:10,006
I wanted to talk to you, San.

382
00:33:10,253 --> 00:33:12,446
I have a favor to ask, Mrs. Kamalas.

383
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:25,726
Is Un back?

384
00:33:25,886 --> 00:33:26,966
Yes, sir.

385
00:33:27,102 --> 00:33:29,686
I asked you to follow Sita today. Did she talk to Phim?

386
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:31,446
She didn't say anything, sir.

387
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:46,206
When will the doctor let me leave?

388
00:33:46,414 --> 00:33:48,966
They need to make sure you're okay

389
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,574
before they let you go. Why else would they keep you?

390
00:33:58,139 --> 00:33:59,646
The baby is alive.

391
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,726
Don't worry, Mrs. Wing.

392
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:04,446
I don't leave my job unfinished.

393
00:34:35,637 --> 00:34:38,926
Please park the car for me and leave the key in the house.

394
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:41,987
What is it, my dear? What happened?

395
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,366
Grandfather is replacing Un.

396
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,966
That's great news!

397
00:34:48,093 --> 00:34:50,886
I saw Un waiting for your grandfather.

398
00:34:51,102 --> 00:34:55,246
That means something's going down this afternoon.

399
00:34:55,486 --> 00:34:56,926
Let's go!

400
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,166
I didn't say anything without evidence.

401
00:35:03,749 --> 00:35:06,406
If you see the evidence that Kuer brought,

402
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:08,246
you'd understand more.

403
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:13,126
Evidence in writing

404
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,526
compared to the photos Kan took,

405
00:35:15,742 --> 00:35:17,806
what is more convincing?

406
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,926
They might have been hooking up since long ago without you knowing.

407
00:35:21,124 --> 00:35:22,446
It's impossible.

408
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:25,006
Phim has cancer, and she's infected with HPV.

409
00:35:33,293 --> 00:35:35,446
Does that mean they can't hook up?

410
00:35:36,406 --> 00:35:39,886
You're a fool to believe a guy's lie over and over again!

411
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:45,366
There's a reason everything is what it is today, and Noot died.

412
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:47,086
You're part of the reason too.

413
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:52,326
Don't talk nonsense.

414
00:35:52,557 --> 00:35:53,926
Is that not true?

415
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,725
You spoiled Noot all his life.

416
00:35:56,877 --> 00:35:58,646
He was never wrong to you.

417
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,126
Noot kept womanizing after he got married.

418
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:05,606
Did you ever warn him?

419
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:08,726
Right now, Phim is pregnant.

420
00:36:08,974 --> 00:36:10,846
That's Noot's baby.

421
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,086
Phim is 15 weeks into her pregnancy.

422
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:18,966
The golf resort incident was not that long ago.

423
00:36:20,574 --> 00:36:22,886
That baby is certainly Noot's.

424
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:25,726
It's an heir of Jangwangprawas.

425
00:36:33,077 --> 00:36:35,606
Ma'am, don't stress out.

426
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,246
I think Un thought about it carefully.

427
00:36:39,182 --> 00:36:41,006
I think she didn't think at all.

428
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:44,646
Oh well...

429
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:49,166
Are you here to see if your daughter is fired or not?

430
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:52,246
You were bragging the other day

431
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:54,846
that Un is talented.

432
00:36:57,605 --> 00:36:59,966
You've been waiting for this opportunity, Mrs. Wing.

433
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:02,046
What opportunity?

434
00:37:02,405 --> 00:37:04,926
An opportunity for Rit to be Vice President.

435
00:37:08,757 --> 00:37:10,757
If we're talking about capabilities,

436
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:13,798
it's obvious who Father will choose.

437
00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:16,846
- You and your big mouth!  - Mom, calm down!

438
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:18,581
Let me go!

439
00:37:18,662 --> 00:37:21,286
I understand you, Aunt Wan. I'm sorry it turned out this way.

440
00:37:21,462 --> 00:37:25,006
I think Un is smart and capable of replacing Noot.

441
00:37:25,149 --> 00:37:27,566
Let me go! Why would you praise her?

442
00:37:29,686 --> 00:37:31,686
Someone like you and your daughter

443
00:37:32,094 --> 00:37:35,686
deserves to keep working in the kitchen.

444
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:40,606
Noot fooled around with countless women.

445
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:42,886
That's why Phim got infected.

446
00:37:43,781 --> 00:37:46,886
Phim is probably deciding whether to keep her child

447
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,926
or get an abortion for the cancer treatment.

448
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:54,726
What if her baby is a boy?

449
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,886
Are you telling me this because

450
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:07,971
you think I'm giving you a chance to stay

451
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,526
as Vice President after you broke your promise?

452
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,726
I can resign if that's what you want,

453
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:15,206
if you think me dating Kuer is wrong.

454
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:20,686
But who will love JP as much as a Jangwangprawas?

455
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,766
Without me, who would you want to run the company?

456
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:26,766
Do you want JP to die with you?

457
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:38,406
Grandfather?

458
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,006
Father?

459
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:42,171
Father!

460
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,126
Father!

461
00:38:44,341 --> 00:38:46,486
Mr. Chairman!

462
00:38:46,766 --> 00:38:49,046
- Father.  - Mr. Chairman.

463
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:50,934
Father...

464
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:53,366
What did you do to my father?

465
00:38:53,518 --> 00:38:55,326
What did you do to him?

466
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:56,774
Call an ambulance.

467
00:38:56,887 --> 00:38:58,644
Call the hospital quickly!

468
00:38:58,766 --> 00:39:00,246
Father!

469
00:39:00,914 --> 00:39:02,246
Mr. Chairman.

470
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,401
Why does Father have to fall sick right now?

471
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:23,126
He should have appointed a new Vice President first.

472
00:39:24,766 --> 00:39:26,766
We rushed him to the hospital.

473
00:39:27,005 --> 00:39:28,286
He'll be okay, Mom.

474
00:39:28,437 --> 00:39:30,846
How are you still calm?

475
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:35,886
If something happens to him, Un will certainly take over JP.

476
00:39:37,582 --> 00:39:39,606
What happened, Un?

477
00:39:41,573 --> 00:39:43,166
We were arguing, Mom.

478
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,046
Was it that heated?

479
00:39:51,885 --> 00:39:53,806
We need to wait and see what the doctor says.

480
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,566
Doctor.

481
00:39:55,846 --> 00:39:58,446
Doctor, how is my father doing?

482
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,006
He's lucky to arrive here quickly.

483
00:40:01,142 --> 00:40:04,446
He got here within four hours. He has a high chance of recovery.

484
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,166
I gave him blood pressure pills. His blood will be absorbed back.

485
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:12,406
There is a considerable amount of blood since he already has hypertension.

486
00:40:12,526 --> 00:40:14,886
If we can't maintain his blood pressure,

487
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:17,326
we might need surgery to remove the blood.

488
00:40:17,454 --> 00:40:18,966
If he's getting surgery,

489
00:40:19,158 --> 00:40:20,952
I'll need to inform his relatives.

490
00:40:21,141 --> 00:40:22,566
It's a high-risk operation.

491
00:40:22,678 --> 00:40:24,046
Will he be alright?

492
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,766
I will be able to answer when his condition stabilizes.

493
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:29,726
Please excuse me.

494
00:40:29,846 --> 00:40:31,206
Thank you so much.

495
00:40:35,508 --> 00:40:38,386
So you want Father to die, don't you?

496
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,133
Your daughter won't be fired without him.

497
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,606
Is that all you can think?

498
00:40:42,797 --> 00:40:44,966
Nobody wanted this to happen.

499
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,406
My position is not as important as his life.

500
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:48,886
Let's go, Mom.

501
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:57,406
Un, what do we do next?

502
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:01,286
I don't know.

503
00:41:02,037 --> 00:41:03,886
There will be chaos at work tomorrow.

504
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:07,126
So this means

505
00:41:07,286 --> 00:41:10,206
you'll be the acting chairman, right?

506
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:28,686
You can't sleep?

507
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:30,806
I can't.

508
00:41:35,221 --> 00:41:37,366
If something happens to your grandfather,

509
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:39,766
you will have even more enemies.

510
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:42,206
What do you mean?

511
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,966
Conflict of interest will follow.

512
00:41:45,405 --> 00:41:48,606
You have both the position in the company and his inheritance.

513
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:51,366
You mean Rit and Prawing, right?

514
00:41:53,581 --> 00:41:55,686
After Noot died,

515
00:41:55,862 --> 00:41:58,566
those two went into his room to get god-knows-what.

516
00:42:00,676 --> 00:42:02,686
That Vice President position,

517
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:04,446
Aunt Wing has been seeking it with malice.

518
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:06,886
I've been here for a short while, and I can see that.

519
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,157
I'm suspecting Rit too.

520
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:13,086
From what I see, he just has a crazy mother.

521
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:19,446
If Phim's kid is a boy and she's moving in,

522
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:22,573
you should move out.

523
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,766
If you stay, you'll go crazy.

524
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:28,206
Yeah.

525
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,981
About Kuer and Tony...

526
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:34,606
If you're getting back with Kuer,

527
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,830
you should tell Tony honestly.

528
00:42:37,366 --> 00:42:39,006
I feel sorry for him.

529
00:44:10,406 --> 00:44:12,126
Take care of yourself, my dear.

530
00:44:17,716 --> 00:44:21,046
At least I can rest easy, knowing that you will have a good life.

531
00:44:23,966 --> 00:44:26,526
Call me if you want to talk.

532
00:44:27,061 --> 00:44:28,726
This is my number.

533
00:44:31,077 --> 00:44:33,077
Are you not coming back?

534
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:36,366
You're set for life.

535
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:38,126
Why would I come back here again?

536
00:44:40,997 --> 00:44:43,406
You and Noot

537
00:44:43,582 --> 00:44:45,806
can travel and visit me there.

538
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:49,886
- Can I tag along?  - Of course.

539
00:44:51,013 --> 00:44:54,486
Have a baby soon. Have a boy and bring him to see me.

540
00:45:06,118 --> 00:45:07,188
Goodbye, Mom.

541
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:08,326
Have a safe trip.

542
00:45:08,454 --> 00:45:09,726
I'll leave Phim with you.

543
00:45:21,766 --> 00:45:23,286
I envy your mom.

544
00:45:25,126 --> 00:45:26,806
She wants me to marry

545
00:45:27,381 --> 00:45:29,166
so that she can stop worrying about me.

546
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,126
- Who's that?  - It's me, Rit.

547
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,126
Come in, son.

548
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:19,309
Have you checked Noot's room for me?

549
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,806
Wan keeps the key.

550
00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:25,859
Why?

551
00:46:26,157 --> 00:46:27,686
Is it important?

552
00:46:28,556 --> 00:46:29,926
A bit.

553
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:33,206
How so?

554
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,886
If I am to convince the board I'm capable,

555
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:40,806
I need to know what Noot was thinking and planning so I can explain it.

556
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,799
If I get that information,

557
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,446
I'll be able to do my homework before the meeting.

558
00:46:48,461 --> 00:46:52,326
You know what? Wan will probably be with your grandfather all day tomorrow.

559
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,126
I'll try to find a way in.

560
00:46:58,286 --> 00:46:59,606
One more thing.

561
00:46:59,973 --> 00:47:02,286
I think we can't trust Kan. He's Grandfather's guy.

562
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,766
While grandfather is still sick,

563
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:07,366
can you find a way to fire him?

564
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,606
Why? What about Kan?

565
00:47:10,013 --> 00:47:11,686
I think he's tailing me.

566
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:14,486
What are you afraid he will find?

567
00:47:14,726 --> 00:47:16,566
I saw him working for Noot.

568
00:47:16,949 --> 00:47:18,949
Now he's working for Grandfather.

569
00:47:19,093 --> 00:47:20,566
He drives Un's car.

570
00:47:21,324 --> 00:47:23,126
Do you think that's normal?

571
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,559
If he makes any mistake,

572
00:47:28,798 --> 00:47:30,686
I'll fire him on the spot.

573
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:38,406
Miss Un called for an urgent board meeting.

574
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:41,526
About what? Mr. Chairman didn't tell us.

575
00:47:42,037 --> 00:47:43,086
It's urgent.

576
00:47:43,182 --> 00:47:44,606
That's Miss Un's assistant.

577
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,726
Nam.

578
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:50,846
What is the urgent board meeting today about? Do you know?

579
00:47:56,366 --> 00:47:59,606
You called for a meeting without letting Rit know. Will that be a big deal?

580
00:48:00,118 --> 00:48:01,926
We'll see if it's a big deal.

581
00:48:02,326 --> 00:48:06,326
You said your assistant and Rit seem to be dating?

582
00:48:06,566 --> 00:48:08,346
I didn't let her know.

583
00:48:08,766 --> 00:48:12,166
I texted all the board members myself this morning.

584
00:48:12,918 --> 00:48:15,126
If those board members tell their assistants,

585
00:48:15,294 --> 00:48:17,046
Nam will find out immediately.

586
00:48:18,606 --> 00:48:20,126
That's what I want.

587
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:22,390
I'll see Rit's reaction to this.

588
00:48:28,095 --> 00:48:32,366
Are you starting a war the first day your grandfather got sick?

589
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,406
What? She called a board meeting herself?

590
00:48:35,516 --> 00:48:36,628
Yes.

591
00:48:36,726 --> 00:48:38,246
What is she planning to do?

592
00:48:38,438 --> 00:48:40,526
She didn't even say what the meeting was about.

593
00:48:40,638 --> 00:48:41,926
I have to go.

594
00:48:55,202 --> 00:48:57,366
I need your advice, Miss Un.

595
00:48:57,926 --> 00:49:00,126
Okay. Let's talk in the car. I can't be late.

596
00:49:00,366 --> 00:49:01,686
Un!

597
00:49:05,214 --> 00:49:07,006
Are you going to work or to see Grandfather?

598
00:49:07,246 --> 00:49:10,566
I'm heading to the office. I'll go to the hospital after work.

599
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:12,926
Ride with me, then.

600
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:16,526
We can visit Grandfather together. You don't need to find a parking spot.

601
00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:30,366
We can talk later.

602
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:41,823
The patient's condition is getting much better.

603
00:49:41,989 --> 00:49:45,326
The amount of blood has gone down. His blood pressure is now stable.

604
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:49,086
If this keeps up, I think he has a chance at a full recovery.

605
00:49:49,326 --> 00:49:51,166
It will take some time,

606
00:49:51,302 --> 00:49:52,886
but it's possible.

607
00:49:54,598 --> 00:49:56,598
He'll need physical therapy, right?

608
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,526
Yes. He will have difficulties walking and talking.

609
00:50:00,685 --> 00:50:03,246
He should get better in a few months.

610
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:06,206
Thank you so much, doctor.

611
00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:08,053
You're welcome.

612
00:50:22,493 --> 00:50:24,566
(Is he making a full recovery?)

613
00:50:33,806 --> 00:50:35,606
I need to apologize, Mrs. Kamalas,

614
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:37,566
for asking you to travel all the way here.

615
00:50:37,766 --> 00:50:40,006
This type of DNA test

616
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,366
requires a female relative of a suspect.

617
00:50:43,677 --> 00:50:45,486
If it takes Kuer

618
00:50:45,662 --> 00:50:47,846
off the list of suspects,

619
00:50:47,959 --> 00:50:49,886
I'm willing to do anything.

620
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,486
I'll drive you to Kuer's house later.

621
00:50:53,238 --> 00:50:54,755
Before we go home,

622
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,926
can you take me to visit Phim?

623
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:15,006
(Un: I'll continue the joint venture project.)

624
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:23,246
I have good news and bad news.

625
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:26,606
The bad news is

626
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:30,126
Mr. Chairman suffered a stroke last night.

627
00:51:33,238 --> 00:51:36,166
His condition and treatment have been positive, though.

628
00:51:36,421 --> 00:51:40,126
While the chairman is still recovering, who will be the acting president?

629
00:51:40,956 --> 00:51:43,566
I'll be the acting president myself.

630
00:51:47,861 --> 00:51:49,646
First, I want to inform you

631
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:53,086
that I want the joint venture with C-Itsara that was on hold

632
00:51:53,446 --> 00:51:54,886
to proceed forward.

633
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,126
Do you think you can just come in and do anything you want?

634
00:52:15,453 --> 00:52:18,046
Is Miss Un proceeding with the joint venture, Rit?

635
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:21,286
She is. I think that's her agenda.

636
00:52:21,646 --> 00:52:23,566
If she wants to be my enemy,

637
00:52:23,814 --> 00:52:25,246
so be it!

638
00:52:28,702 --> 00:52:30,326
Calm down, Rit.

639
00:52:30,806 --> 00:52:33,046
Calm down, Rit!

640
00:52:47,646 --> 00:52:49,246
Mrs. Wan.

641
00:52:49,789 --> 00:52:50,950
Good morning.

642
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,646
Is Un with you?

643
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,686
She's at work.

644
00:52:54,822 --> 00:52:56,326
At JP?

645
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:01,446
You came to the hospital alone. Are you sick?

646
00:53:02,886 --> 00:53:04,206
It's my father-in-law.

647
00:53:04,462 --> 00:53:05,686
He came in last night.

648
00:53:05,862 --> 00:53:08,726
What room is he in? Can I visit him?

649
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:11,446
He's in ICU. You can't visit him yet.

650
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:15,584
I'll tell him that you wish him a speedy recovery.

651
00:53:15,727 --> 00:53:18,726
Un will let you know when he gets better.

652
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:20,806
Thank you.

653
00:53:21,206 --> 00:53:22,446
Excuse me.

654
00:53:30,388 --> 00:53:33,606
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kamalas. The parking lot is packed.

655
00:53:33,767 --> 00:53:35,767
- It's okay.  - This way, please.

656
00:53:43,406 --> 00:53:44,846
It's this room, Mrs. Kamalas.

657
00:53:46,814 --> 00:53:50,247
Wait for me outside. I'll talk to Phim just briefly.

658
00:53:50,445 --> 00:53:51,966
Okay.

659
00:54:12,046 --> 00:54:14,806
Pregnant women sure sleep a lot.

660
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:27,926
Please wake up and talk to me.

661
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,410
Ma'am.

662
00:54:57,725 --> 00:54:58,846
Kuer?

663
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:05,166
Tony.

664
00:55:06,486 --> 00:55:07,806
Are you free?

665
00:55:08,598 --> 00:55:09,806
I am.

666
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:13,206
I took a vacation and flew to see you.

667
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:15,446
I don't have anything else to do.

668
00:55:29,966 --> 00:55:31,646
What will you do?

669
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:35,006
Un is choosing Kuer no matter what you do.

670
00:55:37,484 --> 00:55:39,006
I won't ask her again.

671
00:55:39,685 --> 00:55:41,206
What do you mean?

672
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:45,406
If I ask her to be with me, she will surely reject me.

673
00:55:47,423 --> 00:55:48,686
You know that well.

674
00:55:49,005 --> 00:55:51,686
I do. When Un finally chooses,

675
00:55:53,126 --> 00:55:54,686
she'll choose Kuer.

676
00:55:55,366 --> 00:55:59,526
My chance is still slim, as it has been for eight years.

677
00:56:01,749 --> 00:56:03,566
That's why I won't ask her.

678
00:56:05,293 --> 00:56:07,766
I'll consider Un saying she'll give me a chance

679
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:09,397
as what it is.

680
00:56:09,527 --> 00:56:10,886
So you'll just act like she's yours?

681
00:56:25,705 --> 00:56:26,886
Un.

682
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:31,101
For the past eight years,

683
00:56:31,893 --> 00:56:33,646
you've always been like this to me

684
00:56:35,477 --> 00:56:37,886
whenever I try to show you that I like you.

685
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:40,526
This time you gave me a chance, Un.

686
00:56:40,861 --> 00:56:42,846
Why are you still like this?

687
00:56:44,677 --> 00:56:47,326
You're acting like nothing ever happened between us.

688
00:57:05,086 --> 00:57:06,606
I'm sorry, Tony.

689
00:57:09,086 --> 00:57:10,446
Un.

690
00:57:11,774 --> 00:57:13,774
I've always been here for you,

691
00:57:14,126 --> 00:57:15,726
ever since we met.

692
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:29,933
Excuse me. Do you know where this room is?

693
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,606
- Which way?  - Oh, I know.

694
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,406
Turn to the left. Go straight.

695
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:35,486
Turn to the right, and go.

696
00:57:35,613 --> 00:57:36,886
Turn to the right again.

697
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:38,446
Okay. Thank you.

698
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:40,326
Professor, thank you.

699
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:43,806
Left or right? Straight or stairs? What is it exactly?

700
00:57:49,709 --> 00:57:51,046
Are you Thai?

701
00:57:52,029 --> 00:57:54,166
- Yeah.  - Can I help you?

702
00:57:54,284 --> 00:57:58,126
I need to go to this room. Which way is it?

703
00:57:58,326 --> 00:58:01,126
It's pretty far away. May I walk you there?.

704
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:02,326
Yes, please.

705
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:03,926
Is this your first day?

706
00:58:23,364 --> 00:58:24,606
Un.

707
00:59:15,269 --> 00:59:16,526
I waited.

708
00:59:17,062 --> 00:59:19,062
Even if you never gave me a chance,

709
00:59:19,317 --> 00:59:21,646
I never said I'd give up.

710
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:26,446
I waited eight years for this chance, Un.

711
00:59:26,794 --> 00:59:28,794
As soon as I get that chance,

712
00:59:29,174 --> 00:59:34,086
you change your mind because you think he's right for you?

713
00:59:54,134 --> 00:59:55,926
I just feel that

714
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:59,366
I love Kuer.

715
01:00:00,046 --> 01:00:01,046
Un.

716
01:00:03,006 --> 01:00:04,286
Un.

717
01:00:08,686 --> 01:00:09,846
Un.

718
01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:13,206
Do you know him well enough

719
01:00:14,222 --> 01:00:16,726
to love him without any second thought?

720
01:00:18,101 --> 01:00:20,206
Before him, I know

721
01:00:20,734 --> 01:00:22,734
you never gave anyone a chance

722
01:00:23,022 --> 01:00:25,022
because you didn't want to get hurt.

723
01:00:27,149 --> 01:00:29,686
What if we skip forward another eight years?

724
01:00:30,286 --> 01:00:32,806
Will he still be the right one for you?

725
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,166
I've been here for you for eight years.

726
01:00:38,717 --> 01:00:41,046
If you don't feel that I'm right for you,

727
01:00:43,254 --> 01:00:46,726
you wouldn't have given me a chance that day.

728
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:02,806
Let's go, San. We'll head to Kuer's house.

729
01:01:03,114 --> 01:01:04,620
Okay, Mrs. Kamalas. This way, please.

730
01:01:07,821 --> 01:01:08,886
What did they talk about?

731
01:01:09,071 --> 01:01:10,486
Thank you.

732
01:01:25,206 --> 01:01:26,206
Phim.

733
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,400
Why did Kuer's grandmother come here?

734
01:01:36,886 --> 01:01:38,126
What's wrong?

735
01:01:38,424 --> 01:01:40,166
What happened? Why are you crying?

736
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:47,486
She asked how much money I wanted

737
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:51,966
for me to leave Kuer alone.

738
01:01:53,486 --> 01:01:55,206
Whose baby is it?

739
01:01:58,123 --> 01:02:00,606
Why do you want to know?

740
01:02:00,954 --> 01:02:04,406
Do you wonder if it's Kuer's?

741
01:02:05,794 --> 01:02:07,646
Why would I think that?

742
01:02:09,984 --> 01:02:12,246
When Kuer and I dated,

743
01:02:12,405 --> 01:02:13,926
you used to love me.

744
01:02:14,107 --> 01:02:15,766
You were nice to me.

745
01:02:16,446 --> 01:02:19,447
If Kuer and I get back together and have a child,

746
01:02:19,591 --> 01:02:21,486
I think you would be happy.

747
01:02:22,242 --> 01:02:25,286
I know that my grandson will never get back together with you.

748
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:30,166
I asked about your baby because I wonder

749
01:02:30,365 --> 01:02:32,286
whether someone like you

750
01:02:32,406 --> 01:02:34,606
know who the father is.

751
01:02:35,873 --> 01:02:38,286
Did you fool around so much that you couldn't remember?

752
01:02:41,933 --> 01:02:44,286
I came by today

753
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,286
to tell you to leave Kuer alone.

754
01:02:47,928 --> 01:02:50,246
My grandson is a good man.

755
01:02:50,526 --> 01:02:53,766
He definitely doesn't have what it takes to kick you

756
01:02:53,889 --> 01:02:55,606
out of his life!

757
01:02:56,594 --> 01:02:58,446
He thinks that you

758
01:02:58,584 --> 01:03:00,246
are a poor thing.

759
01:03:01,914 --> 01:03:03,126
Honestly,

760
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:06,566
I think you're more pathetic than poor.

761
01:03:08,068 --> 01:03:10,806
Your husband died, and you're chasing a new man.

762
01:03:10,991 --> 01:03:13,326
You're afraid you'd have nowhere to go because you're

763
01:03:13,554 --> 01:03:16,206
just an in-law, not an heir.

764
01:03:17,223 --> 01:03:19,526
I'm not chasing a new man.

765
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:21,904
I had meant to divorce Noot and get back with Kuer,

766
01:03:22,017 --> 01:03:23,711
but Noot just died before I could.

767
01:03:25,307 --> 01:03:27,307
You already had a husband,

768
01:03:27,402 --> 01:03:30,086
and yet you tried to get with another man

769
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,126
without getting a divorce first.

770
01:03:34,334 --> 01:03:36,846
It's wrong just to think that way.

771
01:03:40,446 --> 01:03:44,086
Ma'am, you're not me. You don't understand.

772
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,566
I do.

773
01:03:47,646 --> 01:03:50,286
Especially now that Chanoot is not with you,

774
01:03:50,503 --> 01:03:52,326
you're just an in-law.

775
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:56,006
Mr. Prawit sees you just as an outsider.

776
01:03:56,151 --> 01:03:57,766
He isn't even sure

777
01:03:57,998 --> 01:03:59,886
if the baby in your womb

778
01:04:00,187 --> 01:04:03,246
is an heir of Jangwangprawas or not.

779
01:04:04,566 --> 01:04:05,606
I think

780
01:04:05,806 --> 01:04:08,846
you need to go back to being poor to learn.

781
01:04:10,216 --> 01:04:13,046
You know what? I'll leave you some money.

782
01:04:13,878 --> 01:04:17,566
It will be enough for you and your kid to live comfortably.

783
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,446
Just don't see my grandson again.

784
01:04:23,395 --> 01:04:24,726
Money can't buy me.

785
01:04:24,854 --> 01:04:26,086
Is it not enough?

786
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,616
I have money, ma'am.

787
01:04:27,766 --> 01:04:30,246
I won't go back to being poor like you think.

788
01:04:31,027 --> 01:04:32,447
I want Kuer.

789
01:04:37,467 --> 01:04:40,246
I've warned you nicely, and you aren't stopping.

790
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:42,166
So I'll make you

791
01:04:43,285 --> 01:04:47,006
lose the thing you've been trying to keep your whole life.

792
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,686
I'll make you

793
01:04:51,926 --> 01:04:57,006
lose your spot in the society where you struggle to fit in.

794
01:04:57,648 --> 01:05:00,434
I'll stomp you down to the ground.

795
01:05:31,486 --> 01:05:34,806
If I had that money in front of me years ago,

796
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,380
it wouldn't have been hard to decide.

797
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:41,326
But I'm not the woman from years ago.

798
01:05:46,886 --> 01:05:49,446
I want to live a good life.

799
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:52,566
I don't just want to be rich.

800
01:05:53,773 --> 01:05:55,486
What did you say to her?

801
01:05:56,726 --> 01:05:58,046
I refused her offer.

802
01:05:59,383 --> 01:06:01,206
Do you think she'll take that well?

803
01:06:13,213 --> 01:06:15,286
She threatens that if I don't stop,

804
01:06:15,732 --> 01:06:17,926
she'll ruin my life.

805
01:06:18,206 --> 01:06:21,166
She'll ruin my reputation till I have no place in society.

806
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:55,846
I stayed up all night to listen to you!

807
01:06:56,165 --> 01:06:57,966
I knew it. I told you everything...

808
01:06:58,795 --> 01:07:03,046
If you're doing something, I want you to at least think of our grandfather.

809
01:07:04,467 --> 01:07:05,966
I'm standing here

810
01:07:06,937 --> 01:07:09,006
because I wonder how you feel

811
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,926
about yourself after making Un's life so miserable.

812
01:07:13,326 --> 01:07:14,966
If Kuer is the father of your child,

813
01:07:15,744 --> 01:07:17,766
if you want Kuer back from Un,

814
01:07:18,437 --> 01:07:19,447
just answer my question.
