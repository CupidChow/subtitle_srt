1
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:49,766
I'll get the one who ordered the hit on Kuer to prison.

2
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:51,686
You ordered the hit on Kuer, didn't you?

3
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,526
Did you send the shooter last night?

4
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:56,166
You're the only one I hired.

5
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,166
I'm going back to the resort.

6
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:07,646
If Noot did anything wrong

7
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:09,718
and got locked up in jail,

8
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,246
it'd just involve Noot.

9
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:19,246
(Noot: Follow Rit's car.)

10
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:52,006
Year 20...

11
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,966
2022?

12
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,366
2018?

13
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:24,446
Rit forged these documents.

14
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:29,886
Has he been stealing the money? Is that why the expenditures went up?

15
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:35,886
What is he planning to do?

16
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:59,286
Un.

17
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:03,286
My grandmother said she's coming here.

18
00:04:03,774 --> 00:04:05,446
Is Mrs. Kamalas coming here?

19
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:09,606
She's fuming. She's mad she had to find it out in the news.

20
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:12,614
She wants to come because

21
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:14,782
she wants to talk to your grandfather herself

22
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,286
and asks whether someone from JP has anything to do with this.

23
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:21,686
I told you to tell her, and you didn't listen.

24
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:25,966
By the way, it's good that she's coming here.

25
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,416
I wonder what my grandfather is going to do.

26
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:30,486
I think so too.

27
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,206
I'll officially ask for my grandmother's blessing.

28
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:31,606
I think he recognized me.

29
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:34,886
- From where?  - I don't know.

30
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,766
He pulled over all of a sudden.

31
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,326
When I passed him,

32
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:40,006
he made eye contact with me.

33
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:42,806
Stop following him for now.

34
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:44,286
We'll figure it out.

35
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,966
What room is Phim staying in?

36
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:58,086
Does she work here?

37
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:10,038
Phim.

38
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:11,486
Si.

39
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:14,526
The police asked me to give a statement on Kuer's shooting.

40
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:16,126
When?

41
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:18,686
They called this morning.

42
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:21,293
I told them I had work to do at the resort.

43
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:23,670
I'll be there in a couple of days.

44
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:27,116
What are you going to tell them?

45
00:07:28,686 --> 00:07:31,886
Are you telling them that Noot might have done it?

46
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:34,486
Does Phim know about this too?

47
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:41,446
I think I have to talk to Noot first.

48
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:54,766
That's it. Phim has nothing to do with the shooting.

49
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:57,354
At least, she must know that her husband is involved.

50
00:07:57,486 --> 00:07:59,886
Why else would she say she needed to talk to him first?

51
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,613
I was so right to come here.

52
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:08,526
And what that woman said.

53
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:10,286
What did that mean?

54
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,126
There's something more important than giving a statement?

55
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,766
Stay focused, Phim.

56
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:18,726
There's something more important to you than giving a statement.

57
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,246
I care about you.

58
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:44,806
Don't tell anyone about this.

59
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:47,646
I don't want anyone to find out.

60
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:54,726
I haven't finished with the old story.

61
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:58,686
Yet there's a new story to follow. Gosh!

62
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:05,205
Why hasn't he come out yet?

63
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:19,686
Why are you in a suit?

64
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:22,446
Do you want me to take it off?

65
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:26,486
I was going to dress your wound.

66
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,246
I came out late because I was dressing my wound.

67
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:36,326
I'd have come out early if I knew you were waiting to do it.

68
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:45,646
You're so sweet. This is why I'm obsessed with you.

69
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,126
You can't stop running your mouth.

70
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:50,366
Then I'll stop talking.

71
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,726
Not talking is quite good too.

72
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:19,286
I think we should head to work.

73
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:22,286
San said he's going to see Noot today.

74
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:24,726
I want to see what he has to say.

75
00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:34,166
Kuer, you have to be extra careful these days.

76
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,286
Okay.

77
00:10:54,623 --> 00:10:58,606
Grandmother, why didn't you tell me you were coming?

78
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:00,326
I'd have come out to welcome you.

79
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:02,726
Good morning.

80
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:14,766
She won't say. She told me to pack my bags and get the first flight.

81
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:17,766
She wants to see for herself that you're okay, Brother.

82
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:21,206
Grandmother.

83
00:11:24,398 --> 00:11:26,398
You didn't have to rush.

84
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:30,427
Nothing happened to me. Don't worry. Please come in.

85
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:35,526
I'll get some cold water for you. It's hot out here.

86
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:43,506
How about that, Grandmother?

87
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:46,046
You're the one who got surprised.

88
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:49,486
Your grandmother seemed surprised to see me here.

89
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,059
I thought so too.

90
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:52,566
Hey!

91
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,006
How would she think of me now?

92
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:00,246
Don't worry. I'll deal with her.

93
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,046
Here's your water, Grandmother.

94
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:08,726
Here you are.

95
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:11,286
Thank you, Doctor.

96
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:13,246
You can call her Un.

97
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:15,726
Thank you, Un.

98
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,326
Mr. Kob.

99
00:12:18,494 --> 00:12:19,726
Thank you.

100
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:24,206
Your house looks nice, Kuer.

101
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:25,806
Yes, Grandmother.

102
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:28,566
What about your wound?

103
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:31,446
- Where did you get shot?  - In my arm, Grandmother.

104
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:33,206
It's just a scratch.

105
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:37,046
Don't worry. I feel fine.

106
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:41,286
Thankfully, Un wasn't hurt.

107
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,566
You're dressed. Are you heading to work already?

108
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:48,387
We were about to.

109
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:50,646
Great. I'll ride with you.

110
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:54,766
I have to talk to the chairman of JP.

111
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:11,846
- What is it, Aom?  - A guest asked to see you for problems in her room.

112
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:13,909
- Which one?  - She's sitting there.

113
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,246
What seems to be the problem, ma'am?

114
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:35,566
Well, in my room,

115
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:39,406
the water heater keeps turning on and off.

116
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,726
I'll send a technician there.

117
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:44,606
My AC is wonky too.

118
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:49,166
It's hot and cold. It's confusing. I can't stay there.

119
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:53,126
Okay. Please wait. I'll tell the technician to look at it too.

120
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:55,206
I don't want to wait.

121
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,326
I want to change rooms.

122
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:02,686
Get me a beachside room.

123
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:07,526
You booked a garden room.

124
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:09,206
We can change rooms for you,

125
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:12,166
but your new room will have to be the same tier.

126
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:16,566
Do you discriminate against your guests?

127
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:19,726
I can pay more to change my room.

128
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:21,759
Your garden room

129
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:24,966
has wonky facilities that are breaking down.

130
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:27,727
Are you a five-star resort or a five out of ten?

131
00:14:27,852 --> 00:14:29,404
You're embarrassing yourself.

132
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:31,374
- Ma'am.  - Do you want to charge me more?

133
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:33,909
I can actually pay, but your place sucks.

134
00:14:34,022 --> 00:14:36,126
It's a waste of my money.

135
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,406
- You're over-advertising.  - You got it, ma'am.

136
00:14:38,518 --> 00:14:39,566
You got it.

137
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:44,046
You can change rooms immediately. I'll send my staff to move your luggage.

138
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:46,406
Okay.

139
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:56,126
She's obviously a Karen.

140
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:15,526
I want this room.

141
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:18,126
Okay.

142
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:23,326
How much more do I have to pay?

143
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:27,126
It's fine. It's on the house as a complimentary upgrade.

144
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:34,086
The technician told me he checked your room.

145
00:15:34,238 --> 00:15:36,326
There's nothing wrong with the water heater

146
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:37,886
and the AC.

147
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:39,156
But we're still happy

148
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:43,261
to change rooms for you, free of charge.

149
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,166
I told you.

150
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:48,749
It keeps going on and off.

151
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:51,366
Your technician might have caught it when it's on.

152
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:56,966
I recognize you. You're Un's friend.

153
00:15:57,149 --> 00:15:58,926
She's Kuer's new girlfriend.

154
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,846
I know you intentionally called me out.

155
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:03,766
I want to know why.

156
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,846
I think we have to renegotiate

157
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,766
the deal.

158
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,606
The offer was accepted. You told me that yourself.

159
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:41,646
The situation today has changed.

160
00:16:41,846 --> 00:16:43,886
My grandson was shot.

161
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:47,966
I know you have influence here.

162
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:50,366
If you want to find out who did it,

163
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:52,637
it won't be hard at all.

164
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:54,366
Therefore,

165
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:58,406
I won't sign anything with JP

166
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:01,406
until the culprit is found.

167
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:04,406
I didn't even know that Mr. Kuer had enemies

168
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:06,246
until he was shot.

169
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:09,766
Can you blame this on me?

170
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:12,446
I know my grandson well.

171
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,286
If it happened here,

172
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:18,926
the only person that'd have a problem with him is Chanoot, your grandson.

173
00:17:23,806 --> 00:17:25,206
Why?

174
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:27,946
Phim, your granddaughter-in-law,

175
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:30,526
used to date Kuer.

176
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:34,606
She's been trying to get back with my grandson

177
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,390
when she herself

178
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:38,086
is still married.

179
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:48,286
Trust me. Grandmother is making it a big deal.

180
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:52,086
Of course. It's obvious this is why she flew here herself.

181
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:55,886
My grandfather won't stand for this.

182
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:02,806
This office is indefinitely closed

183
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:06,046
until we find out who is behind this.

184
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:08,805
Grandmother, our team is coming here.

185
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:10,686
They can stay here and wait.

186
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,086
Un, as our adviser,

187
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,766
do you agree with this decision?

188
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:18,846
I do.

189
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,486
We're pressuring JP into doing what we want.

190
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:23,926
JP has a lot of influence.

191
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:26,054
They can rush this case.

192
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,206
Kuer.

193
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:32,326
Give back the car JP lent to you.

194
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:35,566
I had our staff get you a new car.

195
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:37,926
When this case is done,

196
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:39,310
go back to Bangkok.

197
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:41,886
I'm worried about your safety here.

198
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:47,606
Grandmother, I need to take care of something first.

199
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:55,126
We're done with the business here.

200
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:57,486
Should we fly back, Grandmother? What do you want to do?

201
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:58,846
We're staying.

202
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:02,846
I have something else I need to do here.

203
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:05,926
Did Phim say anything to you?

204
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,246
Just the usual.

205
00:19:08,486 --> 00:19:09,926
But this time, it feels like

206
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,686
she has something else on her mind.

207
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:15,621
Should you talk to...

208
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:21,526
(Grandfather)

209
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:24,566
Won't you take that call?

210
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:31,307
Yes, Grandfather.

211
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:32,821
Where are you?

212
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,006
I'm at Phiman Island.

213
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:38,326
I need to talk to you now. Bring Phim with you.

214
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:39,806
(I want to find out)

215
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:42,006
what happened between you,

216
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:44,392
Phim, and Kuer.

217
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,126
Are you okay? What's wrong?

218
00:19:54,821 --> 00:19:56,246
What were you saying?

219
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,166
I was saying you should talk to Phim.

220
00:20:00,342 --> 00:20:02,686
I think she has something to tell you.

221
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:07,646
It's important. It might change a lot of things.

222
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:12,086
What's so important, Si?

223
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:15,566
You should talk to her yourself.

224
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,886
Whoa! This hotel fee is really paying off!

225
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,766
Mr. Chairman is really upset after talking to Mrs. Kamalas.

226
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:42,446
Do you know what they talked about?

227
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:46,006
I think it's about their deal or something.

228
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:48,293
After Mrs. Kamalas came out,

229
00:20:48,477 --> 00:20:50,606
C-Itsara's office got shut down.

230
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:53,126
Mr. Kuer and Miss Un left the building immediately.

231
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:56,246
Is that so?

232
00:20:56,942 --> 00:20:59,766
Are they really pulling out of the joint venture?

233
00:21:02,413 --> 00:21:03,766
I don't know.

234
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:05,766
We'll see.

235
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,566
Do you not live in Jangwangprawas House?

236
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:24,246
I don't.

237
00:21:24,462 --> 00:21:27,126
I left that house years ago.

238
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,846
Where do you live then?

239
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:32,246
I used to live in America.

240
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:35,806
When I was interested in C-Itsara's offer,

241
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,166
I wanted to come and work in Thailand.

242
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,566
I haven't found a home here.

243
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:43,806
When I go to Bangkok, I stay at my friend's place.

244
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:47,366
When I visit my mom in Phuket, I rent a hotel room.

245
00:21:47,693 --> 00:21:50,006
That's good. You don't have any commitment.

246
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:55,926
Mrs. Kamalas.

247
00:21:56,572 --> 00:22:00,086
That rented house, I...

248
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:02,806
I told you to call me Grandmother.

249
00:22:04,014 --> 00:22:05,690
We're like family now.

250
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:07,806
You don't have to address me as an employee.

251
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:11,646
I don't have a problem with you living with Kuer.

252
00:22:12,688 --> 00:22:13,688
What?

253
00:22:14,326 --> 00:22:17,446
Do you think I'm old and conservative?

254
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:19,646
Not at all.

255
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,686
Kuer.

256
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:26,566
I want to have a meal with Un's mother tomorrow.

257
00:22:37,006 --> 00:22:38,326
Well...

258
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:39,886
What does your mom likes, Un?

259
00:22:40,014 --> 00:22:42,966
We'll find a place that suits her too.

260
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,686
My mom is fine with anything.

261
00:22:52,926 --> 00:22:55,966
Look, Un. You should ask your mother

262
00:22:56,204 --> 00:23:00,766
what time she can make it. Then we'll find a restaurant, right Grandmother?

263
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:02,526
I agree.

264
00:23:27,246 --> 00:23:31,446
Why do you want to meet Un's mother?

265
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:36,468
Kuer, you took her daughter to live with you.

266
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:39,806
Don't you think you should tell her?

267
00:23:42,261 --> 00:23:44,806
Although Un had lived abroad for years,

268
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:46,926
she's still Thai.

269
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,766
We have to be transparent with this.

270
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,286
It's an act of respect for your woman.

271
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,726
Okay.

272
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,046
I'll convince Mrs. Wan

273
00:23:58,253 --> 00:24:01,286
that you really love her daughter

274
00:24:01,628 --> 00:24:03,628
and want to marry her.

275
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:11,366
Thank you.

276
00:24:12,086 --> 00:24:16,286
Thanking me? Does that mean you're agreeing?

277
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:20,086
I agree because

278
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:26,166
I do want to marry her anyway.

279
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:31,246
Thank you, Grandmother.

280
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:49,686
I'll give you a ride to your mom's.

281
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:54,846
Why did your grandmother want to see my mom? Do you know?

282
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:56,926
Well...

283
00:24:57,726 --> 00:25:00,846
It's just a formality. She wants to meet your mom.

284
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,886
Is that so?

285
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:07,926
I think it's good.

286
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,246
My elder gets to meet your parent.

287
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,486
They can talk about things that

288
00:25:15,286 --> 00:25:16,686
parents need to talk about.

289
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:26,326
I told you I was serious.

290
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,246
Won't you let me go inside?

291
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:44,005
I can go home myself when I'm done.

292
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:45,726
It's not far away.

293
00:25:46,566 --> 00:25:48,006
You can call me to pick you up.

294
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:52,366
What's wrong? Why are you so clingy today?

295
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:54,966
My grandmother shut down the office.

296
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,366
You're here to see your mom.

297
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:58,166
I have nothing to do.

298
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:01,086
I'll be alone. I'm lonely.

299
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:04,566
Just go home.

300
00:26:04,806 --> 00:26:06,486
Be careful.

301
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,606
I'll come home to you soon.

302
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:39,246
I won't believe it no matter what you say.

303
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,766
You keep saying you don't want me to see Kuer

304
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,766
because you wanted to kill him, right?

305
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:45,261
Are you out of your mind?

306
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:49,326
Even when I saw you stripped and following Kuer into his room,

307
00:26:49,534 --> 00:26:51,606
I didn't even think about killing him.

308
00:26:52,037 --> 00:26:53,846
- Stripped?  - Didn't you do that?

309
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:57,166
You want him when I still need you.

310
00:26:57,829 --> 00:26:59,526
When was the last time you slept with me?

311
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,366
I'm your husband, Phim.

312
00:27:03,486 --> 00:27:07,166
Someone who cheats on me every chance he gets is not my husband, Noot.

313
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:09,046
Then what am I?

314
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:10,726
You're a scoundrel.

315
00:27:10,822 --> 00:27:12,822
Then you are too.

316
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,326
You're trying to get a new husband

317
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:17,006
when you already have one.

318
00:27:17,126 --> 00:27:18,286
Noot!

319
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:20,726
At least I love you, Phim.

320
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:24,086
Do you

321
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:26,166
still love me?

322
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:43,126
It's fine.

323
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:45,366
I don't care

324
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:48,366
how you see or feel about me anymore.

325
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,806
You're coming home with me today.

326
00:27:51,624 --> 00:27:53,886
Why would I go home? I won't.

327
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:56,526
Grandfather asked to see us both

328
00:27:56,829 --> 00:27:58,366
about Kuer's shooting.

329
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,566
He wants to know what I want to know.

330
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,926
Was it you who did it?

331
00:28:06,054 --> 00:28:07,806
I think he wants to find out

332
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:10,038
why everyone is pointing at me,

333
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:11,966
saying I did it.

334
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:14,526
Why then?

335
00:28:15,724 --> 00:28:17,046
It's because of you.

336
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,766
That's why he wants to see you too.

337
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:26,406
What are you going to tell him?

338
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,606
About me...

339
00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:49,846
Mrs. Kamalas wants to have a meal with me?

340
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:54,686
Obviously, this means you're getting married.

341
00:28:55,677 --> 00:28:58,606
Nok! You're stressing my mom out!

342
00:28:59,061 --> 00:29:01,686
She's stressed enough just being asked out.

343
00:29:01,986 --> 00:29:03,766
Why are you stressed out?

344
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:06,446
You're getting a son-in-law. You'll let your daughter go.

345
00:29:06,646 --> 00:29:08,886
It's a win-win. It's worth it.

346
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:10,766
Shut up!

347
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:15,246
What about tomorrow evening?

348
00:29:15,446 --> 00:29:16,726
I'm fine with that.

349
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,966
About the restaurant, they can pick

350
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,646
anything they want. I can eat anything.

351
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:24,283
Okay.

352
00:29:26,326 --> 00:29:28,206
Are you having dinner outside?

353
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,566
This is about my mom and me.

354
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:34,246
It's got nothing to do with you.

355
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:38,163
We'll have green curry with beef, eggs in tamarind sauce,

356
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,886
and stir-fried veggies in mango paste.

357
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:44,166
I wanted to know what's on the menu today.

358
00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:46,526
But now,

359
00:29:46,924 --> 00:29:50,846
I want to find out more about your eating out.

360
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:55,846
I'm going to dinner with Mrs. Kamalas.

361
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:01,646
Mrs. Kamalas?

362
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:04,037
C-Itsara's chairwoman?

363
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:06,126
That's right.

364
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:08,606
I think it's tomorrow evening.

365
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:11,366
I probably won't be able to cook dinner on that day.

366
00:30:11,998 --> 00:30:14,206
Please be informed.

367
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:18,206
So you can order some food or tell Nok to cook what you want.

368
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:19,366
Okay!

369
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:25,366
Be happy about it all you want.

370
00:30:25,806 --> 00:30:28,446
You don't even know whether they'll get married.

371
00:30:28,886 --> 00:30:30,206
Perhaps,

372
00:30:30,366 --> 00:30:33,526
she wants to ask you to keep your daughter away from her grandson.

373
00:30:34,564 --> 00:30:37,926
Look. Noot is having a problem with that family.

374
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:42,086
Yet you're still eager to join them for a meal.

375
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:45,746
You're so clueless. Maybe this house hasn't provided for you enough.

376
00:30:45,894 --> 00:30:48,206
That's why you're so ungrateful!

377
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:11,046
Why did you let her treat you like that?

378
00:31:11,797 --> 00:31:13,797
I don't let her do that every time.

379
00:31:14,013 --> 00:31:16,246
You don't have to let her do that at all.

380
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:18,926
If you move out with me,

381
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,326
you won't have to tolerate her.

382
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:24,366
Please tell me honestly, Mom.

383
00:31:24,598 --> 00:31:26,286
Why are you still here?

384
00:31:34,654 --> 00:31:36,046
I'm staying here for you.

385
00:31:43,846 --> 00:31:45,646
Why are you staying here for me?

386
00:31:45,846 --> 00:31:48,726
I left Jangwangprawas' house years ago.

387
00:31:49,382 --> 00:31:51,806
I never wanted any of their wealth.

388
00:31:56,726 --> 00:31:58,726
You're your dad's daughter.

389
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:01,926
If I move out,

390
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:05,546
I'll lose everything that should belong to you,

391
00:32:07,686 --> 00:32:09,806
what your dad left behind for you,

392
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:15,646
and the company your dad had helped your grandfather build.

393
00:32:18,012 --> 00:32:21,446
You should get what your father built with his own hands.

394
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:44,326
Un.

395
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:49,486
How is Kuer doing?

396
00:32:52,926 --> 00:32:54,166
He's not hurt too much.

397
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:56,806
He's not dead like someone wanted him to be.

398
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,726
What you say is defaming.

399
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:04,166
Defaming who?

400
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:06,459
I didn't even say who did it.

401
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:09,406
If you're accusing someone, you need evidence.

402
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:12,286
Are you protecting your husband now?

403
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:13,966
That's weird.

404
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:17,646
You've been desperately wanting a new husband.

405
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,006
- You...  - Phim!

406
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:20,406
That's enough.

407
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:23,006
Grandfather is waiting for us in his office.

408
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,166
I apologize on Phim's behalf.

409
00:33:34,286 --> 00:33:35,446
Un.

410
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,246
I think you know me well.

411
00:33:43,493 --> 00:33:45,406
I don't hurt anyone.

412
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:47,766
What do you know?

413
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,966
You don't have a mom. Your dad is dead.

414
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:51,686
Maybe you're bad luck.

415
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:54,766
Noot! Are you okay?

416
00:33:55,781 --> 00:33:59,206
Win, if you keep running your mouth, I'll give it to you!

417
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:02,806
Actually, you both are bad luck.

418
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:05,686
Noot just had it worse.

419
00:34:11,142 --> 00:34:12,206
That's enough, Un.

420
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:13,796
How can you let him disrespect our dad?

421
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,446
I don't want trouble.

422
00:34:23,046 --> 00:34:24,726
I think the Chanoot that I knew

423
00:34:25,486 --> 00:34:29,486
was gone long ago. Perhaps time changes people.

424
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,406
What Mrs. Kamalas said is true.

425
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:01,486
Kuer and Phim did use to date, but that was long ago.

426
00:35:02,549 --> 00:35:04,526
It was before we got married.

427
00:35:06,214 --> 00:35:08,286
If it's not like that, why did she say

428
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,766
you were trying to get back with Kuer?

429
00:35:15,006 --> 00:35:17,006
- I think...  - I think

430
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,879
- it's about...  - Stop.

431
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:20,646
Let Phim explain herself.

432
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:24,126
Go on.

433
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:26,806
I think

434
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:30,407
it's because I keep seeing Kuer often lately.

435
00:35:30,526 --> 00:35:33,066
That's why people get the wrong idea.

436
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:39,806
Perhaps they don't know about JP and C-Itsara's joint venture.

437
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:43,726
And

438
00:35:44,494 --> 00:35:47,606
I felt like the deal wasn't going smoothly.

439
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:51,166
I knew Kuer from before. That's why I helped convince him.

440
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:54,886
I thought it might help the deal.

441
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:04,246
I'm okay with both of your explanations.

442
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,646
I don't want trouble.

443
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:14,566
Couples do fight. It's normal.

444
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,925
All I ask is don't get a divorce.

445
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,646
If they had the wrong idea about you and Kuer,

446
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:33,086
why didn't you just explain it to them?

447
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:42,206
Phim, don't go to the resort tomorrow.

448
00:36:43,262 --> 00:36:45,566
I might need to talk to Mrs. Kamalas.

449
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:47,246
I need to get this over with.

450
00:36:47,693 --> 00:36:52,926
But you said Mrs. Kamalas wouldn't sign until the culprit is caught.

451
00:36:53,158 --> 00:36:54,559
From my point of view,

452
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,600
if Kuer didn't get shot because of your love triangle,

453
00:36:57,526 --> 00:37:00,726
Noot shouldn't remain a suspect to the police.

454
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:02,446
If that's so,

455
00:37:02,558 --> 00:37:05,646
I shouldn't even ask the police to rush this case.

456
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:24,806
Why didn't you tell Grandfather about me?

457
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,366
Because I love you.

458
00:37:36,846 --> 00:37:38,446
If I tell him the truth, then what?

459
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:41,726
Should I make my grandfather hate my wife?

460
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:54,966
But it was my fault.

461
00:37:56,646 --> 00:38:00,006
I was the reason you got suspected.

462
00:38:00,926 --> 00:38:03,046
The police asked me for a statement.

463
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:05,606
They think you did it too.

464
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,646
I've been telling the truth the whole time.

465
00:38:13,388 --> 00:38:17,926
Even to you or to the police, I can only assure you I didn't do it.

466
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:19,486
That's all I can do.

467
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:26,046
We'll see what evidence the police will find.

468
00:38:26,862 --> 00:38:28,462
Then we'll see how it turns out.

469
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:49,434
When I have something to tell you, you're on duty!

470
00:38:50,255 --> 00:38:53,766
Yet you appear so fast when I don't want to see you.

471
00:39:05,086 --> 00:39:06,726
Hi, Sa!

472
00:39:06,883 --> 00:39:09,366
You said you were going to stay at the resort for months.

473
00:39:09,486 --> 00:39:11,926
The dogs didn't even finish howling, and you're already back?

474
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:13,967
Are you saying I'm a ghost?

475
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,446
No!

476
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:18,726
You look like you've seen a ghost. What's wrong?

477
00:39:18,846 --> 00:39:21,086
I have something fiery to tell you.

478
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,646
I've been waiting here since the afternoon. The fire's out.

479
00:39:25,222 --> 00:39:27,222
Why didn't you call if it's urgent?

480
00:39:27,346 --> 00:39:29,566
Hey! If I could

481
00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:34,246
talk passionately on the phone, like in person, I would have done it.

482
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:36,206
Are you saying

483
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:38,046
when you see me,

484
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,966
you get passionate?

485
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,086
- Yeah!  - I knew it.

486
00:39:42,194 --> 00:39:44,606
I felt like you were sitting in my heart.

487
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,926
Hey! It's not that kind of passionate.

488
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,186
Are you ready to listen now?

489
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:49,678
Yeah. Go on.

490
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:52,646
Mr. Noot visited Phim at the resort.

491
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,006
I filmed a video. I thought you wouldn't believe me.

492
00:39:56,206 --> 00:39:58,566
You can't say I make things up now.

493
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:03,766
(He wants to know what I want to know. Was it you who did it?)

494
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:15,726
My feelings for Noot

495
00:40:17,397 --> 00:40:20,686
are like I feel nothing at all.

496
00:40:22,526 --> 00:40:24,326
When he's nice to me,

497
00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:26,166
I still get excited.

498
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,366
But that's just it.

499
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:30,766
I ended up

500
00:40:32,005 --> 00:40:34,286
feeling nothing again.

501
00:40:35,886 --> 00:40:37,966
You've been married for years.

502
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,846
That's why it felt empty.

503
00:40:41,246 --> 00:40:45,726
It's like I only feel attached and happy when he's nice to me.

504
00:40:50,606 --> 00:40:52,006
I don't love him anymore.

505
00:40:55,726 --> 00:40:57,446
It's normal.

506
00:40:57,614 --> 00:41:00,686
You can't be lovey-dovey like it's your first day.

507
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:11,006
This means we can confirm their affair.

508
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:14,409
Do you mean Phim was chasing Kuer?

509
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,710
Kuer won't get back to her anyway.

510
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:17,526
Yeah. We know that already.

511
00:41:17,662 --> 00:41:19,604
We know how much Kuer is into Un.

512
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,806
He won't get back together with Phim.

513
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,406
Today when I was trying to figure out the case,

514
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:29,406
I remembered one thing.

515
00:41:29,638 --> 00:41:30,926
What is it?

516
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:33,366
That day, at the bar,

517
00:41:33,806 --> 00:41:36,006
do you remember the "your type" guy?

518
00:41:37,174 --> 00:41:38,574
- Mr. Rit?  - Yeah.

519
00:41:39,102 --> 00:41:41,102
He was talking to a man.

520
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:46,046
Yeah. I remember!

521
00:41:46,205 --> 00:41:49,366
Today when I looked at the evidence board,

522
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:52,206
I remembered that the dead shooter

523
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:54,806
wore the same clothes as the man talking to Mr. Rit.

524
00:41:55,006 --> 00:41:57,526
- What?  - Don't what me. It's true.

525
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,360
What do you mean? They wore the same clothes?

526
00:41:59,388 --> 00:42:02,126
I mean, they had the same jacket and pants on.

527
00:42:02,326 --> 00:42:03,486
I didn't ask about that.

528
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,726
I mean, are you saying

529
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:08,286
Mr. Rit talked to the shooter?

530
00:42:08,566 --> 00:42:12,526
I have no evidence. The CCTV didn't catch his face.

531
00:42:25,766 --> 00:42:30,646
So that means Mr. Noot isn't the only suspect.

532
00:42:32,696 --> 00:42:34,206
We need interrogations.

533
00:42:34,406 --> 00:42:35,886
Then we will know more.

534
00:42:36,101 --> 00:42:38,046
When are you interrogating Mr. Noot?

535
00:42:40,414 --> 00:42:41,726
Tomorrow.

536
00:42:51,366 --> 00:42:52,526
Un!

537
00:42:58,213 --> 00:42:59,646
Are you going home?

538
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:05,686
- I have to go.  - Un.

539
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,470
Do you have time to listen to me?

540
00:43:09,966 --> 00:43:11,326
It won't take long.

541
00:43:11,509 --> 00:43:14,166
But I think it could change your view about yesterday.

542
00:43:28,598 --> 00:43:31,046
I hired someone to tail Kuer, as you suspected.

543
00:43:34,157 --> 00:43:37,126
The one who saved Kuer was my man.

544
00:44:04,086 --> 00:44:05,526
You walked home. Are you exhausted?

545
00:44:06,205 --> 00:44:08,126
You wouldn't let me wait for you in the car.

546
00:44:11,405 --> 00:44:13,206
What did you say?

547
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:24,606
I said you walked back. Are you exhausted?

548
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:27,286
Not at all.

549
00:44:27,422 --> 00:44:29,422
I was thinking about some things when I walked.

550
00:44:30,286 --> 00:44:31,606
What were you thinking about?

551
00:44:32,862 --> 00:44:34,286
My family.

552
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:39,086
Can you tell me? I might be able to help.

553
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:43,766
I'll tell you later. I need a shower.

554
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,906
(I hired someone to tail Kuer, as you suspected.)

555
00:45:07,726 --> 00:45:10,446
(The one who saved Kuer was my man.)

556
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:13,286
Your man saved Kuer?

557
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,046
I hired him to tail Kuer a while ago.

558
00:45:18,926 --> 00:45:21,126
Was it the guy I saw at the golf resort?

559
00:45:23,957 --> 00:45:25,206
That's him.

560
00:45:27,606 --> 00:45:29,246
I wanted to make sure

561
00:45:30,781 --> 00:45:33,126
that Kuer didn't betray us on the deal.

562
00:45:35,253 --> 00:45:38,166
That's how I found out what he did, where he was,

563
00:45:39,717 --> 00:45:40,966
and who he saw.

564
00:45:41,254 --> 00:45:44,346
And then your man saw Phim with Kuer?

565
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,286
Yes.

566
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,846
I didn't expect

567
00:45:53,942 --> 00:45:55,606
that my wife would have done that.

568
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:01,566
I think you can rest assured.

569
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:04,594
Judging from what I heard from him,

570
00:46:04,821 --> 00:46:07,686
he didn't sleep with Phim. He doesn't even have feelings for her.

571
00:46:08,326 --> 00:46:10,726
No man can truly be trusted, Un.

572
00:46:13,006 --> 00:46:15,926
Even when Phim catches me,

573
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:18,501
I lie to survive too.

574
00:46:20,686 --> 00:46:22,766
You should believe your own instinct.

575
00:46:24,726 --> 00:46:26,726
A woman's instinct

576
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:28,526
is sharper than you think.

577
00:46:32,486 --> 00:46:35,206
My instinct is telling me you're somehow involved.

578
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:44,008
My involvement in this

579
00:46:44,237 --> 00:46:46,086
is only sending someone to tail Kuer.

580
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:49,766
Other than that,

581
00:46:50,245 --> 00:46:51,926
I really don't know.

582
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:58,046
By the way, Kuer is lucky

583
00:46:58,222 --> 00:47:00,086
that my man saved him.

584
00:47:01,925 --> 00:47:03,446
Otherwise, he wouldn't have made it.

585
00:47:09,917 --> 00:47:11,726
I'm not lying.

586
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:15,886
This is already tiring enough.

587
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:17,886
Grandfather is pressuring me with work.

588
00:47:18,189 --> 00:47:20,126
I can't find figure things out with Phim.

589
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:24,846
I don't want to complicate things with more lies.

590
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:29,726
Your boyfriend,

591
00:47:31,006 --> 00:47:32,606
is he telling the whole truth?

592
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,006
Do you have an appointment with Noot today?

593
00:47:45,185 --> 00:47:47,446
He told me to see him at the office today.

594
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:51,286
What about Phim?

595
00:47:51,677 --> 00:47:53,926
Mrs. Phim said she needed a couple of days.

596
00:47:54,801 --> 00:47:56,196
Why did she ask for a few more days?

597
00:47:56,302 --> 00:47:59,526
She's already there. She can come with her husband.

598
00:48:05,661 --> 00:48:07,526
What do you think Phim is thinking?

599
00:48:10,442 --> 00:48:13,886
Perhaps she's waiting to see what kind of questions Noot will get asked.

600
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:16,566
Is she waiting to see the questions?

601
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:19,126
Or is she just stalling?

602
00:48:20,118 --> 00:48:21,886
If she didn't do it, why would she get scared?

603
00:48:22,118 --> 00:48:23,726
Are you suspecting Phim?

604
00:48:24,623 --> 00:48:26,406
I just think it's possible.

605
00:48:26,685 --> 00:48:30,566
From what you said and the fact that Noot told me he didn't do it,

606
00:48:31,214 --> 00:48:34,006
Phim is the only one who's afraid to give a statement.

607
00:48:35,126 --> 00:48:40,086
If Phim did it, she could have ordered a failed hit and framed it on Noot.

608
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:43,966
If Noot goes to jail, Phim is as good as single.

609
00:48:45,566 --> 00:48:49,206
She will be free to start over with anyone.

610
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:53,086
That's right. How did I not think of that?

611
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:58,246
This is what I don't understand.

612
00:48:58,486 --> 00:49:01,446
That shooter clearly wanted you dead.

613
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:04,126
He only failed because someone interfered.

614
00:49:05,157 --> 00:49:06,606
About Mrs. Phim,

615
00:49:06,806 --> 00:49:09,046
I think it's less likely that she did it.

616
00:49:09,844 --> 00:49:13,566
She likes Kuer. She wouldn't want him dead.

617
00:49:21,207 --> 00:49:24,806
By the way, I had this idea last night.

618
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:26,406
The one called Rit

619
00:49:27,286 --> 00:49:29,446
could be a suspect too.

620
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:33,326
He met the shooter before you got shot.

621
00:49:45,366 --> 00:49:47,126
San, let me know if you find out anything.

622
00:49:49,399 --> 00:49:50,646
Let's go.

623
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,470
Why did you suddenly suspect Phim?

624
00:49:58,805 --> 00:50:00,726
I was just trying a different point of view.

625
00:50:01,237 --> 00:50:03,966
It's possible she ordered it to miss on purpose.

626
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:07,566
If Noot goes to jail, she's as good as single.

627
00:50:08,014 --> 00:50:10,006
She can date new guys all she wants.

628
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,486
I should be happy you came up with that idea.

629
00:50:16,206 --> 00:50:17,406
Why?

630
00:50:20,843 --> 00:50:22,446
Because you got jealous.

631
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:32,686
Hey, Kuer! I don't get jealous about things like this.

632
00:50:34,653 --> 00:50:35,966
Un.

633
00:50:36,222 --> 00:50:39,006
My grandmother is meeting your mother this evening.

634
00:50:39,781 --> 00:50:41,286
Are you still jealous?

635
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:46,446
I said I wasn't.

636
00:50:48,172 --> 00:50:49,806
Why are you carrying me?

637
00:50:50,686 --> 00:50:52,606
What are you playing at?

638
00:50:53,046 --> 00:50:54,366
Kuer!

639
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,206
- Hey!  - How should I tell you?

640
00:50:57,797 --> 00:50:59,086
Don't be jealous.

641
00:50:59,397 --> 00:51:01,646
I'll love only you and no one else.

642
00:51:31,686 --> 00:51:33,126
Good morning, Mr. Noot.

643
00:51:33,846 --> 00:51:35,166
Good morning, inspector.

644
00:51:40,406 --> 00:51:43,406
You can ask any question you want, sir.

645
00:51:44,024 --> 00:51:45,206
Okay.

646
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:57,126
Rit!

647
00:51:57,254 --> 00:51:59,366
A lot of cops are here for Mr. Noot.

648
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:01,846
Why are they here?

649
00:52:02,158 --> 00:52:03,806
I think they're questioning him.

650
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,526
They're in the meeting room.

651
00:52:06,862 --> 00:52:08,166
Is that so?

652
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:12,934
Thank you so much for your cooperation, Mr. Noot.

653
00:52:13,075 --> 00:52:17,286
If you want more information, you can contact me anytime.

654
00:52:26,806 --> 00:52:28,246
What did you find, inspector?

655
00:52:31,553 --> 00:52:34,566
I'm sure my grandson had nothing to do with this.

656
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:40,406
Still, I want the police to find the culprit ASAP.

657
00:52:41,046 --> 00:52:44,406
If you want any help from me, just tell me.

658
00:52:45,038 --> 00:52:46,446
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

659
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:49,046
Mr. Chairman.

660
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:53,966
May I ask to see another person?

661
00:52:57,021 --> 00:52:58,286
Who do you want to see?

662
00:52:58,446 --> 00:52:59,926
Mr. Thevarit.

663
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:07,006
Mr. Rit, Mr. Chairman summoned you to the meeting room.

664
00:53:08,684 --> 00:53:10,302
What does he want to talk about?

665
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:12,206
I can prepare my information.

666
00:53:12,477 --> 00:53:15,126
He said the police wanted to talk to you.

667
00:53:15,885 --> 00:53:19,526
The inspector has a few questions for you.

668
00:53:21,086 --> 00:53:22,645
Okay. I'll be there.

669
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:23,926
Okay.

670
00:53:29,893 --> 00:53:30,966
Rit.

671
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:32,766
Is there anything wrong?

672
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:34,878
It's nothing.

673
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:38,046
Maybe they're looking for a witness.

674
00:53:39,862 --> 00:53:41,526
Should I be your alibi?

675
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:43,446
I can tell them I was with you that night.

676
00:53:43,756 --> 00:53:45,246
I can say that.

677
00:53:46,446 --> 00:53:49,286
If it's needed, I can tell a lie.

678
00:53:50,646 --> 00:53:53,366
You don't need to. I didn't do anything wrong.

679
00:53:55,141 --> 00:53:56,446
Thanks a lot.

680
00:54:13,535 --> 00:54:15,006
Did you ask for me, Grandfather?

681
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:17,166
The inspector wants to talk to you.

682
00:54:23,518 --> 00:54:24,966
This is my personal number.

683
00:54:26,326 --> 00:54:28,046
You can call me anytime.

684
00:54:28,686 --> 00:54:32,166
As I said, I want this case closed ASAP.

685
00:54:32,509 --> 00:54:35,286
If you need my help with anything,

686
00:54:35,581 --> 00:54:36,926
you can tell me.

687
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,606
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

688
00:54:38,806 --> 00:54:41,326
Let's go, Noot. Let the inspector do his job.

689
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:52,366
Please sit down, Mr. Rit.

690
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:54,206
Okay.

691
00:54:55,806 --> 00:54:58,166
- Did it go well?  - Yes.

692
00:54:58,485 --> 00:55:00,726
If everything is fine and you're sure you didn't do it,

693
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:04,486
I can rest assured. I don't want JP's only heir

694
00:55:04,726 --> 00:55:06,726
to live his whole life in prison.

695
00:55:06,926 --> 00:55:08,206
Yes, Grandfather.

696
00:55:12,926 --> 00:55:14,586
I want to see Phim tonight

697
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:18,206
before flying to Bangkok to meet a client from Singapore.

698
00:55:19,117 --> 00:55:21,726
- Okay, Grandfather.  - And come home for dinner.

699
00:55:22,374 --> 00:55:23,686
Yes.

700
00:55:35,646 --> 00:55:39,326
On the night of the shooting, you were at the bar.

701
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:41,846
Did you see anything?

702
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:43,086
I didn't.

703
00:55:43,246 --> 00:55:46,806
I think I left before the incident. I didn't see Mr. Kuer there.

704
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:49,846
Were you meeting your friends there?

705
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:51,886
No, I went there alone.

706
00:55:53,846 --> 00:55:55,366
You went there alone?

707
00:55:56,068 --> 00:55:57,068
Yes.

708
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:01,566
I had a few problems at work. I wanted to relax before I headed home.

709
00:56:05,086 --> 00:56:07,326
You didn't have a meeting with anyone

710
00:56:08,605 --> 00:56:10,366
or talk to anyone there?

711
00:56:17,525 --> 00:56:19,966
Actually, someone did talk to me.

712
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:22,213
He said I forgot to close my car's window.

713
00:56:22,566 --> 00:56:25,726
I only talked to him for a few seconds, no one else.

714
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:29,646
After that, I left and didn't return to the bar again.

715
00:56:37,549 --> 00:56:38,806
Mr. Noot!

716
00:56:40,966 --> 00:56:43,406
Is there anything wrong? Are you okay?

717
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:46,366
It's nothing, Nam. You should get back to work.

718
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:48,966
Mr. Noot.

719
00:56:52,406 --> 00:56:53,766
I'm sorry,

720
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:58,166
but let's keep things professional from now on.

721
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,686
If you're uncomfortable seeing me,

722
00:57:01,813 --> 00:57:04,246
I can assign you to another executive.

723
00:57:04,366 --> 00:57:05,766
Just tell me.

724
00:57:10,038 --> 00:57:11,366
Why?

725
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:15,006
I never caused problems for you.

726
00:57:15,285 --> 00:57:17,285
I never messed with Mrs. Phim. Why?

727
00:57:17,382 --> 00:57:19,382
I know I'm selfish

728
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,086
for saying this.

729
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:26,846
But I don't want Phim to feel bad anymore.

730
00:57:28,686 --> 00:57:30,006
I'm sorry.

731
00:57:33,886 --> 00:57:34,886
Mr. Noot.

732
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:36,406
Mr. Noot?

733
00:57:36,509 --> 00:57:39,166
What if you want to stop, but I don't?

734
00:57:43,653 --> 00:57:44,886
Nam.

735
00:57:45,606 --> 00:57:47,326
I don't want to fire you.

736
00:57:48,405 --> 00:57:49,726
Fire me?

737
00:57:51,365 --> 00:57:53,566
Are you firing me because you want to get rid of me?

738
00:57:54,949 --> 00:57:56,646
If you do that,

739
00:57:57,327 --> 00:57:59,086
I'll tell Mrs. Phim.

740
00:58:06,246 --> 00:58:07,806
Phim doesn't care.

741
00:58:11,435 --> 00:58:13,326
She doesn't? Well, let's try.

742
00:58:14,597 --> 00:58:15,926
That's enough, Nam.

743
00:58:17,086 --> 00:58:18,446
Please think about it.

744
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:31,286
If one of us hasn't died,

745
00:58:32,261 --> 00:58:34,406
I'll never break up with you.

746
00:58:59,693 --> 00:59:01,366
- Un.  - Yes?

747
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,406
Come here. Let me help.

748
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:05,686
Thanks.

749
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,086
Can you get it?

750
00:59:11,566 --> 00:59:12,726
It's done.

751
00:59:16,012 --> 00:59:17,012
Un.

752
00:59:18,566 --> 00:59:22,126
Are you sure you just want me to drop you off and pick you up at five?

753
00:59:23,716 --> 00:59:24,789
Yes.

754
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,166
Then,

755
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,606
can I stop by at a place first?

756
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,486
Sure.

757
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:33,966
I'll be waiting downstairs.

758
00:59:43,854 --> 00:59:45,766
(Are you truly what Noot said you were?)

759
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,686
Why did you bring me here?

760
01:00:01,373 --> 01:00:02,606
Un.

761
01:00:03,638 --> 01:00:05,366
We have just recently started dating.

762
01:00:06,814 --> 01:00:08,526
But I love you so much.

763
01:00:10,758 --> 01:00:14,966
So much that I don't want to live alone anymore.

764
01:00:17,461 --> 01:00:19,046
The day I got shot,

765
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:22,385
the first thought in my head was

766
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:26,430
I was scared of not seeing you,

767
01:00:28,606 --> 01:00:30,246
not seeing your face,

768
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,246
and not holding you again.

769
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:36,766
I know I will spend

770
01:00:39,326 --> 01:00:41,446
my life after today with you every minute.

771
01:00:43,078 --> 01:00:44,366
We'll be happy,

772
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,086
and we'll go through tough times together.

773
01:00:57,581 --> 01:00:59,046
Will you marry me?

774
01:01:18,086 --> 01:01:19,806
Can you promise me

775
01:01:23,494 --> 01:01:25,166
that you will not lie to me,

776
01:01:28,335 --> 01:01:31,326
that you will be honest, and that you will only have me?

777
01:01:33,854 --> 01:01:35,214
I promise.

778
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:44,686
I promise you, so

779
01:01:45,572 --> 01:01:47,686
will you marry me?

780
01:01:49,525 --> 01:01:50,926
Yes.

781
01:01:52,726 --> 01:01:58,204
(I will never leave your side.)

782
01:01:58,366 --> 01:02:02,086
(You're the one who touched my heart.)

783
01:02:02,246 --> 01:02:06,006
(No one else comes above you.)

784
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:09,686
(You're my precious thing.)

785
01:02:09,949 --> 01:02:13,606
(I'll keep you well, close to my heart.)

786
01:02:13,774 --> 01:02:17,286
(Only you are the one.)

787
01:02:17,542 --> 01:02:21,276
(Nobody else means a thing.)

788
01:02:21,462 --> 01:02:25,006
(Only you are in my heart.)

789
01:02:25,222 --> 01:02:28,366
(No matter how long, my love is only for you.)

790
01:02:28,535 --> 01:02:31,566
(I'll do anything to be with you.)

791
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,886
(You're the one who touched my heart.)

792
01:02:48,068 --> 01:02:51,726
(No one else comes above you.)

793
01:02:51,886 --> 01:02:55,567
(You're my precious thing.)

794
01:02:55,726 --> 01:02:59,326
(I'll keep you well, close to my heart.)

795
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:03,170
(Only you are the one.)

796
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:07,021
(Nobody else means a thing.)

797
01:03:07,126 --> 01:03:10,806
(Only you are in my heart.)

798
01:03:10,933 --> 01:03:14,006
(No matter how long, my love is only for you.)

799
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:30,526
Grandmother.

800
01:03:31,397 --> 01:03:32,846
Kuer is coming soon.

801
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,766
I know he's coming.

802
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:37,950
Why did he propose to her in the morning

803
01:03:38,055 --> 01:03:40,766
and not tell me how it went?

804
01:03:41,045 --> 01:03:43,686
Did Un say yes to him or not?

805
01:03:51,766 --> 01:03:54,149
(Kuer: She said yes.)

806
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,526
She said yes, Grandmother!

807
01:03:57,636 --> 01:04:01,806
He kept me waiting until the afternoon! What else did he say?

808
01:04:02,366 --> 01:04:06,606
Kuer said he's dropping Un off to see her mom and coming here.

809
01:04:20,806 --> 01:04:22,446
Are you sure you don't want me in there with you?

810
01:04:23,437 --> 01:04:26,026
I am. I want to spend time with my mom.

811
01:04:26,286 --> 01:04:28,686
Just come pick us up at five.

812
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:36,166
I'm not running away.

813
01:04:36,669 --> 01:04:40,606
Then I'll be at the gate as soon as the clock strikes five.

814
01:04:41,357 --> 01:04:42,886
Okay.

815
01:05:00,422 --> 01:05:02,086
Can you wash this again?

816
01:05:02,222 --> 01:05:03,446
Okay.

817
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:07,166
Un.

818
01:05:07,549 --> 01:05:09,886
Why are you here so early? It's not five yet.

819
01:05:10,086 --> 01:05:11,886
I haven't got dressed.

820
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:13,902
I'm here to help you pick your dress.

821
01:05:14,054 --> 01:05:15,086
Why?

822
01:05:15,197 --> 01:05:17,926
I don't go out much, so you think I don't know how to dress?

823
01:05:18,142 --> 01:05:20,046
Mom!

824
01:05:20,286 --> 01:05:22,526
I just want to spend some time with you.

825
01:05:23,301 --> 01:05:24,766
I was just kidding.

826
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:27,646
Aunt Nee, I'll leave you in charge of the kitchen.

827
01:05:27,766 --> 01:05:29,286
Okay, Mrs. Wan.

828
01:05:29,669 --> 01:05:31,206
Let's go and pick a dress.

829
01:05:58,606 --> 01:06:00,606
I was wondering who came by.

830
01:06:01,926 --> 01:06:04,966
You're here so early. Are you worried your man would run away?

831
01:06:09,086 --> 01:06:10,326
Keeping quiet?

832
01:06:10,526 --> 01:06:12,630
That means you're afraid of getting embarrassed

833
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:15,246
when you finally get to talk to them, aren't you?

834
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:19,486
Don't pick a fight with us, Aunt Wing.

835
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:23,446
Why? You don't like what you hear or what?

836
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,646
Is that why you say I'm picking a fight?

837
01:06:27,366 --> 01:06:29,846
I'll tell you when we have good news.

838
01:06:30,526 --> 01:06:33,326
I promise you will be on the guest list.

839
01:06:34,086 --> 01:06:36,526
So you're confident about getting married?

840
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:40,133
I really don't understand. Why does a classy and good-looking man

841
01:06:40,326 --> 01:06:42,286
and also smart like Mr. Kuer,

842
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:44,526
why does he have

843
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:47,606
a taste so bad that he chose a woman like you?

844
01:06:48,006 --> 01:06:51,166
Even as a relative, I don't want you

845
01:06:51,526 --> 01:06:54,126
in the same house as I am.

846
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:00,286
Look at this!

847
01:07:01,053 --> 01:07:02,846
A man with real class

848
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:04,526
and real intelligence

849
01:07:04,677 --> 01:07:06,526
would choose an intelligent woman

850
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:09,406
deserving of his status, just like my daughter,

851
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:12,686
not a woman with just a beautiful shell.

852
01:07:13,206 --> 01:07:15,046
He just left you behind

853
01:07:15,622 --> 01:07:17,366
when he saw how empty you were inside.

854
01:07:20,846 --> 01:07:23,486
Un was going to include you on the guest list.

855
01:07:24,243 --> 01:07:28,006
I think you should be on the unwelcome guest list.

856
01:07:30,658 --> 01:07:31,966
Let's go.

857
01:07:47,789 --> 01:07:50,166
I saw Un just now, and I was like, "Whoa!"

858
01:07:50,406 --> 01:07:52,806
I saw a huge diamond on her finger.

859
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:56,926
I think they're officially asking for blessings.

860
01:07:57,126 --> 01:07:59,766
When I get married to Kuer, and you're still messing with him,

861
01:07:59,886 --> 01:08:00,886
I won't allow that.

862
01:08:01,029 --> 01:08:04,086
That also depends on what the man wants.

863
01:08:04,302 --> 01:08:06,646
Can you give me a ride, please?

864
01:08:08,197 --> 01:08:11,206
I think Phim doesn't want to see you.

865
01:08:11,526 --> 01:08:12,926
She went out with Kuer.

866
01:08:14,635 --> 01:08:15,767
Are you sure, Rit,

867
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:17,934
that Phim really went to the resort with Kuer?
