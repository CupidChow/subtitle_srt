1
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:46,366
Kuer is in Bangkok with Phim.

2
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:50,806
I think you want to know where Phim is.

3
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:54,606
Did I cause trouble between you and Un?

4
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:56,206
Not at all.

5
00:01:56,588 --> 00:01:57,616
She understands.

6
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:59,646
(I saw Miss Un at Mr. Kuer's apartment.)

7
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:03,806
(Mrs. Phim has left Mr. Kuer's apartment and checked into a hotel.)

8
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,326
(Congratulations, you're pregnant.)

9
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:08,326
I did all the work you asked me to do.

10
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:10,326
We need to stay at the golf resort for a night or two.

11
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,548
I'm still mad at you.

12
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:13,046
I love you.

13
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:19,404
We booked two rooms.

14
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:20,765
Here you go.

15
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:24,606
We can stay in the same room.

16
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:29,005
If you can't afford to pay for my room,

17
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:30,486
I'll pay for it myself.

18
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:33,806
You're not mad at me anymore, right?

19
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:36,274
We're here to work.

20
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:38,966
An executive and an adviser shouldn't sleep in the same room.

21
00:02:39,982 --> 00:02:41,262
Here are your key cards.

22
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:44,446
You can leave your luggage here. Our staff will bring it to your room.

23
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:45,989
Thank you.

24
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:50,006
Is work all you think about in a day?

25
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:53,753
You asked me to talk to the owners

26
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,886
of the other five docks who want our deal.

27
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:57,566
I talked to them the other day.

28
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:58,966
They're interested.

29
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,006
So I asked them to come here.

30
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:05,246
I don't want anyone to know we're also dealing with JP.

31
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:11,486
You do your job swiftly. How about your personal life?

32
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:14,446
Let's get to our rooms.

33
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,968
You need to catch up on what I talked to them about

34
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:19,846
before they arrive tomorrow morning.

35
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:37,286
She asked those dock owners to come here.

36
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,206
She's smart.

37
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:53,366
Pregnant?

38
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:56,446
I'm pregnant?

39
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:23,526
(Noot)

40
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:39,347
- What is it?  - Mr. Kuer and Miss Un are at a golf resort near Bangkok.

41
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:42,302
What are they doing there?

42
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,966
They're meeting the other dock owners tomorrow.

43
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:47,926
(Mrs. Phim...)

44
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:49,926
I don't think she's coming here.

45
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:53,526
Thanks.

46
00:04:56,646 --> 00:05:00,366
(Noot)

47
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:28,206
Do you believe me now?

48
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,686
We can't trust Un.

49
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:33,526
She stabs us in the back the first chance she gets.

50
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,366
Now what?

51
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:42,166
What will you do?

52
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:45,606
I'm going to Bangkok.

53
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,886
What are you doing here? Who asked you to come?

54
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,766
I asked her for coffee.

55
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:57,526
I think she's just bringing me my coffee here.

56
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,006
You need to go ASAP.

57
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:04,246
Don't let them get that deal.

58
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:07,526
Yes, Grandfather.

59
00:06:12,526 --> 00:06:13,526
Okay.

60
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:19,406
Rit, I think something's going on.

61
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:22,246
What's going on?

62
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,526
Mr. Chairman seemed very upset. He was talking to Mr. Noot.

63
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,422
Mr. Noot said he would go to Bangkok.

64
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,166
Go to Bangkok? Why?

65
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:31,606
I don't know.

66
00:06:31,718 --> 00:06:33,366
Mr. Chairman told Mr. Noot,

67
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,806
"Don't let them get that deal."

68
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,046
He's clearly talking about C-Itsara.

69
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,220
When is Noot leaving?

70
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:48,686
He has left. He asked me to book the earliest flight and email it to him.

71
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,966
What? You're only talking to him about work?

72
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:58,616
If you really want to find out,

73
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,926
why don't you ask him?

74
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:03,606
We need to do our job first. That's for later.

75
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,566
Why don't you figure things out with him now?

76
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:09,086
You need to be careful. If he changes his mind someday,

77
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:11,086
you'll regret it.

78
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:15,206
If he does, it just means he isn't really into me.

79
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:19,006
If that's so, I think it's better to get over him now.

80
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:26,246
I have to go. I think Kuer is here.

81
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,206
Figure things out with him now.

82
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,206
If you wait too long, someone will steal him away from you.

83
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:45,486
Did you get the wrong room?

84
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:46,993
I didn't call for room service.

85
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:49,093
Mr. Kuer asked me to give this to you.

86
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:53,246
Thank you.

87
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:33,126
What is this event for?

88
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:47,486
(I know you're mad,)

89
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,756
(but you need to eat anyway.)

90
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:52,086
(See you tonight at the hotel restaurant.)

91
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,166
I need to do my job too!

92
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,606
I have serious writer's block right now!

93
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:48,136
Let's see how everyone is doing.

94
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:50,766
I might get some ideas.

95
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:54,048
Let's see.

96
00:09:54,734 --> 00:09:58,126
What gossip does Sa have on her page today?

97
00:09:58,596 --> 00:09:59,596
Oh!

98
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:03,366
Your coffee's here.

99
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:12,006
Miss Sa,

100
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:14,366
what are the initials of the celebs in the gossip this week?

101
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:15,846
I'm not telling.

102
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:19,246
Sa, tell me honestly.

103
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:21,277
Do you sometimes make stuff up?

104
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,120
Look. This page is "Gossip with Sa." I don't make things up.

105
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:29,926
- Really? You don't? Let me see.  - Whoa!

106
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:32,246
No! There's a handful.

107
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,606
A handful?

108
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:36,046
You are a handful. I'm telling you.

109
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:38,206
- Let me see.  - No! You can't stick your nose here.

110
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:40,886
- "No!"  - Don't even think about it.

111
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:43,246
Well? Okay! I won't look at your screen.

112
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,086
I'll just look at your page.

113
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,926
Let's see.

114
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:00,526
Sa.

115
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:04,046
I told you not to run this news.

116
00:11:05,357 --> 00:11:08,485
You said not to post the video. I just posted photos.

117
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,670
I meant, don't post about it at all! Don't you understand?

118
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:13,836
Why don't you listen to me?

119
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:17,366
- Well...  - Well, what?

120
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:19,806
What?

121
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:23,245
I say this because I'm worried about you.

122
00:11:27,342 --> 00:11:29,686
- You are?  - Yeah!

123
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:35,526
I thought you were just being an inspector.

124
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:38,006
You are actually worried.

125
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:47,766
Sa.

126
00:11:48,516 --> 00:11:50,286
A fight in a parking lot?

127
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:54,326
What a snitch! Who is this Sa anyway?

128
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:57,406
Is she a parasite on their bodies? She knows their every move.

129
00:11:58,374 --> 00:12:01,006
"Socialite C and his wife

130
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:04,006
fought in a parking lot. They're close to breaking up.

131
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:06,526
If I feel like it, I'll post the video."

132
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,606
That's fire. She's got a video of it.

133
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:14,646
"Phuket's Socialite C."

134
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:18,566
Chanoot?

135
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:22,726
Gade, you're great. You're the best.

136
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,126
Un needs to know this.

137
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:50,686
They obviously had a fight that day.

138
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:01,806
I wish there were a video of her dumping that curry on me.

139
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,117
I'm so hungry. The dress is so tight.

140
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:20,046
I can't eat much in this.

141
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:24,126
Why do I have to dress so well for a simple dinner?

142
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,606
- I'm with Mr. Kuer.  - This way, miss.

143
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:51,886
(How long does it take?)

144
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:56,126
(You're keeping your heart shut)

145
00:13:57,774 --> 00:14:01,726
(for the past that hurt you.)

146
00:14:03,486 --> 00:14:07,126
(What exactly does it take)

147
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:11,086
(for you to trust in me?)

148
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:17,326
(I'm willing to prove it all my life.)

149
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:22,766
(Every time I look in those eyes,)

150
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:25,886
(please believe me.)

151
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:31,907
(I will never leave your side.)

152
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:35,646
(You're the one who touched my heart.)

153
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:39,534
(No one else comes above you.)

154
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:43,253
(You're my precious thing.)

155
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:47,206
(I'll keep you well, close to my heart.)

156
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,006
(Only you are the one.)

157
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:54,766
(Nobody else means a thing.)

158
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:58,566
(Only you are in my heart.)

159
00:14:58,726 --> 00:15:02,726
(No matter how long, my love is only for you.)

160
00:15:02,878 --> 00:15:05,646
It's just a dinner. It doesn't have to be this grand.

161
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:11,406
I want to talk to you alone. I don't want anyone to hear.

162
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,206
What do you want to talk about?

163
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:16,966
We already talked about work.

164
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:18,926
About you being mad.

165
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:30,006
I don't like liars.

166
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:35,006
I know.

167
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:36,926
Then why did you lie?

168
00:15:38,486 --> 00:15:39,846
You would have been upset

169
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:42,485
if you knew that I was with Phim.

170
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:46,286
Even if you knew, you should have told me.

171
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:48,886
If you thought you were doing the right thing,

172
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:51,206
you should have told me and explained why.

173
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,006
Don't lie like that.

174
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:03,326
If you won't say it, I will.

175
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:07,206
You lied about being in the office.

176
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:09,646
You were actually at the hospital with Phim.

177
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:13,085
You went with Phim to an ob-gyn.

178
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,246
You said she was sick, and her husband doesn't even know.

179
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:18,006
How should I feel about this?

180
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:22,526
How did you know?

181
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:24,899
I told Un.

182
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:31,006
I'm wondering the same.

183
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:32,846
What's wrong with Phim?

184
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:34,646
Why did she go to an ob-gyn?

185
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:45,926
I think you should ask Phim yourself.

186
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:50,606
This is your guys' problem. I can't answer that for her.

187
00:16:54,085 --> 00:16:56,246
Un, let's go.

188
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:01,566
I need to talk to you about something.

189
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:19,326
What do you want to talk about?

190
00:17:23,557 --> 00:17:25,286
What are you and Phim?

191
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:29,646
Why don't you ask your wife?

192
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:31,566
Why ask me?

193
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:35,757
I know my wife well.

194
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:37,766
That's why I'm asking you.

195
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:41,526
We're friends.

196
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:47,646
Just friends?

197
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:54,766
Please assure my wife

198
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,966
that you're just her friend.

199
00:18:00,277 --> 00:18:01,966
Why are you here anyway?

200
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:06,886
I'm here to play golf.

201
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:10,606
What about you?

202
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:13,486
I'm here to play golf too.

203
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:16,886
If you're done talking, I'll be excused.

204
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,206
I don't want to keep Un waiting.

205
00:18:33,686 --> 00:18:36,446
Yesterday, Noot got a photo of Kuer and Phim from his friend.

206
00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:39,246
Today, he followed us here.

207
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,566
He couldn't have known.

208
00:18:43,742 --> 00:18:45,166
How was it possible?

209
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:51,206
Un, let's go.

210
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,166
Go where?

211
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,166
Kuer!

212
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,726
What a coincidence.

213
00:19:14,806 --> 00:19:17,365
Coincidence? Or did you follow us here?

214
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,846
Why would I follow you here?

215
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:24,664
My husband took me here for a vacation.

216
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:29,526
I took her here for a vacation.

217
00:19:30,606 --> 00:19:32,086
We've been working hard.

218
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:33,966
I haven't had much time for her.

219
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:36,766
I don't want her to feel sad.

220
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,966
Then please enjoy your stay.

221
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:47,326
Let's go, Un.

222
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:51,526
Hey, we haven't eaten anything.

223
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:53,013
I'm hungry.

224
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,766
Let's order room service.

225
00:20:07,217 --> 00:20:08,217
Sit down.

226
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,566
Did you force me to come here to see those two?

227
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,326
- Noot?  - Pack your bags and come with me.

228
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:25,366
No.

229
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:28,726
You can't refuse this time.

230
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:30,286
You must come.

231
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:33,526
No, Noot!

232
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,406
I forced you here

233
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:37,446
because you're my wife.

234
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,646
Sit down.

235
00:20:40,343 --> 00:20:42,046
We have a lot to talk about.

236
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:43,326
I won't sit.

237
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:45,966
If you're done, I'll be in the room.

238
00:20:46,142 --> 00:20:48,142
I have nothing to talk about with you.

239
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:56,966
You sneaked out to Bangkok with Kuer.

240
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:59,526
You lied to me that you were on Phiman Island.

241
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:02,486
Do you think I'm a fool? Do you think I don't know?

242
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:13,326
The rumors are about to come true.

243
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:15,646
If you won't stop chasing your ex

244
00:21:15,822 --> 00:21:17,822
and ignoring your husband,

245
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:20,446
I won't pay them to delete it this time.

246
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:22,446
Noot!

247
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:24,806
How would everyone see me?

248
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:27,686
If you care about your image,

249
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:30,326
stop acting like you're single.

250
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:32,926
You're a "Mrs." for a reason.

251
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:36,166
They said they got a video of this.

252
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,686
So what?

253
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,006
This time, you're the promiscuous one,

254
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:43,086
not me.

255
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:55,126
What's wrong with you?

256
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,917
Did you tell Noot we were here?

257
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:02,606
I can separate work from personal issues.

258
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:06,646
Did you leave some papers lying around, and Phim saw them?

259
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:12,646
I'm careful enough not to let a JP employee see our company's secrets.

260
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:15,235
No employee of JP

261
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:17,126
has the right to look at all of our papers.

262
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:19,806
You're the only one.

263
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:22,286
You can't say that.

264
00:22:22,646 --> 00:22:26,686
I might be a Jangwangprawas, but I work for C-Itsara.

265
00:22:27,182 --> 00:22:29,406
I know how I should behave.

266
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:35,886
I understand if you're angry about Phim.

267
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,766
I'm sorry I lied to you.

268
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,446
But it's up to them to figure things out.

269
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:46,526
I have no right to tell you about their personal issues.

270
00:22:48,606 --> 00:22:49,606
Un.

271
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:52,266
I don't want you to use this

272
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,526
as the reason to fight with me.

273
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:00,806
Un.

274
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:07,686
Un, I don't want to fight you at all.

275
00:23:09,606 --> 00:23:12,446
I don't want to fight either.

276
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:14,693
And I didn't tell Noot anything.

277
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,006
I found out about you and Phim because he told me.

278
00:23:19,326 --> 00:23:22,246
Noot showed me a photo of you and Phim at the hospital.

279
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:26,606
That's why I came to your apartment in Bangkok.

280
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:29,526
I didn't tell him anything about our meeting tomorrow.

281
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:35,566
So that means

282
00:23:36,686 --> 00:23:38,606
Noot has been tailing me.

283
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,926
I suspected so too.

284
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:38,646
A glass on the rocks, please.

285
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,954
Yes, ma'am.

286
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:54,071
Mister, I want orange juice instead.

287
00:24:54,198 --> 00:24:55,446
Okay.

288
00:24:57,892 --> 00:25:02,166
So what? This time, you're the promiscuous one, not me.

289
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:12,606
Noot!

290
00:25:13,126 --> 00:25:15,766
I don't want to talk when you're pissed off.

291
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:19,486
I might want a fight, but you look like you want a new husband.

292
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,846
See? Your mouth is why I don't want to talk to you.

293
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,646
What should I say then?

294
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:27,646
You lied to me and came to Bangkok with your ex.

295
00:25:27,974 --> 00:25:30,446
Should I believe it's just a reunion?

296
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:33,478
I'm glad his girlfriend followed you here.

297
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,166
She kicked you out to a hotel.

298
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,286
Otherwise, you'd have slept with Kuer, right?

299
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:43,006
If you don't want me to be a murderer,

300
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,526
stop this behavior.

301
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:19,166
(Phim)

302
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:33,326
What do you want? It's so late.

303
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:35,086
I had a fight with Noot.

304
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:37,966
I don't know who to call.

305
00:26:40,206 --> 00:26:42,606
You guys fight every day. That's not news.

306
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:46,406
You can't wake your friend up just because you're lonely.

307
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:48,846
It's not the same this time.

308
00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:50,566
How so?

309
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:56,006
Noot threatens to kill Kuer if I don't stop.

310
00:27:09,006 --> 00:27:10,406
Is that all you need, Rit?

311
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,550
I think that should be all.

312
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:18,606
If you're done, I'll lock Mr. Noot's office.

313
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:21,486
Mr. Chairman told a maid to lock it this afternoon.

314
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:23,606
Thankfully, I have a key.

315
00:27:23,846 --> 00:27:26,206
Don't forget your documents next time, Rit.

316
00:27:27,165 --> 00:27:29,486
Okay. Thanks.

317
00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:02,206
It's almost ten. Don't they need to be here a bit early?

318
00:28:09,926 --> 00:28:11,406
Who are you waiting for, Mr. Noot?

319
00:28:12,206 --> 00:28:13,686
Are you meeting anyone, Noot?

320
00:28:17,526 --> 00:28:18,806
I'm not.

321
00:28:20,886 --> 00:28:22,246
Who are you calling?

322
00:28:24,117 --> 00:28:26,686
I'm telling the dock owners to come earlier.

323
00:28:31,686 --> 00:28:33,966
These are the owners of the docks in Phuket.

324
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:37,166
Perhaps you're familiar with them?

325
00:28:39,198 --> 00:28:40,486
I am.

326
00:28:40,726 --> 00:28:42,326
I know them well.

327
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:45,606
I just didn't expect to see them here.

328
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:49,766
We just finished our round of golf.

329
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:51,726
I'll be seeing them off.

330
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:56,142
We need a favor from you, Mr. Kuer.

331
00:28:57,231 --> 00:28:59,231
Please look at our offers.

332
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:02,126
If you find anything you don't like,

333
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:04,206
we can renegotiate.

334
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,606
Okay.

335
00:29:07,022 --> 00:29:09,366
Let's go. I'll walk with you. This way, please.

336
00:29:19,526 --> 00:29:20,526
Un.

337
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:23,845
I showed you that photo of Kuer and Phim.

338
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:26,366
Didn't you realize anything?

339
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,326
Should I realize something, Noot?

340
00:29:28,606 --> 00:29:30,846
Someone like Kuer is dishonest.

341
00:29:31,846 --> 00:29:33,486
He's nice when he's with you.

342
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:35,446
He went with Phim behind your back.

343
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:37,126
That's just like how he does his business.

344
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:39,325
He acted like he was signing with JP,

345
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:41,446
only to talk to the other dock owners.

346
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,110
That's his nature.

347
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,566
I think that's just business.

348
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,686
Kuer does not cheat.

349
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:53,269
He's just looking for the best option for C-Itsara's business.

350
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,350
Un!

351
00:29:55,246 --> 00:29:56,966
I work for C-Itsara,

352
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,166
not for our grandfather's JP.

353
00:30:00,085 --> 00:30:02,406
It's not my fault that this is my opinion.

354
00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:05,406
I didn't expect

355
00:30:05,757 --> 00:30:07,686
that you'd be helping someone like Kuer.

356
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:09,766
You know it darn well

357
00:30:09,894 --> 00:30:11,646
that he lies about all the little things.

358
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:14,006
He didn't tell you the truth about that.

359
00:30:14,262 --> 00:30:15,646
When it comes to something bigger,

360
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:17,566
he'd surely manipulate you.

361
00:30:18,406 --> 00:30:21,526
I'm warning you because I love you. Don't trust him.

362
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:23,446
Someone who can do this

363
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:24,926
can't be trusted

364
00:30:25,086 --> 00:30:26,446
with anything at all!

365
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:42,046
What's up, Mr. Noot?

366
00:30:42,862 --> 00:30:45,366
You looked at JP's internal documents.

367
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:47,286
You can't be doing this.

368
00:30:52,076 --> 00:30:53,926
If your mind is not made up,

369
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,686
you shouldn't have acted like you were signing with us.

370
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:59,286
You shouldn't have asked for our internal documents.

371
00:30:59,494 --> 00:31:01,126
That's not fair.

372
00:31:02,358 --> 00:31:03,886
JP was unfair to me first.

373
00:31:04,037 --> 00:31:05,326
How?

374
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:07,806
It's the benefits of the deal.

375
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,406
That was unfair.

376
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,286
I'm revising them.

377
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:14,086
I'll make it as we discussed.

378
00:31:14,526 --> 00:31:16,046
You're too slow with that.

379
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:19,206
It's as if you guys are trying to stall.

380
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:21,346
I think it's not my fault

381
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:23,406
to look at other owners.

382
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:25,726
Like you look at someone else's wife?

383
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:33,526
About that too.

384
00:31:35,205 --> 00:31:38,966
I can assure you that I'm not having an affair with your wife.

385
00:31:39,182 --> 00:31:41,406
I don't know where you got these ideas.

386
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:44,766
And I want you to stop manipulating Un with this.

387
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:48,086
I don't intend to steal anyone's woman.

388
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:53,006
You can say anything.

389
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:55,671
It's what you do that count.

390
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,333
Only you know that for sure.

391
00:31:58,862 --> 00:32:00,006
That's right.

392
00:32:00,421 --> 00:32:02,421
But if I were you, I wouldn't blame someone else.

393
00:32:02,998 --> 00:32:05,126
I'd go back and see why

394
00:32:05,893 --> 00:32:07,926
my wife would want somebody else.

395
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,976
Noot! What are you doing? Stop!

396
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:18,520
Stop! Noot! Stop!

397
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:20,286
I said stop! No!

398
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:22,486
- Stop it!  - Let him go, Phim!

399
00:32:28,806 --> 00:32:30,566
That's enough, Noot!

400
00:32:36,477 --> 00:32:37,606
Of course,

401
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:39,941
you love him!

402
00:32:40,766 --> 00:32:42,406
You still love him even after you broke up.

403
00:32:43,325 --> 00:32:45,646
You married me, and yet you came back to him.

404
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,766
No matter how good I am, I'm still not him.

405
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,846
I'll tell you this.

406
00:32:53,686 --> 00:32:55,966
I'll never let him be with you.

407
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,726
If you don't stop picking a fight,

408
00:32:59,196 --> 00:33:00,766
I'll leave you myself.

409
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,766
Let's go, Kuer.

410
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:05,332
Noot!

411
00:33:05,597 --> 00:33:08,606
If you don't stop, I'll stop you myself.

412
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:11,206
Noot! Stop!

413
00:33:13,646 --> 00:33:14,966
I'm on my way.

414
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:17,566
That's enough, Noot!

415
00:33:17,685 --> 00:33:19,766
Stop please, sir!

416
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:21,200
- Don't do this!  - Let's go!

417
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,372
Stop please, sir.

418
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,126
- Let me go!  - Don't do this, please.

419
00:33:25,374 --> 00:33:26,446
Please.

420
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:28,366
- What's going on?  - Let me go!

421
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:32,086
Noot?

422
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:39,686
Phim, let go of me.

423
00:33:45,486 --> 00:33:47,126
What's going on, Kuer?

424
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:53,926
It's nothing. Thank you.

425
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:56,526
I'll go to my room to wash my face. We'll talk later.

426
00:33:57,206 --> 00:33:58,526
Kuer.

427
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:02,166
May I tend to your wounds?

428
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:07,286
It's the least I could do to apologize for Noot.

429
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,526
I rather not.

430
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:11,726
I don't want it to escalate further.

431
00:34:14,414 --> 00:34:16,086
I'm sorry, Kuer.

432
00:34:17,326 --> 00:34:19,286
I don't want us to be like this.

433
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:47,126
Phim!

434
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:48,686
Don't do this, Phim.

435
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:51,046
I don't want any more misunderstandings.

436
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:01,686
Phim!

437
00:35:07,123 --> 00:35:09,446
What did I do to disgust you?

438
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,806
You never wanted to stop dating me.

439
00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:19,366
Why can't we get back together now?

440
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:23,526
It's not the same anymore, Phim.

441
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:30,566
I can get a divorce.

442
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,206
I don't love you anymore.

443
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,126
I see you just as a friend.

444
00:35:43,286 --> 00:35:45,326
That's all we will ever be, Phim.

445
00:35:45,617 --> 00:35:48,846
(My heart feels frustrated.)

446
00:35:48,953 --> 00:35:52,596
(I'm afraid I'd be left with no one.)

447
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:56,709
(I know I love you with all my heart.)

448
00:35:56,847 --> 00:36:00,384
(I don't know if that will be enough for you.)

449
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:04,478
(If someday that doesn't matter,)

450
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:07,566
(will I be able to live)

451
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:11,806
(a life without you.)

452
00:36:17,286 --> 00:36:21,446
(If all I have is love, would that be enough?)

453
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:25,606
(I don't know what it will take.)

454
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:29,566
(My heart feels frustrated.)

455
00:36:29,806 --> 00:36:33,446
(I'm afraid I'd be left with no one.)

456
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:37,726
(I know I love you with all my heart.)

457
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:51,686
How did you know Kuer and I are here?

458
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:55,926
It's just a coincidence.

459
00:36:57,293 --> 00:36:58,526
Coincidence?

460
00:36:58,837 --> 00:37:00,526
That we were in the same place?

461
00:37:00,861 --> 00:37:03,366
That we both had a meeting at ten?

462
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:09,686
Do you know that our grandfather is well aware

463
00:37:09,846 --> 00:37:11,766
that C-Itsara would betray us like this?

464
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:15,446
This isn't betraying.

465
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:18,486
I'm C-Itsara's adviser.

466
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:23,846
The offers from the small docks could be what C-Itsara is looking for.

467
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:27,806
I believe that if Grandfather had my options,

468
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:29,366
he'd have done the same.

469
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:36,346
I'm asking you this as a Jangwangprawas.

470
00:37:36,646 --> 00:37:38,086
What will you say to Grandfather?

471
00:37:38,942 --> 00:37:40,806
I'll say what I said to you.

472
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:54,646
Kuer is making me worried about you.

473
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:57,806
I know what a man is like.

474
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:00,006
You need to be careful of him.

475
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,766
He might not be the good guy you think he is.

476
00:38:18,486 --> 00:38:22,006
I don't get many likes, and I don't get sponsors.

477
00:38:22,214 --> 00:38:25,766
I followed them to Phuket, and yet they ran to Bangkok.

478
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:28,806
Where would I get my news now?

479
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:31,966
What's the matter, Sa?

480
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:36,126
You dropped a big news yesterday. Didn't you get likes?

481
00:38:36,853 --> 00:38:40,366
I did, but it's not many.

482
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:43,043
I posted a photo, and I blurred their faces.

483
00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:44,766
No one could tell who they were.

484
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:47,205
I really can't with you.

485
00:38:47,406 --> 00:38:49,086
You keep prying about someone else's life.

486
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:50,574
Don't you get tired?

487
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:53,846
I'm stressed enough with my friends and myself.

488
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:55,766
I'm more tired when I don't get news.

489
00:38:55,886 --> 00:38:58,526
I have been getting way fewer likes on my page lately.

490
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:02,646
I'm just dying to post that video of Phim fighting her hubby.

491
00:39:02,766 --> 00:39:04,166
If you didn't stop me,

492
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:06,886
I'd have gotten some serious views as soon as I posted it.

493
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,376
Do you care about your views?

494
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,479
Look.

495
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:12,806
The Jangwangprawas family is not just some rich people.

496
00:39:13,038 --> 00:39:14,446
They have powers.

497
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:17,467
If you mess with the chairman's beloved grandson

498
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:18,989
and write discrediting news about him,

499
00:39:19,085 --> 00:39:21,566
I promise you'd get killed.

500
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:25,686
Look, it's 2023 now. We have laws.

501
00:39:26,013 --> 00:39:27,446
Listen to me.

502
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,006
My seniors said this.

503
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:33,326
Chanoot's father didn't die in an accident as reported.

504
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,686
Nobody dared to say how he died.

505
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:46,566
San!

506
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,366
San!

507
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:51,206
What do you know?

508
00:39:51,342 --> 00:39:54,286
Tell me all of it. Don't keep it to yourself.

509
00:39:54,446 --> 00:39:56,446
Everyone was talking about it back then.

510
00:39:56,581 --> 00:39:57,606
What did they say?

511
00:39:57,749 --> 00:39:59,606
- I don't know.  - Hey!

512
00:39:59,926 --> 00:40:02,006
I wasn't in the force back then.

513
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:03,766
- But someone talked?  - Yeah.

514
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:05,863
- You heard they talked.  - Yeah.

515
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:08,486
But you didn't know what about because you weren't in the force.

516
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,566
- That's right.  - Darn it!

517
00:40:10,957 --> 00:40:14,606
Why would you tease my curiosity without knowing?

518
00:40:14,797 --> 00:40:16,486
You know what? If you're dying to know,

519
00:40:16,606 --> 00:40:18,646
I'll ask my seniors tomorrow, okay?

520
00:40:18,758 --> 00:40:20,641
- Really?  - Yeah.

521
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:22,366
- Surely?  - Stop!

522
00:40:22,526 --> 00:40:23,806
That song tells your age.

523
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:25,806
How does that tell my age?

524
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:29,046
Only people in their 50s know that song.

525
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:30,526
If you finish that song with me,

526
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,565
I will look as old as Michael Jackson.

527
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:34,464
You're not young if you listen to MJ.

528
00:40:34,573 --> 00:40:37,846
Look. I may be 30, but I look 13.

529
00:40:38,046 --> 00:40:40,406
If you had sex with me, you'd be committing statutory rape.

530
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,942
You? Thirteen?

531
00:40:43,046 --> 00:40:47,206
- That's right.  - Thirteen hundred, maybe. You're a dinosaur.

532
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:50,686
- You...  - My name is San.

533
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:53,073
Don't call me names. No!

534
00:40:53,246 --> 00:40:54,666
San!

535
00:40:55,222 --> 00:40:58,206
(JP - 2017 Budget Summary)

536
00:40:58,814 --> 00:41:01,086
I reviewed all the documents last night.

537
00:41:01,246 --> 00:41:04,206
It's true that some departments have increased expenditures.

538
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:06,326
But nothing was off.

539
00:41:06,828 --> 00:41:09,966
Labor and material costs have been going up every year anyway.

540
00:41:11,086 --> 00:41:13,806
I think it's a miscalculation on the accounting's part.

541
00:41:13,982 --> 00:41:16,406
That's what falsely made the expenditure increase by 30%.

542
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,606
Does Noot know about this?

543
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:23,789
Not yet.

544
00:41:23,932 --> 00:41:26,366
Noot wasn't here last night. He asked me to take care of it.

545
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,733
I finished reviewing them all

546
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:30,766
because I was afraid you'd be anxious.

547
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:32,766
That's why I came here to report ASAP.

548
00:41:35,852 --> 00:41:37,646
- Thanks.  - Yes.

549
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:54,366
How did it go, Rit?

550
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:56,566
Grandfather has no problem with it.

551
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:58,206
He said he'd check it later.

552
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:19,486
How did it go?

553
00:42:20,197 --> 00:42:22,286
Did you get to be alone with him like you wanted?

554
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:30,326
If I were alone with him,

555
00:42:30,438 --> 00:42:32,806
I wouldn't be sitting here right now.

556
00:42:35,341 --> 00:42:36,846
You didn't care about your husband

557
00:42:36,943 --> 00:42:38,943
and rushed to help your ex.

558
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,326
I don't know who's the promiscuous one now.

559
00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:51,246
Do you feel less guilty by slapping me?

560
00:42:52,374 --> 00:42:55,286
You acted as if my insults were unbearable.

561
00:42:55,646 --> 00:42:58,046
But I was actually speaking facts.

562
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,566
(Grandfather)

563
00:43:39,846 --> 00:43:41,206
How did it go, Noot?

564
00:43:41,566 --> 00:43:43,886
They really came here for a meeting with the other dock owners.

565
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:45,966
Did you manage to stop them?

566
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,461
I followed them on time,

567
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,766
but they moved up the appointment.

568
00:43:55,429 --> 00:43:57,366
You weren't being smart.

569
00:43:59,134 --> 00:44:00,926
They haven't signed anything.

570
00:44:01,526 --> 00:44:03,366
The owners just submitted an offer to Kuer.

571
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,966
Submitting an offer is half the deal done.

572
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:08,166
If you miss this deal again,

573
00:44:08,365 --> 00:44:12,326
they will laugh at you like a fool.

574
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:14,966
How are you this foolish?

575
00:44:51,197 --> 00:44:53,197
I was waiting for you in the room.

576
00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:55,286
You already took a shower and got changed?

577
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:02,181
Are you hurt?

578
00:45:04,174 --> 00:45:05,486
A little bit.

579
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:08,286
Your concern has just healed me.

580
00:45:11,669 --> 00:45:14,006
It's almost noon. Should we head out for lunch?

581
00:45:15,868 --> 00:45:16,868
Let's go.

582
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,526
Our job is done.

583
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:25,886
We can hold hands and stay in the same room without worrying about

584
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,446
being seen that the executive and the adviser are dating.

585
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:30,486
I'm still mad at you.

586
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,086
But I love you.

587
00:45:35,101 --> 00:45:36,101
Shall we go?

588
00:45:42,846 --> 00:45:44,566
I think Noot followed us here

589
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:48,126
partly because they can't afford to miss a deal with C-Itsara.

590
00:45:54,774 --> 00:45:57,446
Hey, where are you going? Our car is over there.

591
00:45:59,078 --> 00:46:00,766
Come with me. You'll see.

592
00:47:15,446 --> 00:47:16,966
Noot probably found out about you and Phim

593
00:47:17,326 --> 00:47:19,046
because that guy tailed you.

594
00:47:19,846 --> 00:47:23,606
There's nothing between Phim and me. Why don't you believe me?

595
00:47:23,989 --> 00:47:26,566
Because he had evidence that it was possible.

596
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,766
What would make you believe that I don't have feelings for Phim?

597
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:37,246
Should I stop being her friend altogether?

598
00:47:51,206 --> 00:47:53,566
I'm sorry for being too insecure.

599
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:57,686
I should have trusted you more.

600
00:48:00,213 --> 00:48:01,726
You were insecure

601
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,406
because you were in love, weren't you?

602
00:48:18,616 --> 00:48:20,406
You don't have to stop being her friend.

603
00:48:21,926 --> 00:48:25,286
I don't know what it is about Phim that you couldn't tell me,

604
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:30,286
but it always hit your soft spot for her.

605
00:48:34,446 --> 00:48:36,206
If you don't have feelings for Phim,

606
00:48:37,702 --> 00:48:39,286
can you not show her that soft spot?

607
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:44,166
Show that soft spot to who?

608
00:48:53,406 --> 00:48:54,846
(Kan)

609
00:49:01,093 --> 00:49:02,246
(Mr. Noot.)

610
00:49:02,485 --> 00:49:04,086
Those two are leaving.

611
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:06,646
I can't follow them. They noticed me.

612
00:49:11,565 --> 00:49:13,326
Should we get some lunch?

613
00:49:14,198 --> 00:49:15,574
Let's eat here.

614
00:49:15,964 --> 00:49:17,686
I want to talk about work.

615
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:30,246
This is the revised offer, as discussed.

616
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:00,086
It looks good.

617
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,909
You can stop going behind my back now, right?

618
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:12,686
If you had offered this in the first place,

619
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,166
C-Itsara wouldn't even have looked at other deals.

620
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:22,006
Can we proceed with the signing?

621
00:50:24,365 --> 00:50:27,206
I need to present this to our senior executives.

622
00:50:27,686 --> 00:50:28,806
If they approve,

623
00:50:29,086 --> 00:50:30,846
I'll be willing to sign it immediately.

624
00:50:37,021 --> 00:50:40,086
Could you fetch the old JP papers for me?

625
00:50:42,486 --> 00:50:43,486
Okay.

626
00:51:06,046 --> 00:51:07,326
Please get in.

627
00:51:18,813 --> 00:51:20,846
I'm going to see Kuer.

628
00:51:21,317 --> 00:51:22,966
I'm glad I ran into you.

629
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:45,246
It probably got on me when Kuer took his shirt off.

630
00:51:46,213 --> 00:51:47,806
Please give it back to him.

631
00:52:43,046 --> 00:52:45,566
Why do I love you so much?

632
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:58,726
If we break up one day, will you still love me?

633
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:03,846
I don't know.

634
00:53:05,446 --> 00:53:07,086
If you still love me,

635
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:09,406
I'll still love you too.

636
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:17,766
I promise

637
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:23,546
I'll take care of you until you don't need me anymore.

638
00:53:29,093 --> 00:53:30,646
You're such a sweet talker.

639
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:46,446
I don't love you anymore. I see you just as a friend.

640
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,846
That's all we will ever be, Phim.

641
00:53:56,046 --> 00:53:58,286
If Kuer is not the father,

642
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:01,366
I'd rather not have it.

643
00:54:25,046 --> 00:54:28,246
Was this the reason he rushed to shower?

644
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,846
Are these the papers you wanted?

645
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:59,806
Yes, they are.

646
00:55:01,246 --> 00:55:02,526
Thank you, Un.

647
00:55:05,006 --> 00:55:07,686
This new offer looks fair.

648
00:55:12,413 --> 00:55:15,086
I hope C-Itsara will accept this offer

649
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:17,406
and won't go behind our backs again.

650
00:55:30,806 --> 00:55:32,286
Let's head back to Phuket.

651
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,766
Why don't you stay for a bit?

652
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:39,846
I'd rather head back.

653
00:55:40,526 --> 00:55:42,006
I don't want Phim to feel uncomfortable.

654
00:56:05,406 --> 00:56:08,366
Are you mad? Talking to Kuer like that?

655
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,166
I saw you get uncomfortable

656
00:56:13,414 --> 00:56:15,646
at how lovey-dovey Kuer and Un were.

657
00:56:16,454 --> 00:56:17,806
Am I wrong?

658
00:56:22,886 --> 00:56:24,606
I'm always looking at you, Phim.

659
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:27,132
I don't know what you're planning to do.

660
00:56:28,381 --> 00:56:30,126
But I want to let you know

661
00:56:30,366 --> 00:56:32,006
that I take very good care of you.

662
00:56:32,246 --> 00:56:33,686
I never let you struggle.

663
00:56:33,822 --> 00:56:36,246
I give you money to spend all your life comfortably.

664
00:56:36,917 --> 00:56:39,326
Isn't that what you wanted by marrying me?

665
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,966
You have everything today.

666
00:56:42,726 --> 00:56:44,326
Why would you still try?

667
00:56:44,982 --> 00:56:46,526
Because I want to have love.

668
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:49,566
I chose you for money back then.

669
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:51,606
I thought love would follow.

670
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:53,566
But it didn't.

671
00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:56,686
The more you fool around,

672
00:56:56,853 --> 00:56:59,278
the more I hate myself for choosing you.

673
00:57:06,326 --> 00:57:07,846
I'll be waiting downstairs.

674
00:57:09,405 --> 00:57:10,526
Noot!

675
00:57:11,463 --> 00:57:12,646
Noot!

676
00:57:14,366 --> 00:57:15,886
I'm your husband, Phim!

677
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:21,526
Stop it! Noot! Stop!

678
00:57:22,686 --> 00:57:25,606
You can hate me, but you must live with me.

679
00:57:25,966 --> 00:57:28,206
No! Noot!

680
00:57:29,942 --> 00:57:31,486
Are you out of your mind?

681
00:57:33,965 --> 00:57:35,566
You may be married to me,

682
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:38,326
but you have no right to make me do anything!

683
00:58:00,406 --> 00:58:01,806
Here it is.

684
00:58:07,774 --> 00:58:09,046
(Mr. Noot)

685
00:58:15,197 --> 00:58:16,446
Yes, Mr. Noot.

686
00:58:18,558 --> 00:58:20,086
Today?

687
00:58:21,846 --> 00:58:24,366
Okay. I'll do it for you.

688
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:29,206
Was that Noot? What did he say?

689
00:58:29,311 --> 00:58:31,366
He told me to book a flight back to Phuket.

690
00:58:31,526 --> 00:58:33,022
He wants the earliest flight.

691
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:35,366
He said he was leaving the golf resort.

692
00:58:36,294 --> 00:58:38,006
You should get it done.

693
00:58:38,485 --> 00:58:39,686
Okay.

694
00:58:53,006 --> 00:58:55,146
Nobody will see this set of documents again.

695
00:59:07,814 --> 00:59:11,886
Un, you haven't said a word since we talked to Noot.

696
00:59:12,525 --> 00:59:15,286
What do you want me to say? Our job went well.

697
00:59:15,405 --> 00:59:18,194
Should we stay here for one more night?

698
00:59:18,477 --> 00:59:20,606
Let's celebrate us getting the job done.

699
00:59:22,932 --> 00:59:24,024
Silence means yes.

700
00:59:24,189 --> 00:59:26,286
No. I'm going back.

701
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:27,397
Un.

702
00:59:28,102 --> 00:59:31,006
You can stay at my apartment. I don't want to go back to Phuket yet.

703
00:59:33,117 --> 00:59:36,126
Okay. I'll be staying with Gade.

704
00:59:36,335 --> 00:59:38,726
What? Why won't you stay with me?

705
00:59:39,508 --> 00:59:40,686
No.

706
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:50,966
Un.

707
00:59:51,342 --> 00:59:53,806
Are you really not staying with me tonight?

708
00:59:54,046 --> 00:59:57,246
No. I'll be staying with Gade while I'm in Bangkok.

709
01:00:10,966 --> 01:00:12,766
Why are you following me?

710
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:14,846
I'm here to see you off.

711
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:26,326
It's here.

712
01:00:26,462 --> 01:00:28,286
You can go back to your place.

713
01:00:35,944 --> 01:00:37,566
- I'll be staying with you tonight.  - What?

714
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:44,246
Good evening, Mr. Kuer.

715
01:00:44,645 --> 01:00:47,966
Good evening. Please let me stay with you tonight.

716
01:00:48,126 --> 01:00:49,886
- With me?  - Yes.

717
01:00:50,269 --> 01:00:51,606
Thank you.

718
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:58,366
Can you share a guy with a friend?

719
01:00:59,749 --> 01:01:03,086
This is crazy. A guy asked to stay with me.

720
01:01:26,918 --> 01:01:28,918
Are you not going back to your place?

721
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:34,086
You're staying here. I'm willing to stay here with you.

722
01:01:36,576 --> 01:01:37,806
Mr. Kuer.

723
01:01:38,026 --> 01:01:39,966
We only have

724
01:01:40,301 --> 01:01:42,446
one bedroom.

725
01:01:42,621 --> 01:01:45,286
Let me take a shower, please.

726
01:01:46,646 --> 01:01:47,926
A shower?

727
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:50,646
You can't take a shower here. Hey!

728
01:01:54,046 --> 01:01:55,446
Showering together?

729
01:01:59,038 --> 01:02:00,038
I...

730
01:02:00,904 --> 01:02:03,926
When did I die? Why can't nobody hear me?

731
01:02:05,269 --> 01:02:06,566
This is my place.

732
01:02:06,758 --> 01:02:09,486
Only my boyfriend can stay here, right?

733
01:02:10,614 --> 01:02:12,206
If I stay, I will just be in their way.

734
01:02:16,646 --> 01:02:17,886
I should head out.

735
01:02:23,966 --> 01:02:25,926
Hey! Kuer.

736
01:02:27,165 --> 01:02:28,846
Don't you have any respect for my friend?

737
01:02:29,117 --> 01:02:31,166
Do you want to shower? Take it at your own place.

738
01:02:40,909 --> 01:02:43,326
Come with me then, will you?

739
01:02:44,046 --> 01:02:45,566
We can save water.

740
01:03:00,286 --> 01:03:02,646
Hey! What are you doing?

741
01:03:02,956 --> 01:03:05,166
I'll help you take it off.

742
01:03:05,302 --> 01:03:08,086
Are you mad? If you want to take a shower, take it then.

743
01:03:13,717 --> 01:03:16,326
Is he mad? Did he try to undress me just now?

744
01:03:24,006 --> 01:03:25,806
Are you really not taking a shower with me?

745
01:03:26,046 --> 01:03:27,501
I'm not. Just hurry and take it.

746
01:03:27,631 --> 01:03:30,206
- Go! Let me go!  - Come with me.

747
01:03:32,862 --> 01:03:34,326
What's wrong with him?

748
01:03:41,111 --> 01:03:42,806
Gade!

749
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:46,006
Gade?

750
01:03:50,646 --> 01:03:52,766
Have you disappeared on me now?

751
01:03:53,726 --> 01:03:56,606
(Un)

752
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:01,966
I left to give you a chance. Why are you calling me?

753
01:04:04,486 --> 01:04:05,766
(Where are you?)

754
01:04:05,966 --> 01:04:07,326
I'm eating some noodles.

755
01:04:08,269 --> 01:04:10,269
Why would you? Come back here now.

756
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:13,886
Do you want me to die of jealousy in there?

757
01:04:14,252 --> 01:04:15,446
What jealousy?

758
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:20,006
The two of you are so lovey-dovey that I don't even exist.

759
01:04:20,246 --> 01:04:21,806
(Do you want me to watch that?)

760
01:04:22,477 --> 01:04:23,566
Gade.

761
01:04:23,702 --> 01:04:26,606
Tonight, I'll be eating until dawn.

762
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:28,230
(The two of you)

763
01:04:28,366 --> 01:04:30,966
can hold hands in bed all you want.

764
01:04:34,654 --> 01:04:36,046
What is this?

765
01:04:36,494 --> 01:04:39,366
Darn it, Gade!

766
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:46,406
You're not here. How can I tell him to go home?

767
01:04:48,869 --> 01:04:50,446
How about telling me where to sleep?

768
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:57,766
You...

769
01:04:59,086 --> 01:05:02,446
If you want to stay here, you will need to sleep on the couch.

770
01:05:04,606 --> 01:05:05,766
Fine.

771
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:30,566
Let me go.

772
01:05:31,646 --> 01:05:33,646
I'm not in the mood to play with you.

773
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:38,566
Can you at least tell me what you're mad about?

774
01:05:39,606 --> 01:05:40,966
I'm not mad.

775
01:05:42,326 --> 01:05:45,686
You're not? Then why are you acting like this?

776
01:05:54,365 --> 01:05:58,406
Are you really sleeping on the couch and won't go home?

777
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:19,606
I want to take a shower.

778
01:06:25,046 --> 01:06:26,326
Good night.

779
01:06:43,526 --> 01:06:45,326
Phim.

780
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:49,886
Phim. Come on, Phim.

781
01:06:55,389 --> 01:06:56,606
Phim.

782
01:06:58,446 --> 01:06:59,766
Phim.

783
01:07:02,469 --> 01:07:03,966
Phim, stop.

784
01:07:04,206 --> 01:07:05,966
Won't you stay home for a night?

785
01:07:07,558 --> 01:07:10,686
I'll only stay here if you don't.

786
01:07:12,164 --> 01:07:15,206
I don't even want to breathe the same air as you.

787
01:07:17,686 --> 01:07:19,086
What's wrong with me?

788
01:07:19,677 --> 01:07:21,166
It's you who is at fault.

789
01:07:21,373 --> 01:07:23,766
You should realize what you're doing is wrong.

790
01:07:28,373 --> 01:07:29,766
I was wrong

791
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,486
for choosing someone like you.

792
01:07:34,566 --> 01:07:36,846
But you're not in the wrong for cheating on your husband?

793
01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:39,366
I'm in the wrong for everything.

794
01:07:41,366 --> 01:07:42,806
Will you divorce me, then?

795
01:07:43,646 --> 01:07:45,006
Phim. Noot.

796
01:08:09,822 --> 01:08:11,806
Nothing will be signed

797
01:08:12,326 --> 01:08:15,406
until we find out who ordered the hit on Kuer last night.

798
01:08:16,086 --> 01:08:18,726
If you're accusing him, show your evidence.

799
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:20,926
Are you protecting your husband now?

800
01:08:21,575 --> 01:08:25,726
That's weird. You seemed desperate for a new husband.
