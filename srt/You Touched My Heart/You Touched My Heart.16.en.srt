1
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:48,406
Un seems to notice the earrings Kuer gave me.

2
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:52,166
This might ignite the flame I need.

3
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:54,901
Mr. Rit, you are involved.

4
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:58,126
I don't know anything.

5
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:02,446
Un brought a box of documents home.

6
00:02:02,613 --> 00:02:06,006
I'll go upstairs to look. If she comes up, call me.

7
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,500
I told my men to inform the hospital

8
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:13,246
to tell me if someone called Kan came in.

9
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:15,421
I'm coming with you.

10
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:20,486
Lieutenant.

11
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:23,604
Assign undercover cops to watch this place 24/7.

12
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:24,806
Yes, sir.

13
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:27,086
Is that him?

14
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:30,766
Looking at his condition, he probably can't tell us anything.

15
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:33,086
I'll call Un.

16
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:34,846
Tell her to come to your house.

17
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:37,966
Aren't you jumping the gun? You sure are missing her.

18
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:44,766
What are you looking at?

19
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:46,726
Don't get hungry on me.

20
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:50,406
- Hungry for what?  - You should stand with her.

21
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,350
I think Kan saw who attacked him.

22
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:03,566
We probably need to wait for him to heal up.

23
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:08,806
Un! Sit down.

24
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,926
Thanks.

25
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:12,206
How is Kan doing?

26
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:15,166
He's in bad shape.

27
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:20,417
Don't worry, Un. I assigned my men to guard him. You can rest easy.

28
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:22,326
Okay.

29
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:27,926
I took some documents home yesterday.

30
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:30,646
I set up a camera in my room.

31
00:03:37,293 --> 00:03:38,926
Look what I found.

32
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,566
Here.

33
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:52,486
- Rit?  - He just goes through your stuff?

34
00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:54,206
I went down for dinner.

35
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,286
Rit came home and snuck into my room.

36
00:03:58,148 --> 00:04:01,926
Can this be used as evidence?

37
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:05,566
Yeah. That way, I don't have to see Tony again.

38
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:11,606
- Crap!  - Crap!

39
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:14,006
That's a sitcom scene.

40
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:29,486
I asked Tony for a ride here so that people wouldn't suspect me.

41
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:37,566
Come on.

42
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:44,246
Are we leaving, Un?

43
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,126
I need five more minutes, Tony.

44
00:04:54,165 --> 00:04:55,926
Let's talk outside.

45
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:17,926
This is not the time for that.

46
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:22,126
Again!

47
00:05:22,646 --> 00:05:24,806
How long was your dry spell?

48
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,406
Are you mad?

49
00:05:30,853 --> 00:05:32,126
No.

50
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:36,566
This is your idea.

51
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,166
I know.

52
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:44,926
That doesn't mean I'm okay with you always being with Tony.

53
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,846
I miss you.

54
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,006
We'll get married when we're done with this.

55
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:22,646
I don't want to miss you like this again.

56
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,886
Okay. Let's get married.

57
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:57,926
Text me when you get home.

58
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:00,246
Don't worry.

59
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,206
She's safer with me than with you.

60
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,246
I was talking to Un.

61
00:07:07,781 --> 00:07:09,366
I'm just saying.

62
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,406
Let's not fight.

63
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:16,086
You will see him tomorrow anyway.

64
00:07:18,326 --> 00:07:19,566
I have to go.

65
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,166
Let's go.

66
00:07:58,486 --> 00:07:59,806
Kuer.

67
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:04,766
You're jealous.

68
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:07,686
What are you talking about?

69
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:09,286
There's something.

70
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:11,806
What?

71
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:13,926
Listen to me.

72
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:16,086
There's a possibility.

73
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,766
Just get straight to the point.

74
00:08:17,878 --> 00:08:20,046
- Is there no context needed?  - That's a waste of time.

75
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,926
Mr. Rit probably killed Mr. Noot.

76
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,406
Nam's family are fishermen.

77
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:32,606
They might have had another boat to pick Rit up from Noot's boat.

78
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:36,486
I'll look at the CCTV at her apartment tomorrow.

79
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:39,686
I'll see what time Nam and Rit left and arrived.

80
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:58,586
- Thank you.  - Yeah.

81
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:24,966
We'll get married when we're done with this.

82
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,297
I don't want to miss you like this again.

83
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:28,566
Okay.

84
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:30,006
Let's get married.

85
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:37,006
Un.

86
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:41,926
Well...

87
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,206
I have something to ask.

88
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:49,046
What?

89
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:54,446
Why are you so sure that Phim's baby

90
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:56,566
is not Kuer's?

91
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:01,846
I'm not saying he's lying.

92
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:05,806
I just want you to think about it again.

93
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:13,126
I'll go home now.

94
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,246
Good night.

95
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:51,886
What are you looking at?

96
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:56,126
I want to ask about the earrings you're wearing.

97
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,046
These earrings?

98
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:07,606
Are you sure you want to hear it?

99
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:28,526
You came home late. You snuck out to see Kuer, didn't you?

100
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,166
Do you remember the earrings Phim was wearing last night?

101
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:44,206
Yeah, I do.

102
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,446
What about them?

103
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:49,246
I saw Phim earlier.

104
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,686
She said Kuer gave her those earrings.

105
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,046
What?

106
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:58,266
Kuer told me they were his sister's.

107
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:00,246
Does that mean he lied?

108
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:05,926
Now,

109
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:10,086
tell me exactly what Phim said, word by word.

110
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:22,366
My mom wants everyone to think that my baby is Noot's.

111
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,869
If you're saying it's Kuer's, just stop.

112
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,326
I think the doctor's evidence should be able to tell

113
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,926
that you got pregnant before you saw Kuer at the golf resort.

114
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:40,246
Kuer and I have known each other for a long time.

115
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:43,446
We could have been seeing each other

116
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:46,166
somewhere other than that golf course, couldn't we?

117
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:58,006
You said you saw one of those earrings at Kuer's apartment.

118
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,366
That means

119
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:04,826
Phim dropped it, and Kuer lied to you

120
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:09,006
because he didn't want you to know he just hooked up with someone.

121
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:13,806
That's peak drama!

122
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,566
(Mr. Rit, you're involved.)

123
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:40,846
(I don't know anything.)

124
00:13:41,006 --> 00:13:42,841
(Accounting is your direct responsibility.)

125
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:46,206
(If you have problems, you have to solve them yourself.)

126
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:28,326
Where do you think you're going?

127
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,446
We can talk about this, Mr. Rit.

128
00:14:37,726 --> 00:14:39,446
Are you trying to betray me?

129
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:17,406
It's me. You can go back to sleep.

130
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:19,726
Why are you here now? It's almost dawn.

131
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:21,846
I took care of some business.

132
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,806
You're not talking about Mek, right?

133
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:29,526
You asked me to, didn't you?

134
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:06,926
Sir, don't. Don't do that.

135
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,246
Don't do that. It's dangerous.

136
00:16:09,414 --> 00:16:12,046
Sir, stop.

137
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,613
You won't pull anything now, right?

138
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:21,846
If I let you go, you must stay still.

139
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,197
Do you have something to tell us?

140
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:04,686
What is it?

141
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:09,726
What? Okay.

142
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:16,486
What now?

143
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,546
Kan just came to.

144
00:17:19,862 --> 00:17:22,086
What? He came to?

145
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:27,686
He just came to. Why are we rushing there?

146
00:17:29,155 --> 00:17:32,666
What? It was warm to cuddle with me, right?

147
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:36,046
I'll be back for more, okay?

148
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:41,726
Enough. Stop joking. I'm curious. Tell me.

149
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:50,646
He writes "Un" on a piece of paper.

150
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:54,366
Can I come with you?

151
00:17:54,469 --> 00:17:55,884
Don't come. Stay here.

152
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:58,237
I'll tell you when I come back, okay?

153
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:00,846
- I'm off.  - Hey!

154
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,990
Can't I come with you?

155
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:05,086
Don't come. Wait for me in bed, okay?

156
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,446
I'll be back.

157
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,382
I'm off.

158
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:19,806
This is too interesting for me to sleep.

159
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:27,526
Where are you going, Un?

160
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,126
I'm going

161
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,406
- out...  - Un.

162
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:37,326
Let's go. I've been waiting.

163
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:40,206
- Yes, Mom.  - Where are you going?

164
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:43,606
I'm going to make some merits with Un.

165
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:47,446
I've been haunted by ghosts of my past lately,

166
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,726
so I'll make some merits to them.

167
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:53,166
Let's go.

168
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,126
Wan!

169
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:09,486
Aunt Wing is looking at us.

170
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:18,206
Where are you going, Un?

171
00:19:18,405 --> 00:19:19,766
To the hospital, Mom.

172
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:21,526
Did something happen to your grandfather?

173
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:23,966
No, I'm going for someone else. Let's go.

174
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,966
Let's get in the car. I'll tell you on the way.

175
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:33,686
You rushed here because Kan came to?

176
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:34,926
Yes.

177
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:37,989
- Ma'am, good morning.  - Good morning.

178
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:39,035
Good morning.

179
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:42,766
Something happened. I had to bring my mom along. Is that okay?

180
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:46,486
How is Kan doing?

181
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:49,286
I told her a bit already, San.

182
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:51,846
We can't tell right now.

183
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:56,526
He's on the respirator. He can only use his hands.

184
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,406
Kan wrote "Un." I think he has something to tell only her.

185
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:03,926
Let's get inside.

186
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:06,526
Please.

187
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:23,886
When the doctor says he can breathe on his own,

188
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:26,006
the respirator will be removed.

189
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:28,806
He's drowsy right now because of the meds.

190
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:33,966
Kan.

191
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:42,446
Kan, don't.

192
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:49,846
Do you have anything to tell me?

193
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:58,286
Wait for me.

194
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,326
We need to get food on our own this morning.

195
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:33,710
Wan is not here. She went out to make some merits.

196
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,286
Phim, we can eat out.

197
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:43,406
It's fine, Mom.

198
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:48,326
Aunt Nee, please make two dishes of stir-fried pork with basil on rice.

199
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:49,926
Of course, Mrs. Phim.

200
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:53,886
Phim.

201
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:55,526
You're pregnant.

202
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:58,006
Don't you have to eat more healthy food?

203
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:03,966
Your son is the only heir to JP.

204
00:22:06,086 --> 00:22:07,406
It's okay, Mom.

205
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:11,126
Healthy food, you say?

206
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:15,150
Does it have to be shark fin, abalone, or fish maw soup

207
00:22:15,254 --> 00:22:16,814
for every meal?

208
00:22:18,326 --> 00:22:19,726
My daughter is pregnant.

209
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,526
She needs to eat healthily to stay strong.

210
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:26,934
I think I should go and make some merits like Wan.

211
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:32,206
I'll share my merits with the ghosts from my past too,

212
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:34,381
so they can go away when they have enough.

213
00:22:45,806 --> 00:22:47,086
Mom.

214
00:22:48,638 --> 00:22:50,222
I don't even know if it's a boy or a girl.

215
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:52,966
If you say that, we'll be embarrassed if it turns out to be a girl.

216
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,406
When will you find out?

217
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:58,766
Today.

218
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,566
I have a doctor's appointment today.

219
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:05,437
I believe it's a boy.

220
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:15,846
What was Kan trying to write?

221
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:20,686
I can't read that either.

222
00:23:23,077 --> 00:23:24,166
Can I have a look?

223
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,509
Please.

224
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:33,486
"A"?

225
00:23:43,853 --> 00:23:45,766
Can I look again, please?

226
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,966
I'll visit your grandfather.

227
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:58,726
When you're done talking to Kuer and San, you can go.

228
00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:00,406
I'll be with your grandfather.

229
00:24:01,284 --> 00:24:04,206
- Okay.  - Try to figure out what Kan wrote.

230
00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:06,086
I'll walk with Un's mom.

231
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:07,926
This way, please.

232
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:24,366
I need to talk to you.

233
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,446
I need to talk to you about Phim.

234
00:24:36,813 --> 00:24:38,126
Phim?

235
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:41,846
When we first met, were you still seeing Phim?

236
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:45,006
Un.

237
00:24:45,511 --> 00:24:47,326
I broke up with Phim long ago.

238
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:51,446
We broke up because Phim married your brother

239
00:24:51,686 --> 00:24:53,086
and left me.

240
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:56,886
That's the day you saw me at the dumpster.

241
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:02,326
If you broke up, why was one of Phim's earrings at your apartment?

242
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:05,046
Earring?

243
00:25:05,256 --> 00:25:08,446
Yes. The day I dressed your wound,

244
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:10,646
I found a diamond earring.

245
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:13,086
You said it was your sister's.

246
00:25:13,422 --> 00:25:15,686
I saw it on Phim yesterday.

247
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,526
I don't think she's your sister.

248
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:31,166
Phim came over after you dressed my wound that night.

249
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:35,006
She probably dropped it, and you found it in the morning.

250
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:39,606
You mean Phim was with you that night?

251
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:41,286
Yes.

252
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:43,686
Did you sleep with her?

253
00:25:46,054 --> 00:25:49,606
Phim came to me and said she had a fight with Noot.

254
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,206
She asked to stay the night.

255
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:53,086
I insisted she

256
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:55,006
goes back and works things out with Noot.

257
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,486
I gave her a ride to a hotel.

258
00:25:57,646 --> 00:25:58,926
That's all, Un.

259
00:25:59,886 --> 00:26:01,446
You didn't answer my question.

260
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:04,126
I want to know if you slept with Phim that night.

261
00:26:04,268 --> 00:26:05,526
I didn't.

262
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:09,246
Since I broke up with her, I have never been with her again.

263
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:12,926
Un.

264
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,766
Phim is my friend. She's my ex.

265
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:19,133
She will never be anything more than that.

266
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:21,806
I'll say it again.

267
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:24,526
Since I broke up with her, I have never been with her again.

268
00:26:27,206 --> 00:26:29,046
I want to marry you, Un.

269
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:33,054
I've always kept my promises.

270
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:35,686
I'll never make you regret it.

271
00:26:39,726 --> 00:26:41,726
No matter how hard I try,

272
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,366
you still wouldn't believe in me.

273
00:26:48,446 --> 00:26:51,606
What do I need to do to make you believe in me?

274
00:27:17,646 --> 00:27:18,886
Good morning, sir.

275
00:27:20,526 --> 00:27:21,766
Why are you two together?

276
00:27:22,614 --> 00:27:24,206
I saw Mrs. Wan downstairs.

277
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:25,686
I just walked with her.

278
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:32,006
I'm glad you're here, Inspector.

279
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:36,166
What's going on with my grandson's case?

280
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:38,926
Well...

281
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:41,726
We have the DNA test results.

282
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:43,606
It's not Kuer's.

283
00:27:44,853 --> 00:27:46,326
If Kuer didn't do it,

284
00:27:46,686 --> 00:27:48,366
then who could it be?

285
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:50,814
I'm looking at all possibilities, sir.

286
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:53,566
If anyone is suspected,

287
00:27:53,886 --> 00:27:55,526
I'll get a court order

288
00:27:55,838 --> 00:27:57,486
for further questioning.

289
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:01,086
Please get it done, Inspector.

290
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:03,966
I hope my grandson didn't die in vain.

291
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,646
He didn't.

292
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:10,086
Right now, I think this case is more than what it seems.

293
00:28:10,677 --> 00:28:12,726
It's probably not about an affair.

294
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:20,606
Before Noot died,

295
00:28:21,846 --> 00:28:24,886
he was reviewing the company's accounting.

296
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:29,406
If you want to find out more about that, you can ask Rit.

297
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,206
Rit was helping Noot with that.

298
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:38,965
Yes.

299
00:28:39,526 --> 00:28:41,286
I'll investigate it further.

300
00:28:44,277 --> 00:28:45,566
I have to go now.

301
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:03,206
Rit.

302
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,326
Rit.

303
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,726
Rit.

304
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,126
Rit.

305
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,806
It's late.

306
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:18,572
You need to get to work.

307
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:24,446
I don't want to get up.

308
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,686
Nam.

309
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,126
Please wash the clothes I wore last night.

310
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:38,765
When you're done, donate them right away.

311
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:42,886
Okay. I'll do that.

312
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:46,006
You should get up, and I'll see you at the office.

313
00:29:55,318 --> 00:29:56,686
Get up.

314
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:11,606
Oh! Where are they now?

315
00:30:12,198 --> 00:30:14,198
When they're all lovey-dovey, I'm not important.

316
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:17,767
San.

317
00:30:17,989 --> 00:30:20,846
Kuer, I thought you went home.

318
00:30:25,397 --> 00:30:26,686
Are you okay with her?

319
00:30:32,338 --> 00:30:34,144
I talked to the chairman.

320
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:37,541
He said before Noot died,

321
00:30:37,694 --> 00:30:39,894
he was reviewing the company's accounting.

322
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:43,766
He was doing that with Rit, just as Un said.

323
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:46,846
I think the lead is in those accounting papers.

324
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:51,926
Tony said the numbers were made up.

325
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:55,366
That means Noot spotted the same thing Tony did.

326
00:30:57,806 --> 00:31:01,606
I think the head of accounting who nearly ran Un over the other day

327
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:03,846
is not the suspect we're looking for.

328
00:31:04,254 --> 00:31:06,726
I'll need him as a witness anyway.

329
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:08,366
I think that guy

330
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:10,526
knows a lot of things.

331
00:31:10,677 --> 00:31:12,677
Otherwise, when Un asked for the accounting papers,

332
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:15,886
he wouldn't have been in so much trouble that he tried to hurt you.

333
00:31:17,554 --> 00:31:19,926
I think we need to get in touch with that guy.

334
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,431
I'll call him right now.

335
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,659
Okay.

336
00:31:26,706 --> 00:31:30,326
(The number you dialed cannot be reached.)

337
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:31,886
His phone is off.

338
00:31:32,898 --> 00:31:35,166
Does the HR know his address?

339
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,798
I think so. Please wait.

340
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:43,726
Koong.

341
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,526
Do you have Noom's address?

342
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,406
We checked his recent call records.

343
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:54,646
His calls were mostly made to and from Mr. Thevarit.

344
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:59,206
His valuable belongings are all gone.

345
00:31:59,773 --> 00:32:01,886
Did he flee?

346
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,140
I think it's something to do with this accounting.

347
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:07,326
I think he wasn't trying to run over you that day.

348
00:32:07,565 --> 00:32:11,006
He was trying to flee because you were reviewing the accounting.

349
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:14,246
I'm not too sure.

350
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:16,886
There's nothing valuable left.

351
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:18,406
I think he really fled.

352
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:21,886
My men just gave me the list of his calls.

353
00:32:22,046 --> 00:32:25,526
His last call before he tried to run over Un

354
00:32:26,126 --> 00:32:27,406
was to Mr. Thevarit.

355
00:32:30,753 --> 00:32:31,766
What do we do now?

356
00:32:31,847 --> 00:32:33,926
I think we should wait for now.

357
00:32:34,326 --> 00:32:36,846
We'll make our move once we get evidence.

358
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:39,406
- Sergeant Nut.  - Yes.

359
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:40,566
Set up a checkpoint.

360
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,686
Inform the airport we're after a suspect in a fraud case.

361
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,646
Block every exit.

362
00:32:46,846 --> 00:32:48,130
The suspect's name is

363
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:50,486
Mr. Thoedsak Ekthanakul.

364
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:51,646
Yes, sir.

365
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:52,966
Roger that.

366
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:54,846
(Jangwangprawas House)

367
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,966
Good morning.

368
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,006
Letters for your address.

369
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:04,726
This one requires a signature.

370
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:06,646
It's for Miss Unyamanee.

371
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:07,886
Here it is.

372
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:12,926
Thank you.

373
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:42,966
Rit.

374
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:44,766
Miss Un is not here.

375
00:33:45,486 --> 00:33:46,486
I know.

376
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,166
I don't know where she is.

377
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:49,926
I called my mom.

378
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,726
She said Un went to make merits with her mom in the morning.

379
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:57,566
Are they planning something?

380
00:33:58,766 --> 00:34:01,046
I think Un might suspect something,

381
00:34:01,345 --> 00:34:03,166
but she doesn't have any evidence yet.

382
00:34:04,233 --> 00:34:06,233
There's nothing left to find.

383
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,646
That's right.

384
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:13,366
The copies that Noot made

385
00:34:14,326 --> 00:34:16,086
were already destroyed.

386
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:37,006
The last copy was with Noom.

387
00:34:37,746 --> 00:34:39,206
We took care of that too.

388
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,933
If there's no evidence left,

389
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:44,526
I think they can't catch you.

390
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:53,006
Curly lines? Does he want some noodles?

391
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:56,006
Sa, this is serious.

392
00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:00,046
I think Kan tried to tell us something.

393
00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:09,465
Can you read that as "Rit"?

394
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:11,006
Rit?

395
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,846
Could it be "Rit drinks Black"?

396
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,053
This is serious.

397
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,286
Are you getting serious with me?

398
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:20,046
What is that?

399
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:23,206
Don't mind it. It's just an old joke.

400
00:35:24,078 --> 00:35:25,766
I apologize for these two.

401
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:31,086
If he really wrote "Rit,"

402
00:35:31,586 --> 00:35:33,586
we need to go back to the hospital.

403
00:35:33,856 --> 00:35:34,885
Why?

404
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,046
We'll wait for him.

405
00:35:36,153 --> 00:35:37,966
As soon as the doctor removes the respirator,

406
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,006
we'll ask him right away.

407
00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:47,726
Send more men to guard Kan at the hospital.

408
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,326
I'm on my way there.

409
00:35:49,512 --> 00:35:50,606
- Let's go!  - Okay.

410
00:35:57,611 --> 00:35:59,206
This is the baby's heartbeat.

411
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:27,206
It has all the fingers.

412
00:36:29,326 --> 00:36:30,846
And...

413
00:36:32,618 --> 00:36:34,126
It's a boy.

414
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:02,766
There have been cases

415
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:05,446
of cervical cancer during pregnancy.

416
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,046
The mothers are capable of delivering the baby.

417
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,486
That means

418
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:12,286
we need to perform a C-section as soon as possible

419
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,492
before cancer spreads.

420
00:37:14,726 --> 00:37:17,926
Mrs. Phim is 20 weeks into her pregnancy.

421
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:21,006
Just eight more weeks.

422
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:24,566
During these eight weeks, it's possible

423
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:27,206
that cancer will spread.

424
00:37:27,806 --> 00:37:30,166
The patient is pregnant.

425
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:32,446
We cannot perform radiotherapy.

426
00:37:32,945 --> 00:37:34,945
If we were to perform chemotherapy,

427
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:37,126
it would be too risky.

428
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:46,366
What if in eight weeks, cancer spreads

429
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:48,632
as you said, doctor?

430
00:37:49,037 --> 00:37:51,926
It will make the treatment even more difficult.

431
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:01,806
Thank you so much, doctors.

432
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:05,606
I'll need to discuss this with my daughter.

433
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,306
Okay. Make yourselves comfortable.

434
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:08,606
Okay.

435
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:10,126
Thank you.

436
00:38:45,685 --> 00:38:46,926
Shouldn't you get an abortion?

437
00:39:04,872 --> 00:39:06,406
I'll risk it.

438
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:12,606
If I fight for another eight weeks,

439
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,046
my child will have a 70% chance of survival.

440
00:39:18,966 --> 00:39:20,366
I'll try.

441
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,966
It's eight weeks, Phim.

442
00:39:49,366 --> 00:39:52,166
I'll keep in touch with the doctors. It's fine, Mom.

443
00:39:53,939 --> 00:39:55,166
Let's get an abortion.

444
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,426
You can live abroad with me.

445
00:40:00,446 --> 00:40:02,526
I do want you to live a good life,

446
00:40:02,918 --> 00:40:05,846
but I don't want you to risk your own life for that.

447
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,686
The doctor said it's very risky.

448
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:14,966
You wanted me to claim my part in JP.

449
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:18,126
This baby is my last chance to stay in JP.

450
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:22,686
If I get an abortion, I'll get nothing from JP.

451
00:40:23,926 --> 00:40:25,326
- But...  - Mom.

452
00:40:25,452 --> 00:40:26,966
I'm meeting Si.

453
00:40:27,546 --> 00:40:29,806
You can drive my car home.

454
00:40:30,246 --> 00:40:32,606
Si will give me a ride home later.

455
00:40:40,913 --> 00:40:42,753
I want you to live a good life.

456
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:46,166
That means I want you not to die.

457
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:52,366
- Good morning, ma'am.  - Good morning.

458
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,646
Let's head out. See you at home, Mom.

459
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,246
Even if the police say an affair did not cause it,

460
00:41:11,946 --> 00:41:15,246
I have to remove Un as Vice President no matter what.

461
00:41:19,248 --> 00:41:20,400
Why?

462
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:26,966
What did Un do so wrong?

463
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:29,366
She hesitated.

464
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:33,366
She turned back on her decision.

465
00:41:34,765 --> 00:41:37,606
Someone like her can't run a large company.

466
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:45,126
Who are you replacing her with?

467
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:49,246
Rit will do the job for now.

468
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,806
I heard you're coming home tomorrow, Mr. Chairman.

469
00:42:07,044 --> 00:42:08,246
What do you want?

470
00:42:08,812 --> 00:42:11,366
I came with Phim for her doctor's appointment.

471
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:15,606
I'm here to give you an ultrasound photo of your first great-grandson.

472
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:41,766
Where is Phim now?

473
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:45,366
She's with her friend.

474
00:42:48,086 --> 00:42:50,446
I have something I want to talk to you about.

475
00:42:51,526 --> 00:42:52,686
What is it?

476
00:42:54,025 --> 00:42:55,846
I want Phim to get an abortion.

477
00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:02,646
She has cancer.

478
00:43:04,726 --> 00:43:07,086
She needs treatment as soon as possible.

479
00:43:07,938 --> 00:43:10,759
Keeping the baby could pose further risk to Phim.

480
00:43:16,245 --> 00:43:19,166
This baby is the only heir to Jangwangprawas.

481
00:43:19,465 --> 00:43:22,006
She's my only daughter.

482
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,406
What does she say?

483
00:43:28,612 --> 00:43:29,926
I don't care

484
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:31,766
what she says.

485
00:43:32,293 --> 00:43:34,406
If we need to wait eight weeks

486
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:36,446
and cancer spreads,

487
00:43:37,486 --> 00:43:39,326
I might lose Phim for that.

488
00:43:52,372 --> 00:43:55,646
If she delivers this baby, every wealth of ours will be his.

489
00:44:00,406 --> 00:44:02,286
Until this child grows up to be capable,

490
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:06,766
Rit will take care of the company.

491
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:12,806
Once he grows up and is ready, he will take over immediately.

492
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:43,886
Thank you.

493
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,126
See you at home.

494
00:44:48,446 --> 00:44:49,886
I understand you.

495
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:56,366
If I had to choose,

496
00:44:57,766 --> 00:44:59,046
I'd choose my daughter too.

497
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:05,166
Nothing is more important than your child's life.

498
00:45:13,385 --> 00:45:15,246
Only mothers like us

499
00:45:16,366 --> 00:45:17,606
could understand.

500
00:45:57,499 --> 00:45:59,646
Mr. Tony is here to see Miss Un.

501
00:46:00,766 --> 00:46:03,366
Un is not here. Why don't you just tell him that?

502
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,166
She has told me.

503
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:14,606
I called Gade. She said she was coming down to see me.

504
00:46:16,785 --> 00:46:18,046
Tony!

505
00:46:20,372 --> 00:46:21,372
Aunt Wing.

506
00:46:21,786 --> 00:46:23,086
Excuse me.

507
00:46:25,726 --> 00:46:26,726
Wait a sec.

508
00:46:26,926 --> 00:46:28,446
Is there a letter for me?

509
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:31,566
Just look and be quick.

510
00:46:39,807 --> 00:46:41,086
A sec, please.

511
00:46:48,326 --> 00:46:49,486
I'm off.

512
00:46:58,166 --> 00:47:01,486
Hey! Do you just call me when you can't find anyone?

513
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:03,326
Who can I call?

514
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,566
You went to Kuer's house.

515
00:47:05,832 --> 00:47:07,366
Nobody answered the door.

516
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:09,246
Shouldn't you call Kuer?

517
00:47:09,406 --> 00:47:12,440
Why would you call me? I don't have the key to his house, you know.

518
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:14,286
I don't want to call him.

519
00:47:14,885 --> 00:47:17,486
Un asked me to help review the papers at Kuer's house.

520
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:20,406
He should be getting his house ready for me.

521
00:47:20,592 --> 00:47:22,086
He shouldn't leave me waiting outside.

522
00:47:22,205 --> 00:47:24,205
Yeah. Whatever.

523
00:47:25,646 --> 00:47:27,286
Why didn't you call Un, then?

524
00:47:31,446 --> 00:47:34,166
You know it's nonsense, don't you?

525
00:47:41,978 --> 00:47:42,978
So,

526
00:47:43,886 --> 00:47:46,646
did Un say anything about Kuer and Phim?

527
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:49,926
About what?

528
00:47:54,046 --> 00:47:55,526
I couldn't believe my ears.

529
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:57,566
Your mom told you to get an abortion.

530
00:47:58,131 --> 00:47:59,406
That baby

531
00:47:59,553 --> 00:48:03,006
is the only chance you have at keeping Jangwangprawas' inheritance.

532
00:48:04,191 --> 00:48:05,966
I told you. Your mom

533
00:48:06,771 --> 00:48:09,126
has your best interest at heart.

534
00:48:10,699 --> 00:48:12,406
You're her only daughter, after all.

535
00:48:20,966 --> 00:48:21,966
Look.

536
00:48:22,298 --> 00:48:24,298
Why do you want to keep the baby?

537
00:48:25,446 --> 00:48:27,046
It's obvious

538
00:48:27,246 --> 00:48:28,886
that Kuer doesn't care.

539
00:48:30,778 --> 00:48:33,326
Do you still want Jangwangprawas' inheritance?

540
00:48:35,131 --> 00:48:38,406
Right now, money is not important anymore.

541
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,046
I just can't bring myself to kill my baby.

542
00:48:50,109 --> 00:48:52,166
He's my son.

543
00:48:59,987 --> 00:49:03,966
He didn't have anything to do with all this. Why does he have to sacrifice?

544
00:49:06,506 --> 00:49:08,506
You're risking death here.

545
00:49:09,006 --> 00:49:10,126
Are you out of your mind?

546
00:49:11,846 --> 00:49:13,566
A child born to a dead mother

547
00:49:13,713 --> 00:49:15,406
won't be happy anyway.

548
00:49:17,005 --> 00:49:18,094
But

549
00:49:18,506 --> 00:49:21,166
I will probably have a chance to survive

550
00:49:21,566 --> 00:49:23,566
if cancer doesn't spread further.

551
00:49:31,064 --> 00:49:32,606
Are you done with Kuer, then?

552
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,806
You know my mom raised me as a single mom.

553
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:42,286
I don't have a father.

554
00:49:42,473 --> 00:49:45,806
I don't even know who my father is.

555
00:49:51,794 --> 00:49:54,286
I want my son to have a father.

556
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:58,046
A good father

557
00:49:58,531 --> 00:50:02,526
who will love and cherish him for me,

558
00:50:03,286 --> 00:50:07,126
just in case something happens to me one day.

559
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:15,206
Yeah. Fine.

560
00:50:16,766 --> 00:50:19,126
You want your child, and you need a husband.

561
00:50:22,266 --> 00:50:23,766
You have to think.

562
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:29,806
The father of your child needs to fall in love with you first, right?

563
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:38,446
It might sound nonsense to you,

564
00:50:40,592 --> 00:50:42,806
but I have two whole months

565
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:44,486
to make him choose me.

566
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:52,886
Why are you crying?

567
00:51:01,244 --> 00:51:02,244
Yeah.

568
00:51:23,178 --> 00:51:26,006
Did Phim say her baby is Kuer's?

569
00:51:27,246 --> 00:51:29,286
And you believe her?

570
00:51:29,552 --> 00:51:30,952
I knew you wouldn't believe it.

571
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,404
What do you want me to believe?

572
00:51:32,546 --> 00:51:34,426
Nothing indicates that

573
00:51:34,806 --> 00:51:37,086
Kuer and Phim hooked up.

574
00:51:40,178 --> 00:51:41,206
Wait.

575
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:46,566
Do you remember the earrings Phim was wearing last night?

576
00:51:46,647 --> 00:51:47,660
What about them?

577
00:51:47,766 --> 00:51:49,926
She said Kuer gave her those earrings.

578
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:51,806
You said

579
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,686
you saw one of those earrings at Kuer's apartment.

580
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:58,166
That means

581
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,246
Phim dropped it,

582
00:52:00,446 --> 00:52:01,699
and Kuer lied to you

583
00:52:01,806 --> 00:52:05,686
because he didn't want you to know he just hooked up with someone.

584
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:07,726
Could it be

585
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:10,926
that Kuer hooked up with Phim behind Noot's back all along?

586
00:52:12,419 --> 00:52:13,686
I don't know.

587
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,926
When Kuer first dated Un,

588
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:18,966
he didn't seem to care about Phim.

589
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:21,366
At all?

590
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:25,166
A bit, maybe.

591
00:52:26,006 --> 00:52:27,566
He went to see the doctor with her.

592
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:30,166
He visited her in the hospital.

593
00:52:31,306 --> 00:52:34,326
He gave her a ride. He stayed with her on the island.

594
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,166
Crap! That's a lot.

595
00:52:38,379 --> 00:52:41,046
So do you think it's possible

596
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:43,532
that before he met Un,

597
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,413
Kuer has always been taking care of Phim like this?

598
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:02,046
San, when are they removing the respirator?

599
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:03,966
The nurse said it could be a while.

600
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:05,486
The doctor needs to examine him again.

601
00:53:07,085 --> 00:53:08,646
I'll head to the office, then.

602
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,966
I'll give you a ride.

603
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,325
No thanks.

604
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:15,466
What perfect timing.

605
00:53:16,344 --> 00:53:17,606
Tony, Gade.

606
00:53:18,057 --> 00:53:20,131
I brought Tony here.

607
00:53:20,254 --> 00:53:22,086
Un said he was giving her a ride to the office.

608
00:53:22,553 --> 00:53:24,686
Gade, please drive Un's car back home.

609
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,366
So what?

610
00:53:30,846 --> 00:53:32,886
Are we not reviewing the accounting anymore? We're not done.

611
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,046
I was going to do it.

612
00:53:35,273 --> 00:53:36,886
I went to your house this morning.

613
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:38,486
It was locked.

614
00:53:39,292 --> 00:53:42,286
Nobody answered the bell.

615
00:53:45,685 --> 00:53:47,046
After you drop Un off,

616
00:53:47,479 --> 00:53:49,726
see me at home. We'll get it over with.

617
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:53,006
Let's go, Un.

618
00:53:56,326 --> 00:53:57,646
My car is parked at B1.

619
00:53:59,206 --> 00:54:00,206
San.

620
00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:02,139
If the doctor removes the respirator, tell me.

621
00:54:02,247 --> 00:54:04,526
I'll be at the office for a bit to avoid suspicion.

622
00:54:04,632 --> 00:54:05,646
Okay.

623
00:54:08,765 --> 00:54:09,926
I have to go.

624
00:54:10,305 --> 00:54:11,686
I'm just here to bring Tony.

625
00:54:12,605 --> 00:54:13,686
Gade.

626
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:16,486
What?

627
00:54:18,326 --> 00:54:19,446
Thanks.

628
00:54:20,771 --> 00:54:21,806
Okay.

629
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:24,886
That spooked me.

630
00:54:26,498 --> 00:54:28,286
You're free today, right?

631
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:33,446
I'm free. I have nothing to do but open the door for the young master.

632
00:54:33,664 --> 00:54:36,049
Good. We'll film some content.

633
00:54:36,998 --> 00:54:38,006
What content?

634
00:54:38,132 --> 00:54:40,179
You're setting the record straight about Phim.

635
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,126
I forgot. Yeah.

636
00:54:44,562 --> 00:54:46,126
Let's get it over with.

637
00:54:47,245 --> 00:54:50,366
San, if the doctor removes his respirator, call me.

638
00:54:50,494 --> 00:54:52,617
I want to know what his noodles were.

639
00:54:52,732 --> 00:54:53,852
Yeah.

640
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:55,534
Let's go.

641
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:05,366
I forgot to give Un her letter.

642
00:55:07,686 --> 00:55:08,966
I'll just give it to her at home.

643
00:55:12,006 --> 00:55:13,046
Un.

644
00:55:13,286 --> 00:55:14,691
What time should I come to pick you up?

645
00:55:14,839 --> 00:55:16,246
Four o'clock would be good.

646
00:55:16,406 --> 00:55:18,526
If there's anything urgent, I'll call you.

647
00:55:18,686 --> 00:55:19,726
Okay.

648
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:21,286
Someone gave you a ride today, huh?

649
00:55:21,692 --> 00:55:23,006
Yes.

650
00:55:23,706 --> 00:55:25,286
See you this afternoon.

651
00:55:25,564 --> 00:55:26,586
Okay.

652
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:33,006
Your new boyfriend?

653
00:55:33,766 --> 00:55:35,486
We're taking it slow.

654
00:55:36,892 --> 00:55:38,166
Rit.

655
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:40,366
Is Noom here today?

656
00:55:41,926 --> 00:55:44,486
I called him, but I couldn't reach him.

657
00:55:46,686 --> 00:55:47,806
I don't know.

658
00:55:48,005 --> 00:55:50,846
I haven't been to the accounting department this morning.

659
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:53,286
Do you need anything?

660
00:55:54,686 --> 00:55:57,766
I need some more accounting documents.

661
00:55:58,132 --> 00:56:01,526
I'm not sure about the budget for next year yet.

662
00:56:02,606 --> 00:56:04,966
Don't you have enough information with what you have?

663
00:56:05,665 --> 00:56:06,926
It's enough, actually.

664
00:56:07,246 --> 00:56:08,966
But I just want a few more details.

665
00:56:09,485 --> 00:56:12,326
I want to know how much Grandfather has increased the budget annually.

666
00:56:15,006 --> 00:56:16,766
I'll try calling him, then.

667
00:56:25,538 --> 00:56:26,726
His phone is off.

668
00:56:27,393 --> 00:56:29,646
I'll try to reach him for you.

669
00:56:30,064 --> 00:56:31,086
Thank you.

670
00:56:46,566 --> 00:56:49,126
I think if Phim sees this video of yours,

671
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:51,206
she'll surely leave you alone.

672
00:56:53,086 --> 00:56:54,926
It's about time I do something about it.

673
00:56:56,493 --> 00:56:57,806
You're right to do this,

674
00:56:58,166 --> 00:56:59,606
but why now?

675
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:02,326
Maybe

676
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:05,646
I need to be honest and straight to the point.

677
00:57:07,486 --> 00:57:08,526
That's right.

678
00:57:09,086 --> 00:57:12,926
Good. I'll edit your video and post it today.

679
00:57:21,986 --> 00:57:23,166
What's up, San?

680
00:57:23,425 --> 00:57:24,726
Did they remove the respirator?

681
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:27,086
My men said they found Noom's car parked.

682
00:57:27,686 --> 00:57:29,903
- What does San say?  - What's with the car?

683
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:32,019
I don't know. I'm heading out to see.

684
00:57:32,686 --> 00:57:33,686
What about Kan?

685
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:34,831
I gave an order.

686
00:57:34,912 --> 00:57:38,124
When the respirator is removed, they'll call me. I have to go now.

687
00:57:38,234 --> 00:57:39,406
Okay.

688
00:57:39,674 --> 00:57:40,926
Why? What happened?

689
00:57:41,073 --> 00:57:44,166
San said the head of accounting's car was found.

690
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,520
What about the guy? Did they find him?

691
00:57:45,552 --> 00:57:46,646
He's heading out to see.

692
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:48,606
- Do we go?  - We don't.

693
00:57:48,885 --> 00:57:51,046
We'll stay here. If we go, we'll only get in the way.

694
00:57:51,172 --> 00:57:52,966
He'll tell us when he's done.

695
00:57:54,573 --> 00:57:56,366
Oh, well...

696
00:57:57,039 --> 00:57:59,039
You sure are attached to him.

697
00:58:00,846 --> 00:58:02,646
- What?  - What?

698
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:05,806
I just want to go and see what's up.

699
00:58:10,506 --> 00:58:13,766
I'm just getting hungry. I haven't had lunch.

700
00:58:13,912 --> 00:58:15,646
Please eat. I bought some for you.

701
00:58:15,832 --> 00:58:17,966
- I'll set some plates up.  - Okay.

702
00:58:18,147 --> 00:58:19,766
You're a nice guy now, huh?

703
00:58:19,945 --> 00:58:21,486
He's a nice guy!

704
00:58:53,878 --> 00:58:55,686
I'm involved in this now.

705
00:58:56,426 --> 00:58:57,886
Can you tell me

706
00:58:58,046 --> 00:58:59,806
what's happening right now?

707
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:04,486
How much danger is Un in?

708
00:59:45,726 --> 00:59:46,766
"Rit"?

709
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:54,606
What are the other two words?

710
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,899
(San: We found Noom's car, but not him.)

711
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,286
(We found Noom's car, but not him.)

712
01:00:29,373 --> 01:00:30,373
"Rit

713
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,326
killed..."

714
01:00:42,966 --> 01:00:44,486
There's nothing valuable in the car.

715
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:47,566
Locals say it's been here since before dawn. They haven't seen the driver.

716
01:00:48,966 --> 01:00:51,366
Our team will search the entire area.

717
01:00:51,486 --> 01:00:52,806
He couldn't have gone far.

718
01:00:53,006 --> 01:00:54,366
I think we'll find him today.

719
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:55,646
Yes, sir.

720
01:00:57,726 --> 01:00:59,406
You made Un pretend to break up with you

721
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,966
and date me instead.

722
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:03,319
All to make people think the joint venture

723
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,366
ended with you and Un's relationship?

724
01:01:08,692 --> 01:01:09,726
That's right.

725
01:01:09,893 --> 01:01:11,526
Do you think she'll be safe?

726
01:01:24,106 --> 01:01:25,286
I'm

727
01:01:26,572 --> 01:01:27,886
not sure.

728
01:01:29,566 --> 01:01:30,806
Tony.

729
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:33,686
Honestly, nobody knows anything.

730
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,886
Everything we came up with is all theory.

731
01:01:39,526 --> 01:01:41,166
I'm confident that, at the very least,

732
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:44,006
Rit is involved in scamming the company.

733
01:01:44,345 --> 01:01:45,606
What about Noot?

734
01:01:46,664 --> 01:01:49,126
You really didn't have anything to do with his death?

735
01:01:49,257 --> 01:01:50,286
I didn't.

736
01:01:50,966 --> 01:01:52,486
That's got nothing to do with me.

737
01:01:52,853 --> 01:01:55,886
The DNA results showed that I wasn't there.

738
01:01:59,426 --> 01:02:00,806
What about you and Phim?

739
01:02:04,612 --> 01:02:06,806
Hey, Tony.

740
01:02:07,086 --> 01:02:10,406
You're questioning him like the police. Are you one?

741
01:02:11,492 --> 01:02:13,406
Phim and I broke up a long time ago.

742
01:02:13,678 --> 01:02:15,846
As long as Phim's pregnancy?

743
01:02:32,246 --> 01:02:33,246
Sir.

744
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:39,246
That's so much work for one day.

745
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:46,159
The respirator has been removed.

746
01:02:46,545 --> 01:02:48,323
The patient still has difficulty talking.

747
01:02:48,446 --> 01:02:50,006
He can only utter short phrases.

748
01:02:50,632 --> 01:02:51,686
Thank you.

749
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:11,128
Kan.

750
01:03:13,987 --> 01:03:15,326
What did you write this morning?

751
01:03:18,526 --> 01:03:22,926
Watch your back. Rit killed...

752
01:03:27,318 --> 01:03:28,686
What do you mean?

753
01:03:32,006 --> 01:03:33,166
What did Kan say?

754
01:03:33,406 --> 01:03:36,086
Mr. Rit and Mrs. Wing are probably the masterminds behind everything.

755
01:03:36,406 --> 01:03:38,632
You're so quick with this, aren't you?

756
01:03:38,846 --> 01:03:40,526
You explained everything in one sentence.

757
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,446
What do you mean?

758
01:03:43,564 --> 01:03:46,606
Kan said the one who attacked him

759
01:03:47,105 --> 01:03:48,766
was the one who killed your father

760
01:03:49,446 --> 01:03:50,886
and Kan's father too.

761
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:53,366
Kan's father?

762
01:03:53,566 --> 01:03:54,686
Yes.

763
01:03:54,979 --> 01:03:56,979
Kan's father was the driver

764
01:03:57,406 --> 01:04:00,126
who died in the same accident as Mr. Pravee, your father.

765
01:04:00,832 --> 01:04:02,406
What does that have to do with Un right now?

766
01:04:02,826 --> 01:04:05,326
Kan wanted to work at Un's house

767
01:04:05,659 --> 01:04:07,926
because he wanted to investigate his father's death.

768
01:04:08,073 --> 01:04:09,566
He's believed all along

769
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:11,659
that his father's death wasn't an accident.

770
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:14,526
It turned out he found way more than past crimes.

771
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,046
Furthermore,

772
01:04:16,265 --> 01:04:18,446
Noot gave the same statement as Rit did.

773
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,206
Is there a reason

774
01:04:21,332 --> 01:04:23,486
for Noot to distrust Rit?

775
01:04:23,686 --> 01:04:25,526
The company's accounting.

776
01:04:25,884 --> 01:04:27,726
From what Kan said,

777
01:04:27,886 --> 01:04:29,486
when he worked for Noot,

778
01:04:29,734 --> 01:04:31,846
it was in the latter stages

779
01:04:31,972 --> 01:04:34,686
of JP's joint venture with C-Itsara.

780
01:04:36,346 --> 01:04:37,566
Could it be that

781
01:04:38,444 --> 01:04:40,444
Rit found out Noot suspected him?

782
01:04:41,626 --> 01:04:44,000
That's why he got rid of him.

783
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,646
How could he have done that?

784
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:50,726
Noot was alone on that boat.

785
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,566
I don't know either.

786
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:57,686
I'll ask for a DNA test today

787
01:04:57,886 --> 01:04:59,326
of everyone in Jangwangprawas.

788
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:10,886
Wipe it clean and spotless,

789
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:12,286
that round table.

790
01:05:12,432 --> 01:05:14,246
After that, mop the floor too.

791
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:18,246
Make it nice and clean. My father's bed will be here.

792
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:19,686
Yes.

793
01:05:20,347 --> 01:05:21,886
Where have you been?

794
01:05:22,026 --> 01:05:24,026
You left in the morning and came home so late.

795
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,646
You didn't cook any food.

796
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,646
I even needed to oversee Father's room cleaning for you.

797
01:05:29,152 --> 01:05:31,286
You're his daughter. You should do it.

798
01:05:31,852 --> 01:05:34,246
Show your gratitude to your father sometimes.

799
01:05:34,418 --> 01:05:36,486
Really? What about your daughter?

800
01:05:36,685 --> 01:05:38,766
Did she show gratitude at all?

801
01:05:38,872 --> 01:05:43,166
She does nothing all day, sitting to have been waited on hand and foot.

802
01:05:44,038 --> 01:05:45,326
My daughter is pregnant.

803
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:48,686
She doesn't have to show gratitude when she's pregnant.

804
01:05:49,326 --> 01:05:51,846
I let her go where she pleases and do what she wants.

805
01:05:52,392 --> 01:05:54,406
She won't have time after giving birth.

806
01:05:56,178 --> 01:05:57,286
Excuse us.

807
01:05:57,486 --> 01:05:59,006
The inspector needs to ask you something.

808
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:00,526
Good evening.

809
01:06:01,005 --> 01:06:02,726
I would like Mrs. Prawing,

810
01:06:02,912 --> 01:06:05,766
Mrs. Areewan, Mrs. Phattra, Mrs. Phim,

811
01:06:06,265 --> 01:06:07,926
and everyone in the house

812
01:06:08,525 --> 01:06:09,886
to take a DNA test.

813
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:11,846
Wait, Inspector.

814
01:06:12,212 --> 01:06:14,486
Am I a suspect?

815
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:19,326
What's going on, Mom?

816
01:06:19,945 --> 01:06:23,606
Do you hear this? The inspector wants me to take a DNA test.

817
01:06:24,432 --> 01:06:25,606
What's wrong?

818
01:06:26,479 --> 01:06:27,719
Why do we need to take the test, sir?

819
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:29,526
We have a new question

820
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:31,206
about Mr. Noot's case.

821
01:06:31,346 --> 01:06:34,686
I need to get your DNA for comparison.

822
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,606
My mother and everyone here

823
01:06:37,979 --> 01:06:39,526
couldn't have hurt Noot, for sure.

824
01:06:39,766 --> 01:06:40,886
I know.

825
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:42,726
I just need to compare the samples.

826
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:45,246
You don't have any problem with that, do you?

827
01:06:53,892 --> 01:06:55,006
You found him?

828
01:06:56,171 --> 01:06:57,886
Get a preliminary autopsy

829
01:06:58,045 --> 01:07:00,046
and send the report to forensics at the hospital.

830
01:07:21,025 --> 01:07:22,025
We need to talk.

831
01:07:22,126 --> 01:07:23,166
About what?

832
01:07:24,964 --> 01:07:27,286
Do you still want to marry me?

833
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:33,886
I won't let anyone hold me back again.

834
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:36,646
Can you come out and talk to me?
