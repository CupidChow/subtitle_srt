1
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,486
Why are we here?

2
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,086
- Do you like it?  - Are you asking me?

3
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:50,766
You're moving in with me. I have to ask you.

4
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,286
Here? With you?

5
00:01:56,772 --> 00:01:58,092
You did this, didn't you?

6
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:02,766
Isn't that too much? I need to find my scoop and get some food for you too?

7
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:12,206
- Can I open my eyes?  - No. Whoa!

8
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:13,486
Hey!

9
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:31,206
Un, I asked the staff to take our bags downstairs.

10
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:35,006
I moved your stuff into this purse here too.

11
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:36,606
The one before was covered in curry.

12
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:45,606
Let's get a meal before we head home.

13
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:48,086
Are you hungry?

14
00:02:48,726 --> 00:02:49,806
I am.

15
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:51,739
Let's go.

16
00:02:57,105 --> 00:02:58,806
(You don't care at all.)

17
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,880
(You even flirted with another guy in front of me!)

18
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,686
If this doesn't get views, I don't know what will.

19
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:07,046
- Are you posting the whole thing?  - Yeah.

20
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:08,406
Why?

21
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:09,966
You can get sued.

22
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:12,046
That's a violation of privacy.

23
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:15,286
I need to think about my next move.

24
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:17,107
Thank you

25
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:21,206
for sending me to that restaurant exactly at that moment!

26
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:25,206
Okay. I have to go now. You will get a feast.

27
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:32,700
You yelled at me when I asked you.

28
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:34,646
Do you want to thank me now?

29
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:37,646
- Do you want me to yell?  - No. Just stop talking.

30
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:39,566
Let's eat.

31
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:43,046
Listen. Kuer called and said he got a house.

32
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:45,724
- He wants us to visit tomorrow.  - Okay.

33
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,246
Kuer.

34
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:56,966
I have something to talk to you about.

35
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:01,006
Are you changing your mind?

36
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,486
No.

37
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,246
It's about Phim.

38
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:08,886
Phim?

39
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,606
I feel like you and Phim are more than colleagues.

40
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:17,166
She has been picking a fight with me since we met at the hotel.

41
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,799
I think it's because of you.

42
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:25,766
Phim and I are just friends.

43
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,806
There's nothing more.

44
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,286
Are you jealous?

45
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:40,606
I'm not. I just don't want this to be a problem later.

46
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:52,086
If you're jealous, just say it.

47
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:55,886
Isn't that too much?

48
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:57,206
It's not.

49
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:59,206
We're moving in together.

50
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:01,926
Just a peck is nothing.

51
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,166
Hey.

52
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,606
Let's get our bags.

53
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,126
I don't have toothpaste.

54
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:57,246
Kuer.

55
00:05:58,246 --> 00:05:59,806
Do you have some toothpaste?

56
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:02,804
I do.

57
00:06:02,885 --> 00:06:04,566
Come in. Wait a sec.

58
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:05,846
A sec.

59
00:06:28,112 --> 00:06:29,726
He's quite cute.

60
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:41,859
(Don't forget your worth. I hope you start a good new life.)

61
00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:56,566
Did he get dumped?

62
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:03,093
(Don't forget your worth. I hope you start a good new life.)

63
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:16,606
Here's some toothpaste.

64
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:23,132
Hey, take this.

65
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:24,406
Thank you.

66
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,246
What's wrong?

67
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:30,646
My stomach hurts.

68
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:33,906
I have to go.

69
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,326
(Un)

70
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:07,006
Oh! You totally went silent.

71
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,726
Is this what they call "man over friend"?

72
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:15,046
Hey, Gade, stop. Listen to what I want to say first.

73
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:17,806
Tell me.

74
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,846
I'm ready for gossip now. Tell me all about it.

75
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:25,006
Remember the night I stayed at your place before my flight eight years ago?

76
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,246
Yeah, I do.

77
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,886
I saw a drunk man that night.

78
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:36,309
The one you said looked crap, like he got dumped?

79
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:37,526
(That's the one.)

80
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:40,126
I left him a note in his pocket.

81
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:43,526
So what? That's not newsworthy.

82
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:48,046
I saw that note in Kuer's room.

83
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:52,046
Say what?

84
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:55,463
Yeah! I think Kuer is the drunk man

85
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:58,126
I saw at the dumpster at your apartment that day.

86
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:01,406
Did you tell him you met him before?

87
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:03,126
No.

88
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:05,766
Just tell him.

89
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:08,046
This is obviously a destiny, Un.

90
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:19,006
I wonder who dumped him and hurt him that much.

91
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:24,326
Un, are you okay?

92
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,046
Do you need a doctor?

93
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,726
Kuer is here. I'll call you back.

94
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:35,366
That's quite a reunion.

95
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:38,166
Reunion, my butt! I have to go!

96
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:48,766
How is your stomach?

97
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:53,585
It's fine now.

98
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:56,646
That's so fast.

99
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,486
Seriously, I'll take you to a doctor if it's bad.

100
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,646
Are you lying?

101
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:14,246
No.

102
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,486
You're my girlfriend.

103
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,086
I promise

104
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,566
I won't make you sad.

105
00:12:01,392 --> 00:12:02,926
Are you starting without me?

106
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,406
Sit down.

107
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,766
On the rock, please.

108
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,086
You just got here this morning, and you already fought?

109
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,326
What did Noot do this time?

110
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:18,726
Nothing.

111
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,766
It's me this time.

112
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,486
I think Noot and I

113
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,833
can never be the same.

114
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:31,686
You said you wanted a child with him last time.

115
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,566
When I saw Kuer again,

116
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,446
I felt like

117
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:43,126
I had made a mistake eight years ago.

118
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:52,926
You're married, Phim.

119
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,806
If you want to date, you need to get a divorce first.

120
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:03,126
If anyone knows how it feels to get betrayed, it's you.

121
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:06,206
Will you really do what Noot did to you?

122
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:16,006
If you do,

123
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:18,766
you're no better than Noot.

124
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,046
I can't believe I met you before.

125
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:12,126
Don't go yet.

126
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:16,673
Tell me where you met me.

127
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:24,599
At a dumpster.

128
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:27,926
A dumpster?

129
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:30,366
Eight years ago.

130
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,246
You were so drunk.

131
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:36,806
I happened to pass by.

132
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:44,006
So,

133
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:46,526
the umbrella I got that day,

134
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:49,286
is it yours?

135
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:51,446
It's Gade's.

136
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:52,886
Gade, your friend?

137
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:59,046
I borrowed it and put it over you.

138
00:16:02,756 --> 00:16:03,926
And

139
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:06,592
the note that was left to me that day,

140
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,846
was it yours or Gade's?

141
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:11,766
I wrote that.

142
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:16,366
You looked so bad that night. I feared you'd commit suicide.

143
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,845
That's why I left that note.

144
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,102
Kuer.

145
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:37,686
Go and take a shower.

146
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:39,606
You have to go to work.

147
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:41,606
Don't be too emotional.

148
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:43,406
Can I be late?

149
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:47,566
No!

150
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:51,086
I had asked for some documents from the accounting department.

151
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:52,911
Let's go.

152
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,726
Hey, Kuer!

153
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:00,246
If you can't be late, I'll help you take a shower.

154
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,966
Seriously? No!

155
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,072
- Just go.  - No!

156
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:09,686
Can I stay here a bit longer?

157
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:13,366
I told them I'd come. I'm not going to make it on time.

158
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:15,246
Kuer!

159
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,046
How did you not know those two checked out yesterday?

160
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,943
If they stayed at our hotel,

161
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:30,166
we could keep an eye on them, who they meet, and where they go.

162
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:33,606
You let them out? What do we know now?

163
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,326
Un hates my guts.

164
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:40,206
She probably wants C-Itsara to reject us.

165
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:46,066
She could be talking to the other small docks.

166
00:17:46,552 --> 00:17:48,646
If they reach an agreement with them,

167
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,985
how much will we lose out

168
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:53,486
for competing with C-Itsara?

169
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,686
I'm sorry, Grandfather.

170
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:04,766
Revise the offer. I want them to sign the joint venture ASAP.

171
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:07,984
Yes.

172
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:10,065
Send someone to find out

173
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:11,766
where they're staying

174
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,606
and who they're dealing with.

175
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,926
I won't let them slip through my fingers.

176
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:20,686
Yes, sir.

177
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:34,812
Phim.

178
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,766
I need your help.

179
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,006
Can you go with me?

180
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:44,166
To where?

181
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:54,985
Let me help. It's fine.

182
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,886
(Accounting)

183
00:18:57,872 --> 00:18:59,046
Thank you.

184
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:00,966
May I help carry those?

185
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,926
It's okay. It's just ahead.

186
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:04,206
Okay.

187
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:17,646
To the doctor.

188
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:20,105
I just got an appointment tomorrow.

189
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,680
Noot will be having a meeting with his grandfather about

190
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:25,246
that joint venture offer for you.

191
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:28,126
I don't want to go alone.

192
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,526
Okay. Just tell me when.

193
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:42,364
Un.

194
00:19:58,886 --> 00:19:59,886
Let me help.

195
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:02,886
These are JP's accounting documents that we need to study.

196
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:07,406
This is the list of documents we need to prepare.

197
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:10,446
Have your staff bring the documents with them.

198
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:12,766
Okay.

199
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:16,126
Phim asked me to go to the doctor with her.

200
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:20,606
Hey, Un! Wait!

201
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,246
Noot has a meeting. She doesn't want to go alone.

202
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:29,805
Okay.

203
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:34,526
Please come with me.

204
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:38,726
I'd rather not.

205
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,246
You should go.

206
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:42,966
Are you sure?

207
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:52,046
Mr. Noot.

208
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:55,046
I think clause 3.1

209
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:58,286
is too much of a commitment for us.

210
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:07,486
Can you make it favor us?

211
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:10,646
I need to look at some details first.

212
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:22,486
Excuse me.

213
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,246
What is it, Nam?

214
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:27,646
Mr. Noot.

215
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:30,766
I saw Miss Un taking out accounting documents.

216
00:21:30,906 --> 00:21:33,406
Did you approve that?

217
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,006
The accounting staff has told me.

218
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,045
I approved those documents for them.

219
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:44,006
Okay. I thought she asked for those herself, so I came here to tell you.

220
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:45,446
Mr. Noot.

221
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,846
When I looked through the financing details for C-Itsara,

222
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,726
I found something off.

223
00:21:51,152 --> 00:21:53,006
Please take a look.

224
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:56,606
Please gather the documents and send them to my desk.

225
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:58,166
I'll take a look this afternoon.

226
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,446
Okay.

227
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:01,486
- Nam.  - Yes?

228
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:03,086
You will need to stay a bit late tonight.

229
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,806
I need your help.

230
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:07,321
Okay.

231
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:36,579
Rit.

232
00:22:36,692 --> 00:22:40,126
I need to work overtime tonight. You can go home without me.

233
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:43,206
Do you have some urgent work?

234
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:46,766
Yes. Mr. Noot said he needed me.

235
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,205
We're at work, Rit.

236
00:22:56,366 --> 00:23:00,206
If you're coming home late, I'll visit my mom tonight.

237
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,646
Okay.

238
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:12,286
I'm considering a divorce.

239
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:15,504
Are you sure about that?

240
00:23:20,953 --> 00:23:23,046
If this keeps up,

241
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:25,493
I won't be able to look at him.

242
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,286
I wanted to talk about the resort's marketing.

243
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:31,086
You just threw me off.

244
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:38,246
You were the one who recommended me for this job.

245
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:40,886
If you get a divorce, will they fire me?

246
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:42,787
They won't.

247
00:23:42,927 --> 00:23:44,566
You do your job so well.

248
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:48,446
No one can stay at the resort all year long as you do.

249
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,606
Phim.

250
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:04,966
Shouldn't you try talking to Noot first?

251
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,646
Don't get a divorce yet.

252
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:10,686
I think Noot loves you so much.

253
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,326
He just likes to fool around.

254
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,846
If you give him a serious talk, he might stop.

255
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:24,533
I talked to him so many times.

256
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:26,006
You know that.

257
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:29,566
Then answer my question.

258
00:24:30,406 --> 00:24:32,006
If you get a divorce,

259
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:34,566
will Kuer take you back?

260
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:45,259
Wait for them to contact us.

261
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:48,326
I don't want them to think we need to beg.

262
00:24:49,084 --> 00:24:50,366
Please arrange that.

263
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:51,486
Yes.

264
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:13,046
Good morning.

265
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,286
Do you need anything else?

266
00:25:16,772 --> 00:25:19,446
- No, sir.  - Make yourselves at home.

267
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:22,926
I hope I'm not interrupting.

268
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:25,606
No, sir.

269
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,466
I heard you checked out yesterday.

270
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:30,526
Where are you staying now?

271
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:34,446
I'll have to be here for a while.

272
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:38,246
I don't want to bother you at the hotel for too long.

273
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:41,086
I understand.

274
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:48,366
Are you busy, Un?

275
00:25:49,806 --> 00:25:50,846
Yes.

276
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:58,326
Is there anything else you want to look at?

277
00:25:59,112 --> 00:26:00,686
Let me know if you need anything.

278
00:26:04,886 --> 00:26:06,966
I already asked for the list of clients and accounts.

279
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:09,326
I don't think I'll need anything else.

280
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:11,885
You're studying us in such detail.

281
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:17,166
You already know our company will be a good partner to C-Itsara.

282
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,046
I know,

283
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,686
but I still need to look at the details.

284
00:26:23,526 --> 00:26:26,766
Don't forget that Kuer needs to send his documents to us too.

285
00:26:27,606 --> 00:26:29,966
My team will come here with the documents.

286
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,758
This afternoon, Rit will take you

287
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:38,046
to see the dock.

288
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:40,806
Thank you.

289
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,886
He seems strange today.

290
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:55,166
He seems fine to me.

291
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,486
Fine to you,

292
00:26:57,646 --> 00:26:59,166
but too good to me.

293
00:26:59,726 --> 00:27:02,006
Isn't that just because you're his granddaughter?

294
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:03,646
Don't overthink it.

295
00:27:16,646 --> 00:27:18,646
Your grandfather is nice to you.

296
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:20,246
So what's wrong?

297
00:27:21,113 --> 00:27:22,686
I just don't trust him.

298
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:27,246
Do you trust anyone in your family?

299
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:29,646
No one, probably.

300
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:32,806
Everyone wants some benefit.

301
00:27:36,346 --> 00:27:39,526
The only grandchild that he loves is Noot.

302
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:43,486
Rit and I are like backup plans.

303
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:48,166
Rit? Thevarit is your cousin?

304
00:27:49,326 --> 00:27:50,326
Yes.

305
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,726
Rit is Aunt Wing's son.

306
00:27:52,832 --> 00:27:54,046
She's my father's sister.

307
00:27:54,145 --> 00:27:56,446
Rit keeps his father's last name

308
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:59,486
because my grandfather won't accept him as an adopted son.

309
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:02,126
That's why he's not a Jangwangprawas.

310
00:28:04,272 --> 00:28:06,272
I think my grandfather only loves the son of his son.

311
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:12,406
So you and Noot...

312
00:28:16,726 --> 00:28:19,046
Noot and I are half-siblings.

313
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:28,731
Well...

314
00:28:31,606 --> 00:28:33,446
My father had two wives.

315
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:37,126
Noot's mother has died.

316
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:42,686
Aunt Wing knows how much my grandfather wants an heir.

317
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:44,806
She volunteered to raise Noot.

318
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,646
She thought the one who got to raise my grandfather's heir

319
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:51,086
would be second-in-command to him,

320
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:53,246
which is true.

321
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:59,486
Perhaps, Aunt Wing raised Noot better than her own child.

322
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:05,086
Why did you leave the house?

323
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,326
Because I knew I could do better than what my grandfather would let me do.

324
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:16,206
So you wanted to return to show your grandfather

325
00:29:17,126 --> 00:29:18,486
how good you can be?

326
00:29:27,046 --> 00:29:31,686
We have many clients at our docks, so we need this space for storage.

327
00:29:33,686 --> 00:29:37,806
Can I ask why you're interested in doing this joint venture with JP?

328
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:41,446
It shouldn't be too hard for C-Itsara to build a new dock.

329
00:29:43,186 --> 00:29:45,486
I wasn't interested in JP at first.

330
00:29:45,592 --> 00:29:47,886
C-Itsara's chairwoman

331
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:51,206
recognizes JP as the most worthy partner.

332
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:53,806
Because with JP, C-Itsara won't have to invest much.

333
00:29:53,965 --> 00:29:55,726
That's why you're the first choice.

334
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:59,246
But it's still possible that we'll pick other choices.

335
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:01,286
Before I decide,

336
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:03,006
we need to negotiate first.

337
00:30:03,472 --> 00:30:06,326
I think Un told you about our business.

338
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:07,806
Of course, I did.

339
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:11,006
I told him how much of a shark JP's chairman is.

340
00:30:12,665 --> 00:30:14,966
Grandfather is a shark, but he's talented.

341
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:17,966
He knows what he wants and how to get it.

342
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:21,686
I'll take you to the other side.

343
00:30:21,846 --> 00:30:22,846
Okay.

344
00:30:39,485 --> 00:30:41,443
Father wants to eat stewed pork in soy sauce.

345
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,806
Have you cooked it for him?

346
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,766
I have.

347
00:30:52,747 --> 00:30:53,747
Hey!

348
00:30:54,192 --> 00:30:57,446
You're acting. Your wrist should have healed already.

349
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,646
I think you're just wearing that for the show.

350
00:31:00,766 --> 00:31:04,566
You actually don't want to work, right?

351
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:08,286
If I'm healed, I won't wear this to just sit back

352
00:31:08,506 --> 00:31:11,366
to the point I can't do anything on my own like a certain someone.

353
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,526
Are you insulting me?

354
00:31:13,692 --> 00:31:16,166
Can you do anything on your own, then?

355
00:31:16,726 --> 00:31:18,726
If you can, then I'm not insulting you.

356
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:21,886
- You and your big mouth!  - I'll slap you back.

357
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:26,086
Wan.

358
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:31,352
- Yes, Father.  - What did Un study?

359
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:36,545
Just tell Father what your kid studied.

360
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:38,366
Don't keep quiet.

361
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:42,606
I don't think she studied anything good, Father.

362
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:47,549
She has a Ph.D. in economics.

363
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:51,766
She worked as an assistant professor at a university in America.

364
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:53,166
Is that so?

365
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,446
Father.

366
00:31:56,573 --> 00:31:59,406
Are you hungry? Wan will set up the table for you.

367
00:32:09,246 --> 00:32:12,966
Even if your kid makes it big abroad,

368
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:15,486
she's still a nobody here.

369
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:17,806
Why are you standing there?

370
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,246
Set the table up for Father.

371
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:45,326
Father, here is your tea.

372
00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:47,206
Thanks.

373
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:52,366
Why are you interested in Un?

374
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:56,366
Un is working with Mr. Kuer.

375
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,566
She's smart.

376
00:32:59,806 --> 00:33:01,166
I know she's talented.

377
00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:04,206
She's even more talented than I thought.

378
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:17,846
Here's your stewed pork in soy sauce, Father.

379
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:20,206
I didn't ask for this.

380
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:25,726
You should have used the time taken to stew the pork

381
00:33:25,886 --> 00:33:27,886
to tell your daughter

382
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,039
how she should behave

383
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:32,199
as a Jangwangprawas.

384
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:35,206
Yes, Father.

385
00:33:37,986 --> 00:33:38,986
Wan.

386
00:33:40,626 --> 00:33:42,406
Tell her to come home sometime.

387
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:47,966
Yes, Father.

388
00:34:04,192 --> 00:34:05,446
Please excuse me.

389
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:07,886
Yes, Mom.

390
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,726
Are you busy, Un?

391
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:12,406
A little.

392
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:16,726
How is your wrist? Is it getting better?

393
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:18,445
It is.

394
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:22,126
The doctor said I could remove the cast tomorrow.

395
00:34:23,406 --> 00:34:28,126
Un, if you have time, come home to stay with me for a few nights.

396
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:32,086
You've been here for a while, but you didn't come home at all.

397
00:34:34,426 --> 00:34:36,526
Could you come and stay with me instead?

398
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,446
Un.

399
00:34:39,006 --> 00:34:41,926
Can't you spend a night or two at home with me?

400
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:45,646
Okay.

401
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:48,806
I have to go.

402
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,766
I'm a little busy. I'll call you back.

403
00:34:51,086 --> 00:34:52,086
Okay.

404
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:57,446
Sorry about that.

405
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:00,486
Should we head back?

406
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,210
Yes.

407
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:22,046
Father didn't touch it at all?

408
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:23,606
He didn't.

409
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:27,246
It's odd. He asked for it himself. Why didn't he eat it?

410
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:30,806
Someone lied that he did.

411
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:32,566
It's just not tasty.

412
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:34,646
That's why he didn't eat it.

413
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:37,406
You need to stew it longer next time.

414
00:35:37,726 --> 00:35:39,486
I stewed it all night.

415
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:40,646
Stew it longer.

416
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:42,566
You need to stew it for a long time,

417
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:45,373
just like how you have supported your daughter.

418
00:35:46,566 --> 00:35:48,326
She acted like she didn't want anything,

419
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:50,326
yet she returned to show her face.

420
00:35:50,972 --> 00:35:54,846
She is just like a low-class beggar.

421
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,966
Your son, my daughter, and Noot.

422
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,606
All of them are a part of House Jangwangprawas.

423
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:08,686
If Un is a beggar,

424
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:10,606
everyone else is the same.

425
00:36:10,846 --> 00:36:13,766
Do you still think your daughter is a part of this family?

426
00:36:14,446 --> 00:36:16,406
You changed your last name,

427
00:36:16,753 --> 00:36:18,526
and yet you can come back here.

428
00:36:18,806 --> 00:36:20,286
Why can't Un return?

429
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,486
You...

430
00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:36,606
Mrs. Wan?

431
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:40,846
You shouldn't have made Mrs. Wing that angry.

432
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:53,926
Nam, did your boss ask you to stay?

433
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:55,427
Yeah, I might be here till late at night.

434
00:36:55,526 --> 00:36:58,686
You're working hard these days. I have to go. Bye.

435
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:37,686
Mr. Noot, what do you need me for?

436
00:37:39,946 --> 00:37:42,246
Please prepare the documents for tomorrow.

437
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:45,366
Okay.

438
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:59,526
(JP Corp - 2017 Expenditure)

439
00:38:17,832 --> 00:38:21,326
Have you been here since this morning's meeting?

440
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,206
I thought you had forgotten about me.

441
00:38:46,686 --> 00:38:48,086
How could I?

442
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:51,966
Come.

443
00:38:52,446 --> 00:38:54,286
I'll give you a massage.

444
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:19,198
- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

445
00:40:19,665 --> 00:40:21,486
Are you heading home, Rit?

446
00:40:21,606 --> 00:40:24,246
I think I'll get my stuff and head home.

447
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,339
Okay.

448
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:37,966
What?

449
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:39,406
Let's go home.

450
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,805
By the way, I need to stop by somewhere

451
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:44,379
to get some food. San is coming over.

452
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,606
Okay. That's good.

453
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,486
I can get my toothpaste.

454
00:40:54,793 --> 00:41:00,366
I told you. You're my girlfriend, you can use mine.

455
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:06,286
- Will you use mine?  - No. I'll buy my own.

456
00:41:06,486 --> 00:41:08,006
Let's just go.

457
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:11,206
I'll just hold the door for you.

458
00:41:31,986 --> 00:41:33,606
She's not working so late.

459
00:41:47,987 --> 00:41:49,446
Is she still working?

460
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:43,166
How many of your friends are coming? There's so much food.

461
00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:46,246
There's San. You have met him. Sa is coming too.

462
00:42:46,446 --> 00:42:47,606
Two people?

463
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,312
You prepared enough food for a dozen.

464
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:51,366
Sa eats a lot.

465
00:42:52,772 --> 00:42:54,652
They're here.

466
00:42:55,753 --> 00:42:57,726
Your house looks cute, Kuer.

467
00:43:04,879 --> 00:43:07,046
You're so late. I thought you were coming tomorrow.

468
00:43:07,192 --> 00:43:08,966
Well...

469
00:43:09,641 --> 00:43:13,646
We stopped by to get these for you.

470
00:43:14,353 --> 00:43:17,006
To celebrate the new house.

471
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,246
- Yeah, new.  - New.

472
00:43:21,526 --> 00:43:22,526
Un.

473
00:43:23,746 --> 00:43:26,106
Sa, this is Un. Un, this is Sa.

474
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:28,526
- Good evening.  - She's my friend from college.

475
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,886
I'll get some glasses for you.

476
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:34,166
Yes, please. Thank you.

477
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:37,541
You're so quick.

478
00:43:37,705 --> 00:43:40,246
You just said you had a crush on her. Now you've moved in together?

479
00:43:40,393 --> 00:43:42,686
We need to be here for a while, so we rent a house.

480
00:43:43,352 --> 00:43:44,352
Have you shagged her?

481
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:46,166
Sa! What are you talking about?

482
00:43:46,352 --> 00:43:48,326
- Don't you want to know?  - Have you?

483
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:53,446
I have been living with her.

484
00:43:54,826 --> 00:43:59,126
Good for you. I was afraid you couldn't get over Phim.

485
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:02,286
I was thinking that if she broke up with her husband,

486
00:44:02,413 --> 00:44:04,926
- she would come crawling back to you for sure!  - Sa!

487
00:44:05,146 --> 00:44:06,506
Nonsense.

488
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:14,501
Let's see what's on the menu tonight! Wow!

489
00:44:14,707 --> 00:44:16,526
Everything looks yummy.

490
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:19,246
You bought a lot of food.

491
00:44:21,779 --> 00:44:23,926
The food might be a bit sweet.

492
00:44:27,312 --> 00:44:29,406
Wan, you witch!

493
00:44:30,832 --> 00:44:32,046
You witch!

494
00:44:32,452 --> 00:44:35,406
Don't even think you can win against me.

495
00:44:35,766 --> 00:44:37,646
I'll never lose to you!

496
00:44:37,752 --> 00:44:38,966
You crazy hag!

497
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:42,926
- Who is that?  - It's me, Mom.

498
00:44:44,526 --> 00:44:45,766
Come in.

499
00:44:51,406 --> 00:44:52,406
What is it, son?

500
00:45:03,939 --> 00:45:05,286
What's wrong?

501
00:45:12,886 --> 00:45:14,086
What's wrong, my dear?

502
00:45:14,232 --> 00:45:16,006
What did they do to you?

503
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:19,725
It's Noot, Mom.

504
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:22,465
Noot?

505
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:39,326
- San.  - What?

506
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:41,726
- San!  - What?

507
00:46:42,286 --> 00:46:44,606
I'm an inspector. Show some respect.

508
00:46:45,206 --> 00:46:46,886
Give me some snacks.

509
00:46:47,046 --> 00:46:48,526
Call me inspector first.

510
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:50,566
Inspector, sir.

511
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:53,326
- Give me some.  - I ate it all.

512
00:46:53,892 --> 00:46:55,806
He ate it all.

513
00:46:55,912 --> 00:46:59,366
Kuer, you didn't drink. Please go buy some more.

514
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:01,406
Does it feel hot to you?

515
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:04,372
The weather is just fine for me.

516
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:08,246
Okay.

517
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:11,246
Call me if you need anything else.

518
00:47:11,526 --> 00:47:13,046
Okay, I will.

519
00:47:13,279 --> 00:47:14,566
Please watch them for me.

520
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:17,406
Sa.

521
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:21,086
- What?  - Why do you have five heads?

522
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:24,713
My face is here. I'm here.

523
00:47:24,806 --> 00:47:26,366
I thought this was your face.

524
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,006
Put your foot away. You almost kicked my head.

525
00:47:30,404 --> 00:47:33,686
I didn't think Kuer was dating someone.

526
00:47:35,066 --> 00:47:36,806
Honestly,

527
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:39,326
I thought you two just met.

528
00:47:39,426 --> 00:47:40,606
What happened?

529
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:43,126
You've moved in together now?

530
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:51,072
Don't be shy. It's 2023 now. I don't mind.

531
00:47:51,153 --> 00:47:52,565
But does she?

532
00:47:52,646 --> 00:47:54,086
Don't mind it. It's nothing.

533
00:47:56,486 --> 00:47:59,286
A good guy like Kuer has finally forgotten Phim.

534
00:47:59,678 --> 00:48:02,406
I'd be okay if he's dating anyone.

535
00:48:04,124 --> 00:48:05,206
You're right.

536
00:48:08,246 --> 00:48:09,566
Who is Phim?

537
00:48:09,873 --> 00:48:11,766
She's Kuer's ex.

538
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:16,206
She married a millionaire in Phuket. Who is it?

539
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:17,938
What's his name?

540
00:48:18,047 --> 00:48:21,366
Mr. Chanoot Jangwangprawes.

541
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:24,666
Prawes? It's Jangwangprawas.

542
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:29,486
How would I live, Phim?

543
00:48:32,366 --> 00:48:33,806
Kuer

544
00:48:34,406 --> 00:48:36,166
loved Phim so much.

545
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,925
Phim dumped him eight years ago,

546
00:48:39,006 --> 00:48:40,886
but he didn't date anyone

547
00:48:42,406 --> 00:48:43,686
until you, Un.

548
00:48:45,226 --> 00:48:47,806
How could he not have loved her?

549
00:48:48,366 --> 00:48:51,726
The day Phim broke up with Kuer

550
00:48:51,819 --> 00:48:54,682
was the day Kuer wanted to propose to her.

551
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,126
Think about it.

552
00:48:56,632 --> 00:48:59,006
To Kuer.

553
00:48:59,726 --> 00:49:02,726
- To Kuer, our dear friend.  - Our dear friend.

554
00:49:05,406 --> 00:49:08,246
Sa, are you drunk?

555
00:49:10,472 --> 00:49:13,046
I'm not drunk. I just had one glass too many.

556
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:29,806
I'm back.

557
00:49:31,486 --> 00:49:32,646
They're gone.

558
00:49:36,925 --> 00:49:38,946
Call me

559
00:49:39,286 --> 00:49:41,046
inspector.

560
00:49:42,086 --> 00:49:43,766
They look like they're dead.

561
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:49,286
I better bring them some pillows and blankets.

562
00:49:50,672 --> 00:49:51,886
What a pity.

563
00:49:52,846 --> 00:49:55,326
I have bought you more snacks and drinks.

564
00:49:56,318 --> 00:49:57,366
Kuer.

565
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:01,446
I'll be going to the hospital with you and Phim tomorrow.

566
00:50:11,692 --> 00:50:14,326
I'm Pimrata Jangwangprawas. I have an appointment.

567
00:50:14,486 --> 00:50:15,486
Yes.

568
00:50:16,526 --> 00:50:19,406
Mrs. Pimrata Jangwangprawas.

569
00:50:19,566 --> 00:50:20,926
Please wait.

570
00:50:21,766 --> 00:50:22,766
Phim.

571
00:50:33,185 --> 00:50:34,486
Un is here too?

572
00:50:34,646 --> 00:50:38,566
We're going to the office after this. I won't have to pick her up.

573
00:50:42,985 --> 00:50:44,446
I don't want him to waste time.

574
00:50:44,686 --> 00:50:47,406
Kuer is going to Bangkok this afternoon.

575
00:50:50,603 --> 00:50:55,886
You and Un can sit there. I'll be here when I'm done.

576
00:51:06,276 --> 00:51:09,366
Phim is seeing a doctor. Let's wait outside.

577
00:51:10,112 --> 00:51:12,112
Who would want to go in?

578
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:16,126
You asked to come. I thought you wanted to know.

579
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:18,726
Seriously? I'm not invading her privacy.

580
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:23,806
Why did you suddenly ask to come along?

581
00:51:32,272 --> 00:51:34,486
They asked me to wait in front of the doctor's office.

582
00:51:37,446 --> 00:51:38,646
This way, please.

583
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:53,489
Phim.

584
00:51:53,626 --> 00:51:54,726
Yes?

585
00:51:55,626 --> 00:51:57,086
Why did you come to this department?

586
00:51:59,126 --> 00:52:02,886
Didn't I tell you? I don't want anyone else to find out.

587
00:52:05,486 --> 00:52:07,166
I'll just leave then.

588
00:52:07,985 --> 00:52:09,326
It's okay.

589
00:52:09,852 --> 00:52:11,566
I postponed the appointment.

590
00:52:16,326 --> 00:52:17,566
Is something wrong?

591
00:52:19,579 --> 00:52:20,826
It's nothing, Un.

592
00:52:41,112 --> 00:52:43,646
Don't send our client list to Un just yet.

593
00:52:44,312 --> 00:52:46,726
Wait for the documents from C-Itsara first.

594
00:52:47,194 --> 00:52:48,194
Yes.

595
00:52:50,972 --> 00:52:52,086
Grandfather.

596
00:52:52,952 --> 00:52:55,166
Yesterday, during a meeting to revise the offer,

597
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:59,166
an accounting guy noted some abnormalities in our annual reports.

598
00:53:00,206 --> 00:53:03,206
So I asked for annual reports from the past five years.

599
00:53:04,925 --> 00:53:06,925
Good. Let me know if anything is wrong.

600
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:08,486
Yes.

601
00:53:11,006 --> 00:53:12,206
Come in.

602
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:16,806
Noot. Don't leave.

603
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:21,606
How was the dock visit yesterday?

604
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:25,166
Mr. Kuer said we were their first choice.

605
00:53:25,686 --> 00:53:28,176
They think we have everything.

606
00:53:28,256 --> 00:53:31,286
They can invest less with the potential we have.

607
00:53:31,686 --> 00:53:33,926
Are we just an option for them?

608
00:53:35,206 --> 00:53:36,206
Yes.

609
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,766
It looks like they want to sign the joint venture with us,

610
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:42,366
but Kuer is hesitating. I don't know why.

611
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:49,726
Grandfather.

612
00:53:51,372 --> 00:53:53,846
Why do we want this joint venture with C-Itsara?

613
00:53:54,686 --> 00:53:57,206
It looks like they're taking advantage of us.

614
00:53:57,672 --> 00:54:00,566
Even if they joined forces with the other small dock owners,

615
00:54:00,806 --> 00:54:03,206
they wouldn't be able to compete with a dominant force like us.

616
00:54:03,372 --> 00:54:07,126
C-Itsara is a huge shipment company with loads of clients.

617
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,326
They want to do a joint venture with someone here

618
00:54:09,726 --> 00:54:12,726
because they want access to docks and storage.

619
00:54:12,952 --> 00:54:15,206
That will help them serve their clients.

620
00:54:15,992 --> 00:54:18,766
Are you saying we should let their clients go to the small docks

621
00:54:19,725 --> 00:54:22,446
and create opportunities for them to expand and compete with us?

622
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:30,886
Rit.

623
00:54:31,819 --> 00:54:33,286
Today, you'll help Noot

624
00:54:33,766 --> 00:54:35,246
to review our past annual reports.

625
00:54:38,406 --> 00:54:39,646
Yes, Grandfather.

626
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:53,366
There are a few missed calls. I think it's urgent.

627
00:54:54,806 --> 00:54:57,126
I'll be helping you after lunch.

628
00:54:57,858 --> 00:54:58,858
Yes.

629
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:01,299
I told the staff to bring the documents to my room.

630
00:55:01,572 --> 00:55:03,926
I'll call you once they arrive.

631
00:55:25,752 --> 00:55:26,806
What is it?

632
00:55:26,912 --> 00:55:28,606
I found their house yesterday.

633
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,206
I followed them today.

634
00:55:30,366 --> 00:55:32,766
Mr. Kuer came to the hospital.

635
00:55:33,206 --> 00:55:34,206
So what?

636
00:55:34,446 --> 00:55:35,966
Kuer came here with Phim.

637
00:55:36,646 --> 00:55:39,966
(At first, they appeared to be seeing an ob-gyn doctor.)

638
00:55:40,226 --> 00:55:42,226
When Mrs. Phim saw Miss Un was with him,

639
00:55:42,392 --> 00:55:44,392
she asked to change departments.

640
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:03,206
Rit.

641
00:56:06,745 --> 00:56:08,286
Did you stay here late last night?

642
00:56:14,452 --> 00:56:15,606
Yes.

643
00:56:21,732 --> 00:56:22,966
What is it?

644
00:56:23,205 --> 00:56:24,726
Did you miss me?

645
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,486
I did.

646
00:56:31,699 --> 00:56:33,486
What did Noot want you to do last night?

647
00:56:33,699 --> 00:56:35,046
You stayed here till late.

648
00:56:38,012 --> 00:56:40,606
Mr. Noot...

649
00:56:41,926 --> 00:56:45,366
Mr. Noot asked me to review last year's annual report.

650
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:53,006
He said something was off.

651
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,206
Today, Mr. Noot asked the accounting department

652
00:56:55,299 --> 00:56:57,046
to send annual reports from the past five years.

653
00:56:57,273 --> 00:56:58,566
If there are more abnormalities,

654
00:56:58,699 --> 00:57:00,699
we will need to analyze the details.

655
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:06,646
I found out about that.

656
00:57:06,759 --> 00:57:10,206
Grandfather asked me to help Noot with that today.

657
00:57:14,326 --> 00:57:15,566
Thank you.

658
00:57:16,046 --> 00:57:20,526
Okay. I need to get back to work.

659
00:57:52,266 --> 00:57:53,366
What is it?

660
00:57:53,492 --> 00:57:55,406
I want to talk about Phim.

661
00:57:57,886 --> 00:57:59,486
I don't have anything to say.

662
00:57:59,619 --> 00:58:00,739
I do.

663
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:04,526
Do you still have feelings for Phim?

664
00:58:08,726 --> 00:58:10,806
I admit that I couldn't get over

665
00:58:11,866 --> 00:58:14,326
the day Phim left me to marry you.

666
00:58:16,473 --> 00:58:17,766
But today,

667
00:58:17,879 --> 00:58:20,246
I'm not the one you should worry about.

668
00:58:22,605 --> 00:58:24,006
What do you mean by that?

669
00:58:24,646 --> 00:58:26,646
I'm dating Un.

670
00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:29,046
Phim is just my friend.

671
00:58:34,126 --> 00:58:37,206
Are you here just to ask me this?

672
00:58:37,312 --> 00:58:38,375
So,

673
00:58:42,492 --> 00:58:44,166
I hope

674
00:58:44,925 --> 00:58:47,366
you will remain friends with her.

675
00:58:52,259 --> 00:58:53,766
I don't like to steal.

676
00:59:29,226 --> 00:59:30,846
Kuer.

677
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:33,166
What's wrong with you?

678
00:59:40,863 --> 00:59:42,006
Are you tired?

679
00:59:43,326 --> 00:59:47,526
I'll be in Bangkok for a few days. I'm going to miss you a lot.

680
00:59:48,593 --> 00:59:49,966
You're not changing your mind?

681
00:59:51,406 --> 00:59:53,886
If I don't stay, who will do your job here?

682
00:59:56,312 --> 01:00:00,366
Before I go to Bangkok, I have somewhere I want to go with you.

683
01:00:01,285 --> 01:00:02,446
Where?

684
01:00:18,765 --> 01:00:19,966
Kuer.

685
01:00:20,246 --> 01:00:21,446
I know.

686
01:00:21,712 --> 01:00:23,846
You said you didn't want to step foot here again.

687
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:25,926
Why would you bring me here then?

688
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:30,166
There's someone important I want to meet.

689
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:33,206
Who? My grandfather?

690
01:00:33,646 --> 01:00:36,126
You can talk to him at the office.

691
01:00:37,866 --> 01:00:39,486
I want to meet your mother.

692
01:00:40,545 --> 01:00:41,806
Why?

693
01:00:43,246 --> 01:00:46,046
Why won't you let me meet your mother?

694
01:00:53,726 --> 01:00:56,046
At least, I want you to be sure

695
01:00:56,525 --> 01:00:58,406
that I'm serious about you.

696
01:01:11,766 --> 01:01:13,766
I have heard about you, Kuer.

697
01:01:14,246 --> 01:01:16,286
I'm glad to finally meet you.

698
01:01:18,626 --> 01:01:21,126
I want to apologize

699
01:01:21,426 --> 01:01:23,126
for not coming here sooner.

700
01:01:31,526 --> 01:01:33,206
Nok. Who is here?

701
01:01:33,779 --> 01:01:34,806
It's Miss Un.

702
01:01:34,966 --> 01:01:38,126
I know Un. Who is with her?

703
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:41,246
Apparently, his name is Kuer.

704
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:45,126
I'm not sure who he is.

705
01:01:47,766 --> 01:01:50,606
Do you know who she is dating?

706
01:01:50,692 --> 01:01:51,726
She didn't tell me.

707
01:01:51,819 --> 01:01:54,926
Why don't you know what you should know?

708
01:01:56,172 --> 01:02:01,246
She is dating an executive of a company I want to invest in.

709
01:02:06,505 --> 01:02:07,926
Mr. Kuer?

710
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:12,126
Is he the boyfriend Father mentioned?

711
01:02:12,406 --> 01:02:16,406
I'll go to Bangkok for a few days. When I return,

712
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,699
I want to take you out for dinner, ma'am.

713
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:20,686
Sure.

714
01:02:21,086 --> 01:02:23,126
Un can call and tell me.

715
01:02:25,632 --> 01:02:29,366
You can come home to be with me these few days then?

716
01:02:31,212 --> 01:02:32,326
That's good, then.

717
01:02:32,772 --> 01:02:36,086
I would worry about her if she's home alone.

718
01:02:40,726 --> 01:02:46,126
Okay. I'll drive Kuer to the airport and deal with some business.

719
01:02:46,232 --> 01:02:49,926
Then, I'll get my stuff and come to see you tonight.

720
01:02:50,086 --> 01:02:51,806
I'll be home in the evening.

721
01:02:52,086 --> 01:02:53,166
Okay.

722
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:08,526
You know I don't want to step foot in this house.

723
01:03:08,607 --> 01:03:10,406
And yet you make me stay here?

724
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:13,606
Your mom hasn't seen you in years.

725
01:03:13,852 --> 01:03:15,446
She misses you.

726
01:03:16,606 --> 01:03:18,046
I miss her too.

727
01:03:18,566 --> 01:03:20,806
- But I...  - If you miss her, why is there a but?

728
01:03:22,152 --> 01:03:25,366
I think you should stay here, so I don't worry about you.

729
01:03:28,286 --> 01:03:31,526
Are you here just to ask my mom to dinner?

730
01:03:34,092 --> 01:03:36,092
I have to introduce myself.

731
01:03:37,352 --> 01:03:39,352
When I ask for her blessing later,

732
01:03:39,939 --> 01:03:41,499
she will know who I am.

733
01:04:04,606 --> 01:04:07,449
Your kid brought her future husband to see you.

734
01:04:07,726 --> 01:04:09,686
You're smiling ear to ear.

735
01:04:11,232 --> 01:04:13,686
Her man is an executive of C-Itsara.

736
01:04:13,926 --> 01:04:16,966
You will be quick to give him your blessing, won't you?

737
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:21,086
I don't care who he is.

738
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:23,686
I only want someone who truly loves Un.

739
01:04:24,606 --> 01:04:27,206
Who wouldn't want such a rich guy?

740
01:04:27,339 --> 01:04:31,366
Un is lucky to have a man like that.

741
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:33,173
Tell her to get pregnant quickly.

742
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:36,046
If she gets pregnant, she can lock him in.

743
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:40,006
Like you did?

744
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:44,606
I'm talking to you nicely because I wish your kid well.

745
01:04:44,712 --> 01:04:46,566
And yet you're still bad-mouthing me?

746
01:04:46,685 --> 01:04:49,406
If that's talking nicely, nothing is rude then.

747
01:04:50,439 --> 01:04:51,966
If that's the best you can do,

748
01:04:52,379 --> 01:04:54,676
just keep your mouth to flatter Father and Noot.

749
01:04:59,106 --> 01:05:01,646
You don't deserve to be talked to nicely.

750
01:05:04,499 --> 01:05:05,766
Mrs. Wan?

751
01:05:06,717 --> 01:05:07,725
Mrs. Wan!

752
01:05:07,806 --> 01:05:10,646
Don't move. There's a lot of blood.

753
01:05:10,772 --> 01:05:12,446
Mrs. Wan.

754
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:16,606
What about the other two?

755
01:05:17,058 --> 01:05:20,246
They want us to talk to you first.

756
01:05:20,819 --> 01:05:24,046
Apparently, C-Itsara is already negotiating a deal with JP.

757
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:25,406
Yes.

758
01:05:25,819 --> 01:05:28,526
Why did you contact us then?

759
01:05:30,525 --> 01:05:32,326
I'll tell you honestly.

760
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,886
C-Itsara indeed sees JP as our first choice,

761
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:39,486
but we're not overlooking a joint venture with the other small docks.

762
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:43,286
So it means we still stand a chance.

763
01:05:43,665 --> 01:05:44,806
You do.

764
01:05:45,512 --> 01:05:48,326
We will invest less in a joint venture with JP,

765
01:05:48,952 --> 01:05:50,526
but the deal is important.

766
01:05:50,752 --> 01:05:53,646
I want to know your terms too.

767
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:02,366
I need to go to Bangkok and prepare the team to work with me here.

768
01:06:03,086 --> 01:06:06,126
That's good. We need to look at so many details.

769
01:06:07,252 --> 01:06:09,926
While I'm there, I need your help.

770
01:06:11,299 --> 01:06:14,246
I need you to talk to the other small dock owners.

771
01:06:14,879 --> 01:06:16,079
Okay.

772
01:06:17,752 --> 01:06:22,086
As my adviser, you're not against that, are you?

773
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:24,006
Not at all.

774
01:06:24,699 --> 01:06:28,326
I believe JP wants this joint venture. They're just playing hard to get.

775
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:31,566
If we have the edge over JP,

776
01:06:31,806 --> 01:06:33,926
things will probably be easier.

777
01:06:34,886 --> 01:06:37,766
Will you be comfortable

778
01:06:37,986 --> 01:06:40,206
if I meet all five of you together?

779
01:06:40,846 --> 01:06:43,886
We're okay with that. I'll talk to the other two.

780
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:46,046
I'll let you know

781
01:06:46,232 --> 01:06:47,606
the date when we will be meeting.

782
01:06:48,766 --> 01:06:49,846
Of course.

783
01:07:06,832 --> 01:07:07,926
Phim.

784
01:07:09,206 --> 01:07:11,246
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

785
01:07:12,665 --> 01:07:15,806
I knew you were coming to Bangkok.

786
01:07:16,636 --> 01:07:21,646
The hospitals here are better equipped.

787
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,046
I called a doctor here for his advice.

788
01:07:24,286 --> 01:07:26,326
He told me to come and get myself checked.

789
01:07:31,286 --> 01:07:33,286
Can I stay here?

790
01:07:37,786 --> 01:07:38,926
I think

791
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:41,566
you should stay at a hotel.

792
01:07:49,926 --> 01:07:52,326
The doctor's appointment is tomorrow.

793
01:07:53,552 --> 01:07:56,486
They will do a biopsy.

794
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:04,446
I'm afraid I can't handle it alone.

795
01:08:31,366 --> 01:08:32,966
It's okay.

796
01:08:34,419 --> 01:08:37,006
I don't want to cause you trouble.

797
01:09:10,448 --> 01:09:11,448
Phim.

798
01:09:25,219 --> 01:09:26,926
You can stay with me.

799
01:09:33,739 --> 01:09:35,406
Kuer is in Bangkok with Phim.

800
01:09:38,772 --> 01:09:41,366
I know I have chosen the wrong guy.

801
01:09:41,472 --> 01:09:45,486
If I get a divorce, will you get back together with me?

802
01:09:52,584 --> 01:09:53,605
What are you doing?

803
01:09:53,686 --> 01:09:56,486
I'm working at the office. I'm not busy. I can talk.

804
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:02,539
Un.
