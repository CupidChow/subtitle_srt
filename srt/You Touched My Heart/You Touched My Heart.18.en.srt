1
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:51,486
Here are your pills, Father.

2
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:55,566
Phim drove her car off the road.

3
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:58,526
I have a witness saying you hired someone to cause that.

4
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:03,086
I'm glad

5
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:04,566
I kept these from that day.

6
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:07,566
I won't let anyone hold me back again.

7
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:10,406
Can you come out and talk to me?

8
00:02:10,694 --> 00:02:12,606
I have a favor to ask.

9
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:15,006
I'd rather say it to you in person.

10
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:22,726
What's wrong, Father?

11
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:41,646
I don't know what's wrong. I got up, and

12
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,126
I got weirdly dizzy and drowsy.

13
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:50,966
Did you get up too fast?

14
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,406
You can call me next time.

15
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:58,446
Maybe I did.

16
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:06,086
Is Un not coming home tonight?

17
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,206
She has headed out with Gade.

18
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,046
I think she's staying at a hotel near the beach.

19
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:21,486
I don't know how she will react

20
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:25,446
when I remove her as Vice President.

21
00:03:30,382 --> 00:03:33,246
Un does her job with her emotions.

22
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:36,846
She's not fit to lead a large company.

23
00:03:38,446 --> 00:03:40,246
I believe she can do it, Father.

24
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:46,286
Don't argue with me now.

25
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:53,886
I'll let Un continue to work at JP

26
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:57,686
until Phim's son grows up.

27
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:01,766
Un will serve as Rit's right hand.

28
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:06,366
After all, Rit is not as capable as Un.

29
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:17,006
I'll fetch you some water.

30
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:27,446
Are you waiting for your son, or are you here to see Father?

31
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:29,926
What I do is none of your business.

32
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,966
Just take care of your daughter.

33
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:34,206
She's getting fired soon.

34
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:37,606
Who knows?

35
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:41,206
Un might be here to stay.

36
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:57,846
Rit.

37
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:01,926
Rit, where are you? Why don't you come home?

38
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,926
What do you want?

39
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:48,766
Can I have Kuer for myself?

40
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,046
I'm pregnant.

41
00:05:57,885 --> 00:06:00,126
My baby doesn't have a father.

42
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,246
I have cancer. You know that.

43
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:08,726
So what?

44
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,326
If anything happens to me, how will my son live?

45
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:24,206
If he has Kuer,

46
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:33,806
at least if anything happens to me,

47
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,806
I can rest in peace.

48
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,766
I know that Kuer will love

49
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:48,846
and care for my son very well.

50
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:58,646
My baby really needs a good father, Un.

51
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:07,686
The child you tried to tell everyone it was Kuer's

52
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:11,846
when he has denied it the whole time?

53
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:18,606
I'm sorry.

54
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,966
What about the rumors your mother had spread?

55
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:27,926
What was that for?

56
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:32,813
I'm sorry, Un. My mom is...

57
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:34,126
Stop apologizing.

58
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,526
I understand you.

59
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:46,206
If you're saying that because we're both women,

60
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,686
I need to give up my love for you,

61
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:53,086
it doesn't work that way.

62
00:07:57,174 --> 00:07:58,886
I really sympathize with you.

63
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,886
You got pregnant while you were sick.

64
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,766
If you want me to give up Kuer to you

65
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:14,166
just because you're pregnant and sick,

66
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:17,806
I can't.

67
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,166
I'm sorry, Phim.

68
00:08:26,494 --> 00:08:28,406
You can call me selfish.

69
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:34,606
I just think that some things can never be given as charity.

70
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:29,326
Gade, is Un up?

71
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:33,086
She didn't sleep with you?

72
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:35,046
She didn't sleep with me last night.

73
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:37,886
She didn't.

74
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:41,246
Her car is not here.

75
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:43,526
Did she leave early?

76
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:46,286
Phim called Un last night when I was drying my hair.

77
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:48,266
She walked outside to take that call.

78
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:53,606
Gade, can you call Un's mom and ask if she's there?

79
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:55,846
Okay.

80
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:12,486
What's up, Gade?

81
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:14,614
Did Un come home to you last night?

82
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:16,766
She didn't. What's wrong?

83
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:18,926
She isn't there?

84
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:22,646
Ma'am, it's me, Kuer.

85
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:25,206
Un left my house last night.

86
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:27,006
(She hasn't come back.)

87
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:28,486
(The last time Gade saw her,)

88
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:34,006
she was talking to Phim on the phone. Did Un come home last night?

89
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:36,086
She didn't come home.

90
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,726
Ma'am, is Phim's car there?

91
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:43,246
I'll take a look.

92
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:48,166
Phim's car is here.

93
00:10:49,613 --> 00:10:50,966
What about Rit's car?

94
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:54,286
It's here too.

95
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,366
Really? That's all for now, ma'am.

96
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:04,046
Where the heck is she?

97
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:18,406
Would you like to have breakfast before going to work?

98
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,686
I'd rather not. I'm in a hurry today.

99
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:24,686
I'm here to ask Grandfather if he has anything he wants me to do.

100
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:26,526
I'll head straight to the office.

101
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,566
Did Un leave already?

102
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:30,566
Phim?

103
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:34,606
Did you call Un out last night?

104
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,926
I saw her for a few minutes.

105
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:40,246
Why did you call her out?

106
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:43,766
I just wanted to talk to her.

107
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:47,726
I'll head outside now.

108
00:12:04,502 --> 00:12:06,726
- Thank you so much.  - You're welcome.

109
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,886
Hey. What happened?

110
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:11,486
When did she leave?

111
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:15,374
Last night. Phim called her. Un went outside to take the call.

112
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:19,926
I thought she went to Kuer's room after the call and...

113
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,534
I called Tony.

114
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:23,286
He doesn't know anything.

115
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:25,566
Un wouldn't have gone to Tony's.

116
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,846
Did you file a missing person report?

117
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:29,326
I did.

118
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:32,886
Did you find out anything?

119
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:49,483
(Kuer)

120
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:56,166
What do you want, Kuer?

121
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,686
Why did you call Un last night?

122
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:05,686
Did she tell you?

123
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:08,806
She promised me

124
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:11,926
she wouldn't tell you what we talked about.

125
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:14,126
What do you mean, Phim?

126
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:16,526
Well...

127
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:21,526
I called Un out to talk about you.

128
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:25,375
What happened? Where is Un now?

129
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:30,686
If you want to know where she is, why don't you call her? Why call me?

130
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:32,926
Phim.

131
00:13:33,102 --> 00:13:35,246
What time did Un leave you last night?

132
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,206
It was around 10-11 pm.

133
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:38,686
What's wrong?

134
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:40,246
Did anything happen?

135
00:13:40,565 --> 00:13:41,846
Un is missing.

136
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,278
(I have to go.)

137
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:47,086
Un really met with Phim.

138
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,326
She said Un left her at around 10-11 pm.

139
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:50,991
Is there a witness?

140
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:53,486
I don't think so. They talked in private.

141
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:55,446
They talked about you. You're the reason.

142
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,560
- Are you blaming me?  - That's right!

143
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,406
Hey! Please don't fight!

144
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:03,766
I'm stressed enough with just Un missing.

145
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,246
Don't fight now!

146
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:06,806
Please, I beg you.

147
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:13,406
Did Phim do it? She has beef with Un anyway.

148
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:15,246
Don't forget about Rit, Sa.

149
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,702
Rit is a suspect.

150
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:21,366
He scammed the accounting.

151
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:23,646
Before I came here,

152
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:25,326
I called JP's office.

153
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,886
Rit and Nam are not there.

154
00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:29,726
Are we too late?

155
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:31,232
It happened around 10-11 pm last night.

156
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,686
It's been many hours already.

157
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:36,390
If someone wanted to hurt Un, she'd be dead by now.

158
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:31,766
I just think that some things can never be given as charity.

159
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:06,326
Rit?

160
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:23,166
Are you awake?

161
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:38,414
Can you give me the evidence that you have?

162
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:42,686
What evidence?

163
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:47,926
The company's accounting.

164
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:56,286
Why did you take so much money out?

165
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,966
I just built something for myself.

166
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:18,326
You wanted to take your mom out of Jangwangprawas.

167
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:20,166
I wanted to take what's mine too.

168
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:22,669
I don't want to leave, only to struggle.

169
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:27,446
I worked hard for Grandfather.

170
00:17:28,285 --> 00:17:30,686
That was the money I deserved.

171
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:34,646
I'm his grandson.

172
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:37,006
All I get is my salary.

173
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:42,726
Phim is just an in-law, yet she gets to run the resort!

174
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:46,646
All I can be is a regular employee.

175
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,766
Isn't that messed up?

176
00:17:58,126 --> 00:18:00,006
Isn't that because you're Aunt Wing's son,

177
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:03,886
so you're not a Jangwangprawas?

178
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,086
It's a shame that you're a woman.

179
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,606
You're smarter than any of us.

180
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:24,366
It would be nice if you could run JP.

181
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:33,406
Rit, are you not taking over JP?

182
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,366
I never wanted to run JP.

183
00:18:40,446 --> 00:18:41,806
I never even thought about it.

184
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:55,486
Rit.

185
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,286
Did you have anything to do with Noot's death?

186
00:19:15,526 --> 00:19:17,206
I think we've talked enough.

187
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:22,006
Give me your evidence.

188
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:27,966
I don't have it with me.

189
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:31,006
Someone like you

190
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:34,526
would never leave something important out of reach.

191
00:19:43,846 --> 00:19:45,006
Mek.

192
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:46,640
- Mek.  - What's up?

193
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:48,166
Mr. Kuer called me.

194
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:54,046
He asked about Rit. He said if we helped him, he'd help us.

195
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:02,206
I think it's time for us to choose, Nam.

196
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,326
What happened, Mrs. Wan?

197
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,046
There's something urgent. I need to head outside.

198
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,686
- Okay.  - I need to give Father his pills first.

199
00:20:31,253 --> 00:20:35,606
If you don't mind, I can do that for you.

200
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:41,046
Don't worry. I can do it.

201
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,446
Then I'll leave it to you.

202
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:47,646
I'll give you the pills before I go out.

203
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:48,806
Okay.

204
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,166
Where is Wan going?

205
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,470
Would it kill you not to know?

206
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:23,006
Phim!

207
00:21:24,677 --> 00:21:28,206
I drove all over the beach looking for you!

208
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,806
You didn't pick up my calls!

209
00:21:33,188 --> 00:21:35,406
Did you know how worried I was?

210
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:39,486
Un went missing.

211
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:43,206
Kuer is worried to death.

212
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:46,846
Un went missing?

213
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:51,982
He called and told me.

214
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,446
Would he get worried like that if it were me?

215
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:02,646
Hey, Phim!

216
00:22:03,237 --> 00:22:05,406
Don't think that way.

217
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:09,486
If you go missing, everyone will be worried.

218
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:26,526
Don't!

219
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:49,006
- Please do it for me.  - Okay.

220
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:58,446
Kan.

221
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,446
Kan.

222
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:03,486
Mrs. Wan?

223
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:08,206
You said the person who killed Vee is the one who attacked you.

224
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:11,326
Is it possible that Prawing hired them to hurt Un too?

225
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,478
It's possible.

226
00:23:15,381 --> 00:23:16,486
What happened?

227
00:23:16,677 --> 00:23:18,270
Did anything happen to Miss Un?

228
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:19,686
Un went missing last night.

229
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:34,086
Promise me, Mr. Kuer,

230
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,846
that you will give your statement

231
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,366
to save Mek.

232
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:40,526
If you help me, I promise I'll help you.

233
00:24:57,686 --> 00:25:00,006
Where will you go to look for Miss Un?

234
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,326
I don't know.

235
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:04,886
Rit didn't leave any trace.

236
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:16,102
What are those?

237
00:25:16,207 --> 00:25:17,926
I got these from the night of the murder.

238
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:20,646
I think these can help you convict Rit.

239
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:24,206
If Rit gets away,

240
00:25:25,517 --> 00:25:27,006
my family will be in trouble.

241
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:29,536
They got stuck on the edge of the boat.

242
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:31,526
Rit probably tried to throw them into the sea.

243
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:48,926
If you don't know where to look,

244
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,326
can you follow me to a place?

245
00:25:51,878 --> 00:25:52,926
Where?

246
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:02,126
Can we really trust her?

247
00:26:03,238 --> 00:26:06,166
Phim doesn't look like she did anything.

248
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,516
She won't talk.

249
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:21,446
If she won't, how can we find out?

250
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:25,366
She said she didn't do it. She didn't touch Un.

251
00:26:25,981 --> 00:26:29,046
She talked to her last night, and then she left.

252
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:33,486
Does she know where Un went?

253
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,846
Believe me.

254
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,566
Phim has nothing to do with this.

255
00:26:46,286 --> 00:26:48,286
Forget about Phim kidnapping someone.

256
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:52,046
She's barely keeping herself alive.

257
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:02,486
Kuer told us to meet at Rit's new house.

258
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:04,526
Rit's new house? Where is it?

259
00:27:04,678 --> 00:27:06,046
He told me roughly.

260
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:08,233
How did Kuer find that house?

261
00:27:08,318 --> 00:27:09,382
Nam told him.

262
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:12,846
The search warrant we have is not for that house.

263
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,286
Wait. Nam and Rit are dating.

264
00:27:16,414 --> 00:27:18,206
And Nam is suddenly telling it all to Kuer?

265
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:20,142
Doesn't that seem odd?

266
00:27:20,582 --> 00:27:22,582
It's not. Let's go.

267
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,246
Let's go.

268
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:25,526
Okay.

269
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:28,286
- Mrs. Wan, good morning.  - Good morning.

270
00:27:28,717 --> 00:27:31,526
Kan said he put a GPS on Un's car.

271
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:34,646
If she had taken her car, we would know where she was.

272
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:39,606
Kan told me to give this phone to you.

273
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:46,053
It's dead.

274
00:27:46,189 --> 00:27:47,566
It's fine. We can charge it in the car.

275
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:49,822
Let's meet up with Kuer. Come with us, Mrs. Wan.

276
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,057
- Okay.  - Let's go.

277
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:52,326
Please.

278
00:28:07,526 --> 00:28:08,726
That's Rit's car.

279
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:11,046
He's really here.

280
00:28:16,086 --> 00:28:17,206
Nam.

281
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:19,206
Let's wait in the car.

282
00:28:19,757 --> 00:28:21,446
I have told San. He's coming.

283
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,446
Mr. Kuer, are you going in right now?

284
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:31,806
Won't you wait for the Inspector?

285
00:28:31,966 --> 00:28:33,070
I won't wait.

286
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:46,006
I'll go around behind the house and check upstairs.

287
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:43,566
It's on!

288
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:47,446
- Her car is moving.  - Where is it?

289
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:48,686
It's in town.

290
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:50,366
It looks like it's heading out.

291
00:30:50,534 --> 00:30:51,926
San, make a U-turn.

292
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:54,846
Okay. Sa, call Kuer and tell him.

293
00:31:06,261 --> 00:31:07,461
What did you find?

294
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:09,126
(Sa)

295
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:10,766
What's up, Sa?

296
00:31:12,181 --> 00:31:13,486
Where is the car now?

297
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:16,286
Okay.

298
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,246
What's wrong, Phim?

299
00:32:03,726 --> 00:32:05,126
Where are you going?

300
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:09,446
Phim.

301
00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:12,526
Where are you going?

302
00:32:57,534 --> 00:32:58,806
Thank you, Si.

303
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:04,526
It's been good to have you as my friend.

304
00:33:19,126 --> 00:33:20,486
I want to rest now.

305
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:26,766
I'm tired of thinking about Kuer and my son every day.

306
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:33,583
Then I'm going with you.

307
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:35,406
Let's go to your home first.

308
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,221
Will you just leave your car here?

309
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:45,446
It's fine. It's just my car. We can come back for it.

310
00:33:48,989 --> 00:33:50,086
It's okay.

311
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,712
You've stayed with me all day long.

312
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:56,766
Can I please go alone?

313
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:00,390
Please?

314
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:04,206
Please?

315
00:34:08,566 --> 00:34:09,726
Phim!

316
00:34:13,171 --> 00:34:14,406
Please, Si.

317
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,086
Phim, come out and talk to me.

318
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:37,206
Phim!

319
00:34:37,914 --> 00:34:39,166
Phim!

320
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:19,566
Hello, San. What's up?

321
00:35:20,112 --> 00:35:21,326
The car has stopped?

322
00:35:22,526 --> 00:35:23,700
Where is it?

323
00:35:23,895 --> 00:35:26,046
Okay. I'll be there in five minutes.

324
00:35:35,206 --> 00:35:36,348
Phim called me.

325
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:38,526
Take her call and merge it. I'll listen.

326
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:40,606
(Okay, hold on.)

327
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:47,289
What's up, Phim?

328
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:52,686
I'm sorry that

329
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:54,406
I left you that day.

330
00:35:57,262 --> 00:36:00,566
I know how important you are to me now.

331
00:36:01,405 --> 00:36:04,557
I know I can't live without you.

332
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,286
- Phim.  - (My baby is Noot's.)

333
00:36:09,206 --> 00:36:10,886
My baby

334
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,206
is Noot's son.

335
00:36:21,365 --> 00:36:23,166
I want to let you know that

336
00:36:24,037 --> 00:36:25,926
even if you leave me,

337
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,446
it's not your fault.

338
00:36:30,742 --> 00:36:32,246
It's my fault alone.

339
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:37,126
It has always been.

340
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:41,886
- Phim.  - I'm sorry, Kuer.

341
00:36:43,357 --> 00:36:45,326
I'm really sorry.

342
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:02,926
I might not get to talk to you again.

343
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:08,686
I want to let you know

344
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:17,406
how much I love you.

345
00:37:20,694 --> 00:37:22,694
I love you so much.

346
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,936
Kuer, is Phim committing suicide?

347
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:41,566
Sa. Can you think of something nice? She's probably just giving up.

348
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:44,166
What are you going to do?

349
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:06,926
(I'll take care of you)

350
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:10,006
(until the day you don't need me anymore.)

351
00:38:18,236 --> 00:38:19,806
Let's break up.

352
00:38:51,334 --> 00:38:53,086
(I want you to stop this.)

353
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:54,806
(You and I)

354
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,966
(were done eight years ago.)

355
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:16,486
My son...

356
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:02,589
San, I see Un's car!

357
00:40:02,822 --> 00:40:04,314
- It's driving downhill.  - What?

358
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:06,013
Kuer, please save Un.

359
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:19,046
Un!

360
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:41,589
Un!

361
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:15,806
Un!

362
00:41:17,718 --> 00:41:18,766
Un!

363
00:41:20,582 --> 00:41:21,806
Un!

364
00:41:22,798 --> 00:41:24,566
Un!

365
00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:44,246
Un, my dear.

366
00:41:44,564 --> 00:41:45,757
Un!

367
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:53,966
Rit, stop, or I'll shoot!

368
00:42:03,278 --> 00:42:04,446
Un!

369
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:09,606
(Logic does not apply to love.)

370
00:42:10,254 --> 00:42:12,606
(Because when you try to be logical,)

371
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:15,846
(feelings are suppressed deep inside.)

372
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:17,846
(Before you realize)

373
00:42:18,222 --> 00:42:20,686
(who the one who touched your heart is,)

374
00:42:21,812 --> 00:42:24,486
(it's too late to change your mind.)

375
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:40,326
Phim!

376
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:42,686
Phim!

377
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:32,886
There's a fatal victim. We need an emergency operation.

378
00:43:33,014 --> 00:43:34,286
Phim?

379
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:16,286
(If it's someone's fault,)

380
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:19,486
(it's mine.)

381
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,886
(It's mine alone.)

382
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:26,086
(I made everything became this way.)

383
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:28,086
If Chanoot doesn't get to be head of the class,

384
00:44:28,278 --> 00:44:30,846
I'll reconsider my support for the school.

385
00:44:50,478 --> 00:44:52,806
I was right to limit your duties.

386
00:44:53,286 --> 00:44:56,046
Should I demote you for a while?

387
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,406
Maybe that will make you a bit smarter.

388
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:00,486
I trusted you.

389
00:45:00,646 --> 00:45:04,246
You couldn't even get them to sign the contract.

390
00:45:07,723 --> 00:45:10,686
Go! Go wherever you want!

391
00:45:36,294 --> 00:45:37,470
- Be careful.  - Yes.

392
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:41,206
Don't worry. We will investigate this.

393
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:43,446
Thank you so much.

394
00:45:56,069 --> 00:45:58,926
I know you're not going to jail.

395
00:45:59,614 --> 00:46:02,926
You have the money to hire a lawyer to help you get away.

396
00:46:03,733 --> 00:46:06,046
I just want to let you know that karma

397
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:07,966
follows you everywhere you go.

398
00:46:08,261 --> 00:46:09,966
You will never be happy.

399
00:46:10,453 --> 00:46:11,766
You've killed people.

400
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:14,526
Your son's fate will be the same as yours.

401
00:46:15,446 --> 00:46:18,006
It will be even more painful

402
00:46:18,896 --> 00:46:20,446
when everything you did

403
00:46:20,693 --> 00:46:22,566
ruins your son's life.

404
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:31,037
Please come to the interrogation room, Mrs. Prawing.

405
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:32,886
Please.

406
00:46:34,677 --> 00:46:36,126
I'm here to turn myself in.

407
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:40,806
I attempted to kill Kan.

408
00:46:41,077 --> 00:46:42,366
I assaulted Phim.

409
00:46:43,206 --> 00:46:45,406
I killed Pravee Jangwangprawas.

410
00:46:52,406 --> 00:46:54,206
Why are you turning yourself in so easily?

411
00:47:24,846 --> 00:47:26,726
Just lie down somewhere!

412
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:48,726
I'm here to kill you.

413
00:47:59,189 --> 00:48:02,286
(Mistakes can happen at any time.)

414
00:48:03,565 --> 00:48:05,366
(My mistake)

415
00:48:07,158 --> 00:48:10,806
(made me lose someone who was my life.)

416
00:48:13,068 --> 00:48:15,926
(Please give me a chance to fix my mistake)

417
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:20,086
(and take care of your heart, Phim.)

418
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:31,646
I'll do my best to raise Petch.

419
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:36,061
I'll raise him with my heart.

420
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:41,566
He will grow up to be the happiest boy ever.

421
00:49:46,885 --> 00:49:48,110
I promise.

422
00:49:51,726 --> 00:49:52,926
Are you sure

423
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:55,926
you won't raise him here?

424
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:00,406
Yes, sir.

425
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:11,006
I'll support him and give him the best of everything.

426
00:50:13,726 --> 00:50:15,246
Won't you change your mind?

427
00:50:21,446 --> 00:50:24,246
I have wronged Phim so much.

428
00:50:27,326 --> 00:50:30,006
I thought what I gave her was the best thing,

429
00:50:32,493 --> 00:50:34,806
but I forced onto her what

430
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,766
I wanted her to have,

431
00:50:41,686 --> 00:50:43,086
what I wanted her to be.

432
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:52,246
Please give me my second chance.

433
00:51:01,446 --> 00:51:02,846
When he grows up,

434
00:51:05,998 --> 00:51:08,966
let him know he has family here.

435
00:51:16,155 --> 00:51:17,155
I will.

436
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:47,646
Thank you.

437
00:51:51,646 --> 00:51:52,966
Are you okay now?

438
00:51:58,126 --> 00:51:59,446
I can't believe it.

439
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:03,726
Love and ambition

440
00:52:04,886 --> 00:52:07,686
make you do things without a second thought.

441
00:52:23,389 --> 00:52:24,766
Do you know, Mek,

442
00:52:29,237 --> 00:52:31,846
that I pretended to be Mr. Noot's lover

443
00:52:34,805 --> 00:52:37,286
just to give Rit what he wants?

444
00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:46,846
With what we have,

445
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,566
we are happy with our lives, aren't we?

446
00:52:51,382 --> 00:52:52,846
You don't have to struggle

447
00:52:54,086 --> 00:52:55,926
and fight for what's not yours.

448
00:52:59,232 --> 00:53:01,406
You still have your brother.

449
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:08,246
I miss Dad.

450
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,046
You should visit him.

451
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:19,606
I don't know when

452
00:53:20,653 --> 00:53:23,046
we will be together again.

453
00:53:26,357 --> 00:53:27,606
In the end,

454
00:53:27,893 --> 00:53:30,446
all we have left is family.

455
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:32,366
We'll love

456
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:35,686
and take care of each other no matter what.

457
00:53:39,406 --> 00:53:41,846
We can't trust anyone else

458
00:53:43,374 --> 00:53:45,374
except for our own family.

459
00:54:17,686 --> 00:54:19,286
It's time for your pills, Father.

460
00:54:20,926 --> 00:54:22,406
I'll take my pills in my room.

461
00:54:23,637 --> 00:54:24,766
Let's go.

462
00:54:26,206 --> 00:54:29,166
Father, here's your tea.

463
00:54:31,812 --> 00:54:32,966
Wan.

464
00:54:34,726 --> 00:54:37,046
Tell Un to take good care of the company.

465
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,086
I'm retiring.

466
00:54:46,902 --> 00:54:48,166
Wing.

467
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:51,646
You'll live outside

468
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:53,446
on your own.

469
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,846
Defend yourself in court, but don't let me know.

470
00:55:04,461 --> 00:55:06,021
I'll give you money monthly.

471
00:55:07,183 --> 00:55:09,686
I don't want to see your face ever again.

472
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,126
You're an outsider. What does this concern you?

473
00:55:20,726 --> 00:55:22,126
I wouldn't want any part of it

474
00:55:22,446 --> 00:55:24,286
if it didn't harm my daughter.

475
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,741
What harm came to your daughter? She's pregnant.

476
00:55:26,879 --> 00:55:30,806
She does nothing all day. She just eats, sleeps, and goes shopping.

477
00:55:30,942 --> 00:55:32,326
She's just waiting for her love child

478
00:55:32,927 --> 00:55:35,606
to claim the inheritance.

479
00:55:36,982 --> 00:55:39,486
The harm is that someone here

480
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:43,006
doesn't want my grandson to be born to claim that inheritance.

481
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:51,166
I wanted to do worse to you,

482
00:55:52,462 --> 00:55:53,926
but you're my daughter.

483
00:55:54,957 --> 00:55:56,486
I can't bring myself to.

484
00:56:05,181 --> 00:56:07,326
Wan, take me back to my room. I want to rest.

485
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:01,886
Wan.

486
00:57:03,622 --> 00:57:05,622
Please don't increase the dose of my medicine.

487
00:57:11,293 --> 00:57:12,926
I talked to the doctor.

488
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:17,046
The doctor said my condition right now

489
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:22,046
is because I overdosed on blood pressure pills.

490
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:37,486
I'm sorry, Father.

491
00:57:44,046 --> 00:57:45,506
I'm not angry at you.

492
00:57:53,325 --> 00:57:56,046
I want you to continue taking care of me.

493
00:58:15,749 --> 00:58:16,926
Yes, Father.

494
00:58:18,897 --> 00:58:20,171
Thank you.

495
00:58:30,149 --> 00:58:32,086
I'm sorry, Father.

496
00:58:42,174 --> 00:58:43,806
Are you really leaving?

497
00:58:43,966 --> 00:58:45,366
You just got here a while ago.

498
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:47,366
It's been just four or five days.

499
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:49,486
You went back to Bangkok for months.

500
00:58:49,725 --> 00:58:53,846
Well, I don't have big news to follow here.

501
00:58:54,294 --> 00:58:56,294
You can work here, can't you?

502
00:58:56,446 --> 00:58:57,787
Do your meeting online.

503
00:58:57,902 --> 00:58:59,486
Use your phone to order your staff.

504
00:58:59,591 --> 00:59:00,668
Use texting apps to talk shop.

505
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:02,046
You have your emails too.

506
00:59:02,317 --> 00:59:04,317
You used to do it. You don't have to go back.

507
00:59:05,549 --> 00:59:07,966
- What do you want?  - Oh...

508
00:59:09,486 --> 00:59:14,846
I used to sleep with someone. Sleeping alone is like...

509
00:59:15,253 --> 00:59:16,926
I can't sleep.

510
00:59:17,246 --> 00:59:18,526
So what?

511
00:59:18,854 --> 00:59:19,966
Well,

512
00:59:21,021 --> 00:59:22,766
can you sleep with me forever?

513
00:59:24,142 --> 00:59:25,766
Just ask me to marry you, then.

514
00:59:26,246 --> 00:59:27,846
How can one do that?

515
00:59:28,685 --> 00:59:30,046
Like this.

516
00:59:33,094 --> 00:59:34,646
Will you marry me?

517
00:59:35,286 --> 00:59:36,286
Yes.

518
00:59:39,229 --> 00:59:42,414
Did you just trick me into proposing to you?

519
00:59:43,321 --> 00:59:45,486
- Will you then?  - I need to think about it.

520
00:59:45,606 --> 00:59:49,166
Please, you're not young anymore.

521
00:59:49,478 --> 00:59:51,680
- I need to ask my mom first.  - Then don't bother.

522
00:59:51,784 --> 00:59:53,126
Wait! Don't change your mind.

523
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:56,246
Marry me?

524
00:59:56,861 --> 00:59:59,126
Of course, I will.

525
00:59:59,654 --> 01:00:02,286
- Should I get my bag upstairs?  - Yeah, let's go.

526
01:00:18,007 --> 01:00:19,260
This is the life of a single.

527
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:22,566
All my friends are married. I'm all alone now.

528
01:00:22,766 --> 01:00:25,606
I'm married to my laptop. I'm with it all day long.

529
01:00:27,086 --> 01:00:28,686
(Mr. Hong, Producer)

530
01:00:35,741 --> 01:00:37,046
Yes, sir?

531
01:00:37,462 --> 01:00:39,766
(Is the script for the first 15 episodes done?)

532
01:00:40,126 --> 01:00:42,446
(I can't start filming without the script.)

533
01:00:43,603 --> 01:00:47,286
Okay. It's nearly done. I'll send it to you before this weekend.

534
01:00:47,694 --> 01:00:51,246
(You said that last week. Your week sure is long.)

535
01:00:52,265 --> 01:00:54,046
This week for sure, sir.

536
01:00:54,206 --> 01:00:56,526
I have to go now. Bye.

537
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,606
You should be a debt collector, not a producer.

538
01:01:02,782 --> 01:01:04,566
I'm not done. That's why I haven't submitted it yet.

539
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:08,006
If it's done, I'll submit it and get paid. Why would I keep it?

540
01:01:10,053 --> 01:01:12,006
Your iced Americano, ma'am.

541
01:01:13,286 --> 01:01:14,726
I didn't order this.

542
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:19,126
Drink it. Recharge your energy.

543
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:23,766
You went back to America. Why are you back here?

544
01:01:27,646 --> 01:01:28,806
I forgot something.

545
01:01:28,926 --> 01:01:31,462
You can call me. I can send it to you.

546
01:01:31,778 --> 01:01:33,646
The thing I forgot can't be sent via mail.

547
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:35,526
What did you forget?

548
01:01:37,317 --> 01:01:38,606
I forgot to say I love you.

549
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:03,806
You can write your shows anywhere.

550
01:02:07,365 --> 01:02:09,406
Would you like to do it in New York?

551
01:02:21,773 --> 01:02:22,806
But

552
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:25,766
I need to do something before I go.

553
01:02:26,805 --> 01:02:28,086
What do you need to do?

554
01:02:36,357 --> 01:02:37,526
Okay.

555
01:02:48,221 --> 01:02:49,751
Did you forget something, Prang?

556
01:02:55,429 --> 01:02:58,246
Kuer? You said you're coming on Friday.

557
01:02:58,469 --> 01:03:01,366
You should tell me if you flew here. I'll pick you up at the air...

558
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:06,806
I can't stand missing you.

559
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,446
I have some work to do here too.

560
01:03:11,396 --> 01:03:14,526
You assigned me to take care of the joint venture.

561
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,486
What else do you need to do?

562
01:03:23,098 --> 01:03:25,646
It's a shame the owner won't sell.

563
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:28,426
I have asked to buy this house several times. They still said no.

564
01:03:30,542 --> 01:03:32,326
How can the owner sell it?

565
01:03:40,886 --> 01:03:42,166
Did you buy it?

566
01:03:43,526 --> 01:03:46,766
It's a wedding anniversary gift

567
01:03:48,037 --> 01:03:49,646
for you.

568
01:03:51,366 --> 01:03:52,726
Thank you!

569
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:58,286
- Do you like it?  - I love it so much!

570
01:04:05,686 --> 01:04:06,686
Un.

571
01:04:09,229 --> 01:04:11,086
Our story began here.

572
01:04:12,398 --> 01:04:14,406
I want our children

573
01:04:15,182 --> 01:04:17,566
to live in a house full of love like this one.

574
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,566
After you.

575
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:56,886
(How long does it take?)

576
01:04:57,045 --> 01:05:00,806
(You're keeping your heart shut)

577
01:05:02,734 --> 01:05:06,566
(for the past that hurt you.)

578
01:05:08,286 --> 01:05:12,126
(What exactly does it take)

579
01:05:12,271 --> 01:05:15,966
(for you to trust in me?)

580
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:22,206
(I'm willing to prove it all my life.)

581
01:05:23,606 --> 01:05:29,359
(Every time I look into those eyes, please believe me.)

582
01:05:29,573 --> 01:05:31,206
Happy anniversary.

583
01:05:34,686 --> 01:05:37,366
Are we raising our children in this house?

584
01:05:37,526 --> 01:05:40,566
(You're the one who touched my heart.)

585
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:44,526
(No one else comes above you.)

586
01:05:44,654 --> 01:05:48,286
(You're my precious thing.)

587
01:05:48,446 --> 01:05:52,206
(I'll keep you well, close to my heart.)

588
01:05:52,686 --> 01:05:54,046
Are you pregnant?

589
01:05:54,577 --> 01:05:56,526
- Yes.  - Un!

590
01:06:00,726 --> 01:06:03,246
Surprise!

591
01:06:03,614 --> 01:06:04,855
- Hey! What's that?  - What's that?

592
01:06:04,991 --> 01:06:07,006
- Is she pregnant?  - Is she?

593
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:16,286
- You're a father now!  - San, look at this!

594
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:20,806
(If you know what your heart wants,)

595
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,726
(you will immediately know)

596
01:06:23,053 --> 01:06:25,966
(who touched your heart.)

597
01:06:27,094 --> 01:06:29,094
(Hold their hands tight.)

598
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:31,286
(Don't let them go.)

599
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,206
(Your love)

600
01:06:34,805 --> 01:06:37,486
(will get you through tough times together.)
