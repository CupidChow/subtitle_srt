1
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:46,917
Un.

2
00:01:50,526 --> 00:01:52,526
Is he the reason you're breaking up with me?

3
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,206
Why do you keep calling me?

4
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:57,445
Someone died, Nam.

5
00:01:57,573 --> 00:01:58,806
We have nothing to do with this.

6
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,446
The boat you asked me to pick up

7
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,046
wasn't broken, was it?

8
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:04,006
If I have a chance as he did,

9
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,606
you will never regret it.

10
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:07,966
Oh!

11
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:09,846
Good evening.

12
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:14,526
Un.

13
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:17,486
- Un.  - I said let me go.

14
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:19,246
- Listen.  - Kuer!

15
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:21,486
The woman said to let her go. Don't you hear?

16
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:23,286
Tony, stop!

17
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:25,886
Stop already! Hey!

18
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,206
Tony!

19
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:29,926
Fine! Fight all you want.

20
00:02:30,773 --> 00:02:31,966
Un!

21
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,846
Hey!

22
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:36,926
You already made her cry.

23
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:39,326
And you want to make her cry again.

24
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,886
If you really love her,

25
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:43,446
you should stop.

26
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:47,526
If you can't explain or fix things right now,

27
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:49,686
just stay away.

28
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,686
So Un won't have to cry again.

29
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:56,086
When she loved you,

30
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:59,006
you didn't cherish her enough.

31
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:03,702
If you want to get back with her now,

32
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:06,086
you must go through me.

33
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:26,846
- You ordered too much and couldn't finish. - Well...

34
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,246
She's back.

35
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:35,446
What is she upset about?

36
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,926
I don't know.

37
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:39,166
Did she fight with Kuer?

38
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:41,806
Where is Kuer, then?

39
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:03,878
What happened?

40
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:05,166
How would I know?

41
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,326
- Hey!  - Hey, what?

42
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:15,526
Stop saying hey to me.

43
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:22,926
Un.

44
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,486
Are you mad at me?

45
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:29,286
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,766
I saw you try to walk away from him.

47
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:34,246
He just wouldn't stop.

48
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:39,926
Thank you.

49
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,886
I think I lost my appetite tonight.

50
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,806
How about a rain check?

51
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:45,646
Okay.

52
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:47,046
A rain check is fine.

53
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,486
That means she doesn't want to talk to you.

54
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:10,846
I think you should give her some time.

55
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:13,493
It's only been a couple of days, and a guy is already following her around.

56
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,126
If I give her more time, I'll have nothing left to explain.

57
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,646
Yeah, I understand.

58
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:23,486
If she really loves you,

59
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:26,406
even if she has many more guys chasing her,

60
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:28,926
she will come back to you anyway.

61
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:54,006
Why are you still up, Mom?

62
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:58,205
I have something to talk about with you.

63
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:03,886
I saw someone with you at the funeral.

64
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:06,366
That's Tony.

65
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:18,358
Tony used to be my coworker

66
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:20,046
when I lived abroad.

67
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:24,246
From what I see,

68
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:28,446
he thinks of you as more than just a coworker.

69
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,086
He does,

70
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:32,086
but I don't see him that way.

71
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:38,046
I understand.

72
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,798
I don't want to trust anyone ever again.

73
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:56,846
That's not a good idea.

74
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,566
Didn't you get that idea

75
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,486
from what Dad had done to you?

76
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:06,406
Do you mean with his mistresses?

77
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:12,646
I do,

78
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:16,166
but I loved him.

79
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,126
If you could choose,

80
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:23,726
would you still have loved Dad?

81
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:29,526
I would.

82
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:33,366
Even if I knew what would have happened.

83
00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:40,806
Can I sleep with you tonight?

84
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:47,086
You should sleep with Gade.

85
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:49,589
She's probably waiting for you in the room.

86
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:53,326
She said she didn't have a black dress for the funeral.

87
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,006
She wants to buy one to attend Noot's funeral with you tomorrow.

88
00:07:58,606 --> 00:07:59,766
Okay.

89
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:05,966
I love you, Un.

90
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:31,505
Un, you're finally back.

91
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:33,806
Let's go shopping for a black dress with me tomorrow.

92
00:08:54,726 --> 00:08:58,286
Just a day after your boyfriend cheated on you, and you're gay with me?

93
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,406
Are you tired?

94
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:21,086
I'll be there with you tomorrow.

95
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:23,406
Tony was there tonight, wasn't he?

96
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:25,686
He called and asked if I was there.

97
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:35,406
Kuer was there too.

98
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:39,966
I still love him.

99
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:44,846
I can't get over him yet.

100
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:51,286
I don't understand why he did that.

101
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,126
If I hadn't let him in, this would never have happened.

102
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:12,246
We're humans.

103
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:15,446
We don't know who we will fall in love with or when.

104
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:18,766
We only know when we don't love someone anymore.

105
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:22,286
You shouldn't tie your heart to him.

106
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:26,366
Ask yourself why you can't get over him.

107
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,326
Right now, just live your own life.

108
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:33,606
Someday, when your heart is ready,

109
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:35,606
you will feel better naturally.

110
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,566
Okay. Stop crying. Take a shower.

111
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:50,246
(Don't forget your worth. I hope you start a good new life.)

112
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:56,126
I have found someone worthy.

113
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:01,606
How can I start over again?

114
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:34,646
Gade!

115
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:48,366
Why did you turn it off? It's getting to a love scene.

116
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:54,059
Or are you so jealous that you can't watch a romantic scene?

117
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,806
You just broke up, right?

118
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:57,446
No!

119
00:13:57,846 --> 00:13:59,246
Then why did you turn it off?

120
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,846
I was rooting for them to make out for hours.

121
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,246
When they were making out, you turned it off.

122
00:14:04,454 --> 00:14:06,206
You killed my mood.

123
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:12,366
I want you to listen.

124
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:14,806
Tell me if this is possible.

125
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:16,926
What is?

126
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:21,806
I once told you that

127
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:24,166
someone tried to kill Kuer.

128
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:27,166
You did. So?

129
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:32,366
Do you remember the new driver my grandfather assigned to me?

130
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:39,206
Noot hired him to tail Kuer everywhere.

131
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:47,606
Noot said he was the guy

132
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:49,646
who saved Kuer's life.

133
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:53,406
I remember that the person who saved Kuer

134
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,806
followed the shooter.

135
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:00,846
The guy I'm talking about

136
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,566
is Kan.

137
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:06,126
Do you think it's possible

138
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:09,446
that Kan saw how the shooter got killed?

139
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:13,726
You should ask him.

140
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,406
Okay.

141
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:30,406
Father,

142
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:34,566
I finally got into House Jangwangprawas.

143
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:32,602
Why do you keep calling me? I'm busy today.

144
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:35,806
I told you I need to help my boss at the funeral.

145
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:39,206
I know. We have nothing to do with this.

146
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:42,566
We don't. We don't have anything to do with it at all.

147
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:47,526
Don't ask too much.

148
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:49,126
It's better if you don't know.

149
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:51,006
You'll be in danger if you know too much.

150
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:52,846
I have to go now.

151
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:55,366
Is anything wrong?

152
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:57,206
It's nothing.

153
00:16:57,422 --> 00:16:59,106
Rit, why are you out here?

154
00:16:59,723 --> 00:17:02,926
It's awkward inside. My mom keeps convincing me

155
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:05,286
that the vacant position should be mine.

156
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:08,012
But it should be yours.

157
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:10,646
I have a feeling that I won't get it.

158
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:13,406
Your mom won't accept that.

159
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:15,566
You're the only grandson now.

160
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:17,326
Who else can take that position?

161
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,526
Let's head back inside

162
00:17:20,662 --> 00:17:22,566
before Mr. Chairman notices.

163
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:50,246
Hello?

164
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,246
Please find the records for Nam, Mr. Chanoot's assistant.

165
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:58,366
Okay. Please get it ASAP.

166
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,326
Why are you pulling Chanoot's assistant's record?

167
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:05,286
It's nothing.

168
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:08,726
If it's nothing, why did you ask to get it ASAP?

169
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:12,726
Well, I'm off to work. See you later.

170
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:16,326
Obvious.

171
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:19,366
It's obvious. He's hiding it.

172
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,326
Did we share the same cup?

173
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:33,429
Is this an indirect kiss?

174
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:41,806
Are you going to the office today?

175
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:45,846
I am. I just need to help Gade buy a black dress first.

176
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:48,149
You can head straight to work.

177
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:50,606
I'll go with your mom.

178
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:52,086
Just be quick.

179
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:56,046
I don't hold any position at the company.

180
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:57,606
I don't need to hurry.

181
00:18:57,718 --> 00:19:00,381
- But does your grandfather mind?  - He doesn't.

182
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:04,006
You don't hold any position, but you want to, don't you?

183
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:08,966
Rit, hurry up and follow your grandfather.

184
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:11,183
You can talk to him in the car.

185
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,588
Yes.

186
00:19:17,294 --> 00:19:19,046
Important people will always be important.

187
00:19:19,686 --> 00:19:22,366
Whether late or early, she's still important.

188
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:25,486
Un, you go and have breakfast.

189
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,990
- Head to the office after you're done shopping.  - Okay. Let's go.

190
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:30,526
You raised her this way.

191
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,006
This is why she doesn't respect anyone.

192
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:38,206
Un is good enough for Father to see her talent.

193
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,126
Excuse me.

194
00:19:43,526 --> 00:19:44,806
Be happy all you want.

195
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,326
When you make a mistake,

196
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,550
I'll stomp you deep into the ground.

197
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:50,966
I won't even let you get back up to breathe.

198
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,413
Kuer.

199
00:20:18,294 --> 00:20:20,966
I made breakfast. Do you want to have some?

200
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:31,566
I know

201
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:34,406
that you blame me.

202
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:38,446
You think I'm the reason you and Un fought.

203
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:43,286
I wanted a divorce,

204
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:45,894
but I didn't want Noot to die.

205
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:49,526
Does Noot's death erase my existence from your life?

206
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:52,566
What did I do wrong?

207
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:58,006
You didn't do anything wrong.

208
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,206
I did.

209
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:04,886
I couldn't say no to you when I knew it would cause me trouble.

210
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:07,926
I felt sorry for you.

211
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,726
I didn't choose to have cancer, Kuer.

212
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:26,086
I wasn't so miserable that you had to take care of me.

213
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:28,366
Why does everyone

214
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:31,766
blame me?

215
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,206
If I still act like I fool around like this,

216
00:21:36,822 --> 00:21:39,006
Un will never understand

217
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:41,406
that I don't have any feelings for you.

218
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:36,446
(Mek)

219
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:43,406
Miss Nam.

220
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:44,966
Someone is here to see you.

221
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:48,646
The receptionist told him to wait because you didn't answer your phone.

222
00:22:48,926 --> 00:22:51,686
Okay. I'll put these away and come right down.

223
00:22:51,886 --> 00:22:53,086
Okay.

224
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:35,126
(Jangwangprawas House)

225
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,606
Who asked to see me?

226
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:52,566
He's waiting outside.

227
00:24:59,686 --> 00:25:00,886
Mek?

228
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:09,276
Why are you here?

229
00:25:09,357 --> 00:25:11,686
I want to know what you did.

230
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:14,286
I said I didn't do anything.

231
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:15,693
Someone died, Nam.

232
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:17,294
How can I do nothing?

233
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:19,126
If you don't let this go...

234
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:27,326
If you don't let this go, you and I will be in real trouble.

235
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:29,685
Come on.

236
00:25:55,477 --> 00:25:56,677
Un.

237
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,301
Won't you go out?

238
00:26:20,342 --> 00:26:22,806
Drive, Kan. We need to go to work after.

239
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:34,286
Did he kick you out?

240
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,846
He didn't.

241
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:44,926
Yeah? From what you said, he didn't tell you to pack up.

242
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:47,526
Why would you ask me to come and pick you up?

243
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:51,286
He probably tried to say it nicely.

244
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:57,326
Phim.

245
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:00,166
Do you really want him?

246
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:04,526
I do, but he doesn't want me.

247
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:13,526
You can stay with me for now.

248
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:15,966
I'll help you figure out what to do next.

249
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,206
I agree

250
00:28:30,623 --> 00:28:33,446
that we shouldn't rush to the conclusion that Mr.Chanoot

251
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:35,486
committed suicide.

252
00:28:35,686 --> 00:28:36,886
Yes.

253
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:39,406
Mr. Rit was with Miss Nam.

254
00:28:39,574 --> 00:28:42,046
Mr. Prawit and his family all went to bed.

255
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:43,886
Only these three

256
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:46,709
were at the harbor at the same time.

257
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:52,526
Is it possible that Mr. Chanoot

258
00:28:52,806 --> 00:28:54,566
was killed at this spot?

259
00:28:59,062 --> 00:29:01,062
We will consider that as a theory.

260
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,286
We will find out more when we have evidence.

261
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:04,606
Yes, sir.

262
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:08,046
What about Mr.Chanoot's assistant, Miss Nam, record?

263
00:29:08,158 --> 00:29:10,158
- Is there anything interesting?  - Here, sir.

264
00:29:11,276 --> 00:29:13,276
Miss Nam's family are fishermen.

265
00:29:13,414 --> 00:29:14,766
She has two siblings.

266
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:17,926
Her older brother is Mek. He's a fisherman.

267
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,086
Miss Nam is educated

268
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:22,238
and got a job at JP.

269
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,046
I want more information.

270
00:29:29,623 --> 00:29:31,406
When will you ask Kan?

271
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:33,566
I'll wait a bit longer.

272
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:35,646
I don't know if he'd tell me or not.

273
00:29:37,438 --> 00:29:39,126
What if he killed that shooter?

274
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,566
Would he tell then?

275
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:43,646
Also, if he thinks I'm onto him,

276
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:46,526
he might kill me next. That'd be bad.

277
00:29:47,174 --> 00:29:49,726
That's right. Let's wait a bit longer.

278
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,486
When you ask him,

279
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,126
beat around the bush. Don't be so direct.

280
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:55,966
Yeah. I know.

281
00:30:04,246 --> 00:30:05,886
Gade.

282
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,566
I think this will fit you.

283
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:09,926
No.

284
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,446
I want something to keep up with your appearance.

285
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:18,206
A t-shirt and a pair of jeans won't do it.

286
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:20,206
It's okay, Gade.

287
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:22,846
You're just there to show condolence.

288
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:29,846
What is Rit like?

289
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:31,326
Rit?

290
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:33,046
Why are you asking?

291
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,886
I went out to get coffee yesterday morning.

292
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,846
I saw him walking out of Noot's room.

293
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:09,566
Maybe he was doing Noot's unfinished work?

294
00:31:09,773 --> 00:31:11,126
I don't know.

295
00:31:11,263 --> 00:31:13,366
I saw him go out with an envelope.

296
00:31:17,894 --> 00:31:20,566
I want some interesting news.

297
00:31:21,854 --> 00:31:24,206
I rather not take what's hot.

298
00:31:24,446 --> 00:31:26,126
Every channel is reporting the same.

299
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:28,166
Yeah. That one is good.

300
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,030
That's fine.

301
00:31:30,134 --> 00:31:32,446
Okay. Please do it for me.

302
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:38,646
Whoa! Kuer?

303
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:42,646
Why are you showing up like this?

304
00:31:42,886 --> 00:31:44,246
Come in.

305
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:47,326
I'll get you a towel.

306
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:49,566
You're going to catch a cold. Wait for me.

307
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:07,206
Un, are we heading to the office right after this?

308
00:32:07,757 --> 00:32:09,206
I think so.

309
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:15,006
Won't you talk about what happened this morning?

310
00:32:16,406 --> 00:32:17,646
About what?

311
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:21,086
About Kuer.

312
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:27,166
Why would I talk about him?

313
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,806
I think he went there to wait for you.

314
00:32:31,926 --> 00:32:33,166
That's none of my business.

315
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,246
Have you really given up on him?

316
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,766
Tony!

317
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:52,166
Gade, did you call him here?

318
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:54,166
No. It's a coincidence.

319
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:55,766
Gade!

320
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:58,566
Yeah, I called him here.

321
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:00,006
Un.

322
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,606
- Have you eaten anything?  - We have.

323
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:06,886
You know what? I...

324
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,446
I need to head home to finish my work. It's nearly due.

325
00:33:09,606 --> 00:33:11,846
Please give Un a ride to the office, Tony.

326
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:14,886
See you this evening.

327
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:17,166
I'll go to the funeral with you. I'll wait for you at home.

328
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:18,326
I have to go.

329
00:33:24,814 --> 00:33:26,814
I can go to work by myself.

330
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:28,246
Please let me give you a ride.

331
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:31,086
Well...

332
00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:40,726
(If you want to get over him, get a new guy.)

333
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:42,886
I want to go with you.

334
00:33:48,366 --> 00:33:49,486
Okay.

335
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:51,366
Please.

336
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:15,326
How is your work?

337
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:17,326
It's fine.

338
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:20,766
It's just not as fun without you.

339
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:26,126
I miss you, Un.

340
00:34:29,806 --> 00:34:32,126
Are you staying here long?

341
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,686
I think so.

342
00:34:37,502 --> 00:34:39,326
I want to go back with you.

343
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:45,086
You know, right?

344
00:34:45,486 --> 00:34:46,886
That I have a crush on you.

345
00:34:49,997 --> 00:34:51,126
I do.

346
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,166
I know you never looked at me.

347
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:56,286
I just don't know why.

348
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:03,942
I don't want to feel guilty.

349
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:07,406
I don't want to give you a chance

350
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:10,926
when I know

351
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:13,446
I can only be friends with you.

352
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:19,966
I know I've always been just a friend.

353
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,806
Today, I'm asking you for a chance.

354
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:25,022
Please open up for me just once.

355
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:27,726
Let me take care of you.

356
00:35:28,478 --> 00:35:30,286
Look at me with your heart.

357
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:33,806
If ultimately, you really can't see me as more than a friend,

358
00:35:34,086 --> 00:35:35,286
I'll understand.

359
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:39,086
I believe

360
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,837
I won't let you down

361
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,005
and make you feel what you're feeling now.

362
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,966
She didn't even get out of the car to see you?

363
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:05,366
Kuer.

364
00:36:05,814 --> 00:36:07,775
I don't want to crush your hopes.

365
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,486
I know you're taking it hard.

366
00:36:11,582 --> 00:36:14,406
If you still can't prove your innocence

367
00:36:14,526 --> 00:36:17,326
and prove that you and Phim were nothing,

368
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:18,926
If I were Un,

369
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:22,806
I wouldn't want to see your face. I would be mad at you too.

370
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:27,726
I want something to prove that I didn't do it too.

371
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,566
It just doesn't exist.

372
00:36:32,142 --> 00:36:34,526
Where do I find that evidence, Sa?

373
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:37,997
Is there anything that can prove

374
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,966
I didn't sleep with Phim

375
00:36:41,037 --> 00:36:43,606
and had nothing to do with Noot's death?

376
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,486
I just told Phim to leave my house.

377
00:36:54,663 --> 00:36:56,406
Did you kick her out?

378
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:58,806
- No.  - What?

379
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:01,686
I just told her to find somewhere else to stay.

380
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:05,606
I don't want anyone to see us in the same house and think we are lovers.

381
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:09,766
That's good.

382
00:37:09,974 --> 00:37:12,806
Otherwise, you'll only add fuel to the gossip fire.

383
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,446
Did she agree to leave?

384
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:22,806
You want him,

385
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:25,446
but you just wasted your chance to live in his house.

386
00:37:25,966 --> 00:37:27,846
If I were you, I wouldn't go anywhere.

387
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:30,086
I'll keep at it. He'll let his guard down.

388
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:34,086
Kuer is not someone who'll let his guard down with something like this.

389
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:38,126
I just want to give some distance to him right now.

390
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:40,277
I don't want to put too much pressure on him.

391
00:37:41,614 --> 00:37:43,846
You left. How can you get back in?

392
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,197
I think I can.

393
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:49,926
Before I left, I thought of a plan to go back in.

394
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:51,686
Whatever you do, Phim,

395
00:37:52,781 --> 00:37:54,966
you need to take care of the child inside you.

396
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:00,686
Have you decided what to do?

397
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:05,726
If you don't get treatment and the cancer spreads,

398
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:07,606
you and your child will both die.

399
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,846
Isn't now the time to choose, Phim?

400
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:23,046
- Nam.  - Yes?

401
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:25,486
Did someone come to see you this morning?

402
00:38:27,925 --> 00:38:29,166
No one came.

403
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:33,366
What should we eat for lunch today?

404
00:38:35,129 --> 00:38:38,166
We should eat nearby. I have a lot of work today.

405
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:40,886
Okay.

406
00:38:40,998 --> 00:38:43,606
I'll see you at your desk at lunchtime.

407
00:39:20,686 --> 00:39:22,606
I'll wait for lunchtime with you.

408
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:25,845
It's still an hour away. Don't wait.

409
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:28,406
It's okay. It's just an hour.

410
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:31,228
See you here at noon, okay?

411
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:33,846
Okay.

412
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,470
Let's call San and go out for lunch.

413
00:39:53,813 --> 00:39:55,166
I'm not hungry.

414
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:57,926
You got heartbroken. I know you don't have an appetite.

415
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,926
But you have to eat somehow.

416
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,246
Let's go.

417
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,086
(Phim)

418
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,126
(Phim)

419
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,326
Is that Phim?

420
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,766
Let's pick San up and ask him what to eat.

421
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:36,486
I think you should stop calling.

422
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:40,006
Kuer won't answer my call.

423
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:42,446
He usually never ignored me like this.

424
00:40:44,237 --> 00:40:46,566
This is not the usual.

425
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:49,886
It's not been usual since he kicked you out.

426
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:14,686
You said you have the plan to get back in.

427
00:41:15,493 --> 00:41:18,566
But if he doesn't even answer your call,

428
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:21,486
how can you possibly return to his house?

429
00:41:22,637 --> 00:41:23,886
You can't.

430
00:41:33,102 --> 00:41:34,726
Kuer won't answer my call

431
00:41:34,973 --> 00:41:37,126
because he's afraid he can't say no.

432
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,966
I know him well.

433
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:45,286
He's a good man. He'll help me when I'm in need.

434
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:14,126
Let me help you carry them.

435
00:42:14,238 --> 00:42:15,629
It's okay.

436
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,886
You can head to the office to pick up Un.

437
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,326
Okay.

438
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:35,686
How many days off are you taking?

439
00:42:36,572 --> 00:42:39,926
- Three or four days, Ma'am.  - Come back soon.

440
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:44,206
- Okay.  - And be here on time.

441
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,246
Don't wander off too far.

442
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:50,006
Mrs. Wing.

443
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:54,893
There are some troubles with Miss Un's car.

444
00:42:55,014 --> 00:42:57,406
Who do I report this to, Ma'am?

445
00:42:57,941 --> 00:42:59,246
Troubles with the car?

446
00:42:59,573 --> 00:43:01,966
Just get it fixed. Why are you telling me this?

447
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:07,126
I don't know who I should tell first.

448
00:43:07,901 --> 00:43:09,446
Just get it fixed.

449
00:43:09,606 --> 00:43:12,526
And bill it to the accounting department.

450
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:14,886
Thank you.

451
00:43:38,406 --> 00:43:39,646
Kan.

452
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:41,726
Kan.

453
00:43:41,846 --> 00:43:44,326
Would you like to have lunch before heading out to pick up Miss Un?

454
00:43:44,606 --> 00:43:46,486
Yes, please. What do we have, Nok?

455
00:43:46,614 --> 00:43:48,566
We have a lot of food today.

456
00:43:48,647 --> 00:43:49,686
Really? Let's go.

457
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:52,206
Come in.

458
00:43:54,461 --> 00:43:55,726
So is this the place?

459
00:43:55,902 --> 00:43:57,286
Of course.

460
00:43:57,487 --> 00:44:00,326
Can we get a table at lunchtime without reservation?

461
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:03,798
I reserved it. Why else would I be here?

462
00:44:03,925 --> 00:44:05,526
Don't complain. Follow me.

463
00:44:05,705 --> 00:44:06,766
Okay.

464
00:44:07,142 --> 00:44:08,606
Miss Sa.

465
00:44:11,726 --> 00:44:14,639
I want pork stewed in soy sauce, stir-fried pork in yellow curry,

466
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,126
fish organs sour soup, and crab meat curry.

467
00:44:20,254 --> 00:44:22,206
Won't you let your friends order something?

468
00:44:22,582 --> 00:44:25,246
These are your usual dishes. I remember it.

469
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,726
Good morning. Do you have a reservation?

470
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,822
We don't.

471
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:33,166
Sorry, we don't have any available tables. Please wait about 40 minutes.

472
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,637
We apologize.

473
00:44:43,671 --> 00:44:45,006
What the heck?

474
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:48,526
Out of all the restaurants? Isn't this too much of a coincidence?

475
00:44:50,661 --> 00:44:52,366
Should we go somewhere else, Tony?

476
00:44:52,614 --> 00:44:54,326
We can try this place next time.

477
00:44:54,603 --> 00:44:58,229
I need to go to work and pick Gade up for the funeral.

478
00:44:58,957 --> 00:45:00,566
- Okay.  - They're with me.

479
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:03,726
You can sit with us.

480
00:45:06,726 --> 00:45:07,966
Thank you,

481
00:45:08,893 --> 00:45:10,326
but I think Un wouldn't want to bother.

482
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:19,286
It's okay, Tony.

483
00:45:19,822 --> 00:45:23,406
If you really want to eat here, we can sit with them.

484
00:45:33,503 --> 00:45:35,926
- The food is here.  - Thank you.

485
00:45:37,006 --> 00:45:38,326
Thank you.

486
00:45:43,406 --> 00:45:45,446
You can order anything. The food here is good.

487
00:45:53,478 --> 00:45:55,806
- Let's try the pork stewed in soy sauce.  - Okay.

488
00:45:56,544 --> 00:45:57,886
Thank you.

489
00:46:03,438 --> 00:46:06,006
Un, would you like fermented noodles?

490
00:46:07,061 --> 00:46:09,566
I'd rather have brown rice.

491
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,046
Okay.

492
00:46:11,404 --> 00:46:13,806
Waiter. Brown rice, please.

493
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:16,366
- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

494
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,846
- Would you like some stewed pork?  - Save it for now.

495
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:27,126
How is Phim?

496
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,806
Has she gotten used to the new house?

497
00:46:33,253 --> 00:46:35,366
Why is Phim not here to eat with you?

498
00:46:35,518 --> 00:46:37,281
Phim doesn't live with me anymore.

499
00:46:38,806 --> 00:46:42,486
I told her to find someplace else this morning. She has left my place.

500
00:46:44,462 --> 00:46:47,286
Yeah. I think she's gone by now.

501
00:46:48,278 --> 00:46:50,646
Un, don't you

502
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:54,246
want to talk it out with

503
00:46:55,325 --> 00:46:56,526
Kuer?

504
00:46:57,502 --> 00:47:01,046
I think Un should decide that herself.

505
00:47:01,406 --> 00:47:05,886
Un, I think you should give Kuer a chance to speak.

506
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:11,006
I believe he loves you, not Phim.

507
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:16,166
He never wanted to hurt you.

508
00:47:22,454 --> 00:47:23,686
Wait!

509
00:47:23,894 --> 00:47:25,566
I think you should sit down.

510
00:47:32,991 --> 00:47:37,326
Tony, I don't know about your relationship abroad with Un.

511
00:47:37,726 --> 00:47:39,686
Right now, she's in Thailand.

512
00:47:39,886 --> 00:47:41,446
She's dating Kuer.

513
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,286
She even accepted his proposal.

514
00:47:53,995 --> 00:47:55,086
Un!

515
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,006
Un!

516
00:47:58,702 --> 00:48:00,142
Listen to me, Un.

517
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,286
Okay.

518
00:48:06,686 --> 00:48:07,926
I'm sorry.

519
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:13,966
I know I've said it many times.

520
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:17,126
At this point, it might as well mean nothing.

521
00:48:19,878 --> 00:48:21,486
Just say what you have to say.

522
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:24,246
I kept thinking about how I could clear my name.

523
00:48:26,495 --> 00:48:29,326
I would never be able to do it without telling what Phim told me.

524
00:48:31,014 --> 00:48:32,566
Are you ready to tell me then?

525
00:48:37,326 --> 00:48:38,686
Phim...

526
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,326
Phim told me and asked me to keep it a secret.

527
00:48:45,373 --> 00:48:48,806
If I did, it would be like I betrayed someone who trusted me

528
00:48:49,286 --> 00:48:50,686
just to survive.

529
00:48:51,126 --> 00:48:52,326
So are you not telling anyone?

530
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:55,286
And are you taking the blame from the public too?

531
00:48:57,206 --> 00:48:58,726
Aren't you too much of a saint?

532
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:08,446
I told you I would find evidence to prove my innocence.

533
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:12,526
But so far, I haven't been able to figure out what can prove it to you

534
00:49:14,803 --> 00:49:17,926
or make you understand that Phim and I are just friends.

535
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:22,486
With what happened, every accusation makes sense.

536
00:49:23,726 --> 00:49:25,206
But it was never true.

537
00:49:25,726 --> 00:49:27,726
I never slept with Phim.

538
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:29,406
Not even once.

539
00:49:43,445 --> 00:49:44,806
I want to believe you.

540
00:49:46,014 --> 00:49:47,526
I really do.

541
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:51,126
But there's no evidence to prove otherwise,

542
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:55,646
and you still choose to keep Phim's secret.

543
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:02,566
If I choose to believe you just to follow my heart,

544
00:50:04,158 --> 00:50:07,726
I'd be a fool who gets tricked easily, wouldn't I?

545
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,006
Un!

546
00:50:22,862 --> 00:50:23,926
Un.

547
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:25,966
Should we leave?

548
00:50:26,366 --> 00:50:27,526
It's okay.

549
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:47,726
- San.  - Yes?

550
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:51,246
A cop and a suspect having a meal together

551
00:50:51,486 --> 00:50:53,366
wouldn't affect the case, right?

552
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,246
Don't worry about that.

553
00:50:56,422 --> 00:51:00,286
Everything is transparent. If he's guilty, we'll deal with him.

554
00:51:01,582 --> 00:51:04,246
Then please solve Noot's murder, San.

555
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:09,206
I believe he didn't commit suicide.

556
00:51:12,725 --> 00:51:16,326
The police haven't concluded it was a suicide.

557
00:51:16,703 --> 00:51:20,166
We still have to find evidence to prove other theories.

558
00:51:20,566 --> 00:51:21,566
Okay.

559
00:51:22,206 --> 00:51:25,726
If you work without bias, I'd be at ease.

560
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:30,966
I have to go now.

561
00:51:32,566 --> 00:51:36,006
Tony, I think we should eat somewhere else.

562
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:38,566
I don't want Southern food anymore.

563
00:51:39,301 --> 00:51:41,486
- Okay.  - Excuse us.

564
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:53,686
How did it go? Asking them to sit with us because we have empty seats?

565
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:56,166
My mind is empty too.

566
00:51:56,382 --> 00:51:57,526
Why?

567
00:51:57,774 --> 00:51:59,926
We got burned so bad I can't think straight.

568
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:04,486
Kuer, what did you talk to Un back there?

569
00:52:07,148 --> 00:52:08,246
It's the same as last time.

570
00:52:11,477 --> 00:52:13,477
I can't reveal Phim's secret yet.

571
00:52:13,886 --> 00:52:16,246
This is the best I can explain.

572
00:52:17,597 --> 00:52:19,446
I just hope she believes what I said.

573
00:52:19,558 --> 00:52:22,086
You have nothing to prove it. Who would believe you?

574
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:24,366
I told you just to say it.

575
00:52:24,494 --> 00:52:28,566
Or you can write to me. I'll post it on my page for the whole country.

576
00:52:53,606 --> 00:52:54,806
Un.

577
00:52:59,694 --> 00:53:01,046
I'm sorry

578
00:53:03,126 --> 00:53:05,246
for putting you through this.

579
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:10,806
You waited to have lunch with me.

580
00:53:25,086 --> 00:53:27,166
I've never seen you cry like this.

581
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:32,446
Can you please stop?

582
00:53:45,173 --> 00:53:46,406
I know

583
00:53:46,622 --> 00:53:48,406
it's not the right time.

584
00:53:48,678 --> 00:53:50,526
But if I don't say it now,

585
00:53:50,734 --> 00:53:52,734
I'll never have another chance.

586
00:53:53,709 --> 00:53:56,206
Can you give me a chance to make you smile,

587
00:53:57,077 --> 00:53:58,806
to make you happy again?

588
00:54:18,086 --> 00:54:20,406
I don't want to lose a good friend.

589
00:54:24,446 --> 00:54:25,766
If you end up feeling nothing for me,

590
00:54:26,565 --> 00:54:28,286
I promise

591
00:54:29,054 --> 00:54:30,926
I'll never make it awkward for you.

592
00:55:19,373 --> 00:55:20,566
Thank you, Tony.

593
00:55:20,678 --> 00:55:22,446
I'll pick you up for the funeral tonight.

594
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:24,526
It's okay.

595
00:55:24,718 --> 00:55:26,166
I'm going with Gade.

596
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:30,646
Then, let's have a meal tomorrow.

597
00:55:33,069 --> 00:55:36,486
Let's pick a less famous place, so we don't run into someone we know.

598
00:55:55,821 --> 00:55:58,846
That's all for today. Thank you all very much.

599
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:03,486
Please wait a minute.

600
00:56:16,565 --> 00:56:20,646
I heard Mr. Chairman called for a board meeting about a new Vice President.

601
00:56:20,886 --> 00:56:23,366
Do you want that position, Mr. Rit?

602
00:56:26,631 --> 00:56:30,746
I've worked here for so long. I've known you guys for years.

603
00:56:30,982 --> 00:56:35,726
You guys should know how much I love and contribute to the company.

604
00:56:36,598 --> 00:56:38,886
If I get this position,

605
00:56:39,156 --> 00:56:41,406
I'll take good care of my people.

606
00:57:05,973 --> 00:57:08,126
These are some little thank-you gifts

607
00:57:08,366 --> 00:57:10,326
for everyone who has always supported me.

608
00:57:10,966 --> 00:57:14,286
I hope you guys will support me this time, as always.

609
00:57:28,406 --> 00:57:32,472
I told my assistant to leave some documents on the desk. Did you read it?

610
00:57:32,873 --> 00:57:35,206
I read some, but not all.

611
00:57:37,141 --> 00:57:40,326
Those are projects that Noot was running.

612
00:57:41,006 --> 00:57:43,926
They're still just plans. They haven't started yet.

613
00:57:44,366 --> 00:57:48,006
We have plans to expand our resorts and hotels to other provinces.

614
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:50,766
We will begin with seaside places, which are our specialty.

615
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:54,886
There are plans for business hotels in the city and luxurious resorts.

616
00:57:57,086 --> 00:57:58,086
So,

617
00:57:59,486 --> 00:58:02,646
does Rit have any projects that he was running with Noot?

618
00:58:09,021 --> 00:58:10,126
He doesn't.

619
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:17,206
They only work together to review the accounting, which isn't finished yet.

620
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:20,806
What's wrong?

621
00:58:22,534 --> 00:58:23,726
Nothing.

622
00:58:24,086 --> 00:58:27,926
I was asking just in case.

623
00:58:34,171 --> 00:58:37,166
By the way, there will be a board meeting soon.

624
00:58:37,414 --> 00:58:42,006
We will need to sort out the vacant Vice President position.

625
00:58:44,126 --> 00:58:47,406
I need an answer from you. What will you do?

626
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:50,526
Yes.

627
00:58:50,846 --> 00:58:51,966
"Yes"?

628
00:58:52,764 --> 00:58:54,046
Are you accepting it?

629
00:58:54,246 --> 00:58:55,406
I am.

630
00:58:56,526 --> 00:58:58,886
You will listen to my opinion

631
00:58:59,046 --> 00:59:02,006
and let me do my job my way, right?

632
00:59:13,046 --> 00:59:14,446
Yes, I will.

633
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:20,566
You can move your stuff into Noot's office.

634
00:59:31,758 --> 00:59:33,886
Miss Un, where are you moving your stuff?

635
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,326
Noot's office.

636
00:59:35,486 --> 00:59:36,726
What?

637
00:59:38,006 --> 00:59:39,366
To Noot's office.

638
00:59:40,645 --> 00:59:43,126
Are you replacing Mr. Noot?

639
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:44,629
I am.

640
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,886
You will need to help me set up the office.

641
00:59:47,046 --> 00:59:49,606
Also, call a locksmith for me.

642
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,526
A locksmith?

643
00:59:53,868 --> 00:59:56,286
I want to change the lock today.

644
00:59:56,407 --> 00:59:58,286
I will be the only one with the key.

645
00:59:58,613 --> 01:00:00,286
Don't make any spares.

646
01:00:00,526 --> 01:00:03,686
- Okay. Let me help.  - It's okay.

647
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:05,326
I'll do it myself.

648
01:00:05,502 --> 01:00:07,246
You can do what you want.

649
01:00:07,366 --> 01:00:09,926
Just call a locksmith for me.

650
01:00:10,509 --> 01:00:11,646
Okay.

651
01:00:20,062 --> 01:00:21,286
Rit!

652
01:00:21,454 --> 01:00:23,454
Miss Un just moved into Mr. Noot's office.

653
01:00:23,717 --> 01:00:26,166
She said she had taken the Vice President position.

654
01:00:26,406 --> 01:00:29,006
She asked for a locksmith to change the lock.

655
01:00:29,206 --> 01:00:30,766
I don't know what she's up to.

656
01:00:31,886 --> 01:00:33,166
Change the lock?

657
01:00:38,222 --> 01:00:40,886
Make sure you have a spare key.

658
01:00:41,206 --> 01:00:43,446
Miss Un said only she could have the key.

659
01:01:06,078 --> 01:01:09,126
I have a favor to ask you.

660
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:10,726
What is it?

661
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:15,446
Don't ever get back together with Kuer. I can't handle that.

662
01:01:17,326 --> 01:01:19,886
No matter how this case ends,

663
01:01:20,238 --> 01:01:23,886
I believe Kuer's affair with Phim played a part in Noot's death.

664
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:27,966
Don't ever get back together with him.

665
01:01:28,332 --> 01:01:30,006
If you start dating him again,

666
01:01:30,206 --> 01:01:31,926
even if you work for our company,

667
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,526
I'll fire you.

668
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:42,607
- It's done.  - Thank you.

669
01:01:53,437 --> 01:01:54,726
Miss Un.

670
01:01:57,165 --> 01:01:58,766
Miss Un!

671
01:02:02,505 --> 01:02:03,926
It's done.

672
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:08,198
Would you allow me to keep a spare key?

673
01:02:08,366 --> 01:02:11,573
In case you forget something or need me to do something.

674
01:02:12,846 --> 01:02:14,046
I'd rather not.

675
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:16,846
Okay.

676
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:34,390
If there are any documents for me,

677
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,480
I'll look at them tomorrow. I have to go now.

678
01:02:36,748 --> 01:02:37,748
Okay.

679
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,526
Should we head back to pick up Miss Gade?

680
01:02:58,806 --> 01:03:00,175
I need to stop by a place on the way.

681
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:01,462
Okay.

682
01:03:13,101 --> 01:03:15,566
Kan, pull over.

683
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:17,686
Who are you meeting here?

684
01:03:17,886 --> 01:03:19,206
No one.

685
01:03:19,335 --> 01:03:21,150
I just want to talk to you.

686
01:03:40,221 --> 01:03:42,246
What do you want to talk about?

687
01:03:43,156 --> 01:03:45,086
On the day you met my grandfather,

688
01:03:45,517 --> 01:03:48,046
you said Noot hired you to tail Kuer, didn't you?

689
01:03:49,102 --> 01:03:50,206
Yes.

690
01:03:50,677 --> 01:03:52,726
Were you the only one Noot hired?

691
01:03:53,637 --> 01:03:54,886
Yes.

692
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:58,446
Noot said his man saved Kuer at the restaurant.

693
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,006
Yes.

694
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,966
I was the one who saved Mr. Kuer.

695
01:04:02,398 --> 01:04:05,646
I remember that the person who saved him followed the shooter.

696
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:11,286
How far did you follow him?

697
01:04:12,053 --> 01:04:13,966
Did you kill the shooter?

698
01:04:18,517 --> 01:04:20,886
I just want to know how careful I need to be

699
01:04:21,246 --> 01:04:22,966
and who I should be careful of.

700
01:04:27,588 --> 01:04:30,606
If you don't tell me, I'll inform the police.

701
01:04:40,886 --> 01:04:42,286
I was waiting for you.

702
01:04:47,646 --> 01:04:49,406
- Shall we go?  - Yeah.

703
01:04:52,846 --> 01:04:53,966
What's wrong?

704
01:04:54,734 --> 01:04:56,246
I have talked to Kan.

705
01:04:56,876 --> 01:04:59,609
Really? What did he say? What did he see?

706
01:04:59,767 --> 01:05:01,746
He didn't kill the shooter.

707
01:05:02,646 --> 01:05:05,646
I followed the shooter to an alley, where they found him dead.

708
01:05:06,005 --> 01:05:08,005
I didn't kill him, though.

709
01:05:08,901 --> 01:05:10,766
I was shot and injured.

710
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:14,326
I was in no condition to keep following him, so I escaped.

711
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:18,349
Was someone else there when you escaped?

712
01:05:19,702 --> 01:05:22,866
I saw the light from an approaching car from the other side.

713
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:25,446
I used that opportunity to get away.

714
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:29,646
You didn't kill the shooter.

715
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:31,406
Then who did?

716
01:05:32,382 --> 01:05:33,766
I don't know.

717
01:05:34,141 --> 01:05:36,141
All I know is the one who killed him

718
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,006
ran into him after I escaped.

719
01:05:41,892 --> 01:05:43,686
How much can I trust you?

720
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:52,886
This is the gunshot wound I got from that shooter.

721
01:05:53,141 --> 01:05:55,141
I almost died.

722
01:05:56,471 --> 01:05:58,086
I swear to you,

723
01:05:58,302 --> 01:06:00,566
every word I say is true.

724
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:03,126
He saw the light from a car

725
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:05,526
approaching from the other side of the fence.

726
01:06:06,189 --> 01:06:07,446
That's all.

727
01:06:08,413 --> 01:06:09,806
Darn it!

728
01:06:11,438 --> 01:06:13,438
This is like a movie reaching its climax,

729
01:06:13,646 --> 01:06:15,646
but the reveal is anticlimactic.

730
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:17,766
Yeah, right.

731
01:06:17,909 --> 01:06:20,506
What should we do now?

732
01:06:26,485 --> 01:06:29,246
How about Kuer's friend, the cop?

733
01:06:29,542 --> 01:06:31,806
He might have some other evidence.

734
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,966
We might find out more.

735
01:06:36,142 --> 01:06:38,366
If what Kan said is true,

736
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,950
the person who ordered the hit on Kuer is still out there.

737
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,566
We don't know when they will strike again.

738
01:06:46,534 --> 01:06:48,246
You said you gave up on him.

739
01:06:49,325 --> 01:06:52,206
Yet you're still anxiously worried about him.

740
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,966
I saw Kuer today.

741
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:57,606
Where? At work?

742
01:06:58,573 --> 01:07:01,486
At a restaurant I went with Tony.

743
01:07:04,881 --> 01:07:08,086
Tony is so very lucky.

744
01:07:08,364 --> 01:07:09,966
You finally agreed to a meal with him,

745
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:12,526
yet you ran into Kuer.

746
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,566
Kuer said he kicked Phim out.

747
01:07:18,718 --> 01:07:20,046
So what?

748
01:07:20,582 --> 01:07:22,166
He kicked Phim out.

749
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:25,606
Does that mean he didn't sleep with her?

750
01:07:36,878 --> 01:07:38,166
Are you sure you want to do this?

751
01:07:47,432 --> 01:07:50,189
Do you want to be kicked out like a dog and embarrass yourself?

752
01:07:50,327 --> 01:07:52,126
Try kicking me out, then.

753
01:07:52,942 --> 01:07:55,366
Kicking out a pregnant woman is outrageous to the guests.

754
01:07:56,653 --> 01:07:58,366
So are you wondering

755
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:00,958
whose baby is in my womb?

756
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:02,966
It's Kuer's.

757
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,846
Do you know that the car owner in that accident

758
01:08:15,421 --> 01:08:18,046
- is Phim?  - Do you think my friend did it?
