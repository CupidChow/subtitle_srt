1
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:46,602
I will always be an assistant, no matter how good I am.

2
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:48,086
You will never look at me.

3
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:49,766
Go wherever you want!

4
00:01:49,913 --> 00:01:52,206
So you really came back to get back at your grandfather?

5
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,646
JP's chairman invited me to dinner tomorrow.

6
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,366
Do you want me to go with you?

7
00:01:57,526 --> 00:02:00,046
Can you go as my girlfriend?

8
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:02,406
My grandfather wants you to attend tonight's dinner.

9
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:07,926
I'll try this dress on.

10
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:09,566
If it doesn't fit, I can return it tomorrow.

11
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:11,126
You said yes to him so easily.

12
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,126
And then you kissed him!

13
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:41,126
Is this really a dress for dinner?

14
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:49,446
How did he get a dress that fit me so well?

15
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,086
Kuer.

16
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:03,646
Kuer.

17
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,839
Hey!

18
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,966
Why are you shouting?

19
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:25,093
You look good.

20
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:31,766
Isn't this too revealing?

21
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,126
We're meeting JP's executive.

22
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:35,646
I'm an adviser.

23
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:39,406
I should wear a formal dress, not a dress that shows everything.

24
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:44,406
You're there as an executive's girlfriend,

25
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:46,126
not as an adviser.

26
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:48,046
I think

27
00:03:48,538 --> 00:03:51,846
you look pretty in this dress.

28
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:59,246
Change your dress. Let's get some breakfast.

29
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:05,286
Or you can just wear that.

30
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,766
I'm fine with it.

31
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,806
Are you out of your mind?

32
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:11,043
See you at your front door in ten minutes.

33
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,446
Okay.

34
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:57,006
You look pretty,

35
00:04:57,546 --> 00:05:00,086
as expected of a JP executive's wife.

36
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:04,086
Don't even think I've forgiven you.

37
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:08,526
It's just my duty as the daughter-in-law of House Jangwangprawas.

38
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,366
Maybe you're going there

39
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:19,166
to see Kuer.

40
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:24,745
If I want to see him,

41
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,606
so what?

42
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:34,046
Let me go.

43
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:35,886
I'll let him know

44
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:38,726
that you're mine alone.

45
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:26,646
Do I look good?

46
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:29,606
Yes.

47
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,353
Shall we go?

48
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:03,206
I think you should change your mind.

49
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:09,232
You're pretty and smart. You can get a better boyfriend.

50
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:11,966
Are you still thinking that?

51
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:13,526
Yeah.

52
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:16,686
And I think you asked to go with me tonight

53
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,286
because you want to let him know, right?

54
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,266
Yes.

55
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:26,086
Why?

56
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:29,046
I'm your boyfriend. Why would you care about him?

57
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,246
I'll tell you about it later.

58
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:49,126
Believe me. I'm not one of Chanoot's mistresses.

59
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:52,008
Let's get inside. Quick.

60
00:07:57,926 --> 00:07:59,166
That woman...

61
00:07:59,632 --> 00:08:00,686
She's Un.

62
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:02,806
She's my sister.

63
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:18,126
Where are you going?

64
00:08:19,152 --> 00:08:20,726
Are you going after Kuer?

65
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:35,646
Good evening, Mr. Prawit.

66
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:38,326
Good evening. Please sit down.

67
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:48,086
Good evening.

68
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:54,806
It's been a few years. Did you miss me?

69
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:05,406
What are you doing here?

70
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,366
I haven't seen you in eight years.

71
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:10,246
Won't you ask

72
00:09:10,478 --> 00:09:12,326
how your granddaughter is doing?

73
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:14,206
Grandfather.

74
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,206
Grandfather?

75
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:24,966
Un!

76
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:30,006
I'm here as Mr. Kuer's girlfriend tonight.

77
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:33,606
Please be respectful with your words.

78
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:43,686
Un.

79
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:48,886
Shall we start our dinner?

80
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,246
You look hungry, Grandfather.

81
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:09,686
Hey.

82
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,846
When were you going to tell me that you're a Jangwangprawas?

83
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:19,366
I don't consider myself one of them anymore.

84
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:21,486
I didn't think it was important.

85
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:24,606
Is this why you said yes to me so easily?

86
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:26,846
You were using me.

87
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,726
I'll explain it later, but not now.

88
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:36,846
We'll talk after this.

89
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:41,366
What a coincidence.

90
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:44,166
What do you mean, Phim?

91
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,006
You and Un.

92
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:52,246
My ex is dating my husband's sister.

93
00:10:52,846 --> 00:10:55,046
Is this not a coincidence?

94
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:58,446
It is, but it's not weird.

95
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:00,953
It is weird.

96
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,366
I married Noot eight years ago.

97
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,526
I haven't seen her even once.

98
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:09,686
She suddenly appears by your side

99
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:12,686
when you`` sign a joint venture with JP.

100
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:15,126
Did she do this on purpose?

101
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:18,286
It's not like that.

102
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:21,006
I'm going inside.

103
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:42,646
I saw you in the photos. I didn't think I'd see you here today.

104
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:44,846
Are you surprised?

105
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,566
I think everyone is surprised,

106
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:51,006
especially Grandfather.

107
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:03,086
How long have you been dating Kuer?

108
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:06,406
Quite long.

109
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:09,286
You said you were...

110
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:12,846
His girlfriend.

111
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:24,086
Actually, we only met a few days ago.

112
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,646
He asked me to be his girlfriend.

113
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:31,526
After only a few days?

114
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:35,246
And you said yes?

115
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:44,006
You're too easy.

116
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:48,606
Of course.

117
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:52,126
It's not every day that a great guy comes your way.

118
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:55,006
That's right.

119
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:57,926
If you don't get to meet many great guys,

120
00:12:58,406 --> 00:13:00,446
you need to cherish it when you meet one.

121
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:05,646
I have to go now.

122
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,606
I've been out too long. Kuer might get worried.

123
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:16,566
By the way,

124
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,966
I saw you and Noot in the news.

125
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,446
It's not true, is it?

126
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:25,846
I'm rooting for you both.

127
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,286
Think about it.

128
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:51,126
If your company

129
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:54,086
joins forces with JP, I believe

130
00:13:55,246 --> 00:13:56,966
no one can compete with us here.

131
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:04,206
I think JP should reconsider the offer.

132
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:08,046
At least make it equally beneficial to both sides.

133
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:16,366
I would rather have this discussed between C-Itsara and JP.

134
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:33,926
Un also serves as an adviser to C-Itsara, and

135
00:14:34,486 --> 00:14:36,406
she's personally involved in this project.

136
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:38,806
I'll need to ask for her opinions anyway.

137
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:49,766
Then we'll reconsider our offer.

138
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:52,406
We'll submit a new offer soon.

139
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,726
Please do.

140
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,166
Thank you so much, Mr. Prawit,

141
00:15:04,247 --> 00:15:08,566
for taking care of me with this dinner and accommodation.

142
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:11,245
- You're very welcome.  - Thanks.

143
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:14,246
I look forward to working with you soon.

144
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:15,366
Likewise.

145
00:15:15,593 --> 00:15:16,873
- Thank you.  - Thank you.

146
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:03,526
Don't go in.

147
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,366
Wait here.

148
00:16:05,823 --> 00:16:07,806
- But...  - No buts.

149
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:09,526
It's not your job.

150
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:12,606
I asked you to drive tonight because my driver called in sick.

151
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:15,886
Yes, Grandfather.

152
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:28,006
I thought he'd let me in the meeting.

153
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,046
He only let me drive.

154
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:37,326
Mr. Rit, the chairman is coming.

155
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:38,672
Thanks.

156
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:51,846
When did you find out about Un?

157
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:55,046
I knew she was in Phuket. I didn't know she was with Kuer.

158
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:58,926
I never saw Un in any meeting back in Bangkok.

159
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:05,326
She wants to go against her grandfather. Let her try.

160
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:32,659
- What is it?  - I saw that

161
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,386
you were looking right at him.

162
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:40,366
Can't I even look at him?

163
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:42,806
Do you want me to sit with my eyes closed?

164
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:45,446
When you went to the bathroom,

165
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,766
you were actually seeing him, weren't you?

166
00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:51,526
Do you want me to say yes?

167
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:52,966
"Yes, I did."

168
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,646
"I hooked up with Kuer in the bathroom." Is this what you want to hear?

169
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,846
- Phim.  - Don't think everyone is the same as you.

170
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:03,406
I never want to fool around as you do.

171
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:06,966
That'd better be true.

172
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:11,446
Just go home.

173
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:13,046
I can go back to the hotel myself.

174
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,606
No! You came with me. You must come home with me.

175
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,886
I'm not letting you go up there to see him.

176
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:59,245
You said you were going to explain after the meeting.

177
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:02,166
Well, you didn't ask.

178
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:05,446
That doesn't mean I don't want to know.

179
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:10,166
It's a long story. I can't tell it all here.

180
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:12,126
I can listen to you all night.

181
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:25,699
Kuer.

182
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,926
What do you want to know?

183
00:19:30,406 --> 00:19:31,846
Were you using me?

184
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:37,026
Yes.

185
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:15,366
But I didn't lie when I said I liked you.

186
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:18,886
At this point,

187
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:22,686
you can drop your facade.

188
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:25,526
It wasn't a facade.

189
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,126
It's really how I feel.

190
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:35,086
Are you trying to fool me again?

191
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:36,966
I'm not.

192
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,526
I like you.

193
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,286
It's not about my grandfather.

194
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:50,126
I do like you.

195
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:05,526
After all this,

196
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:08,286
do you still want to date me?

197
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:12,926
Or do you want to break up?

198
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:36,766
Yes, Father.

199
00:21:38,652 --> 00:21:40,846
Do you know that your daughter is back?

200
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:43,206
I do.

201
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:47,766
Do you know who she is dating?

202
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:51,606
She hasn't told me.

203
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,166
She is dating an executive of a company I want to invest in.

204
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:01,526
What are you smiling about?

205
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:05,806
Un must be helping to make it easy for you, right?

206
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:07,326
Easy, my butt!

207
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:09,806
She's ruining me.

208
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,686
I never want to see her face again.

209
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:18,526
She can date whoever the heck she wants!

210
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:42,806
Rit, go upstairs to your grandfather quickly.

211
00:22:43,246 --> 00:22:44,406
Yes, Mom.

212
00:22:50,165 --> 00:22:51,526
Why did Un return?

213
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:53,726
Maybe she couldn't make it abroad.

214
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,326
That's why she needed to come back to find a rich boyfriend.

215
00:22:57,112 --> 00:22:59,366
- I don't know.  - You don't?

216
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:03,406
You don't know whether she will end up like her mother.

217
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,086
You got married only to become a housewife.

218
00:23:06,446 --> 00:23:09,166
That's still better than getting dumped.

219
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:13,006
If my brother were still alive, he would have left you too.

220
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:33,486
Where are you going?

221
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:38,286
I'm staying at the resort.

222
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:40,166
Why don't you come home?

223
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:42,806
I don't want to stay with someone who looks down on me.

224
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:47,726
You think I'm a hooker. You thought I slept with someone else, didn't you?

225
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:52,446
If this is all you think, I won't stay here.

226
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:57,286
When you can think of better things,

227
00:23:57,913 --> 00:23:59,326
we will talk.

228
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:21,246
(Mom)

229
00:24:23,486 --> 00:24:24,486
Mom?

230
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:26,446
Did Grandfather yell at you?

231
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:29,006
He didn't.

232
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,006
He told me you had a boyfriend.

233
00:24:32,678 --> 00:24:35,452
Why didn't you bring him to me?

234
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:40,126
I don't even know whether he's still my boyfriend.

235
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,926
Why?

236
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:44,526
Did you fight?

237
00:24:45,606 --> 00:24:46,606
Yeah.

238
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,046
Talk it out nicely.

239
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:53,446
Couples do misunderstand and fight.

240
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:56,126
(If you love him,)

241
00:24:56,472 --> 00:24:59,046
you need to consider his feelings.

242
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:02,126
If you know what makes him uncomfortable

243
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:04,446
or upset him, don't do it.

244
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,806
Mom.

245
00:25:07,192 --> 00:25:10,166
I didn't tell you anything, yet you talk like I'm at fault.

246
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,606
I know my daughter.

247
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:16,619
Once you make up with him,

248
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:18,646
bring him to me, okay?

249
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:21,246
Okay, Mom.

250
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:24,486
- Good night.  - Good night.

251
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,166
What did you tell her?

252
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:53,646
- I didn't say anything.  - Why?

253
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,886
She fooled you. Just break up with her.

254
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:59,286
It got off on the wrong foot. It's hard to go on.

255
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:05,806
No response? Are you hesitating?

256
00:26:07,892 --> 00:26:08,892
Kuer.

257
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:11,406
Do you really like her that much?

258
00:26:15,686 --> 00:26:16,686
Yes.

259
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:18,926
Since I broke up with Phim,

260
00:26:20,086 --> 00:26:21,446
she's the first person who

261
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:23,366
made me feel this way.

262
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:30,580
Kuer, what happened between Phim and Noot?

263
00:26:31,028 --> 00:26:34,606
That's right. Sa came here to find out about this.

264
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:40,366
I did. My page is skyrocketing because of their breakup news.

265
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,885
People got even more interested

266
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:44,058
when I deleted my post, thinking it was true.

267
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:45,459
Otherwise, I wouldn't have deleted it.

268
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:48,358
I don't know.

269
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:51,486
You do know, but you aren't telling.

270
00:26:53,093 --> 00:26:54,207
Look.

271
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:58,246
I called you two out to talk about me, not Phim.

272
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:03,326
Okay. We're done talking about you.

273
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:07,646
I already know how you will deal with this.

274
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:35,406
(Kuerkhun)

275
00:27:59,086 --> 00:28:00,166
What is it?

276
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,726
(Kuerkhun)

277
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:09,446
Crap!

278
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:30,886
Hey!

279
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:33,686
Un!

280
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,206
Morning!

281
00:28:40,406 --> 00:28:42,206
I need five minutes. Please wait.

282
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:44,646
Hey! Wait!

283
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:48,526
I've been waiting here all morning, and you still want me to wait outside?

284
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:53,566
I couldn't sleep last night. I felt so guilty.

285
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:57,286
I wanted to ask you for breakfast, but I overslept.

286
00:28:58,185 --> 00:29:01,646
Can I wait for you inside?

287
00:29:07,465 --> 00:29:09,926
Sure, but you need to close your eyes.

288
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:11,806
Why do I have to close my eyes?

289
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:14,726
I'm in my nightgown.

290
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:19,766
Okay. I'll close my eyes.

291
00:29:22,356 --> 00:29:23,686
Give me your hand.

292
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,098
A bit more.

293
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:29,126
- Now what?  - Don't open your eyes.

294
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:31,566
- Hey!  - Keep walking.

295
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:34,366
- I can't see anything.  - You're inside.

296
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:38,446
- Where to?  - Turn this way.

297
00:29:39,286 --> 00:29:40,511
- Sit down.  - Right here?

298
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:43,019
Hey! No! Back off a bit.

299
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:44,626
Okay.

300
00:29:45,112 --> 00:29:47,086
- Please wait here.  - Okay.

301
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,106
- Don't open your eyes.  - I won't.

302
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:55,646
You can open your eyes now.

303
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:11,926
(Phim)

304
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:20,446
Hello, Phim.

305
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:23,686
Kuer, I'm sorry I woke you up.

306
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:27,526
What's wrong?

307
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,326
I want to ask you out for a meal.

308
00:30:35,393 --> 00:30:38,886
I have plans today. Rain check?

309
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:43,166
Okay.

310
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:49,006
Noot!

311
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:50,926
(Where are your manners?)

312
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:52,931
(Noot!)

313
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:55,006
(Give it to me. You can't do this!)

314
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:56,806
Noot!

315
00:30:57,486 --> 00:30:59,766
You're not screwing my wife, are you?

316
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,486
(Are you?)

317
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:07,406
You're the one who did that to me eight years ago.

318
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:11,566
That was eight years ago.

319
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:13,686
Phim is my wife now.

320
00:31:14,726 --> 00:31:17,606
(I won't do what you did.)

321
00:31:18,165 --> 00:31:22,046
I think you should talk to Phim, not me.

322
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,486
Don't you have any shame?

323
00:31:30,052 --> 00:31:32,326
Asking another man out for a meal?

324
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,086
Didn't we talk about this, Phim?

325
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:37,486
We'll just be talking. Can't I be friends with him?

326
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:39,286
Today, you're friends.

327
00:31:39,446 --> 00:31:41,566
Tonight, will he be your boyfriend?

328
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,366
Noot.

329
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:54,886
This is why I don't want to talk to you.

330
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,606
You screw other women a lot, and that's fine?

331
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:01,006
So many people saw the news

332
00:32:01,431 --> 00:32:03,086
that broke out.

333
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:04,846
Even Un saw it.

334
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:07,126
How can I show my face anywhere?

335
00:32:19,526 --> 00:32:20,526
Phim.

336
00:32:32,212 --> 00:32:37,046
I just want to talk to someone who understands how I feel.

337
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:42,966
Phim.

338
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:46,806
I'm sorry.

339
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,686
I'm just scared that you'd return to him.

340
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:57,966
It was my mistake

341
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:00,166
when I chose you.

342
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:18,286
I'm sorry that I did this to you.

343
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:22,246
Phim.

344
00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:13,446
Phim, can we start over?

345
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:17,206
Let's forget about the past, okay?

346
00:34:21,512 --> 00:34:22,587
Please.

347
00:34:29,126 --> 00:34:32,766
Do you think I'd forget everything with your promise?

348
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:36,766
Just go home.

349
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:40,206
I'll be back when I'm ready.

350
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:06,046
I'm ready.

351
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,326
Is he gone?

352
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,806
I rushed to take a shower.

353
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:18,473
Is he still mad from last night, and I made him upset again?

354
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,486
Hey, Kuer.

355
00:35:29,686 --> 00:35:31,246
- Are you ready?  - Yes.

356
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:33,006
Did you wait long?

357
00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:36,206
Not at all. Shall we go? I have an appointment.

358
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,646
You haven't told me your answer.

359
00:35:45,606 --> 00:35:47,326
About what you asked me last night?

360
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:51,326
After all this,

361
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:54,046
do you still want to date me?

362
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:57,926
Or do you want to break up?

363
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,766
I don't want to break up.

364
00:36:16,526 --> 00:36:17,806
If I wanted to break up,

365
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:21,686
I wouldn't have come to wait for you.

366
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,366
Don't try to fool me again.

367
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,726
- Here?  - Yes.

368
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,526
Noot comes for you, and you still won't go home?

369
00:37:21,852 --> 00:37:22,852
Not yet.

370
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:25,686
Playing hard to get, huh?

371
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:29,966
Just a little bit.

372
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:33,086
What did he say? Tell me.

373
00:37:33,806 --> 00:37:34,806
Well,

374
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,206
he said he'd stop womanizing.

375
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:39,646
That's good.

376
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:42,286
He said it every time.

377
00:37:42,686 --> 00:37:45,046
And he still did it every time.

378
00:37:46,246 --> 00:37:48,166
This time might be a "new normal."

379
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:53,886
When are you going home?

380
00:38:17,846 --> 00:38:19,206
Why are we here?

381
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:21,446
Good morning.

382
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:22,846
- Good morning.  - Good morning.

383
00:38:22,906 --> 00:38:23,926
- Mr. Kuer, right? - Yes.

384
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:25,406
Please come inside.

385
00:38:25,498 --> 00:38:27,166
- Okay. After you.  - Yes, sir.

386
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:36,593
I don't want to stay at a hotel under JP's eyes for months.

387
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:39,806
Let's go.

388
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:51,486
I never thought I'd be back in Phuket, you know?

389
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:56,366
I left home eight years ago.

390
00:38:56,859 --> 00:38:59,166
I won a scholarship, but my grandfather refused to let me go.

391
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:01,366
Why?

392
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:04,486
My grandfather only loves and supports his grandsons.

393
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:07,464
Like Noot?

394
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:14,526
When I was young, I was elected as head of the class.

395
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,606
My grandfather found out and complained to the school.

396
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:19,966
How can a girl be a leader?

397
00:39:22,032 --> 00:39:24,006
If Chanoot doesn't get to be the head of the class,

398
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:27,086
I'll reconsider my support for the school.

399
00:39:58,586 --> 00:40:01,246
He believes men are more qualified to lead,

400
00:40:01,505 --> 00:40:04,446
so he didn't support me in pursuing my study.

401
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,606
I realized that if I wanted to make it big, I needed to leave.

402
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:11,406
Is that why you left?

403
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:15,886
I changed my name.

404
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,686
I changed my last name.

405
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:19,886
I no longer needed support from my grandfather.

406
00:40:22,846 --> 00:40:24,846
That's why you wanted to

407
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,206
prove him wrong.

408
00:40:35,606 --> 00:40:37,406
I'm sorry that I fooled you.

409
00:40:38,732 --> 00:40:42,006
If I were just Dr. Ann, I'd still be nothing to him.

410
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:46,366
But as the girlfriend and adviser to a C-Itsara executive,

411
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:48,846
I knew my grandfather would have been caught off guard.

412
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,166
I think this place is good.

413
00:40:57,852 --> 00:40:58,966
Do you like it?

414
00:41:00,246 --> 00:41:01,406
Are you asking me?

415
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:04,819
Well,

416
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:08,406
you're moving in with me. I have to ask you.

417
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:11,606
Here? With you?

418
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,046
What's wrong with your ears?

419
00:41:17,606 --> 00:41:19,166
Are you out of your mind?

420
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:24,046
I think I'd better stay at the hotel.

421
00:41:25,645 --> 00:41:29,046
We have two bedrooms here. You and I get one each.

422
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,766
- But...  - As my girlfriend,

423
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:36,686
living with me is not weird.

424
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:49,126
Do you like this place?

425
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:51,726
If you like it here, I'll pay the deposit.

426
00:41:54,486 --> 00:41:56,246
I just wired the deposit to you.

427
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,686
We've received your deposit. Thank you.

428
00:42:00,006 --> 00:42:01,206
These are your keys.

429
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:03,646
You can move in once you're ready.

430
00:42:03,793 --> 00:42:04,846
Thank you.

431
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:14,806
Are you hungry? I haven't eaten anything.

432
00:42:15,126 --> 00:42:16,806
I thought you wouldn't ask.

433
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:18,486
I'm so hungry my eyes are blurred.

434
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,526
Then please get in the car, Ann. I've found a place.

435
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:31,366
My name is Un.

436
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:34,206
Unyamanee Jangwangprawas.

437
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,599
Nice to meet you,

438
00:42:40,752 --> 00:42:41,912
Miss Un.

439
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:54,225
Look.

440
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,406
Your grandfather,

441
00:42:56,566 --> 00:42:58,806
I don't want you to think about taking revenge on him.

442
00:42:59,006 --> 00:43:00,126
Why?

443
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:03,686
You know what? He needs to go against someone like me.

444
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:06,086
I will make him stop looking down on women.

445
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:10,846
I don't want to see you disappointed.

446
00:43:12,246 --> 00:43:14,046
Why would I be disappointed?

447
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:17,646
It might be no use.

448
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:19,726
He doesn't care about you.

449
00:43:20,393 --> 00:43:23,286
It's like throwing rocks in the water.

450
00:43:23,672 --> 00:43:25,606
Only the one who throws gets tired.

451
00:43:26,673 --> 00:43:28,646
My grandfather knows everything.

452
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,966
He knows what he wants and what anyone does to him.

453
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:34,326
How he reacts is another story.

454
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:39,606
Honestly, if he had been upset last night that I was with you,

455
00:43:39,905 --> 00:43:43,806
and I was an adviser to a project he wanted, that would have satisfied me.

456
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:50,406
Okay.

457
00:43:50,892 --> 00:43:52,892
Then, you're going to have fun tomorrow.

458
00:43:53,305 --> 00:43:55,406
We will visit JP's office together.

459
00:44:13,118 --> 00:44:15,486
We have prepared a temporary office for you.

460
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:17,949
Thanks.

461
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:20,166
Please make yourself at home.

462
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:25,226
- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

463
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:34,326
You should be familiar with this place, Un.

464
00:44:34,526 --> 00:44:37,646
If Kuer needs anything, you can tell me.

465
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:39,286
Okay.

466
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:42,726
Can you arrange a meeting with Grandfather for us?

467
00:44:43,052 --> 00:44:44,846
I want to discuss the offer.

468
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:49,766
I think Grandfather would rather talk to Kuer.

469
00:44:50,246 --> 00:44:51,326
I know,

470
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,646
but I still want to talk to him.

471
00:44:54,146 --> 00:44:55,766
Please help me, Brother.

472
00:44:57,546 --> 00:44:58,646
Okay.

473
00:45:06,189 --> 00:45:07,189
Nam.

474
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:08,420
Rit.

475
00:45:10,732 --> 00:45:11,926
Is Noot here?

476
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:13,606
Yes.

477
00:45:14,532 --> 00:45:16,006
Do you know what they're talking about?

478
00:45:18,126 --> 00:45:19,566
I'm not sure.

479
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,326
He told me to prepare a lot of papers.

480
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:24,679
I think they're talking about the joint venture.

481
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:29,078
I'll serve these myself.

482
00:45:29,332 --> 00:45:30,406
Okay.

483
00:45:37,366 --> 00:45:42,566
If we agree, we'll share our revenue from existing clients with them.

484
00:45:43,246 --> 00:45:47,246
Should we share revenue from our new clients in percentages instead?

485
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:49,886
But we own the docks.

486
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:52,846
C-Itsara comes in without investing anything,

487
00:45:53,439 --> 00:45:55,166
but they get a cut from the revenue.

488
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:56,646
We will be at a disadvantage.

489
00:45:56,739 --> 00:45:58,053
It's a win-win.

490
00:45:58,412 --> 00:46:01,326
C-Itsara actually has a lot of clients.

491
00:46:01,566 --> 00:46:04,246
I think they want a dock here

492
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:06,966
to provide options for their clients.

493
00:46:07,826 --> 00:46:10,286
Will they need to check our finance?

494
00:46:10,939 --> 00:46:14,046
Yes. We will need to check theirs too.

495
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:22,286
You're done. Why are you still standing here? Leave us.

496
00:46:22,712 --> 00:46:25,846
I want to tell you that Kuer and Un are here.

497
00:46:26,185 --> 00:46:28,686
I brought them to the temporary office we had prepared.

498
00:46:28,864 --> 00:46:29,864
Okay.

499
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:32,286
And...

500
00:46:36,573 --> 00:46:37,726
Is there anything else?

501
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:40,846
Un asked to see you, Grandfather.

502
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:51,745
I want to start moving this afternoon.

503
00:46:51,919 --> 00:46:55,206
Let's get our things from the hotel and bring them to the house.

504
00:46:55,886 --> 00:46:57,846
Why are you in such a rush?

505
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:00,806
I want to live with my girlfriend.

506
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:09,526
Excuse me.

507
00:47:09,766 --> 00:47:11,966
Mr. Prawit will see Miss Un now.

508
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,319
Please come in.

509
00:47:45,953 --> 00:47:47,166
Prang.

510
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:48,526
Good morning.

511
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:50,406
Who went in there with Nam?

512
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:54,646
That was Miss Un, Mr. Kuer's adviser from C-Itsara.

513
00:47:55,613 --> 00:47:58,126
Why is she here?

514
00:47:58,452 --> 00:48:01,636
Today is the first-day C-Itsara starts working with us here.

515
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:04,446
Mr. Prawit provides an office for them on the fourth floor.

516
00:48:06,806 --> 00:48:08,006
Please excuse me.

517
00:48:15,906 --> 00:48:17,606
What do you want to talk about?

518
00:48:18,366 --> 00:48:21,006
I just want to tell you that I'm here

519
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:23,566
as an adviser to C-Itsara.

520
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:27,406
I know.

521
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,366
If you're afraid I'll forget, you can wear a neck strap with a card.

522
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,806
I'm back here to do my job.

523
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,766
I want you to separate business from personal issues.

524
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:41,366
Are you telling me, who has been working since before you were born,

525
00:48:41,446 --> 00:48:43,526
how to do my job, you little brat?

526
00:48:44,566 --> 00:48:45,726
I am.

527
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:50,446
I don't want you to decide for or against a joint venture with C-Itsara

528
00:48:50,673 --> 00:48:53,686
just because I'm an adviser to them.

529
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:56,646
That's all I want to say.

530
00:48:58,405 --> 00:49:00,966
Women always use their emotions over their brains.

531
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:06,606
I wonder what Mr. Kuer thought when he made you his adviser.

532
00:49:07,279 --> 00:49:08,766
What was he thinking, huh?

533
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:11,526
He is thinking the right thing.

534
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:14,686
And I'll prove you wrong.

535
00:49:15,646 --> 00:49:18,366
Just like how you were wrong about me eight years ago.

536
00:49:18,933 --> 00:49:21,646
You thought I'd die out there, that I wouldn't make it,

537
00:49:21,886 --> 00:49:23,846
that I'd come crawling back to you.

538
00:49:25,686 --> 00:49:26,886
But today,

539
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:30,006
your JP Corp might even need me.

540
00:49:51,652 --> 00:49:53,206
Have you been to the doctor?

541
00:49:57,646 --> 00:50:02,686
I got better with the prescription from Bangkok, so I haven't.

542
00:50:02,886 --> 00:50:05,646
I think you should get it checked, so you can fully recover.

543
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:16,646
If I make a doctor's appointment, can you go with me?

544
00:50:23,805 --> 00:50:25,846
Hi, Phim.

545
00:50:27,172 --> 00:50:29,246
I'm here to ask you guys out to lunch.

546
00:50:29,379 --> 00:50:32,486
If you're busy, that's fine.

547
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:35,966
It's my first day here. There's not much to do.

548
00:50:36,459 --> 00:50:37,966
Where are we going?

549
00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:43,006
Should we get some rice noodles?

550
00:50:43,406 --> 00:50:46,326
Or Southern Thai food? You like that, Kuer.

551
00:50:49,705 --> 00:50:50,705
I'm fine with that.

552
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:53,446
I'm not really picky about food.

553
00:50:53,812 --> 00:50:55,486
I'll get my purse then.

554
00:50:55,612 --> 00:50:56,846
I'll get it for you.

555
00:51:04,546 --> 00:51:06,206
He used to like Southern Thai food.

556
00:51:06,966 --> 00:51:09,086
But what about now? He might not like it anymore.

557
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:17,406
Noot, I'm going to a Southern Thai restaurant. Do you want to come?

558
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:21,526
Okay. See you outside.

559
00:51:28,872 --> 00:51:30,206
Why did you tell Noot?

560
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,606
Do you want to cause trouble between him and me?

561
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:35,806
I'm sorry,

562
00:51:36,185 --> 00:51:37,646
but I'm more comfortable with this.

563
00:51:44,005 --> 00:51:45,286
Let's go to my car.

564
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:47,926
- Let's go.  - Thanks.

565
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:08,966
Kuer is going too?

566
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,126
We can be informal for a change.

567
00:52:11,326 --> 00:52:13,646
I'm going with Noot. Kuer, you go with Un?

568
00:52:13,913 --> 00:52:15,406
See you at the restaurant.

569
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,246
Did you do this?

570
00:52:28,439 --> 00:52:29,966
Did you ask Kuer out?

571
00:52:30,985 --> 00:52:32,806
I invited Un too.

572
00:52:33,986 --> 00:52:35,566
He must be really important.

573
00:52:36,006 --> 00:52:38,526
That's why you went to him before me.

574
00:52:39,465 --> 00:52:42,326
Isn't he important to JP right now?

575
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:46,806
If you want to close the deal quickly as your grandfather wanted,

576
00:52:47,006 --> 00:52:48,806
you have to talk to him often.

577
00:52:48,926 --> 00:52:51,046
So you know what he wants.

578
00:52:52,206 --> 00:52:54,486
I'm doing a good job as a backdoor staff.

579
00:52:54,593 --> 00:52:57,006
I'm helping you get the job done ASAP.

580
00:52:57,392 --> 00:52:58,646
That's all.

581
00:53:11,145 --> 00:53:14,686
I need to go to the bathroom. Please get our table.

582
00:53:20,646 --> 00:53:21,966
Is this the place, Noot?

583
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,486
Phim likes this place.

584
00:53:28,952 --> 00:53:31,526
Let's get inside. They're busy during lunchtime.

585
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:32,688
Okay.

586
00:53:40,256 --> 00:53:43,166
Listen. You need to take it slow with your business.

587
00:54:02,886 --> 00:54:04,046
Are you hungry?

588
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,206
Did you order anything for our guests?

589
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,966
I did.

590
00:54:17,286 --> 00:54:20,286
If you want anything more, just order.

591
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:21,926
Okay.

592
00:54:25,926 --> 00:54:27,086
Waitress.

593
00:54:28,046 --> 00:54:31,246
A yellow curry with sea bass and bamboo shoot, please.

594
00:54:31,406 --> 00:54:32,726
- Add this to the same bill?  - Yes.

595
00:54:33,086 --> 00:54:35,286
- Serve it in a hot pot.  - In a hot pot.

596
00:54:57,406 --> 00:54:58,646
Thank you.

597
00:55:00,493 --> 00:55:02,246
What have you talked about?

598
00:55:04,866 --> 00:55:07,646
I asked Noot about the revised offer.

599
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:12,006
It will be ready soon.

600
00:55:12,546 --> 00:55:15,326
It only depends on your decision.

601
00:55:15,572 --> 00:55:17,572
I'm not really picky about anything.

602
00:55:18,172 --> 00:55:20,486
I just want an offer with a win-win situation.

603
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:22,486
That's right.

604
00:55:22,812 --> 00:55:25,446
If we can work out the benefits before we start,

605
00:55:25,592 --> 00:55:27,846
we wouldn't have problems on the job.

606
00:55:28,718 --> 00:55:30,046
I hope so.

607
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,726
But if C-Itsara feels that the offer is not perfect,

608
00:55:39,325 --> 00:55:41,846
we might talk to other docks' owners

609
00:55:41,966 --> 00:55:44,566
who have been trying to get a meeting with Kuer.

610
00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:00,206
I'm sorry.

611
00:56:01,006 --> 00:56:03,193
Un.

612
00:56:03,314 --> 00:56:04,926
It's fine.

613
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:07,606
Let's go to the bathroom. I'll help.

614
00:56:08,886 --> 00:56:10,086
Okay.

615
00:56:10,232 --> 00:56:11,246
It's fine.

616
00:56:20,726 --> 00:56:23,019
How are you? Did it burn?

617
00:56:23,298 --> 00:56:24,326
A little bit.

618
00:56:26,185 --> 00:56:28,806
Good. A little burn will cure the itch.

619
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:31,926
You did this, didn't you?

620
00:56:45,473 --> 00:56:46,526
Waitress.

621
00:56:47,846 --> 00:56:49,566
I need some help.

622
00:56:57,846 --> 00:56:59,465
What did I do?

623
00:56:59,546 --> 00:57:01,126
The waitress did it.

624
00:57:01,499 --> 00:57:05,606
I think she just chose whom to spill it on.

625
00:57:10,486 --> 00:57:13,694
Remember, don't mess with me again.

626
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:22,806
You have a husband.

627
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,926
If you want it so bad, just ask your husband.

628
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:29,526
Don't be desperate for another man.

629
00:57:31,399 --> 00:57:33,766
I'm embarrassed for Noot to have a wife like you.

630
00:57:35,432 --> 00:57:37,606
If you mess with me again,

631
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:40,126
it won't be a close call next time.

632
00:57:41,006 --> 00:57:42,646
How is a wife like me embarrassing?

633
00:57:47,372 --> 00:57:48,606
You're trashy.

634
00:58:01,046 --> 00:58:02,606
Can I be honest?

635
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:07,046
About what?

636
00:58:07,613 --> 00:58:08,686
Phim.

637
00:58:10,366 --> 00:58:11,606
What about Phim?

638
00:58:12,286 --> 00:58:13,406
I think Phim still...

639
00:58:13,487 --> 00:58:17,006
I need to go home early. My suit is messed up. I need to change.

640
00:58:18,106 --> 00:58:19,606
Un and I will be leaving now.

641
00:58:19,852 --> 00:58:21,366
Let's talk later at the office.

642
00:58:22,045 --> 00:58:23,045
Let's go.

643
00:58:28,032 --> 00:58:29,109
Come on.

644
00:58:29,446 --> 00:58:30,526
Kuer.

645
00:58:34,085 --> 00:58:35,325
Are you leaving?

646
00:58:35,447 --> 00:58:37,966
Yes. Un needs to change.

647
00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:41,086
Please excuse us.

648
00:59:02,059 --> 00:59:05,446
Those two just left. We haven't talked at all.

649
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:07,966
Think of this as

650
00:59:08,732 --> 00:59:10,566
a lunch with your husband, okay?

651
00:59:36,686 --> 00:59:37,846
What's wrong?

652
00:59:41,853 --> 00:59:43,446
Kuer just left early.

653
00:59:44,726 --> 00:59:46,326
Did that kill your appetite?

654
00:59:47,846 --> 00:59:50,286
Can you stop talking about the same thing over and over?

655
00:59:52,406 --> 00:59:53,886
I won't be talking about it over and over

656
00:59:54,546 --> 00:59:56,306
if you're not being that obvious.

657
01:00:04,926 --> 01:00:07,086
Waitress, bill, please.

658
01:00:07,179 --> 01:00:09,792
- I have to leave now. It's urgent.  - Okay.

659
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:23,753
Isn't that too much? Do I need to find my scoop

660
01:00:23,846 --> 01:00:25,606
and get some food for you too?

661
01:00:25,806 --> 01:00:28,486
Stop! Don't blame me, or I won't buy your food.

662
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:36,366
Okay. I have to go now. You will get a feast.

663
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:42,566
Hey! Don't even try to make an excuse.

664
01:00:42,946 --> 01:00:45,166
Don't say that I can't, but you can.

665
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:47,566
I haven't said anything.

666
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:49,206
I know you were going to say it.

667
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:52,486
Do you want a ride back with me or go back on your own?

668
01:00:53,439 --> 01:00:54,526
Phim.

669
01:00:55,366 --> 01:00:58,526
- Hey!  - I tried to stop being bad to make you happy,

670
01:00:59,006 --> 01:01:00,526
but you don't care at all.

671
01:01:01,212 --> 01:01:03,646
You even flirted with another guy in front of me!

672
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:16,166
Will you be mad if I say

673
01:01:16,846 --> 01:01:20,606
you were practically spreading your legs for your ex in front of me?

674
01:01:23,073 --> 01:01:25,073
You don't respect me at all, right?

675
01:01:25,486 --> 01:01:27,486
If you still do what you did just now,

676
01:01:28,246 --> 01:01:29,926
you don't deserve my respect.

677
01:01:31,072 --> 01:01:32,606
You've lost it.

678
01:01:35,312 --> 01:01:36,686
I'll go back on my own.

679
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,726
I checked out this morning.

680
01:01:52,838 --> 01:01:56,606
I packed my stuff already. We're moving in this afternoon.

681
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:00,286
You go and take a shower.

682
01:02:00,686 --> 01:02:02,726
I'll help you pack your bags in the meantime.

683
01:02:03,766 --> 01:02:05,046
Are you serious?

684
01:02:05,438 --> 01:02:07,966
If you help me pack, you'll see my...

685
01:02:10,439 --> 01:02:16,246
I'll help you with your clothes and documents. You can take your time.

686
01:02:16,646 --> 01:02:21,446
What you don't want me to see, you can pack them yourself.

687
01:02:23,246 --> 01:02:24,926
Come on.

688
01:02:25,339 --> 01:02:26,686
Let's get in.

689
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:31,406
- Go.  - Hey!

690
01:02:31,526 --> 01:02:32,686
Kuer.

691
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:38,526
I think I should do it myself.

692
01:02:38,766 --> 01:02:42,246
Don't bother. Just take a shower. You got yellow curry all over you.

693
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,958
If you leave it on too long, it will burn.

694
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:45,126
Just go.

695
01:02:45,277 --> 01:02:46,726
Take a shower.

696
01:02:47,768 --> 01:02:49,606
- Hey!  - Take a shower.

697
01:02:56,436 --> 01:02:57,606
Bags.

698
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,526
Don't touch the drawers in the closet!

699
01:03:14,726 --> 01:03:16,206
I'll pack them myself.

700
01:03:17,905 --> 01:03:21,766
Okay. I won't touch your drawers, I promise.

701
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,086
This bag.

702
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:33,406
These shorts.

703
01:03:38,686 --> 01:03:40,166
Let's lay these out.

704
01:03:40,759 --> 01:03:42,126
Put these here.

705
01:03:44,186 --> 01:03:45,726
These are Un's purses.

706
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:52,166
Hey, you!

707
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:53,966
What?

708
01:03:54,225 --> 01:03:57,646
If you don't know how to fold the clothes, just leave them there.

709
01:03:57,846 --> 01:04:01,130
It's okay. This is easy. Just take your shower.

710
01:04:01,225 --> 01:04:05,086
I'll take you to another lunch, and then we'll go home.

711
01:04:05,226 --> 01:04:07,286
We didn't eat anything back there.

712
01:04:08,726 --> 01:04:11,166
Crap. I forgot.

713
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:16,606
What should I do now? Dear me!

714
01:04:17,346 --> 01:04:18,414
Hey!

715
01:04:19,366 --> 01:04:20,726
I'll fold them all.

716
01:04:25,026 --> 01:04:30,006
Wait! I forgot the clothes I need to wear.

717
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:37,646
What are you going to wear? Let me

718
01:04:39,399 --> 01:04:40,806
bring it to you.

719
01:04:41,738 --> 01:04:43,566
Are you coming in here?

720
01:04:44,366 --> 01:04:45,406
Yes.

721
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:50,046
I'll close my eyes and hand them to you. I won't look.

722
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:51,726
Are you serious?

723
01:04:52,086 --> 01:04:53,446
You can't!

724
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:56,806
What do you want me to do then?

725
01:04:59,286 --> 01:05:02,646
Just sit there and close your eyes. I'll get them myself.

726
01:05:03,326 --> 01:05:05,406
Okay. I'll close my eyes.

727
01:05:16,816 --> 01:05:18,966
Okay. My eyes are closed.

728
01:05:19,061 --> 01:05:20,166
Okay.

729
01:05:30,025 --> 01:05:32,606
Don't touch these clothes. I'll fold them myself.

730
01:05:32,912 --> 01:05:34,006
Okay.

731
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:35,486
Keep your eyes closed.

732
01:05:35,586 --> 01:05:37,446
- They're closed.  - Okay.

733
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:42,166
- Is there anything I can help with?  - No, sir.

734
01:05:53,586 --> 01:05:55,415
What's your soap? It smells so good.

735
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:57,519
Turn that way, please.

736
01:05:57,826 --> 01:05:58,956
Don't open your eyes.

737
01:05:59,049 --> 01:06:00,049
Okay.

738
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:01,806
Look. I can help...

739
01:06:02,672 --> 01:06:04,201
It's fine. I got this.

740
01:06:04,282 --> 01:06:06,526
I folded a shirt and a pair of shorts in...

741
01:06:06,647 --> 01:06:09,186
Just stay still. Don't do anything.

742
01:06:09,286 --> 01:06:11,166
- Can I open my eyes?  - No. Whoa!

743
01:06:11,806 --> 01:06:12,926
Hey!

744
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:17,246
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

745
01:06:20,085 --> 01:06:21,926
You said you'd close your eyes.

746
01:06:59,126 --> 01:07:01,366
If I did, I wouldn't have seen you.

747
01:07:24,521 --> 01:07:25,526
Kuer...

748
01:08:04,389 --> 01:08:05,409
I think

749
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:09,072
Kuer is the drunk man I saw at the dumpster at your apartment that day.

750
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:11,046
This is obviously a destiny, Un.

751
01:08:19,153 --> 01:08:20,806
I'm considering a divorce.

752
01:08:21,106 --> 01:08:23,606
Okay. Just tell me when.
