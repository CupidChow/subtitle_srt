1
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:46,766
My grandfather is replacing Un

2
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,990
with me as Vice President.

3
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,286
I want the joint venture with C-Itsara that was on hold

4
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:55,886
to proceed forward.

5
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:59,686
Wait for me outside. I'll talk to Phim just briefly.

6
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,766
Call me if you want to talk.

7
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,166
Here.

8
00:02:06,846 --> 00:02:09,006
You never gave anyone a chance

9
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:10,766
because you didn't want to get hurt.

10
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:13,246
What if we skip forward another eight years?

11
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:15,806
Will he still be the right one for you?

12
00:02:20,846 --> 00:02:22,426
You said you were anxious

13
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:26,166
about Un reviving the joint venture. You want to talk to her.

14
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:29,181
That means you haven't talked to her yet.

15
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:31,806
I haven't.

16
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:39,966
Kuer, I have a lot of work to do.

17
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:43,846
My staff emailed some leads to me. They need me to follow those leads.

18
00:02:43,987 --> 00:02:46,646
And yet you dragged me out of my desk

19
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,246
just to look at you in this condition?

20
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:51,166
I'm not rich like you, Kuer.

21
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:53,726
My page needs sponsors.

22
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:56,806
Do you want to be my biggest sponsor, then?

23
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:59,477
That way, I can sit with you every day. Deal?

24
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,806
It's a win-win.

25
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,486
Look at him.

26
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:08,806
Please, Mrs. Kamalas.

27
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:13,726
Good afternoon, Mrs. Kamalas.

28
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:15,766
Good afternoon, Grandmother.

29
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:17,326
I'll get you some water.

30
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:25,966
What did she talk about with Phim?

31
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,326
I don't know. I didn't go in with her.

32
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:32,126
- Hey! Why?  - What?

33
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:35,584
- What? Where are you going? No!  - Follow them to...

34
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:37,206
Don't stick your nose in.

35
00:03:38,156 --> 00:03:42,350
Kuer, you don't look happy to see me.

36
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:45,326
I am happy.

37
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:46,926
What's wrong, then?

38
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:54,086
I'm worried about Un.

39
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:57,166
About Un or her grandfather, Mr. Prawit?

40
00:03:57,374 --> 00:03:58,606
What happened to Mr. Prawit?

41
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:00,734
He's in ICU.

42
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:02,886
ICU?

43
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:05,326
What happened, Grandmother?

44
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:07,166
I'm not sure myself.

45
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,206
It might be because of me.

46
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:19,086
I talked to him about Un yesterday.

47
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:21,886
I don't think so.

48
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:24,686
I think you should wait to hear from Un first.

49
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:27,726
That's why.

50
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:29,686
Now that Mr. Prawit is in the hospital,

51
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:31,646
Un is the acting president.

52
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,966
She's proceeding with our joint project.

53
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,606
Did she tell you that?

54
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:37,246
That's good.

55
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:41,966
After all, JP is our best option for business here.

56
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:46,406
Mr. Prawit probably doesn't want to join us anymore.

57
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:49,286
If Un proceeds this way,

58
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:52,446
some people will surely oppose her.

59
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:55,526
- Come here!  - Hey!

60
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,486
Where are you taking me? I was getting a good spot.

61
00:04:57,622 --> 00:04:59,926
- No! Don't!  - Whoa!

62
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:02,486
Why don't you go inside?

63
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:04,529
Mrs. Kamalas told me to wait outside.

64
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:08,166
I tried to listen, though.

65
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:10,166
- Listen to what they say?  - No.

66
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:11,430
What did you listen to then?

67
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:15,566
Listen to your heart, baby.

68
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:17,718
If you pull this joke again, I won't let you flirt anymore.

69
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,333
Just date me already.

70
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:24,206
- Really?  - Yeah.

71
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,348
But right now, I need to know about Kuer and his grandmother.

72
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:31,846
No, Sa!

73
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:34,166
Let them talk as grandmother and grandson.

74
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:38,046
I want to know.

75
00:05:38,222 --> 00:05:42,830
- The "wondering" is really in your blood and veins.  - Yeah!

76
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:45,806
You said you had a lot of work last night.

77
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:48,182
How come you're here with Kuer all day long?

78
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:51,566
I want to find out about Phim.

79
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:55,306
What did you find out?

80
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:56,826
Nothing.

81
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:58,578
If you do,

82
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:00,806
we can go and do something else, right?

83
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:05,726
She's pregnant.

84
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:10,326
I don't know if the baby is Noot's or Kuer's.

85
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:15,166
Kuer said it's not his. I'm sure he's not lying.

86
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:17,366
Hey, San!

87
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,166
This is great stuff. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

88
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:22,606
You let me watch Kuer look at the floor all day long.

89
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:24,709
That hurts. You didn't ask, did you?

90
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:27,846
Don't you know my nature? I want you to tell. Don't wait for me to ask.

91
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:31,966
Now that you know,

92
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:34,766
can we go do something else?

93
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:38,526
What should we do?

94
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,366
We

95
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:44,446
go to work.

96
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:48,006
You said you had a lot of work. I need to do my work at the station too.

97
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:50,846
You said that like you wanted to do something else.

98
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:52,841
If it's something else, would you do it then?

99
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:55,814
- Try asking.  - Okay. See you at eight tonight.

100
00:06:56,486 --> 00:06:58,846
Aren't you rushing too much?

101
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,106
- Let's have dinner.  - San!

102
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:05,406
You can eat anything. Let's eat at your place so that I can do my work.

103
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:08,446
Hey, you said I can eat anything.

104
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:09,926
Can I eat you, then?

105
00:07:12,753 --> 00:07:13,966
I have to go.

106
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:18,966
Idiot!

107
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:21,526
You made me go "Kimi No Toriko."

108
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:26,206
Do you know Grandfather doesn't want that joint venture?

109
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,886
Yeah, I know.

110
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,446
If you know, then why?

111
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:35,966
I'm talking to one of the dock owners who want to expand their facilities.

112
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:38,006
Shouldn't you wait for this deal first?

113
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:40,286
If you think about what's best for the company,

114
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:43,446
a joint venture with C-Itsara benefits us the most.

115
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,566
The deal that benefits us the most

116
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,126
is probably not the best deal

117
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:49,326
or best suited for us, Un.

118
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:53,926
If that's what you think,

119
00:07:54,118 --> 00:07:56,118
please write a report for me.

120
00:07:56,428 --> 00:08:00,446
In the meantime, I'll proceed with the C-Itsara project.

121
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,966
Are you doing this because you're dating Kuer?

122
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:07,646
Is this why you're trying to do this as a favor to C-Itsara?

123
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:10,229
I don't give out favors to anyone in my job.

124
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,246
From what I see now, you're giving out a favor to C-Itsara.

125
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:17,326
Everything is transparent.

126
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:21,606
You can check the terms of the agreement between JP and C-Itsara.

127
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,726
I'm confident I'm doing everything right.

128
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:26,526
We're not at a disadvantage.

129
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,374
It's true that our grandfather is sick

130
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:32,326
and he can't do anything himself.

131
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,646
But if you're doing something, I want you to at least think of him.

132
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:54,166
- Kan. Let me drive myself. - Yes.

133
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,185
Yes.

134
00:08:58,406 --> 00:08:59,406
Okay.

135
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:00,846
Miss Un.

136
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:03,246
Do you have a minute?

137
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,966
I'll talk to you tonight.

138
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:10,886
You're strange.

139
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:13,966
- How so?  - If I were you, I would have given up.

140
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,726
Won't you at least try?

141
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,446
Don't you watch TV shows?

142
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,966
The supporting character

143
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:22,446
won't get the lead girl, no matter what.

144
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:25,566
Maybe I'm not a supporting character.

145
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:33,326
There, your lead girl is here.

146
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:36,589
Hey!

147
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:40,606
We've been sitting for a while, and you didn't even tell me she's coming?

148
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:43,566
You betrayed me.

149
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:45,926
I didn't. You want to see her.

150
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:48,406
Not after we talked about what happened this morning.

151
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:51,126
She's here.

152
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,493
Oh! He left so quickly.

153
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:11,686
My first day as acting president sucks.

154
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:13,086
How did it go?

155
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:22,166
Gade!

156
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:25,046
I just confronted her this morning.

157
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:27,046
Who would want to see her after that?

158
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:35,166
It's as you thought.

159
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:40,726
Rit used to be the calmest person.

160
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:43,166
He never complained. He never had a problem.

161
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:47,999
But he seems like a different man today.

162
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,846
That's it. I told you he's suspicious.

163
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:53,166
Good people don't sneak into other people's rooms.

164
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:54,726
Especially his mom.

165
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:57,065
She's the worst.

166
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:59,966
If Rit is not a good man, that's because of Aunt Wing.

167
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:06,286
By the way, you said you're meeting Kuer.

168
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:09,686
He said he was going to have lunch with his grandmother.

169
00:11:11,277 --> 00:11:14,446
Didn't he say he'd bring you along?

170
00:11:14,694 --> 00:11:16,526
Maybe they need to talk about something private.

171
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:18,725
He's meeting me this evening instead.

172
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:21,886
So was that why you asked me where I was?

173
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:25,406
Your man ghosted you, and you didn't want to eat alone.

174
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,566
What do you want to eat? I'll treat you.

175
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,726
What do I want?

176
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:34,426
Miss Un is treating me.

177
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,486
Tell me whatever you want.

178
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:41,726
Have you talked to Un about this?

179
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:48,366
I just feel that I love Kuer.

180
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:49,806
Un.

181
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:55,166
Do you know him well enough to love him without any second thought?

182
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:57,646
Before him, I know

183
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:01,886
you never gave anyone a chance because you didn't want to get hurt.

184
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:05,606
What if we skip forward another eight years?

185
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:08,766
Will he still be the right one for you?

186
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,726
I've been here for you for eight years.

187
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:14,566
If you don't feel that I'm right for you,

188
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:20,326
you wouldn't have given me a chance that day.

189
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:33,646
Well? Have you talked to Un about this?

190
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,526
We'll talk about it this evening.

191
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:41,126
You're lovers. You have to cherish each other.

192
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:44,606
You decided to marry so quickly.

193
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:48,206
You still have a lot to learn about each other.

194
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:52,886
This is just the beginning.

195
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:56,806
After some time, you will know that marriage

196
00:12:57,022 --> 00:12:59,686
is about much more than just love.

197
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:23,206
He won't agree to see me?

198
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:26,446
I tried to follow him. He had already left.

199
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:31,566
He didn't go with Un. Where did he go?

200
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:33,246
I don't know.

201
00:13:33,534 --> 00:13:36,406
I asked the other drivers. Nobody knows.

202
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:44,446
Why did you ask me to follow him?

203
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:46,086
What's the matter?

204
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:48,766
I've been watching him for a while.

205
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,286
He worked for Noot.

206
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:53,526
I saw him tailing me once. I noticed him first.

207
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:56,166
I want to find out what he wants.

208
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,206
(His job is not finished.)

209
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,486
(He will come for her again.)

210
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:23,886
This way please, Grandmother.

211
00:14:41,974 --> 00:14:43,486
You're thinking about Un, aren't you?

212
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,486
Yes, I am.

213
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:55,646
What about Phim? How are you going to deal with her?

214
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:58,726
Can you still be her friend?

215
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:02,846
Grandmother, I admit that

216
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,046
when I broke up with Phim, I wanted her back.

217
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:07,606
But now,

218
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,686
I don't think of her as more than a friend at all.

219
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,186
Have you ever told her this?

220
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:16,166
The word "friend,"

221
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:18,206
anyone can say it.

222
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,006
What are your boundaries?

223
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,686
She's been taking advantage as your ex-girlfriend.

224
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:28,766
What about Un, your new girlfriend?

225
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:30,846
Is she okay with that?

226
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:39,406
Talk to her nicely. The thing about feelings is

227
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:43,206
when it's hurt, it's hard to repair.

228
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,446
What you think is not a big deal to you

229
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:51,046
might be a big deal to others.

230
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:53,126
Understand?

231
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:57,966
Yes, Grandmother.

232
00:15:59,515 --> 00:16:01,334
Go pick Un up.

233
00:16:02,204 --> 00:16:03,806
She's meeting me at the restaurant.

234
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:06,446
I'm not going with you.

235
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:09,326
Whoa! Why not?

236
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:13,206
I've been everywhere since this morning. I haven't had time to rest.

237
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:15,566
I want to sleep early tonight.

238
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,006
Go, my dear. Don't keep her waiting.

239
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:20,446
Okay then,

240
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:23,166
I won't bother you now. Please get some rest.

241
00:16:23,912 --> 00:16:24,966
- I'm off.  - Okay.

242
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:35,366
People who are too kindhearted

243
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:39,246
can sometimes unwittingly hurt others.

244
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:45,406
Is he not coming today?

245
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:13,326
- Nurse?  - Yes?

246
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,806
The patient in room 302 needs help.

247
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:17,286
She needs to use the bathroom.

248
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,566
Okay.

249
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,286
This way, ma'am.

250
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,686
Did you tell her I'm coming?

251
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:09,766
I can't bring myself to tell her.

252
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,406
I don't want her to find out I called you.

253
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:18,966
I think Phim can't be left alone.

254
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:21,566
Why not?

255
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:26,326
Well, she wants to get back together with Kuer.

256
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:31,006
Kuer? Her ex-boyfriend?

257
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:32,286
Yes.

258
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:34,366
Kuer's grandmother came here today.

259
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:36,677
Apparently, she told Phim to leave Kuer alone.

260
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,806
Are you sure that the baby

261
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:42,965
is Phim and Noot's?

262
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:47,646
Okay.

263
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,246
Thank you, dear.

264
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:52,726
I'll stay with Phim tonight. You can go home.

265
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:55,021
Okay.

266
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:57,126
Yes.

267
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:03,926
Mom.

268
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:07,046
How are you?

269
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:09,446
Did Si tell you?

270
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,046
You won't tell me yourself.

271
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:16,086
That's why she needed to call me.

272
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,086
Are you keeping the baby?

273
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,620
Good.

274
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:29,981
At least you're smarter than back then.

275
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:36,806
About your cancer,

276
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:39,406
what did the doctor say?

277
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:47,886
I can only get treatment after I give birth.

278
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:53,006
Is that so?

279
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:00,366
The doctor will wait until the baby reaches a stable stage.

280
00:20:00,717 --> 00:20:02,717
They will perform an early C-section.

281
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:06,006
And then I'll get treated right after.

282
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:16,966
What does Mr. Prawit

283
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:20,046
know about your baby?

284
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,526
He only knows I'm pregnant.

285
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:28,326
Does he know it's Noot's?

286
00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:31,846
He suspects it but can't confirm.

287
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:34,886
He needs to know

288
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,846
that your baby is his great-grandchild.

289
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:26,126
We'll find out if Jangwangprawas will really disown your baby.

290
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:31,246
I don't care if they'll accept my child or not.

291
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:35,246
You're a fool.

292
00:21:36,182 --> 00:21:38,182
You're such a fool, Phim.

293
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:43,126
Do you want to struggle as I did?

294
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:48,086
Do you want to be disappointed over and over and barely stay alive?

295
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:52,606
I love Kuer, Mom.

296
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:57,446
I never wanted to be an in-law of Jangwangprawas.

297
00:21:58,726 --> 00:22:00,126
I've had enough.

298
00:22:00,422 --> 00:22:03,006
I'm done with that unhappy life.

299
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:11,046
Do you know

300
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,646
that nobody loves me in that house?

301
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:20,726
They see me as an enemy.

302
00:22:21,694 --> 00:22:23,926
They look for a chance to add insult to injury

303
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:26,286
whenever I fall.

304
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:35,046
I don't care about them anymore.

305
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:38,686
Think, Phim.

306
00:22:40,182 --> 00:22:42,182
Your emotion is the reason.

307
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:44,646
This is why your life is ruined.

308
00:22:48,846 --> 00:22:51,326
You're an in-law of Jangwangprawas, no matter what.

309
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,766
No matter who you're up against,

310
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:56,686
I'll get you back in there, Phim.

311
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:22,333
Deep-fried seabass with fish sauce and deep-fried shrimp cakes.

312
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:24,174
- Please wait.  - Thank you.

313
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:33,246
How is your grandfather doing?

314
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:35,606
He's recovering.

315
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:39,166
We'll have to wait and see how fast his body heals.

316
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,166
And

317
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:44,999
what about your text this morning?

318
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,806
Do you mean the joint venture project?

319
00:23:49,893 --> 00:23:52,886
I don't want people to think you're bringing it back because of me.

320
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:54,446
Even if I'm not dating you,

321
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:56,486
I'll still proceed with this project.

322
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,566
This is a project JP stands to gain more than lose.

323
00:24:00,726 --> 00:24:03,446
It will probably even double JP's profit.

324
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:06,366
I don't see any cons to this joint venture at all.

325
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,606
I think your family won't be happy about Noot

326
00:24:15,006 --> 00:24:16,326
and Mr. Prawit.

327
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:18,846
Your family probably thinks I'm the reason.

328
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:20,886
That's not the truth.

329
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:41,001
What? Un has the guts to do that?

330
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,846
My father is still alive!

331
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,806
Who does she think she is?

332
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:47,566
She's the acting president. She's the big boss for now.

333
00:24:47,797 --> 00:24:50,446
I'm telling you. Your grandfather made a mistake.

334
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:51,846
Someone like Un

335
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,006
will break before she bends.

336
00:24:54,135 --> 00:24:56,319
She's determined to get what she wants,

337
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:58,726
even if it's the last thing she does.

338
00:25:00,275 --> 00:25:03,582
Rit. Wait, my son! Rit!

339
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:29,406
Are you staying with me tonight?

340
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:33,726
I don't want to see Un.

341
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,166
You still have to see her at work.

342
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:42,526
If she reviews the accounting before the joint venture,

343
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,366
everything will get exposed again.

344
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:47,606
You already altered those documents.

345
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:50,526
It's true I altered them,

346
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,806
but if anyone checks carefully, they'll still find abnormalities.

347
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:00,766
Don't think about it right now.

348
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:06,366
Miss Un might rush into the deal without realizing that.

349
00:26:07,414 --> 00:26:10,166
Let's go. I'll give you a massage.

350
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:37,086
Why did you close it? I haven't saved it yet.

351
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:38,526
If I lose my work...

352
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:41,246
Don't panic. I saved it.

353
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:44,326
Were you waiting for me?

354
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:46,806
Yeah, I was.

355
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,480
We were supposed to have dinner, weren't we?

356
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,863
You're so late. It's nearly breakfast.

357
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,006
I thought I'd be home for dinner.

358
00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:58,006
I got stuck at work for too long.

359
00:26:58,526 --> 00:26:59,886
What work?

360
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:03,926
Someone came to see me about Mr. Noot's case.

361
00:27:04,397 --> 00:27:05,846
Who was it?

362
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:07,406
An assistant.

363
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:11,006
Whose assistant?

364
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:13,646
Mr. Prawit's assistant.

365
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:18,886
Why did Mr. Prawit's assistant come to see you about Mr. Noot?

366
00:27:19,126 --> 00:27:20,646
In this situation,

367
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:23,126
I think she just doesn't want to lose her job.

368
00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:25,606
If Un becomes the chairwoman,

369
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:28,446
she'll take Nam, her assistant, with her.

370
00:27:28,686 --> 00:27:32,286
So Mr. Prawit's assistant will be transferred elsewhere.

371
00:27:33,614 --> 00:27:35,614
What does it have to do with the case?

372
00:27:36,126 --> 00:27:38,646
She saw Mr. Noot and Nam arguing

373
00:27:38,814 --> 00:27:40,486
before Mr. Noot died.

374
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,286
Are you firing me because you want to get rid of me?

375
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,366
If you do that,

376
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:49,038
I'll tell Mrs. Phim.

377
00:27:50,925 --> 00:27:52,925
If one of us doesn't die,

378
00:27:54,598 --> 00:27:56,686
I'll never break up with you.

379
00:28:08,613 --> 00:28:09,646
My goodness!

380
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:12,726
Yeah. I was going to call Un.

381
00:28:13,246 --> 00:28:14,966
Call her now.

382
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:16,766
Shouldn't we eat first?

383
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,707
- This looks so yummy.  - We're not eating now.

384
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,566
I don't want food. I want gossip.

385
00:28:20,718 --> 00:28:21,828
Call her. Now.

386
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,726
- Let me try this.  - No.

387
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,726
Call her before she goes to bed. We'll eat later.

388
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:39,526
Why do you seem quiet tonight?

389
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:44,446
Un.

390
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,606
If your family doesn't accept me

391
00:28:47,838 --> 00:28:49,366
because of everything that's happened,

392
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:51,555
what should I do?

393
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,846
Were you quiet because you were thinking about this?

394
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:01,846
I don't care about that.

395
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,430
My mom is okay. That's all I care about.

396
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:06,607
Can you really do that, Un?

397
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:09,166
You won't care what anyone in your family thinks?

398
00:29:15,614 --> 00:29:16,926
Yes, I can.

399
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,046
What will your aunt and cousin think?

400
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:26,006
It's true that Phim and I are nothing.

401
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:29,006
It's true that I wasn't the reason Noot died.

402
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,726
But the misunderstanding caused your grandfather to fall ill.

403
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,646
In this case, it feels like I was the reason.

404
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,206
I'm all you need to see

405
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:57,806
and care about.

406
00:30:00,726 --> 00:30:03,006
We can't control everyone else.

407
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,710
Let them think about what they want.

408
00:30:06,525 --> 00:30:07,806
One day,

409
00:30:08,221 --> 00:30:09,926
the truth will come out.

410
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,686
Everyone will understand.

411
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:31,046
Should you take that call?

412
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:33,526
It's been ringing a few times now. It's probably urgent.

413
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:36,086
San?

414
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:39,806
Hello, San.

415
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:14,646
Prang said that?

416
00:31:15,877 --> 00:31:16,886
Yes.

417
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:19,366
Why didn't she come out and say this in the first place?

418
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,286
I don't know.

419
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,486
She might have had something to gain.

420
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:26,434
Come on. If the police suspect someone else,

421
00:31:26,537 --> 00:31:27,653
let them suspect.

422
00:31:27,748 --> 00:31:29,366
That way you'll be free.

423
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:33,646
Nam? She's just a little woman. How could she have possibly done it?

424
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:37,326
I don't know that too.

425
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:39,406
I think

426
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,966
once we suspect someone,

427
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:44,341
we should investigate them.

428
00:31:45,606 --> 00:31:48,286
That's right. Among her coworkers,

429
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:50,886
who else is close to Nam?

430
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:52,446
Why?

431
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,406
We will investigate Nam

432
00:31:56,021 --> 00:31:58,206
and the people close to her at once.

433
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:02,726
Nam is dating Rit.

434
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:07,794
She had an affair with Mr. Chanoot

435
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:10,486
when she was Mr. Rit's girlfriend?

436
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:12,004
She's a super idol.

437
00:32:12,118 --> 00:32:13,510
Idol in what?

438
00:32:13,701 --> 00:32:15,326
Idol in promiscuity.

439
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:21,726
By the way, does Rit know Nam cheated on him with his cousin?

440
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:25,726
I'm not sure. I think he doesn't know.

441
00:32:26,222 --> 00:32:28,222
If he does, he'd be fuming.

442
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:31,526
Noot was always more favored than Rit.

443
00:32:32,374 --> 00:32:34,926
If he finds out that Nam cheated on him with Noot,

444
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:36,886
he won't be okay with that.

445
00:32:37,485 --> 00:32:38,886
Is it possible that

446
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:41,406
Rit found out about it?

447
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:47,326
Then he got angry and committed the crime.

448
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:03,246
Rit left his home first.

449
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,726
Noot left a short while later.

450
00:33:05,886 --> 00:33:09,126
He said he went to his apartment. That's his alibi.

451
00:33:09,366 --> 00:33:11,086
Did anyone confirm that?

452
00:33:11,498 --> 00:33:12,606
Yes.

453
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,926
By Noot's secretary,

454
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:16,526
Nam.

455
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:20,046
Maybe Rit's statement

456
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:22,206
was made up to cover up for Nam?

457
00:33:24,357 --> 00:33:26,566
I think I need my investigators

458
00:33:27,358 --> 00:33:29,358
to dig up on Nam.

459
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:05,006
Un, I'll drive you home.

460
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,630
We're not done talking about us.

461
00:34:20,277 --> 00:34:21,846
I feel so guilty.

462
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,726
I went to talk to your grandfather yesterday.

463
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:31,726
I caused problems between you and him

464
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:35,326
just because I want him to understand

465
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:37,957
and allow us to be together.

466
00:34:41,966 --> 00:34:43,126
I feel that

467
00:34:46,037 --> 00:34:47,526
I was selfish.

468
00:34:49,126 --> 00:34:50,886
The problem ends up...

469
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:53,006
It's escalated.

470
00:34:54,406 --> 00:34:57,566
I'm not sure that if

471
00:34:58,957 --> 00:35:01,806
we keep insisting on staying together,

472
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:06,206
will everything be fine or

473
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:09,046
become worse than it already is.

474
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:48,886
Miss Un, should I help you carry anything?

475
00:35:49,038 --> 00:35:50,206
No, thank you.

476
00:35:50,286 --> 00:35:51,289
Okay.

477
00:35:51,377 --> 00:35:53,406
- Nee.  - Yes?

478
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:54,806
Where is Kan?

479
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:58,406
He went to the office with you this morning.

480
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:01,326
- He hasn't come home yet?  - He hasn't.

481
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,446
That's fine.

482
00:36:03,646 --> 00:36:04,966
You can go to bed.

483
00:36:05,158 --> 00:36:06,446
- Okay.  - Thank you.

484
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:34,286
- What do you want?  - We need to talk.

485
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:37,326
You know, don't you?

486
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,710
That I have a crush on Un.

487
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:42,126
It's not hard to tell.

488
00:36:43,022 --> 00:36:44,646
But you should be able to see

489
00:36:45,157 --> 00:36:47,646
that Un and I are dating.

490
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,926
Everybody knows

491
00:36:52,637 --> 00:36:54,637
that you and Un are dating.

492
00:36:56,742 --> 00:36:58,742
If you know, why are you talking to me?

493
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:00,726
It should have been over for you.

494
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:03,686
I'm standing here

495
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:06,486
because I wonder how you feel

496
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:10,686
about yourself after making Un's life so miserable.

497
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:15,486
Even if I don't tell you,

498
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:17,566
you should already know.

499
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:20,766
Her brother is dead.

500
00:37:21,637 --> 00:37:23,526
His case hasn't been closed.

501
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:26,846
Nobody can tell if you were involved or not.

502
00:37:27,957 --> 00:37:29,766
But everybody thinks you played a part.

503
00:37:30,037 --> 00:37:31,366
You're the homewrecker.

504
00:37:33,646 --> 00:37:35,806
JP's chairman is sick now.

505
00:37:37,093 --> 00:37:38,846
I shouldn't need to tell you

506
00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:40,766
that he suffered a stroke

507
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:42,326
because of whom.

508
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,246
Are you done?

509
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:50,886
If you are, just go home.

510
00:37:53,782 --> 00:37:56,166
If you're still putting Un through these things,

511
00:37:57,286 --> 00:37:58,966
I think you should leave her alone.

512
00:37:59,406 --> 00:38:00,766
By the way,

513
00:38:01,486 --> 00:38:03,726
if you're not married to her yet,

514
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:06,829
I think I still have a chance.

515
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:09,966
I hope you understand.

516
00:38:32,806 --> 00:38:36,686
I know it's hard to expect Un to leave Kuer.

517
00:38:38,878 --> 00:38:40,446
I told you a hundred times.

518
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:42,246
I can't help it.

519
00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:44,246
I've fallen for her.

520
00:38:44,486 --> 00:38:46,486
I've waited for her for years.

521
00:38:49,668 --> 00:38:51,286
I want her to be ready.

522
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:53,789
I don't want her to feel

523
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:55,966
rushed to a decision.

524
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,130
Truthfully, you were afraid she wasn't ready.

525
00:39:02,248 --> 00:39:04,166
You thought that's why she's been avoiding you.

526
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:06,484
But now you're just wondering

527
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,526
if Kuer loves Un as much as you do.

528
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:13,606
That's right. How did you figure it out?

529
00:39:16,074 --> 00:39:19,326
You've been saying the same thing since one in the morning. Look now!

530
00:39:19,605 --> 00:39:21,006
The sun is already up.

531
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,246
You're still saying the same thing, the same sentence.

532
00:39:23,383 --> 00:39:26,126
If I can't remember, that means I have Alzheimer's.

533
00:39:26,926 --> 00:39:29,926
Go back to your hotel so that I can go to bed.

534
00:39:37,357 --> 00:39:39,686
I can drive you there if you feel weak.

535
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:43,006
It's my heart that feels weak.

536
00:39:45,277 --> 00:39:46,966
Did you really come from America?

537
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:49,926
Go! Get up!

538
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:52,246
Come on! It's morning already.

539
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:53,726
Come on!

540
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:55,926
My work is not done.

541
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:58,406
And I stayed up all night to listen to you!

542
00:39:58,686 --> 00:40:00,046
If I tell stories as you do,

543
00:40:00,182 --> 00:40:03,486
my show's viewers will criticize me because I tell it all...

544
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,326
Thank you so much for listening to me.

545
00:40:21,196 --> 00:40:23,726
Go to bed. I'll leave now.

546
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:37,606
A hug?

547
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,206
Why did he hug me?

548
00:40:57,597 --> 00:40:59,246
I'm here to talk to Un about the joint venture.

549
00:40:59,477 --> 00:41:01,006
And I'll take her to my grandmother.

550
00:41:01,261 --> 00:41:03,112
After that, I'll see you and San.

551
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:04,964
How dare he shows his face here?

552
00:41:05,084 --> 00:41:07,821
After what happened to Mr. Noot and Mr. Chairman?

553
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:28,086
Hey, is Miss Un still dating that guy?

554
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:31,166
That's right. Why else would he come here, then?

555
00:41:32,077 --> 00:41:33,326
This family is strange.

556
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,246
Are they really okay with this?

557
00:41:35,422 --> 00:41:38,206
I don't know. If I were them, I wouldn't be.

558
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:41,886
Miss Un's brother is dead, and her grandfather is sick because of him.

559
00:41:42,478 --> 00:41:45,526
Maybe that's the way rich people's minds work.

560
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,566
- Yeah.  - Let's just go.

561
00:42:14,446 --> 00:42:15,446
Kuer.

562
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:18,046
Grandmother.

563
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:20,166
Would you like some coffee?

564
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:22,926
I would like something else too.

565
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:25,446
What would you like? I'll make it for you.

566
00:42:25,678 --> 00:42:28,006
I would like to know what's on your mind.

567
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:30,886
You talked to Un last night.

568
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:35,326
I did.

569
00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:38,886
It's spilled.

570
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,566
Here's your coffee, Grandmother.

571
00:42:41,527 --> 00:42:43,246
Let's talk at the table.

572
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:49,966
The table, please.

573
00:42:51,886 --> 00:42:53,166
Here you are.

574
00:42:55,468 --> 00:42:56,966
What happened, Kuer?

575
00:42:57,254 --> 00:42:59,766
I think you're not thinking about Un now.

576
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:01,606
What are you thinking about?

577
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:15,566
Grandmother, I know I love her. I can do anything for her.

578
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:23,246
I believe I can take care of her for the rest of my life.

579
00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:28,046
I just don't know

580
00:43:29,077 --> 00:43:31,406
how everyone else will feel about that.

581
00:43:32,173 --> 00:43:34,406
If Un chooses to be with me,

582
00:43:36,326 --> 00:43:38,526
I'm afraid her image will be bad,

583
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:41,446
especially among her family.

584
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:44,406
Are you thinking like this

585
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:47,846
because of the man who waited for you out front last night?

586
00:43:48,597 --> 00:43:51,046
I saw him waiting there for hours.

587
00:43:51,246 --> 00:43:53,766
He left after talking to you.

588
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:56,326
Why? What did he say?

589
00:43:56,892 --> 00:43:59,486
You don't normally hesitate like this.

590
00:44:00,446 --> 00:44:02,886
Whenever you have a goal, no matter what it is,

591
00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:05,606
I've never seen you back off.

592
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:10,286
If you're still putting Un through these things,

593
00:44:11,428 --> 00:44:13,086
I think you should leave her alone.

594
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,726
By the way,

595
00:44:15,598 --> 00:44:17,598
if you're not married to her yet,

596
00:44:18,933 --> 00:44:20,806
I think I still have a chance.

597
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,526
What will you do?

598
00:44:29,518 --> 00:44:30,686
Grandmother.

599
00:44:33,446 --> 00:44:36,046
I feel bad about what happened to her.

600
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:38,286
I feel guilty

601
00:44:38,534 --> 00:44:40,606
about causing her problems.

602
00:44:41,556 --> 00:44:43,886
I even escalated those problems.

603
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:49,406
I'm not giving up on her easily, Grandmother.

604
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:53,806
If she trusts and believes in me,

605
00:44:54,565 --> 00:44:56,046
if she still loves me,

606
00:44:56,925 --> 00:44:59,646
I'll never let go of her hands.

607
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:12,846
Are you heading out already?

608
00:45:12,966 --> 00:45:15,206
Yeah. I didn't see you when I woke up.

609
00:45:15,365 --> 00:45:16,806
Where have you been?

610
00:45:19,046 --> 00:45:20,246
You couldn't sleep?

611
00:45:21,526 --> 00:45:23,526
Yeah. That's pretty much it.

612
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,726
Are you heading out to work?

613
00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:30,406
Yes, Mom. I want to be early. I have so many things to do.

614
00:45:30,637 --> 00:45:32,326
Eat with me in the kitchen first.

615
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:34,846
I want to talk to you about your grandfather.

616
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:38,726
You go and have breakfast with your mom.

617
00:45:38,894 --> 00:45:40,726
I'll tell Kan to get the car ready.

618
00:45:40,982 --> 00:45:42,486
Okay. Thanks.

619
00:45:49,686 --> 00:45:50,926
Thank you.

620
00:45:56,677 --> 00:45:58,526
I saw Mrs. Kamalas yesterday.

621
00:45:59,486 --> 00:46:00,486
Where?

622
00:46:00,606 --> 00:46:03,726
At the hospital. I don't know who she was visiting.

623
00:46:05,405 --> 00:46:08,686
Kuer told me his grandmother came here. I haven't seen her yet.

624
00:46:09,748 --> 00:46:11,326
What did she say?

625
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:14,646
She asked why I went to the hospital.

626
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,686
I told her your grandfather was sick.

627
00:46:16,878 --> 00:46:19,046
She seemed shocked to find out.

628
00:46:21,094 --> 00:46:24,966
I told her you'd let her know when she could visit him.

629
00:46:29,324 --> 00:46:31,086
You should visit your grandfather today.

630
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:37,846
He's still your grandfather, Un.

631
00:46:38,324 --> 00:46:40,102
Even with your differences,

632
00:46:40,247 --> 00:46:42,166
he's still the elder of the house.

633
00:46:42,365 --> 00:46:44,446
At least you should show good faith.

634
00:46:50,438 --> 00:46:51,606
Keeping quiet?

635
00:46:52,525 --> 00:46:55,166
Do you understand that I need you to visit him?

636
00:46:58,645 --> 00:46:59,806
I do.

637
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,886
I can't find him anywhere. Where is he?

638
00:47:07,606 --> 00:47:09,446
Did he go out shopping?

639
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:13,366
His bike is not here either.

640
00:47:19,195 --> 00:47:21,686
Un hasn't headed out to work yet,

641
00:47:22,046 --> 00:47:23,646
but Kan's bike is not here.

642
00:47:25,252 --> 00:47:28,246
I don't know if she asked Kan to do something.

643
00:47:28,422 --> 00:47:29,846
Whatever you do,

644
00:47:29,942 --> 00:47:31,886
be very careful.

645
00:47:32,077 --> 00:47:36,806
Kan is really suspicious and can't be trusted, as you told me.

646
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:41,126
Good. Okay?

647
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,166
What's wrong, Rit?

648
00:47:47,693 --> 00:47:49,566
My mom said Kan didn't come home.

649
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,246
Nobody knows where he is.

650
00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:55,606
Un might have asked him to do something.

651
00:47:58,957 --> 00:48:02,526
Kan is not here, but your car is. He took his bike.

652
00:48:03,077 --> 00:48:04,526
Since last night?

653
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:09,126
Un!

654
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:12,846
I sat out front from one in the morning until seven.

655
00:48:12,934 --> 00:48:14,366
Nobody came in or out.

656
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:18,046
That means Kan hasn't come home since last night.

657
00:48:18,174 --> 00:48:19,606
But wait.

658
00:48:19,734 --> 00:48:22,806
What were you doing out front all night?

659
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,446
Yeah. Don't ask.

660
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:32,086
Un, try calling him.

661
00:48:32,366 --> 00:48:35,806
Kan is probably with your grandfather at the hospital.

662
00:48:36,453 --> 00:48:37,686
Okay.

663
00:48:44,334 --> 00:48:46,566
His phone is on, but he's not picking it up.

664
00:48:46,684 --> 00:48:48,006
I think he ran away.

665
00:48:49,277 --> 00:48:51,446
We should check our belongings inside.

666
00:48:51,726 --> 00:48:53,726
Something might be missing.

667
00:48:54,357 --> 00:48:58,566
You trusted him so much, and he's gone.

668
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:01,446
He probably stole something from our home.

669
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:04,846
I think I can trust him.

670
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:09,166
The one who can't be trusted might have even more access than he does.

671
00:49:10,638 --> 00:49:12,446
You're talking about a burglary.

672
00:49:12,717 --> 00:49:14,646
If something really was stolen,

673
00:49:15,238 --> 00:49:17,126
no matter who did it,

674
00:49:17,581 --> 00:49:19,166
I'll take care of it for you.

675
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:21,086
What we know for sure is he went missing.

676
00:49:21,606 --> 00:49:24,766
If he isn't doing his job, fire him then.

677
00:49:24,925 --> 00:49:28,086
Find someone else to drive you instead.

678
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:36,006
What happened to your aunt? She woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

679
00:49:40,158 --> 00:49:42,526
Kan is not someone who goes anywhere as he pleases.

680
00:49:44,438 --> 00:49:46,166
I think something is going on.

681
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:12,086
This is obviously fake news.

682
00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:15,166
The mistress is discrediting the wife.

683
00:50:15,606 --> 00:50:17,406
I'm not running this story.

684
00:50:17,606 --> 00:50:19,846
If I run this, I'll end up in jail.

685
00:50:21,847 --> 00:50:24,247
(Phuket's socialite P kicked out of home for having a baby with an ex.)

686
00:50:25,614 --> 00:50:27,966
Phuket's socialite P

687
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:35,126
was kicked out of home for having a baby with an ex

688
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:40,486
whose family owns a nationwide transport business.

689
00:50:43,029 --> 00:50:45,326
San!

690
00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:47,366
San!

691
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:50,646
San!

692
00:50:51,695 --> 00:50:55,726
You don't have to run into my bed this quickly.

693
00:50:55,854 --> 00:51:00,000
You can tell me nicely. I can open up and turn it on...

694
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:02,126
- What's wrong with you?  - Hey!

695
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,086
- Come here. You need to see this.  - What now?

696
00:51:04,206 --> 00:51:06,247
Quick. San, come here.

697
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:07,886
What is it?

698
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:11,246
What? Why? Do you want to do it outdoors?

699
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:13,166
Outdoor, my butt. Come here.

700
00:51:13,284 --> 00:51:14,726
- What?  - Sit.

701
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:17,806
Look and read.

702
00:51:44,022 --> 00:51:45,406
I need to talk to you.

703
00:51:47,806 --> 00:51:48,886
Come in.

704
00:51:57,044 --> 00:51:58,646
Mr. Chairman is in hospital.

705
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,686
It will be a long while before he comes back.

706
00:52:01,834 --> 00:52:02,834
Yes.

707
00:52:04,046 --> 00:52:06,286
I'm assigning you as my assistant.

708
00:52:06,525 --> 00:52:07,886
You're starting today.

709
00:52:36,101 --> 00:52:37,446
Have you eaten?

710
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,166
I have, Mom.

711
00:52:39,903 --> 00:52:44,366
Good. Take care of yourself. Be healthy.

712
00:52:45,077 --> 00:52:48,006
Nothing must happen to you and your child now.

713
00:52:48,534 --> 00:52:50,286
You have a lot to fight for, Phim.

714
00:52:51,286 --> 00:52:52,926
What do I have to fight for, Mom?

715
00:52:53,509 --> 00:52:56,806
You need to get Jangwangprawas' wealth.

716
00:52:57,886 --> 00:52:59,446
The baby in your womb

717
00:53:00,054 --> 00:53:02,966
has to repay me for raising you.

718
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:08,606
What are you doing?

719
00:53:11,046 --> 00:53:13,406
The better question is, "What have I done?"

720
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:22,606
Sa.

721
00:53:23,037 --> 00:53:24,302
Are you running this story?

722
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:25,566
I think so.

723
00:53:25,668 --> 00:53:27,668
But this rumor is about Kuer.

724
00:53:27,926 --> 00:53:29,046
I know.

725
00:53:29,221 --> 00:53:31,606
You know, and you're still running this?

726
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:35,886
This is a chance for Kuer to set it straight. Isn't that right?

727
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:38,126
It's a win-win. My page gets to trend.

728
00:53:38,238 --> 00:53:40,086
Kuer gets to set himself straight.

729
00:53:40,254 --> 00:53:42,446
I'm not asking for your permission.

730
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:44,446
I'm just telling you.

731
00:53:45,118 --> 00:53:47,006
- Sa.  - Yes, honey?

732
00:53:47,198 --> 00:53:51,126
I told my team to make some graphics. I'll post it when they're done.

733
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:54,086
Your old story is still ongoing,

734
00:53:54,286 --> 00:53:56,046
yet you're running a new one.

735
00:54:00,847 --> 00:54:03,726
Why did you tell Sa's page about Kuer and me?

736
00:54:03,902 --> 00:54:05,686
You know it's not true.

737
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:09,526
That's exactly why.

738
00:54:11,246 --> 00:54:13,606
Kuer will have to set the record straight.

739
00:54:14,886 --> 00:54:17,326
Everyone will know your baby is Noot's.

740
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:20,886
No one can doubt you again.

741
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:35,926
So quick. That's my team!

742
00:54:38,077 --> 00:54:40,686
Post it straight away. What would I be waiting for?

743
00:54:41,661 --> 00:54:44,006
I'll wait for the likes.

744
00:54:44,508 --> 00:54:46,926
Sa, I'm off. See you tonight.

745
00:54:48,405 --> 00:54:50,606
- Sa. I need to access your email today.  - Yeah?

746
00:54:50,765 --> 00:54:52,689
Why? Are you checking it?

747
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:57,886
Hey! We've just started dating, and you're checking my email already?

748
00:54:58,149 --> 00:54:59,526
You're not serious about me at all.

749
00:54:59,701 --> 00:55:03,686
Sa. I don't have to check your stuff. I can see it all.

750
00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:08,326
What? That I'm cute, rich, and bouncing with botox?

751
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:10,058
Men do chase me, you know?

752
00:55:10,193 --> 00:55:12,126
You bounced so hard it hit my eye.

753
00:55:13,098 --> 00:55:14,166
You say

754
00:55:14,302 --> 00:55:16,086
just one word, and men are all blown away.

755
00:55:16,245 --> 00:55:17,766
Why? What's wrong with my words?

756
00:55:18,093 --> 00:55:19,166
You

757
00:55:20,782 --> 00:55:22,246
look pretty.

758
00:55:23,006 --> 00:55:25,806
Your face is round like a good cemetery.

759
00:55:25,966 --> 00:55:27,206
That's chemistry!

760
00:55:27,686 --> 00:55:28,926
Why do you need to access my email?

761
00:55:29,078 --> 00:55:32,046
I'll have my IT team check who it was from.

762
00:55:36,949 --> 00:55:40,006
That's right, did your team dig up about Nam?

763
00:55:47,693 --> 00:55:50,206
Are you going to visit your family? You took a day off.

764
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:54,446
Yes. I'll stop by to buy something for my dad and Mek.

765
00:56:00,646 --> 00:56:02,246
Are you still thinking about that?

766
00:56:05,806 --> 00:56:08,166
I told you. You can trust me.

767
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:11,286
Mek will not spill anything.

768
00:56:14,286 --> 00:56:15,726
See you tonight.

769
00:56:20,766 --> 00:56:21,806
Nam.

770
00:56:23,566 --> 00:56:25,206
I never let anyone

771
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,606
stab me in the back.

772
00:56:32,912 --> 00:56:34,246
I know.

773
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:36,446
I don't want that to happen.

774
00:56:37,029 --> 00:56:39,166
He's your family, after all.

775
00:56:48,222 --> 00:56:51,326
How can I let the man I love get in trouble?

776
00:56:55,822 --> 00:56:57,886
Let's go. I'll walk with you.

777
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:16,726
I'm tired,

778
00:58:17,174 --> 00:58:18,846
but I can't sleep.

779
00:58:30,053 --> 00:58:31,966
(Big gossip in Phuket.)

780
00:58:32,086 --> 00:58:36,457
(Socialite P, who recently widowed, was kicked out of home for)

781
00:58:36,566 --> 00:58:39,686
(getting pregnant with an ex who owns a nationwide transport business.)

782
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:51,830
Lieutenant, please find out where this email came from.

783
00:58:51,942 --> 00:58:53,141
Yes, inspector.

784
00:58:57,414 --> 00:58:59,046
What did you find out about Nam?

785
00:58:59,246 --> 00:59:00,326
Here it is.

786
00:59:01,206 --> 00:59:03,286
Our detectives sent these pictures this morning.

787
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,486
They tracked her financial record.

788
00:59:05,598 --> 00:59:07,766
Nam is certainly not just an assistant.

789
00:59:08,142 --> 00:59:10,566
She drives an old Japanese car to work,

790
00:59:11,077 --> 00:59:12,926
yet she can afford this luxury car?

791
00:59:13,102 --> 00:59:15,166
Everything was bought with cash.

792
00:59:15,765 --> 00:59:17,086
With cash?

793
00:59:17,206 --> 00:59:18,366
Yes, sir.

794
00:59:20,574 --> 00:59:23,606
Did Mr. Chanoot pay her when they had an affair?

795
00:59:23,782 --> 00:59:25,206
I don't think so.

796
00:59:25,756 --> 00:59:27,756
I think the money comes from Mr. Rit.

797
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:29,286
Look at this.

798
00:59:29,717 --> 00:59:32,446
I highlighted the amount withdrawn from Mr. Rit's account.

799
00:59:32,598 --> 00:59:34,486
See the amount she used to buy the car

800
00:59:34,598 --> 00:59:37,286
and her apartment. The amount matches.

801
00:59:42,726 --> 00:59:43,926
Thanks a lot.

802
00:59:46,126 --> 00:59:47,166
What's wrong?

803
00:59:47,644 --> 00:59:49,846
I think Mr. Rit is suspicious.

804
00:59:53,134 --> 00:59:54,526
Are you suspecting

805
00:59:54,869 --> 00:59:56,869
Mr. Rit earned that money the wrong way?

806
00:59:58,187 --> 01:00:01,646
They say Mr. Rit is just a regular employee.

807
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:04,766
His high salary is normal for an executive,

808
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:07,846
but it's not that much. He doesn't get a share of the company's profit.

809
01:00:08,093 --> 01:00:10,326
He doesn't own any business.

810
01:00:10,485 --> 01:00:12,686
His only job is with JP.

811
01:00:13,253 --> 01:00:14,938
He lives an expensive lifestyle.

812
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:17,286
And he pays his woman a lot.

813
01:00:18,773 --> 01:00:20,446
That's why I'm here to warn you.

814
01:00:20,582 --> 01:00:23,526
I think you should tell Un to keep an eye on him.

815
01:00:23,901 --> 01:00:24,926
Okay.

816
01:00:25,806 --> 01:00:29,014
You dug up about Nam, and now you need to investigate Rit too?

817
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:31,810
Everyone in the station is probably working on this family's case.

818
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:34,686
I have something to tell you too.

819
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:37,166
I ran this story.

820
01:00:43,934 --> 01:00:45,566
Did you write it, Sa?

821
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:49,686
Who did you get this story from? Who is your source?

822
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,926
From what we tracked,

823
01:00:55,261 --> 01:00:57,646
it was sent from an internet cafe in Phuket.

824
01:00:57,974 --> 01:00:59,646
We still don't know who sent it.

825
01:01:02,646 --> 01:01:04,006
You know it's not me.

826
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,326
It's not.

827
01:01:05,549 --> 01:01:08,573
I ran this story to give you a chance to speak.

828
01:01:08,687 --> 01:01:11,086
Otherwise, there will be false rumors about you.

829
01:01:11,174 --> 01:01:12,926
You will be the public's scapegoat.

830
01:01:13,078 --> 01:01:14,806
You should have a chance to clear yourself.

831
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:17,326
Whoever sent you this, what do they want?

832
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:09,286
Please leave the food on the table.

833
01:02:17,286 --> 01:02:18,726
I have something to ask you.

834
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:24,446
Who are you?

835
01:02:25,452 --> 01:02:28,446
We met at the temple during your husband's funeral.

836
01:02:41,172 --> 01:02:45,366
So do you want to talk to me about this article?

837
01:02:48,404 --> 01:02:50,126
Are you really worried about Un?

838
01:03:03,086 --> 01:03:04,686
Are you really pregnant with Kuer's baby?

839
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:16,086
Why does everyone want to know about my baby?

840
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:21,206
If Kuer is the father of your child,

841
01:03:21,941 --> 01:03:23,966
if you want Kuer back from Un,

842
01:03:24,564 --> 01:03:25,846
just answer my question.

843
01:03:35,591 --> 01:03:36,966
Thank you so much.

844
01:03:41,373 --> 01:03:44,246
The hospital called. They said Father is now out of ICU.

845
01:03:44,676 --> 01:03:47,166
He's coming home in a few days, right?

846
01:03:47,326 --> 01:03:50,166
Yeah. We need to prepare his room.

847
01:03:51,278 --> 01:03:52,686
That's none of your business.

848
01:04:00,493 --> 01:04:01,606
If I didn't do anything,

849
01:04:01,772 --> 01:04:04,166
Father would have been like a homeless patient.

850
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,646
Her own daughter never showed up to visit him.

851
01:04:07,782 --> 01:04:09,526
Don't you dare talk to me like that!

852
01:04:10,493 --> 01:04:12,286
Father was in ICU.

853
01:04:12,478 --> 01:04:13,846
He had visiting hours.

854
01:04:14,054 --> 01:04:16,166
Why would you want me to sit there all the time?

855
01:04:16,878 --> 01:04:18,406
I may not have been there,

856
01:04:18,806 --> 01:04:22,526
but what about your good daughter? Has she visited him even once?

857
01:04:24,085 --> 01:04:26,886
She's the reason Father fell ill.

858
01:04:27,205 --> 01:04:28,806
She doesn't even feel remorse.

859
01:04:53,581 --> 01:04:54,726
Mek.

860
01:04:55,013 --> 01:04:56,406
Whose wrecked car is that?

861
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,790
I don't know.

862
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:00,646
Dad brought it home last night. He's probably fixing and scavenging it.

863
01:05:02,886 --> 01:05:06,046
Dad, I bought you something.

864
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,415
Are you not working today?

865
01:05:09,496 --> 01:05:10,543
I took a day off.

866
01:05:10,647 --> 01:05:13,806
I haven't seen you for a while. I want to buy some things for you.

867
01:05:13,934 --> 01:05:15,644
You bought a lot.

868
01:05:15,766 --> 01:05:17,686
They're your favorites, Dad.

869
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:22,326
Did you truly miss Dad, or do you want something?

870
01:05:23,165 --> 01:05:26,006
You never show up for nothing.

871
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:27,326
Mek!

872
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:30,446
Is there anything wrong, dear?

873
01:05:38,182 --> 01:05:39,206
Kuer.

874
01:05:41,925 --> 01:05:44,446
Why are you waiting here? Why didn't you go upstairs?

875
01:05:45,277 --> 01:05:46,846
I want to talk to you.

876
01:05:47,533 --> 01:05:50,286
I don't want to bother you. I know you're working.

877
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:52,486
Also,

878
01:05:53,038 --> 01:05:54,566
the thing I want to talk about

879
01:05:55,006 --> 01:05:56,286
shouldn't be said at work.

880
01:05:56,981 --> 01:05:58,246
What is it?

881
01:06:02,366 --> 01:06:05,166
About the article saying you're the homewrecker? That doesn't bother me.

882
01:06:06,366 --> 01:06:07,886
About Rit,

883
01:06:08,446 --> 01:06:10,286
I'm suspecting him myself.

884
01:06:10,527 --> 01:06:12,527
Are you suspecting him too?

885
01:06:13,298 --> 01:06:14,298
Yes.

886
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,246
Why are you suspecting him?

887
01:06:16,494 --> 01:06:19,686
Gade saw Rit entering Noot's room

888
01:06:20,622 --> 01:06:22,446
the night after he died.

889
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,886
He was the only one who reviewed our accounting with Noot.

890
01:06:26,726 --> 01:06:28,686
Since I took the position here,

891
01:06:28,933 --> 01:06:31,406
Rit has never said anything about accounting.

892
01:06:32,846 --> 01:06:34,566
His reaction

893
01:06:34,734 --> 01:06:37,166
to finding out I was the acting president

894
01:06:38,149 --> 01:06:39,566
didn't seem okay.

895
01:06:41,149 --> 01:06:44,486
I think he has something in his mind and is not saying it.

896
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:48,806
Or he's doing something he doesn't want anyone to find out.

897
01:06:52,118 --> 01:06:53,486
If that's the case,

898
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:56,966
we must review the accounting before the joint venture.

899
01:06:58,006 --> 01:07:00,166
We might catch him with something.

900
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:06,326
You can never talk about that with anyone.

901
01:07:07,158 --> 01:07:10,126
You haven't told me what you did that day.

902
01:07:12,413 --> 01:07:15,206
I have an idea even if you don't tell me.

903
01:07:16,078 --> 01:07:17,486
I'm just wondering

904
01:07:17,718 --> 01:07:20,486
how you're involved with that man on the boat.

905
01:07:28,229 --> 01:07:29,766
The guy who died

906
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:33,246
was my boss.

907
01:07:34,101 --> 01:07:35,366
I didn't mean him.

908
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,166
You already said that to him.

909
01:07:42,445 --> 01:07:44,606
Why are you still letting him be with Un?

910
01:07:47,526 --> 01:07:49,926
Do you think I didn't try to tell him?

911
01:07:52,126 --> 01:07:53,726
He's probably tired of old stuff.

912
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:56,526
Maybe he was just

913
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,166
fooling around with no strings attached.

914
01:08:03,053 --> 01:08:07,366
It was my fault too. I had a husband, and yet

915
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:11,168
I got involved with an ex.

916
01:08:11,397 --> 01:08:14,166
Noot and I were having problems back then.

917
01:08:14,526 --> 01:08:15,846
So you...

918
01:08:21,126 --> 01:08:22,446
I got pregnant.

919
01:08:24,932 --> 01:08:26,806
And he won't accept it?

920
01:08:36,733 --> 01:08:39,886
I'm sending Phim back to Jangwangprawas

921
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:41,926
as a daughter-in-law

922
01:08:42,109 --> 01:08:44,686
and mother of JP's only heir.

923
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:48,030
- What do you want?  - Un asked me to bring this to you.

924
01:08:48,213 --> 01:08:49,406
Why would she ask you to?

925
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:51,246
I don't know. She probably trusts me.

926
01:08:51,518 --> 01:08:53,046
We have a guest in the house,

927
01:08:53,166 --> 01:08:54,886
but she's more like a leech.

928
01:08:54,982 --> 01:08:57,266
Are you calling me a leech?

929
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,966
Are you? If you are, then yes.

930
01:09:05,292 --> 01:09:06,387
Un!
