(Raw audio)

7
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:40,677
I wanted to portray the two aspects,

and a fan...

Mr. J.

11
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:51,347
Hey, Ji Young. What did you want to talk about?

12
00:00:54,357 --> 00:00:57,457
There's something I want to ask you.

13
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:18,547
I keep getting confused.

14
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:22,216
That's why I want to make...

15
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:23,847
our relationship clear.

16
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:26,487
"Our relationship?"

(Timecode)

18
00:01:58,487 --> 00:01:59,657
Hey, Yeol. Where are you going?

19
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,267
Bani.

20
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:12,427
Wait.

21
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:29,647
All done.

22
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,917
Thank you.

23
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,937
Ban Hee Jin.

24
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:57,347
Let's get you home.

25
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,767
- Jae Yeol.
- Let's get you home.

26
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:35,217
Let go of me!

27
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:39,017
Let go of me, will you?

28
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,217
Do you like him?

29
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,457
What?

30
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:46,397
Don't like...

31
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:48,027
that jerk.

32
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:53,467
- Why not?
- I told you he was a scum.

33
00:03:53,937 --> 00:03:55,237
Are you blind when it comes to people?

34
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:01,437
But what does that have anything to do with you?

35
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:03,207
What you're doing right now...

36
00:04:03,447 --> 00:04:04,947
is crossing the line.

37
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:07,377
Only you will get hurt by dating someone like him.

38
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:11,147
Think, will you? To put it bluntly,

39
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,917
why would he like you?

40
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:14,887
Do you want to be fooled again?

41
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:18,487
Have you not learned your lesson from the last time you got tricked?

42
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:21,527
What did you say?

43
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,397
Who I date and whether I get fooled or not.

44
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:32,107
You have no right to butt in or get in the way.

45
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:36,047
So please.

46
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,047
Mind your own business.

47
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:17,717
Is that coffee too?

48
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:20,356
I can't drink coffee, so this is Solomon's seal tea.

49
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:21,417
What?

50
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:23,987
You're like an old man.

51
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:33,697
Actually,

52
00:05:34,097 --> 00:05:36,407
Mr. J invited me separately to his studio tomorrow.

53
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:38,707
I wonder how things are going.

54
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:00,457
Mr. J?

55

Bani.

56
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:16,947
I thought you would've left.

57
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:20,017
I waited for you.

58
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:26,117
What was up with that guy earlier?

59
00:06:26,657 --> 00:06:27,757
Oh, him?

60
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:30,227
There was a misunderstanding.

61
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,957
It's no biggie. Don't worry about it.

62
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:34,597
I see.

63
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:37,597
You're okay, right?

64
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:39,867
Yes.

65
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:48,507
To put it bluntly, why would he like you?

66
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:50,207
Do you want to be fooled again?

67

Mr. J.

68
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:05,587
Yes?

69
00:07:08,857 --> 00:07:09,997
What...

70
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:13,867
kind of relationship do we have?

71
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:17,367
Us?

72
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:21,737
What do you think we are?

73
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,117
I don't invite just anyone to my studio.

74
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:35,887
Nor do I come to the park with just anyone.

Do you want to be fooled again?

78
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:07,116
Have you not learned your lesson...

79
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:08,617
from the last time you got tricked?

80
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:11,787
What did you say?

81
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:14,957
Did I go too far?

82
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:55,197
What are you doing here?

83
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:06,477
Did you...

84
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,717
get home safely last night?

85
00:09:12,347 --> 00:09:13,557
Why do you care?

86
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:16,327
I don't have anything to say to you.

87
00:09:28,597 --> 00:09:29,667
Let's talk.

88
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:32,907
Me?

89
00:09:42,777 --> 00:09:43,987
I'll call you Ji Won.

After all, we've met before.

91
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,787
I don't know what we could possibly talk about.

92
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:53,927
It's about Ban Hee Jin.

93
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:58,997
Ban Hee Jin and Jo Ah Lang.

94
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,407
We can't leave the two meet.

95
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,337
What do you mean by that?

96
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:15,417
There's something I want to ask you.

97
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:18,247

That's why I want to make our relationship clear.

"Our relationship?"

100
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:30,067
Since I was with you at your place...

101
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:32,927
all night long that day,

102
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,137
that makes us a couple, right?

103
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:42,177
How is that important?

104
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:45,207
I don't invite...

105
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:48,117
just anyone to my place, you know?

106
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:56,956
That jerk is crazy about girls.

107
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,627
Did you play that to Bani as well?

108
00:10:58,927 --> 00:10:59,997
No way.

109
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,767
I simply told her not to meet with him.

110
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,337
But she never listens to me.

111
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:11,567
Won't she listen to you if you stop her?

112
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:18,847
I'm guessing you're the nosy type.

113
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,047
You and Bani...

114
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,447
aren't that close, are you?

115
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:28,957
I'm being a decent human being, not being nosy.

116
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:31,427
I can't just ignore injustice.

117
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,667
I'm leaving now that I've fulfilled my duty.

118
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,637
Right. It's her problem to deal with.

119
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,567
Whatever. I've done more than enough.

00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:01,117
Okay. I'm on my way.

123
00:12:04,227 --> 00:12:06,897
Ji Won. I need to make a short trip to the Creative Room.

124
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:08,597
Go ahead.

125
00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:22,277
Sir. I need you to look into something urgently.

126
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,477
I wanted to portray the two aspects,

127
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:31,587
and a fan noticed it.

128
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,587
That was the most memorable moment.

129
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:38,326
As expected of Hwang Jae Yeol.

130
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:40,557
Did you finish editing this in that short period?

131
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:42,857
Great work.

132
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:48,297
Pass on to Ban Hee Jin to tell me if there are any changes to make.

133
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:50,537
You can tell her directly, can't you?

134
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,967
She doesn't want to talk to me.

135
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,447
Bani. Do you have any feedback?

136
00:12:57,447 --> 00:13:00,246
Please tell him to adjust the brightness,

137
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,847
as Mr. J looks darker than in person.

138
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:05,587
She wants you to adjust the brightness.

139
00:13:07,717 --> 00:13:09,686
Tell her it's impossible since his face...

140
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:11,087
is originally dull.

141
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:13,427
He says it's impossible.

142
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:15,996
Tell him to use the left angle more,

143
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:18,567
as Mr. J's left side of the face is more attractive.

144
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:23,136
She wants you to use a variety of angles.

145
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,666
Tell her to keep...

146
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:26,677
her private and public life separate.

147
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,406
And to be better at judging character while at it.

148
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:31,407
You heard him, right?

149
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:34,547
Please tell him to stay out of my business.

150
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:36,947
You two are loud enough.

151
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,447
And what am I? A parrot?

152
00:13:39,747 --> 00:13:40,957
A voice mail?

153
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,027
You two can talk to each other directly.

154
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:45,627
Seriously.

155
00:13:48,357 --> 00:13:49,357
What?

156
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,527
Whatever.

157
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,067

Where?

164

Mr. J!

165
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:27,967
What brought you here?

166
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:30,937
I remembered you said you lived around here.

167
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:33,837
Did you have some business nearby?

168
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:36,337
No. I came to see you.

169

My exhibition ends this week.

170
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,417
I'll be busy wrapping it up starting tomorrow.

171
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:45,847
I dropped by when I had the time today.

172
00:14:48,217 --> 00:14:49,787
Was it a bad idea to come out of the blue?

173
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:51,987
No.

174
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:53,596
Since you're already here,

175
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:55,457
there's a must-visit coffee shop around here.

176
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,197
Do you want to go together?

177
00:14:59,427 --> 00:15:00,496
I'm in.

178
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:02,097
I was actually in need of some coffee.

179
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,367
- Let's go.
- Okay.

180
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:23,527
Are you okay?

181
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:27,057
Yes. I'm fine.

182
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:44,377
Let's go.

183
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:58,727
Does that mean you two are dating?

184
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,197
He hasn't asked me out yet.

185
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:04,197
Nobody starts dating like that these days.

186
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:07,896
Interlocking your fingers says it all.

187
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:09,837
But you weren't in touch for three days?

188
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,267
- No.
- That seems wrong, no?

189
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:14,636
Putting aside the fact that he's a hotshot sculptor,

190
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:16,777
the exhibition must keep him really busy.

191
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:19,306
And he came to tell her...

192
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:21,216
that he might not be able to get in touch much in advance.

193
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:22,516
How sweet is that?

194
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:23,887
Yes. You're right.

195
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:26,517
That's why I haven't contacted him on purpose.

196
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,687
I'm going to contact him when the exhibition ends tomorrow.

197
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:31,726
- Is tomorrow the last day?
- Yes.

198
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:32,857
Then...

199
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:34,496
don't you have to buy some flowers at least?

200
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:36,796
- Get some flowers.
- No. He'll be very busy.

201
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,226
If you go, he'll have to take care of you,

202
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:39,667
which is inconvenient.

203
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:41,567
Don't go unless he asks you.

204
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,136
No. He probably didn't tell her...

205
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:44,567
because he didn't want her to feel pressured.

206
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:49,307
It's not any other day. It's the last day of his exhibition.

207
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,577
Won't he be disappointed if you don't go?

208
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:19,537
He is crazy indeed.

209
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:56,237
He's seeing...

210
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:57,877
more than ten girls.

211
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:00,747
Using his status as a sculptor, he's dating college students.

212
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:04,117
He's a lot worse than I thought.

213
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,927
I guess you're rich indeed.

214
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:13,756
How do you find out stuff like this?

215
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:15,027
Do you hack their phones...

216
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,727
and find out their private social media accounts?

217
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:18,297
I don't know.

218
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,137
I don't do it myself.

219
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:26,777
Have you talked with Hee Jin?

220
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:31,347
If I tell her without firm evidence, it'll only make her worry.

221
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:32,977
So I didn't tell her yet.

222
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,277
I found concrete evidence,

223
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,617
so I'm going to tell her now.

224
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,647
Are you going to say everything, including this?

225
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,186
I think it's better to know and be angry...

226
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:45,927
than to be ignorant and look foolish.

227
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:51,297
(Senior Partner Bani)

228
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:56,537
(Ji Won)

229
00:18:57,467 --> 00:18:58,736
- Bani.
- Yes.

230
00:18:58,737 --> 00:18:59,737
Where are you?

231
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,636
I'm on my way to Mr. J's exhibition.

232
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:02,677
Now?

233
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:04,707
Okay. Bye.

234
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,277
She's on her way to his exhibition.

235
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:09,977
What?

236
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,257
- Are you not going to get on?
- This?

237
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:21,227
I've never gotten on something like this.

238
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,427
I'll get going first then.

239
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:25,167
Gosh. Hold on.

240
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:26,767
Move over.

241
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,537
Wear the helmet.

242
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:33,677
Hold tight.

243
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:38,747
Hey, that's my Sparkle!

244
00:19:40,217 --> 00:19:41,447
Be gentle with it!

245
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:50,587
Please look here.

246
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:52,227
Please look here.

247
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:57,567
Thank you for coming.

248
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,027
Shall we go inside now?

249
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:11,947
Thank you.

250
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,627
What's wrong with the ride quality of this?

251
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,527
Do you have a license?

252
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:33,697
Hey, do you have insurance?

253
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:35,997
Hold tight.

254
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:10,607
You're welcome.

255
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,637
I enjoyed your exhibition.

256
00:21:14,277 --> 00:21:15,937
- Oh, my gosh.
- It's him.

257
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:18,107
Hurry up.

258
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:54,517
Gosh.

259
00:21:56,077 --> 00:21:58,317
I should give him flowers before I go.

260
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:29,977
You didn't have to come.

261
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,287
I came because I wanted to see you.

262
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:38,587
I couldn't keep in touch with you during the exhibition.

263
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,827
We were supposed to meet tonight anyway.

264
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:48,237
I just wanted to give you this before leaving.

265
00:23:39,787 --> 00:23:41,086
When did you come?

266
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,157
You should've called me when you came.

267
00:23:45,027 --> 00:23:46,087
Let's go.

268
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:48,726
What did I just see?

269
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,827
You don't have to look.

270
00:23:50,257 --> 00:23:52,267
Yes, Bani. Let's go.

271
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,567
Give me a moment.

272
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:06,607
Can you explain...

273
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,077
this situation?

274
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:12,247
What situation?

275
00:24:13,247 --> 00:24:15,917
The situation that is happening now.

276
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:22,857
Oh, yes.

277
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:25,327
I guess you saw it.

278
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,867
But why do I have to explain it?

279
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:33,637
I don't think there's any reason for me to explain my private life.

280
00:24:35,677 --> 00:24:36,737
Am I wrong?

281
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,247
It's not like we're dating.

282
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:42,947
Whoever I meet and whatever I do,

283
00:24:45,187 --> 00:24:46,447
that's my business.

284
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,287
Does Ji Young know...

285
00:24:53,257 --> 00:24:54,657
what kind of person you are?

286
00:25:02,137 --> 00:25:03,137
I don't know.

287
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:05,767
What kind of person am I?

288
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:08,437
Bani.

289
00:25:10,037 --> 00:25:11,907
I think what you're doing is actually inappropriate.

290
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:15,046
You came to an exhibition you weren't invited to.

291
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,477
And you're blaming me as if I did something wrong.

292
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:19,347
Don't you think you're being rude?

293
00:25:28,297 --> 00:25:29,557
If you want to say anything, let's talk later.

294
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:32,327
Today is important to me.

295
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:39,467
That jerk.

296
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:44,807
Bani.

297
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,377
What is all this about?

298
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,136
Congratulations, Mr. J.

299
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:11,407
I love your work.

300
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:14,207
Hey!

301
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:18,307
I'm not done talking yet.

302
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:26,287
But I don't think a person like you...

303
00:26:27,147 --> 00:26:28,887
would understand what I say.

304
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:34,857
So this would be better.

305
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:48,777
Hey!

306
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,447
- Are you crazy?
- Did that wake you up?

307
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:55,247
You kept saying nonsense.

308
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,647
And you almost got me.

309
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:00,317
But no matter how much I think about it,

310
00:27:01,157 --> 00:27:02,787
it's not normal to kiss another woman...

311
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:05,487
after doing what you did to me.

312
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:11,227
What are you doing?

313
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,866
You can't ruin my exhibition while there are guests.

314
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,197
That's why I'm going to leave now.

315
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:20,737
Unlike you, I have common sense.

316
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,607
But let me say one thing before I go.

317
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:31,347
You!

318
00:27:36,017 --> 00:27:38,027
Become a decent human being before an artist.

319
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,197
Hey!

320
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:52,306
What are you?

321
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:54,277
Stop before embarrassing yourself even more.

322
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:55,907
Are you okay, Mr. J?

323
00:27:56,137 --> 00:27:57,647
"Destiny," my foot.

324
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:01,547
What are you doing?

325
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:02,917
Let's talk.

326
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,327
You always make me take off my clothes.

327
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:51,317
Are you done crying?

328
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:54,217
Yes.

329
00:30:58,527 --> 00:30:59,587
Let's go then.

330
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:09,397
My tears might be on the jacket.

331
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:11,837
I'll wash it for you.

332
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:13,837
Never mind.

333
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:23,317
So you knew everything, right?

334
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:27,887
That's why you tried to stop me.

335
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,527
I guess I'm really a pushover when it comes to a relationship.

336
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:41,067
Even after what I had gone through, I got fooled again.

337
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:48,377
I'm so pathetic.

338
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:49,977
You're not pathetic.

339
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,017
He's the bad one.

340
00:32:03,457 --> 00:32:04,487
Bani.

341
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:06,727
Let me take you home.

342
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:19,267
Bye.

343
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:21,907
Bye.

344
00:32:38,387 --> 00:32:39,387
Bani.

345
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:42,127
Are you okay?

346
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:45,927
I was a mess earlier, right?

347
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:47,367
No.

348
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:49,137
You were so cool.

349
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:53,307
No. I ended up crying anyway.

350
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:55,977
But you didn't cry in front of him.

351
00:32:57,107 --> 00:33:00,677
You looked your best.

352
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:05,047
Hold on.

353
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:08,357
- If you laugh after crying...
- Come on!

354
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,297
All right.

355
00:33:17,527 --> 00:33:19,827
Wait. What...

356
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:21,567
I told you to be gentle.

357
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:25,107
How did Sparkle end up this way?

358
00:33:28,037 --> 00:33:29,107
It's this place.

359
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:37,647
Come on. I'll pay for the repairs.

360
00:33:38,887 --> 00:33:41,257
It needed some fixing anyway,

361
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:43,387
so it's not all too bad.

362
00:33:44,727 --> 00:33:45,827
Forget it.

363
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,586
What makes Sparkle special...

364
00:33:47,587 --> 00:33:49,197
is her no-accident, no-repair insignia.

365
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,197
Give me that.

366
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:56,267
So tell me. What was this about?

367
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:58,707
You left in a hurry. Was everything sorted out?

368
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:05,447
Unbelievable.

369
00:34:08,477 --> 00:34:10,676
(Did you get home...)

370
00:34:10,677 --> 00:34:13,517

00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:41,847
Why were you acting like a stranger to her?

556
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:44,947
It takes me at least a month to open up to people.

557
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:47,447
What? Why wasn't that the case with me?

558
00:44:48,957 --> 00:44:49,987
Beats me.

559
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:51,887
I wonder why I found you comfortable right away.

560
00:44:53,787 --> 00:44:56,197
Of course. I'm that sociable.

561
00:44:56,557 --> 00:44:58,527
I get it from my dad.

562
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:00,366
He befriends at least two people...

563
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,267
whenever he takes out the trash.

564
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:04,237
That's who I take after.

565
00:45:37,597 --> 00:45:39,237
(Ban Hee-nuisance I Can't Stand)

566
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,376
Are you all right?

567
00:45:44,377 --> 00:45:48,077
(Are you all right?)

568
00:45:50,477 --> 00:45:51,987

569
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,447
(Anti-clockwise, High angle)

570
00:46:56,777 --> 00:46:58,647
I knew it.

571
00:46:59,887 --> 00:47:01,747
He stayed up three whole nights finishing the shot list.

572
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:03,657
What for?

573
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,287
Our work for the contest.

574
00:47:07,387 --> 00:47:08,756
You have to hand it to him.

575
00:47:08,757 --> 00:47:10,527
He never cuts any corners.

576
00:47:35,557 --> 00:47:37,386
(Student Council Room)

577
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,126
All right. Good job, everyone.

578
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:40,786
- Good job.
- Good job.

579
00:47:40,787 --> 00:47:41,956
- Good job.
- Good work, guys.

580
00:47:41,957 --> 00:47:44,196
- See you.
- Good job.

581
00:47:44,197 --> 00:47:45,267
- Bye.
- See you.

582
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:49,366
The banner is all I have to get, right?

583
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,667
Yes, that's all we ask.

584
00:47:50,897 --> 00:47:52,607
I have a class to get to. See you later at the studio.

585
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,167
I'll see you.

586
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:58,137
I thought you'd be weeping in sorrow,

587
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,407
but that's not the case.

588
00:48:01,947 --> 00:48:03,217
Why would I cry?

589
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,247
You said they were the nasty ones.

590
00:48:06,647 --> 00:48:07,717
Then it's all good.

591
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:12,827
Thank you...

592
00:48:14,927 --> 00:48:15,927
for that day.

593
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,036
I have a class right away...

594
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:27,267
and should get going.

595
00:48:28,577 --> 00:48:29,677
See you!

596
00:48:35,617 --> 00:48:38,747
Is she all right or putting on a brave face?

597
00:48:55,797 --> 00:48:57,867
(Bani)

598
00:49:01,807 --> 00:49:04,237
Bani, what do you say to the cafeteria special tomorrow?

599
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:14,347
(Bani)

600
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:23,856
We borrowed all the equipment we need.

601
00:49:23,857 --> 00:49:25,727
- What about the shot list?
- I have to stay up all night again.

602
00:49:26,027 --> 00:49:28,226
Filming starts tomorrow anyway, so don't try to make it perfect.

603
00:49:28,227 --> 00:49:29,837
We should give it our best while we're at it.

604
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:32,867
Make sure Choon Shik and Ho Dong are aware of the timetable.

605
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:34,937
All right. I'll get going.

606
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,377
- What now?
- It's to wish us luck.

607
00:49:39,207 --> 00:49:40,247
Unbelievable.

608
00:49:42,977 --> 00:49:44,617
- I'm really leaving now. Bye.
- Okay.

609
00:50:22,017 --> 00:50:23,157
Thank you...

610
00:50:24,787 --> 00:50:25,927
for that day.

611
00:50:31,097 --> 00:50:34,126
I have a class right away...

612
00:50:34,127 --> 00:50:35,297
and should get going.

613
00:50:36,597 --> 00:50:37,637
See you!

614
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,486
(Wide high angle: Film with a drone)

615
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:00,787
(Zoom in: Heads facing up)

616
00:51:01,787 --> 00:51:03,327
Why am I suddenly so full of energy?

617
00:51:19,207 --> 00:51:21,107
All right. Let's do this.

618
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:36,257
The special meal today was tasty as always.

619
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:38,426
I knew it.

620
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:40,767
Being introduced to flavour enhancers late in life can get you hooked.

621
00:51:42,737 --> 00:51:45,367
Hold on. Are they filming something?

622
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:47,267
Maybe, they are. What's going on?

623
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:53,176
(Wide high angle: Film with a drone)

624
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:54,877
Well, for the next take,

625
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:57,776
we'll use the dolly to move the camera side to side.

626
00:51:57,777 --> 00:51:59,586
Just keep up the good work.

627
00:51:59,587 --> 00:52:01,746
I heard that Yeol was preparing to enter a contest.

628
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:03,517
- I guess this is it.
- I see.

629
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:05,727
- Shall we try it?
- Okay.

630
00:52:06,587 --> 00:52:09,297
- Let's roll, Dong Ha.
- All right, let's do this.

631
00:52:10,897 --> 00:52:12,327
All right. Rolling.

632
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,937
One. Ready.

633
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,097
- Action.
- Action.

634
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:47,997
Cut. Okay.

635
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:49,936
- Okay. That was great.
- Okay.

636
00:52:49,937 --> 00:52:52,066
Hey, what's going on? Are they idol stars? Awesome.

637
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:54,437
- Give me the storyboard.
- Hey, stop pushing.

638
00:52:54,507 --> 00:52:55,536
- Stop pushing.
- Are they filming something?

639
00:52:55,537 --> 00:52:58,136
We'll change the lens and do a tight shot for the next one.

640
00:52:58,137 --> 00:52:59,706
- Keep performing like that.
- Gosh.

641
00:52:59,707 --> 00:53:01,476
- Bani, let's go.
- Shall we?

642
00:53:01,477 --> 00:53:02,547
- Yes.
- Okay.

643
00:53:03,017 --> 00:53:04,377
Excuse us. Let us pass through.

644
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:05,747
Gosh, stop pushing.

645
00:53:07,287 --> 00:53:08,587
Excuse us.

646
00:53:11,257 --> 00:53:14,257
- Stop pushing.
- Come on. What's wrong with them?

647
00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:23,037
Yeol, shouldn't we start?

648
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,537
Right. Let's do it.

649
00:53:26,707 --> 00:53:28,767
- Let's roll again.
- Please quiet down.

650
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:31,837
By the way, Yeol...

651
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:34,147
turned out to be more impressive than I thought.

652
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:37,247
He seemed a bit professional at the shoot.

653
00:53:39,117 --> 00:53:40,787
What a surprise. You're actually complimenting him.

654
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:44,087
Well,

655
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:48,257
I've been thinking, and he's not so bad.

656
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:50,827
Things could be a lot better if he wasn't so rude when he talked.

657
00:53:51,757 --> 00:53:52,767
Right?

658
00:53:54,797 --> 00:53:55,797
Yes.

659
00:53:58,137 --> 00:53:59,267
What about you, then?

660
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,067
Was this only out of concern for her?

661
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:04,777
Or perhaps you like her.

662
00:54:10,517 --> 00:54:11,577
Good work.

663
00:54:11,717 --> 00:54:13,347
- Good work.
- Good work.

664
00:54:14,617 --> 00:54:16,586
- Good work.
- Good work.

665
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:17,957
- All right. Great job.
- Good work.

666
00:54:20,687 --> 00:54:22,756
Yeol, when I saw your storyboard,

667
00:54:22,757 --> 00:54:24,657
I got this feeling...

668
00:54:25,157 --> 00:54:28,397
that you would win the Grand Award at the contest again.

669
00:54:29,137 --> 00:54:30,266
You bet.

670
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,967
You always ask me to pay for the drinks indirectly.

671
00:54:34,407 --> 00:54:36,376
So you're not going to?

672
00:54:36,377 --> 00:54:38,137
- You're not going to?
- You're not going to?

673
00:54:40,947 --> 00:54:42,077
Fine, it's my treat.

674
00:54:43,717 --> 00:54:46,146
I know everyone worked hard today. Eat a lot.

675
00:54:46,147 --> 00:54:47,616
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food then.

676
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,657
- Call us when you need help again.
- Thank you.

677
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:51,557
Eat a lot.

678
00:55:10,677 --> 00:55:13,346
Is it okay to order some sea eels?

679
00:55:13,347 --> 00:55:15,877
Of course! Ma'am, give us all the sea eels you've got!

680
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:17,877
Over here.

681
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:21,517
Do you like sea eels?

682
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:24,417
Is that why you dance like a sea eel?

683
00:55:24,557 --> 00:55:25,887
Can you show it to us?

684
00:55:38,337 --> 00:55:40,566
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

685
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:41,867
I'm here to pick up the banner for the student council.

686
00:55:42,307 --> 00:55:45,637
- I see. Here you go. Sure.
- Thank you.

687
00:55:47,947 --> 00:55:49,476
(I picked up...)

688
00:55:49,477 --> 00:55:51,147
I picked up the banner.

689
00:55:51,617 --> 00:55:52,846
- Are you all right?
- Where are you going?

690
00:55:52,847 --> 00:55:54,317
I'm fine.

691
00:55:59,287 --> 00:56:01,857

695
00:56:43,037 --> 00:56:44,097
What am I going to say?

696
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:50,707
No?

697
00:56:54,047 --> 00:56:55,507
Do I need a reason to call her?

698
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:00,447
I can just call her to ask what she's doing.

699
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:07,027
Gosh, but still. I shouldn't call her.

700
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:19,207

("The Ultimate Male Divinity" by Ban Hee Jin aka Bani)

735
01:02:49,637 --> 01:02:50,937
It was the same Bani.

736
01:02:56,907 --> 01:02:58,037
Are you all right?

737
01:02:58,777 --> 01:03:00,047
I hope you weren't hurt.

738
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:03,217
What a relief.

739
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:23,737
Hey, Ban Hee Jin.

740
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:27,407
You.

741
01:03:29,537 --> 01:03:31,177
Stop occupying my head space.

742
01:03:33,947 --> 01:03:35,647
What is the problem this time?

743
01:03:38,677 --> 01:03:39,717
I...

744
01:03:44,217 --> 01:03:45,217
I think...

745
01:03:50,557 --> 01:03:51,857
I'm broken.

746
01:03:57,997 --> 01:03:59,037
I think...

747
01:04:03,907 --> 01:04:05,307
I like you.

748
01:05:44,577 --> 01:05:47,477
(Crushology 101)

749
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:48,977
Is he...

750
01:05:49,777 --> 01:05:51,016
really flirting with me?

751
01:05:51,017 --> 01:05:52,017
Me?

752
01:05:52,018 --> 01:05:53,317
When you call him, you sound friendly.

753
01:05:54,247 --> 01:05:55,547
But how come you sound cold when you call me?

754
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:58,687
If you're toying with her, you'd better stop now.

755
01:05:58,817 --> 01:05:59,987
I'm not toying with her.

756
01:06:00,857 --> 01:06:02,527
You said he would never like you.

757
01:06:02,757 --> 01:06:03,997
But you were wrong.

758
01:06:04,757 --> 01:06:06,097
Who cares about the equipment?

759
01:06:06,367 --> 01:06:07,996
What if you got hurt?

760
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:11,037
You even confessed your feelings that you liked me.

761
01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:13,107
It wasn't...

762
01:06:14,567 --> 01:06:15,637
a mistake.
