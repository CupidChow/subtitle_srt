00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
Darn it.

187
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,370
Where are you going, Bo Bae?

188
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,600
I'm sorry, but I look more like an actress.

189
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,639
I hope you fall in love with someone who's like an idol.

190
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,670
What...

191
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,810
Come on.

192
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,949
Hey. Where are you going? What about the proposal?

193
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,220
I'll finish it even if I must pull an all-nighter.

194
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,190
I've waited a year for this real-life face-off.

195
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,360
I'm off, Yeol.

196
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,690
Wait. Lee Dong Ha!

197
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,990
Dong Ha!

198
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,510
What? Pee my pants?

199
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,920
(The Cinematic Table)

200
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,330
- Are you...
- She's a Wacko?

201
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,200
Come Again Land?

202
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,339
(Apply)

203
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,909
(Your application has been submitted.)

204
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,940
All done.

205
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,440
(Fine Arts Overseas Scholarship Program Competition Rate)

206
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,710
It's 280 to 1?

207
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,650
That's too low.

208
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,350
Yes?

209
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,990
Hey, Bani. Are you busy?

210
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,949
What? No.

211
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,890
You see...

212
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,329
I just want to tell you not to worry about...

213
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,899
your tuition fee because of me.

214
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,800
I'm more than capable of paying for that.

215
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,930
I'm not worried. You shouldn't be either.

216
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,439
I've applied for this program.

217
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,810
Get accepted, and I can study abroad with a full scholarship.

218
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,810
If not, I can take time off from school.

219
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,710
Taking two semesters off is the norm now.

220
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,050
Thanks.

221
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,550
And I'm sorry.

222
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,119
You're already busy with school,

223
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,660
but I'm troubling you too.

224
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,830
No, Dad. I understand.

225
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,130
You did it for my and Mom's sake, right?

226
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,010
Right. Continue what you were doing.

227
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,680
Oh, and...

228
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,010
your boyfriend.

229
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,350
Yes?

230
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,320
He seems like a nice guy.

231
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,000
(Bani)

232
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,570
Where are you going?

233
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,310
I was going to go to you.

234
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,710
Bani, has somebody come?

235
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,509
Who is it? Oh, my.

236
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,380
You're Bani's boyfriend.

237
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,950
Hello.

238
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,789
It's cold. Come on in and talk inside.

239
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,949
- I'm okay, ma'am.
- It's cold.

240
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,089
No. Come in and talk inside.

241
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,090
Come in.

242
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,400
Well... Go ahead and talk.

243
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,279
It might be stuffy. Should I leave it open a little?

244
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,810
Come on.

245
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,290
Well...

246
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,330
Do you want to sit here?

247
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Sure.

248
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,380
Jae Yeol.

249
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,119
Thank you for coming first.

250
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,860
I was going to go to you.

251
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,930
Why did you drink so much at that time?

252
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,200
Did something happen?

253
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,000
Actually,

254
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,310
my dad was scammed.

255
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,950
Why didn't you tell me immediately?

256
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,580
Something good happened to you at that time.

257
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,420
I didn't want to ruin your mood.

258
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,670
But I want you to tell me immediately...

259
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,600
no matter what happens.

260
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,500
If something happens to you,

261
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,110
I should be the first one to know and stay by your side.

262
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,310
Okay. Thank you.

263
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,120
I'll do that from now on.

264
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,259
Oh, right. There's something...

265
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,160
I wanted to tell you first.

266
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,690
What is it?

267
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,699
Because of what happened to Dad, our family is struggling,

268
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,200
and I'm worried about the tuition for the next semester.

269
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,610
So...

270
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,650
I applied for an overseas scholarship program.

271
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,849
If I get accepted,

272
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,380
they'll fully fund a year of study abroad in the US.

273
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,620
The US?

274
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,720
Why do you think people watch movies in the end?

275
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,100
There are stories I want to see.

276
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,899
But I enjoy movies that present those stories...

277
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
in ways I haven't seen before.

278
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,169
The popular movies I like are those kinds.

279
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,570
The movies that pursue novelty...

280
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,210
within familiarity.

281
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,950
Why? What's the matter?

282
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,220
This is fun.

283
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,099
Well... I'm glad it's fun.

284
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,529
It's fun to me as well.

285
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,299
Of course, I thought it'd be fun...

286
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,400
even before we met.

287
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,370
I'm so glad it's been you the whole time.

288
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,710
I was so happy when I found out it was you.

289
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,810
Don't you think it was meant to be?

290
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,220
What...

291
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,390
What are you doing? You have a boyfriend.

292
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,730
Oh, my.

293
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,230
We broke up a long time ago.

294
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,630
You broke up?

295
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,150
(My baby, Hee Jin, I love you.)

296
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,320
You haven't changed at all.

297
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,230
- I haven't?
- No.

298
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,370
I haven't seen these for a long time.

299
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,970
(Something is going on between Bani and Hyun.)

300
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,740
Who is this?

301
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,880
A guy who lived next door.

302
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,950
He's not just a guy.

303
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,920
You look suspicious.

304
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,720
What? No.

305
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,150
Hey, why are you looking at it so closely?

306
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,890
Come on. It's more suspicious when you're trying to hide it.

307
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,690
Was he...

308
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,599
your first love or something like that?

309
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,159
No. It's not like that at all.

310
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,630
- He was. Let me see.
- He's really not!

311
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,430
Bani, it's snowing.

312
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,899
- Is it, sir?
- Is it?

313
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,930
Yes.

314
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,840
- Let's go and see.
- Yes.

315
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,250
It's so pretty.

316
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,020
Gosh, I can't believe we're seeing the first snow together.

317
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,959
Oh, yes. To celebrate the first snow,

318
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,830
why don't you have dinner with us? I'll make tasty tteokbokki for you.

319
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,230
You don't make delicious food for me.

320
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,300
Aren't you ashamed to say that now?

321
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,430
I am.

322
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,569
You should taste her tteokbokki. It's amazing.

323
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,970
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh.

324
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,039
I checked one thing off my bucket list.

325
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,110
What?

326
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,450
Seeing the first snow together.

327
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,390
I already told them...

328
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,290
to let it snow...

329
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,190
because we're going to be together tonight.

330
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,390
What?

331
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,980
(First Love)

332
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,179
Yes, Hye Won.

333
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,450
- Are you at school?
- Yes.

334
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,519
I talked with Mom on the phone.

335
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,420
I plan to go to the States before starting school.

336
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,289
I want to adapt to life there...

337
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,490
and spend time with my parents.

338
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,870
Yes. That'd be better.

339
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,370
Will you come with me?

340
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,910
Come with me. Will you?

341
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,139
Take a leave of absence next semester...

342
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,840
and spend some time with me there.

343
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,710
Our parents miss you a lot too.

344
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,880
Please, Ji Won.

345
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,130
Ms. Ban.

346
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,130
(Arte Foundation)

347
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:52,730
Why did you apply for this program?

348
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,200
The art school offers a wide range of high-quality art courses.

349
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,540
I want to take those classes...

350
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,370
to better define what kind of work...

351
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,840
I want to do in the future.

352
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,479
If you're selected for this program,

353
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,880
what are your academic plans in the US?

354
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,890
First, I want to take an installation art class.

355
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,189
So far, I've only created individual pieces,

356
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,400
but I want to broaden my perspective...

357
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,030
and learn about spatial composition as well.

358
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,670
That's nice.

359
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,539
Okay. Get home safe.

360
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,740
Call me when you're home.

361
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,310
Bye.

362
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,280
Hey.

363
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,450
What do you think about long-distance relationships?

364
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,290
Why do you ask? It's the worst.

365
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,829
- Is it that bad?
- Yes. Hey.

366
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,630
Even if you're together every day, your feelings can change.

367
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,100
Why do you think there's the saying, "Out of sight, out of mind?"

368
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,109
Hey, I'll get going first today.

369
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,910
- Are you not going to eat dinner?
- No.

370
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,379
I have to go somewhere. Don't skip meals.

371
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,380
I'll get going.

372
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,820
I think we should make it clear...

373
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,920
about our kiss last time.

374
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,760
Technically, you initiated the kiss.

375
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,830
And I can't tolerate meaningless kisses...

376
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,830
between a man and a woman.

377
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,000
- Let's date.
- Yes. Let's do that.

378
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,600
What?

379
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,740
I don't kiss just anyone either.

380
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,920
So are we really dating?

381
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,720
Are we in a relationship?

382
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,460
I hope we can make it work!

383
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,139
Bani. Eat something.

384
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,370
What are you looking at all day?

385
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,509
(2025 Arte Foundation Fine Arts Overseas Scholarship Program)

386
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,810
(Congratulations, Ban Hee Jin. You've been officially accepted.)

387
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,580
Have you been accepted to the American school?

388
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,020
Honey, come here right now!

389
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,089
Oh, my gosh. She's in a daze. She must be unbelievably happy.

390
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,789
Honey, she was accepted into the program to go to the US!

391
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,790
What?

392
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,069
Oh, my gosh! Seriously?

393
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,070
- My daughter, I'm so proud of you!
- Oh, my gosh.

394
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,939
- Yes. Who else would be accepted?
- Oh, my goodness.

395
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,640
- Gosh.
- I'm so happy.

396
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,240
You're the best.

397
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,390
With the recent rumours,

398
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,100
I don't want Yeol to get the wrong idea again.

399
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,430
From now on,

400
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,770
I'm going to put a distance between us.

401
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,290
(First Love)

402
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,030
Hello?

403
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,030
- Hye Won.
- Yes?

404
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,140
I'll go to the States with you.

405
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,340
Really? Are you sure?

406
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,580
I'll tell my parents then.

407
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,710
When do you want to leave?

408
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,650
Speaking of which, let's go before the end of the year.

409
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,720
I should search for the flight tickets first.

410
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:59,070
You went to get a cake for Bani. Why are you still not coming?

411
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,409
You didn't go out for delivery, did you?

412
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,280
We promised not to do that anymore.

413
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,979
No. What delivery?

414
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,779
I just got a cake at the bakery.

415
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,050
I'll be coming soon. See you.

416
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,119
Hold on. "Delivery complete."

417
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,660
(Blueme Kitchen, 5 dollars)

418
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,130
"Blueme Kitchen?" It's on the way home.

419
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,700
Okay. "Accept." I can earn money before going home.

420
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,340
Bani.

421
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,070
Oh, Jae Yeol.

422
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,840
It's cold. Why didn't you go inside first?

423
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,210
I was waiting for you so that we can go together.

424
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,010
- Let's go inside.
- Yes.

425
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,420
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

426
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,490
What do you want to have?

427
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:01,030
- How about you?
- I want meat.

428
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,800
- Let's have a steak.
- Sounds good.

429
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,179
I'm here at the Blueme Kitchen to pick up a delivery.

430
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,590
Could you distract her for a moment?

431
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,220
Why?

432
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,030
It's a spam message.

433
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,300
- I see.
- Yes.

434
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,210
What? Why are you sitting next to me?

435
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,980
I want to sit close.

436
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,620
- Do you like me that much?
- Of course, I do.

437
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,060
Here's the delivery.

438
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,720
Thank...

439
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,200
The person who just left. Don't you think he's my dad?

440
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,840
No way. You must've been mistaken.

441
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,640
I saw him too, but he wasn't your father.

442
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,580
He wasn't?

443
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,420
Be safe on the road, Father.

444
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,490
(Bani's father)

445
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,800
Bani, what did you want to tell me?

446
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,100
Oh, that.

447
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,240
Well...

448
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,210
What are you hesitant to share?

449
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,880
That program in the US.

450
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,950
I got in.

451
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,230
Really?

452
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,700
Congratulations, Bani.

453
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,970
Thanks, Jae Yeol.

454
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,500
I didn't think I'd get in.

455
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,740
It feels surreal.

456
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,440
That's great news.

457
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,679
I heard it was highly competitive.

458
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,880
But you still got in?

459
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,350
My girlfriend sure is impressive.

460
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,830
Just a second.

461
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,230
(Father)

462
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,370
Hello?

463
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,470
I'm calling from Ban Yeong Min's phone.

464
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,240
There was a motorcycle accident here.

465
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,980
He's being taken to Chaon Hospital ER.

466
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,250
Mom.

467
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Bani.

468
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,530
Dad!

469
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,600
Dad, what...

470
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,300
Don't worry. I'm fine.

471
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,769
Are you Mr. Ban's family?

472
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,399
- Yes.
- Mr. Ban needs surgery...

473
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,040
for injuries in his right arm and leg,

474
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,280
but all our operation room are occupied.

475
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,280
We're searching for other hospitals that can admit him,

476
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,850
but none are able to.

477
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,379
Won't something bad happen...

478
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,550
if he doesn't get surgery right away?

479
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,450
Can't you do something?

480
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,350
Well...

481
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,060
- What do we do?
- Doesn't it hurt?

482
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,809
(Cha)

483
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,679
(Cha Ji Won)

484
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,550
(Surgery in progress)

485
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,719
I told him not to deliver.

486
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,589
(Operation Room)

487
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:24,189
But he was adamant about earning money for your tuition...

488
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,730
on his own.

489
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,370
I saw this coming.

490
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,800
He's not even skilled at riding a motorcycle.

491
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,070
But your father wouldn't listen to me.

492
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,750
(Surgery in progress)

493
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,220
(Operation Room)

494
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,020
The surgery went well.

495
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,590
We'll see how he does in the following eight weeks.

496
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,799
I'm sure he'll recover sooner with physical therapy.

497
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,900
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

498
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,570
Thank you, Professor. I know it was your day off.

499
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,340
Who am I to turn down your request?

500
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,540
Thank you.

501
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,440
You have no idea how grateful I am.

502
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,110
Ji Won, thank you so much.

503
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,680
You heard the professor.

504
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,380
Your dad will recover in no time.

505
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,260
I'll get going, then. Keep me in the loop.

506
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,460
Sure.

507
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,030
My gosh.

508
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,470
Hey.

509
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:40,970
Thanks...

510
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,970
for today.

511
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,850
It was nothing. I'm glad his surgery went well.

512
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,280
Thanks for contacting me.

513
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,000
It's a relief to know that he'll make a full recovery.

514
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,140
Tell me about it. It's a relief.

515
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,040
You should hurry back in. Don't keep your mom waiting.

516
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,440
Sure.

517
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,750
That reminds me. I was going to ask you earlier,

518
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,650
but why did the guy call you of all people?

519
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Have you been in touch with my dad recently?

520
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,230
Well...

521
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,100
You see,

522
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,440
I knew about your father's part-time job.

523
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,270
He made a delivery to the studio once.

524
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,480
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

525
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,680
He asked me to keep it a secret.

526
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,290
Still, you should've told me.

527
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,220
I know.

528
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,000
I feel like I caused this.

529
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,230
That's just silly.

530
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,430
How is it your fault that he was in an accident?

531
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
I'm just saying.

532
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,570
It seems like I'm no help to you.

533
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,470
What are you saying?

534
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,640
You were by my side all night.

535
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,110
You got me through it all today.

536
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,490
So please, don't ever think that again. Got it?

537
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Sure.

538
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,270
I think I'm good.

539
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,910
Here.

540
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
What?

541
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,179
(Flight to New York, 14 hours)

542
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,610
Is the long-distance thing becoming a reality?

543
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,050
Are you okay with this?

544
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,489
She'll be gone for a year, not a week.

545
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,450
(Flight to New York, 14 hours)

546
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,700
Gosh, my whole body's aching.

547
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,669
My dad was discharged, and we just got home.

548
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,029
Yeol, I'm as good as new!

549
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,369
Tell him I'm fine.

550
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,839
Seriously? Stop it already.

551
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,069
Would you like to hurt something else?

552
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,540
My dad has always been quick to recover from injuries.

553
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,680
You should invite him over later.

554
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,480
Jae Yeol, would you like to have dinner with us today?

555
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,580
Dad will be treating us to celebrate his return home.

556
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,820
- Can you start with the red ones?
- The red ones.

557
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,720
- Sure.
- Good.

558
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,690
That's nice.

559
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,390
Another person means another set of hands.

560
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,999
Dad, be honest with me.

561
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,129
I bet you invited him over to make him decorate the tree.

562
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,900
As if. I did so because I like him.

563
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
What?

564
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:01,570
Says the man who had him under scrutiny.

565
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,240
You know how I like men who are tight-lipped.

566
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,010
Yeol, thank you for keeping my secret.

567
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,420
Although I messed that up myself.

568
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,150
Here.

569
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,320
My gosh.

570
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,919
Goodness, you're the one who helped us at the hospital.

571
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,180
- Right?
- Yes.

572
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,590
Hello, ma'am.

573
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,450
You have no idea how grateful I was.

574
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,920
It was nothing.

575
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,620
Are you here to see Bani?

576
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,990
What? Oh, I...

577
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:59,630
No, I was just in the neighbourhood passing by.

578
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,500
I'll get going, then.

579
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,730
Sure thing.

580
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,909
I ran into that guy outside our house.

581
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,410
That young man who helped us at the hospital.

582
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,280
- Won?
- Yes, Won.

583
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,219
I asked if he was here to see you,

584
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,890
but he left, saying he was just in the neighbourhood.

585
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,120
I'll step out for a bit.

586
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,630
Sure.

587
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Ji Won.

588
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,790
I heard you were outside our house.

589
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,560
Right.

590
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,829
Well, I had something to say to you.

591
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,800
It wasn't urgent, so I thought I'd just call.

592
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,930
I see.

593
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,370
Now is a good time too.

594
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,210
Bani.

595
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,720
I'm going to the US.

596
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,950
To the US?

597
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,720
Yes.

598
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,289
I'm going with Hye Won before she enrols...

599
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,990
to help her settle in.

600
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,300
I'll be staying in New York with my parents.

601
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,870
I see.

602
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,870
Still,

603
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,670
I thought I should at least say goodbye.

604
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,420
Thanks...

605
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,050
for everything.

606
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,170
Likewise.

607
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,170
I'm grateful for everything too.

608
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,540
Your family will be waiting. You should hurry back.

609
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,210
I'll get going.

610
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,180
Sure.

611
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,439
- I study visual design.
- Visual design?

612
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,769
- That's so nice.
- Visual design.

613
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,110
- You're back.
- Hey.

614
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:59,640
What did he want?

615
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,109
He just had something to say to me.

616
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,250
I see. What did he say?

617
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,220
He'll be going to the US to be with his little sister.

618
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,990
- He came to say goodbye.
- Where in the US?

619
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,490
New York.

620
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,630
New York? That's where you'll be going.

621
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,729
- Maybe you could meet up.
- Goodness.

622
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,900
This place had some of the best reviews.

623
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,200
We should try the food.

624
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,270
Sure, let's dig in.

625
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,900
It'll go cold.

626
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:33,009
I was full after dinner, but that walk helped.

627
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,080
Right?

628
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:35,810
Sure.

629
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,090
Bani.

630
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,120
Yes?

631
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,630
Do you have to go?

632
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,790
To the US?

633
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,430
What?

634
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,700
Can't you choose not to go?

635
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,340
Is it because...

636
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,780
of Won?

637
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,490
Don't worry about him.

638
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,190
It's not like we're going there together.

639
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,730
We have to be apart not for a month,

640
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,000
but for a year.

641
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,170
I haven't spoken about it,

642
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,970
but coming to terms with it wasn't easy.

643
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,710
Still,

644
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:37,810
since it's a good opportunity for you,

645
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,480
I knew it was only right for me to wait.

646
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,250
But now,

647
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,320
above everything else,

648
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,130
even Won will be there.

649
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,630
If that's the case,

650
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:05,700
I can't let you go.

651
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:10,610
You know how hard I worked to get into this program.

652
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,480
I do. Of course, I know.

653
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:21,580
But you must know how he feels about you.

654
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,330
Can't you have a little more faith in me?

655
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,590
I won't meet up with Won in the US,

656
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,300
nor will I make you worry.

657
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:40,870
I don't know.

658
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,210
I just feel...

659
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,350
like I shouldn't let you leave.

660
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,820
I'm sorry.

661
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,000
Your father is snoring like a sailor today.

662
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,300
You'll be going to the US shortly,

663
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,870
so I wanted to sleep next to you.

664
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,840
Sounds good to me.

665
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,210
What's with the long face?

666
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,280
Is something troubling you?

667
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,450
Mom.

668
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,720
Is going to the US...

669
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:37,830
the right choice for me?

670
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,530
Come on.

671
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,960
You were thrilled to get into the program.

672
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,100
A year is far from short.

673
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:49,370
I'm worried that I didn't think it through enough.

674
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,610
I don't know if I'll be able to adjust.

675
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,610
I'll have to spend...

676
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,720
too many days away from Yeol.

677
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:04,890
I get it.

678
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,330
I see you care deeply about Yeol.

679
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,800
I think I felt the same way when I was your age.

680
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,299
I wanted to have a great career as a volleyball player...

681
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,100
and a great love life.

682
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,140
I wanted to have both,

683
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,010
so I was worried that I might end up losing both.

684
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,780
But I didn't want to give up either one.

685
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,080
That's how I truly felt. You know?

686
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,420
Bani.

687
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,590
Don't worry about how things might turn out.

688
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:46,830
Just follow your heart for now.

689
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,130
There's nothing you can do regarding what happens later.

690
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:54,340
But if you're not true to your feelings now,

691
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,170
you'll really regret that later.

692
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,700
Even if you're together every day, your feelings can change.

693
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,070
Why do you think there's the saying, "Out of sight, out of mind?"

694
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,399
He'll be going to the US to be with his little sister.

695
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,140
- He came to say goodbye.
- Where in the US?

696
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,370
New York.

697
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,470
Jae Yeol.

698
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,650
I've given this a lot of thought.

699
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,480
But I still want to go.

700
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:54,720
It was hard to get into the program. I want to see this through.

701
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,000
Could you be...

702
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:07,100
more understanding about my decision for my sake just this once?

703
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,080
Can't you try to understand how I feel?

704
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:19,620
I might end up regretting a lot if I miss this opportunity.

705
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,330
Jae Yeol.

706
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,840
Could you please understand my decision...

707
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,840
just this once?

708
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,970
I can understand just about everything,

709
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,550
but I really can't accept this.

710
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,550
But what do we do?

711
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,520
If I go to the US, are we going to break up?

712
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,200
That won't happen, right?

713
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:28,080
Now that I've told you how I feel,

714
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,860
I'll wait.

715
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,390
- Ta-da.
- My gosh.

716
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,159
Bani. When you go to the US,

717
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,689
you won't get to eat a lot of Korean food.

718
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:09,829
Eat as much as you can. Okay?

719
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:12,599
My gosh. There are so many Korean restaurants in New York.

720
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,900
Of course, I know that. But it won't taste like my food.

721
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,970
- Finish that. Okay?
- Okay.

722
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,000
Oh, right.

723
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,869
I texted Yeol to come over...

724
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:23,210
- for a meal too.
- Yes.

725
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,639
He said he couldn't come because he didn't have time.

726
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,210
Is he that busy these days?

727
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,379
Oh, that? Well,

728
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,149
he has to deliver his final presentation...

729
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,920
for the contest today.

730
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,579
He's probably busy preparing for that.

731
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,819
My gosh.

732
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,319
I wanted all of us to have a meal before you left for the US.

733
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,460
That's a bummer.

734
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,190
If today is his final presentation,

735
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,830
will he not be able to come to the airport to see you off?

736
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:48,229
No. Well,

737
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:50,929
the thing is, this is a major contest.

738
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,799
- Is that so?
- Yes.

739
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,970
- He must be bummed out too.
- Right.

740
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,039
- Gosh, this is good.
- Yes.

741
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,070
Yes.

742
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,979
(Yeol: Make sure to have lunch.)

743
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,450
(Bani: You too. Don't skip your meal even if it's a hassle.)

744
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,990
Jae Yeol. You know that my flight is today. Right?

745
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,900
I hope I can see you before I go.

746
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:39,619
(Bani)

747
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,620
(Jae Yeol. You know that my flight is today. Right?)

748
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,659
(Jae Yeol. You know that my flight is today. Right?)

749
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,730
(I hope I can see you before I go.)

750
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,200
Yeol, are you nervous?

751
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,840
Don't be nervous. We can do this. Just stick to our script.

752
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,329
(Jae Yeol. You know that my flight is today. Right?)

753
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,100
(I hope I can see you before I go.)

754
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,370
Bani. Let's go.

755
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,070
- Okay.
- It's time to go.

756
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,540
- Did you pack everything?
- Yes.

757
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,909
Attention, please.

758
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:44,849
(Airport Main Number, Customer Service and Report)

759
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:47,580
Bani. Once you land,

760
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,520
get your luggage first.

761
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,060
Then call us right away.

762
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,819
My gosh. I got it. How many times must I tell you?

763
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,390
Gosh, you're such a softie when it comes to Bani.

764
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,699
Girls, thank you for coming today to see her off.

765
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,900
Of course, we should be here.

766
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:05,500
It would've been great if Yeol had come too.

767
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:09,910
My gosh. The awards ceremony of the contest is today.

768
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,340
I'm sure Yeol wanted to come. Right?

769
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,079
First of all, I would like to congratulate...

770
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,179
all the finalists here today.

771
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,749
Thank you for completing the assignment...

772
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:23,950
under a tight schedule.

773
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:27,190
Today is Christmas Eve.

774
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,489
I hope you didn't have to cancel your plans...

775
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:32,190
for the presentation.

776
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,600
- As today is a special day, - Going to the ice rink.

777
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,959
- leave no regrets.
- Eating carp bread...

778
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,999
and fish cakes from the streets,

779
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,400
and enjoying the first snow.

780
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:40,700
And lastly,

781
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,710
spending Christmas Eve together.

782
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,839
My all-time wish is to spend Christmas Eve...

783
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,410
with my boyfriend.

784
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,750
Then let's hear it from the first team.

785
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:12,749
Handsome Dolphins, could you begin your presentation?

786
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:13,759
Yes.

787
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,760
(Handsome Dolphins)

788
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,500
Hey, why are you just standing there?

789
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:24,000
Dong Ha.

790
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,540
I'm sorry.

791
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,140
Could you take care of the presentation?

792
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,310
Okay.

793
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:53,900
Bani. Shouldn't you head in now?

794
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,960
Yes, I should.

795
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:58,700
I'll be fine. I'll check in with you regularly.

796
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,800
Mom. Dad. I'll get going now.

797
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,870
Don't worry about me.

798
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,640
Don't skip your meals there.

799
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,810
I won't.

800
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:12,250
My sweetie.

801
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,380
- Be safe.
- Okay.

802
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,960
- Bye.
- Safe travels.

803
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:23,390
If it's too tough, come back home.

804
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:25,430
Okay.

805
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,890
(KR 702, New York)

806
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:58,650
Bani.

807
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:18,940
Jae Yeol. I'm leaving now.

808
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,480
Take care of yourself.

809
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,950
(Crushology 101)

810
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,579
Bani!

811
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,550
Bani came back to Korea today.

812
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,959
You and Yeol never talked, right?

813
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,090
To be honest,

814
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,529
I thought we might be able to go back to how it used to be...

815
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:45,230
once we saw each other again.

816
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:46,800
It's been a while.

817
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,230
Why are you going through this trouble of telling me that?

818
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,429
It's always been you for Bani.

819
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:52,829
It's been six years.

820
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:55,670
Hey, you really haven't changed at all.

821
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,710
Nothing ever captured my heart the way sports did.

822
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,310
Nothing except for one person.

823
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:03,450
My first love.
