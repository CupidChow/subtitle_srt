(All places, organizations, characters,)

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,019
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,020
Thank you.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,720
Thank you.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,530
- Jae Yeol.
- Don't get on it.

7
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,140
What's your problem?

8
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,090
Don't get on it.

9
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,390
Didn't you have something to talk about?

10
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
You see...

11
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
After you came back,

12
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,710
we didn't even have a chance to talk.

13
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,140
I wanted us...

14
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,980
to talk in person at least once.

15
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,420
Was everything all right over there?

16
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,030
Yes. Everything was fine.

17
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,470
After you left,

18
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,240
I was offered some opportunities, which kept me busy.

19
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,140
When it happened,

20
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,780
I could understand how you felt back then.

21
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,020
In the end,

22
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,620
you made the right decision.

23
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,130
If we could turn back time,

24
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,100
I would be able to send you off better.

25
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Well,

26
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,040
that's all in the past now.

27
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,190
Okay. I get it, Jae Yeol.

28
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,530
Either way, it's in the past.

29
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,410
You want us to move on...

30
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,770
and stay as good friends, right?

31
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,780
- What?
- I'm fine with that.

32
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,080
I should go now.

33
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,750
- Bani, that's not...
- You're keeping me waiting.

34
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,890
Can you let go of her hand?

35
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,360
Coming out of nowhere and wanting us to talk...

36
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,630
actually...

37
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,530
made my hopes go up,

38
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,640
thinking he might ask me to get back together.

39
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,250
But that wasn't the case.

40
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,350
It's really the end.

41
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,320
We broke up a long time ago.

42
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,260
But why does it feel like it just ended?

43
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,240
Are you not interested in me?

44
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,570
What?

45
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,910
If it's over between him,

46
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,310
what do you think about me?

47
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,550
Remember my first love I mentioned?

48
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,590
It...

49
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,890
was you.

50
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:16,210
(Final Episode: First Love)

51
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,210
With Bani's return,

52
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,450
I've become a complete fool.

53
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,720
Whenever I bump into her, I freeze up.

54
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,590
It seemed like it.

55
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,889
I could tell from...

56
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,890
how you screwed up over there.

57
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,800
What's this?

58
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,500
You're not even trying to make me feel better.

59
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,830
- So why did you come?
- Hey.

60
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,970
I didn't come voluntarily.

61
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,569
You dragged me here,

62
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,470
wanting to ride that hot air balloon.

63
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,410
Seriously.

64
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,760
You don't drink, do you?

65
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,300
You want me to cheer you up, no?

66
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,360
Bani didn't get what I meant.

67
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,000
I finally understood her feelings.

68
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,770
I wanted to apologize...

69
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,840
and ask her to get back together with me.

70
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,499
(Let's work hard for 1 year...)

71
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,710
(and return to Jae Yeol as someone amazing!)

72
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,980
If we could turn back time,

73
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,050
I would be able to send you off better.

74
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,920
Well,

75
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,420
that's all in the past now.

76
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,720
What? "The past?"

77
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,699
(Let's work hard for 1 year...)

78
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,770
(and return to Jae Yeol as someone amazing!)

79
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,230
What? Why?

80
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,700
What?

81
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,900
Why are you here?

82
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,270
Because this is my place!

83
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,370
Why are you here, Ji Won?

84
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,510
Didn't you drag me here?

85
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,230
Hey, Lee Dong Ha. My friend.

86
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,330
Come get me.

87
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,370
Come and get me, will you?

88
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,640
Jae Yeol. Are you going to leave me behind?

89
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,439
- Take me too.
- Gosh.

90
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,539
Dong Ha. Take Ji Won with you, not me.

91
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,110
- I'll put him on the phone.
- Dong Ha!

92
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,110
Hey. You know me, right?

93
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,380
- The handsome Won.
- Gosh.

94
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,520
(Door)

95
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,160
Ji Won.

96
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,690
When I first met you,

97
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,860
- you were in front of a sculpture.
- Yes?

98
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,340
But I couldn't tell which was the actual sculpture.

99
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,940
Gosh, come on.

100
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,770
Same here.

101
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,380
You were quite rude,

102
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,480
but I thought you sure were a looker.

103
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,650
I'm serious.

104
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,820
Is this what they call...

105
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,659
birds of a feather flock together?

106
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,390
- Are we birds?
- Correct.

107
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,490
- We're birds.
- Birds.

108
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,429
Birds? Right, birds.

109
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,000
Let's go, Yeol. Let's go home now.

110
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,429
- Dong Ha.
- Dong Ha.

111
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,430
- Get up.
- My dear Dong Ha.

112
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,000
Seriously.

113
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,040
Unbelievable.

114
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,710
They were so heavy.

115
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,040
Since when were you two...

116
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,050
close enough to drink together?

117
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,550
My back hurts.

118
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,290
Nothing will happen, right?

119
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,340
Let's each handle...

120
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,940
our own hangovers.

121
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,210
Of course.

122
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,750
What awful timing.

123
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Your first love confessed to you...

124
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,460
the moment you sorted things out with your ex?

125
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,890
Yes.

126
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,530
Did he drink until he dropped because you two...

127
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,430
made a clean break off?

128
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
What?

129
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,210
You see... Yeol got plastered,

130
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,440
so Dong Ha went to get him.

131
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,410
It's over between them. Whether he drinks is not her problem.

132
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,780
Bani. You're never supposed to...

133
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,820
go back to your ex.

134
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,950
Try to work things out with your first love, okay?

135
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,560
Getting to date your first love is a miracle, isn't it?

136
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,790
And what's more, you two are each other's first love.

137
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,830
I'm jealous, girl.

138
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,660
"First love?"

139
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,810
(Hyun)

140
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,980
(Hyun)

141
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,850
Bani. Hurry up and answer it.

142
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,210
Come on.

143
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,020
Hello?

144
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,720
Mr. Hwang Jae Yeol.

145
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,220
Why did you drink so much?

146
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,790
Thanks.

147
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,930
You can't imagine how tough it was last night.

148
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,860
What's worse, you two are super tall.

149
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,770
I thought of dumping you on the streets numerous times.

150
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,570
I got it. I'll treat you to some good food, okay?

151
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,310
When?

152
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,410
After I finish editing the outsource order.

153
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,010
Okay. I won't forget.

154
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,109
Come to think of it, you only have the insert left, right?

155
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,110
Yes.

156
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,820
I'll wrap it up at the studio today.

157
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,190
What?

158
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,960
- Where is it?
- What is?

159
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,759
- My external hard drive.
- What?

160
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,530
The one with the insert on it?

161
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Yes.

162
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,470
Look for it thoroughly, will you?

163
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,800
Isn't it in here?

164
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,370
What's with all these zippers?

165
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,470
- Oh, no.
- Hey.

166
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,210
Are you sure it's in this bag?

167
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,910
Could you drop me off here?

168
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,120
Shoot.

169
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,160
Over here, Hyun Oh.

170
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,200
He's got a great body.

171
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,870
They are my friends.

172
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,640
- Hi.
- We meet again.

173
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,640
Hi.

174
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,940
Bo Bae.

175
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,280
What do we do? We're screwed.

176
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,520
Dong Ha. What do you mean by that?

177
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,350
Yeol lost his external hard drive.

178
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,690
The commercial footage of our outsourced work is on it.

179
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,620
What now?

180
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,360
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

181
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,629
He left it in a taxi.

182
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,860
But it's hard to reach the driver.

183
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,100
What do we do? At this rate, it'll be the end of our project.

184
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,199
Oh, no. I'm screwed.

185
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,930
I'm screwed, Bo Bae.

186
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,810
I didn't know such a place existed.

187
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,750
Do you come here often?

188
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,390
What's on your mind?

189
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
What?

190
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,330
It's nothing.

191
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,230
Nothing, my foot. You're distracted, aren't you?

192
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,110
I'm really sorry, but I have to go.

193
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,610
Something urgent came up.

194
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,520
Sorry.

195
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,530
Please pick it up.

196
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,070
It's driving me crazy.

197
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,840
Jae Yeol.

198
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,180
Bani.

199
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,950
Go with me.

200
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,060
I left my bag in the cab.

201
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,930
I checked the ride history, and it said Yu Cheol Ung was driving,

202
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,660
but he's not answering his phone.

203
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,200
Oh, him?

204
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,670
He's off duty and went to visit his family.

205
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,569
He usually turns off his phone when he's off.

206
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,570
You won't be able to reach him.

207
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,110
Where does his family live?

208
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,810
Where was it?

209
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,580
It was somewhere in Gyeonggi Province.

210
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,260
I think it's near here.

211
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,800
Hold on.

212
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,299
- Hello?
- Oh, Jae Yeol.

213
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,340
- It's about the Ion Fit commercial.
- Okay.

214
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,170
You know the deadline is tomorrow afternoon, right?

215
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,840
Tomorrow?

216
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,710
Why? Is there any problem?

217
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,079
No. There's no problem.

218
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,579
- You startled me.
- Sorry.

219
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,520
- Tomorrow then?
- Yes. I can do that.

220
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,890
- Good luck, Jae Yeol.
- Thank you.

221
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,760
Are you all right?

222
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,500
Yes.

223
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,269
Let's go there and ask.

224
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,400
(Radiant Corner Shop)

225
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,510
Excuse me.

226
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,700
Are you okay?

227
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yes.

228
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,370
Oh, my gosh.

229
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,199
I'm so sorry.

230
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,910
I was washing with water.

231
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,080
It's okay.

232
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,449
Oh, gosh. You're completely soaked.

233
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,320
Come on. Come inside.

234
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,020
Come on in.

235
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,860
It's cold, isn't it?

236
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,630
No. You're the wet one.

237
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,200
Put it closer to... Oh, my.

238
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,400
Are you okay? Let me see.

239
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,210
No. I...

240
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,480
I'm fine. I was just startled.

241
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,050
Okay.

242
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,130
Oh, my. Get changed into this.

243
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,270
Give your clothes to me. Let me dry them for you.

244
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,280
It suits you more than me. Oh, gosh.

245
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,090
I can tell you came from Seoul.

246
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,620
What brought you here?

247
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,660
Oh, right. Do you know Yu Cheol Ung by any chance?

248
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,699
The cab driver?

249
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,470
Ok Bun's son?

250
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,870
- Yes.
- Do you know him?

251
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,540
Where does he live?

252
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,170
He lives in the third house back here.

253
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,110
But he's probably not home today.

254
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,809
Why?

255
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,910
He went out early this morning with his mother for a trip.

256
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,210
They said they were going to see the sea.

257
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,610
Which sea?

258
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,950
How would I know?

259
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,960
Oh, gosh.

260
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,790
You guys must be hungry.

261
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,299
You should eat before doing something.

262
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,230
Do you want some ramyeon?

263
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,610
Then...

264
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,710
two bowls, please.

265
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,880
Gosh, the ramyeon here is amazing.

266
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,800
The owner gave this to me earlier.

267
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,630
Give me your hand.

268
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,600
I'm fine.

269
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,500
Come on.

270
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,720
You don't want to get blisters on your hand.

271
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,220
Yes. Thank you.

272
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,430
What are you going to do now?

273
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,700
We couldn't find the external hard drive.

274
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,370
There's nothing I can do.

275
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,500
I should visit the agency tomorrow and beg.

276
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,380
By the way,

277
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,590
why did you follow me today?

278
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,160
I heard something had happened to you.

279
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,490
So I got worried.

280
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,240
I didn't mean anything by it.

281
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,010
It's not like we're strangers.

282
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,440
We should help each other out. Don't you think?

283
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,680
I wouldn't mind if you meant anything.

284
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,290
What?

285
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,530
You know what?

286
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,230
I've been strange since you came back.

287
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,800
The class and the hot air balloon.

288
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,810
I didn't go there to mess things up like that.

289
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,790
So...

290
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,060
What I wanted to say is...

291
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,000
I missed you so much,

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,070

Guys, I see Cheol Ung's cab, which you were looking for earlier.

294
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,560
Can you come out right now?

295
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,610
Oh, my. What if I were on an overnight trip?

296
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,180
See if it's here.

- Thank you.

- Yes.
- I'll give you a ride then.

I'm not going to charge you. Hurry up.

302

Okay. We're here.

303
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

305

Thank you...

306
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,770
for today.

307
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,699
Sure. Get home safe.

No, it's fine.

316

- Your ex-boyfriend.

You still like him a lot, don't you?

321
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,620
Yes.

Hey.

I mean, a young man and woman...

337
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,910
went to an unfamiliar place.

338
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,970
I'm sure you didn't just get the external hard drive back.

339
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,590
I saw your lips twitch just now.

340
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,720
- When?
- Just now.

341
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,660
Fine.

342

- Oh, it's twitching.
- Stop it.

344

Here you go again.

345
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,030
How far will it go up?

346
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,070
Did he say he wanted to get back together?

347
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,840
He didn't say that.

348
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,309
What? So you're not getting back together.

349
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,350
These days, no one actually says, "Let's date."

350
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,619
It's pretty obvious.

351
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,480
No.

352
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,120
It's not like they had a crush and agreed to date for the first time.

353
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,720
They're getting back together after a breakup. It should be clear.

354
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,700
If you had said you missed her, she must've reacted to it.

355

Did you not hear anything from her?

356
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,530

This is Hwang Jae Yeol you interviewed earlier.

376
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,180
I wasn't honest...

waiting for my girlfriend who left a year ago.

381
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,360
Back then, I wasn't good enough,

382
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,560
and that's why I lost her.

383
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,200
But now, I know for sure.

Me? Outside the library.

394
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,300
I'll be right there. Wait for me.

I counted the days until I could return to you.

But I didn't want to be a burden to you...

399
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,720
I couldn't tell you.

00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,660
I still like you a lot.

401

I actually missed you more.

406
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,520
I missed you way more.

407

It's been ages...

408
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,080

Sure.

This would probably shock Bo Bae and Dong Ha.

412
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,490
They'll be surprised,

413
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,420
but then, they'll tease us endlessly.

414
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,790
We'll just have to cope with that.

- That's great!
- That's great!

- Don't copy me.
- Why are we in sync?

You...

441
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
You never told me there was a kissing scene.

442
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,830
No way. This can't happen.

443
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,300

444
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
His girlfriend has always dreamed of being an actress,

445
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,329
and she's finally getting her big break...

446
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,340
after years of waiting.

447
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,399
Shouldn't he be happy for her...

448
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,310
instead of getting upset over a mere kissing scene?

449
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,570
A mere kissing scene?

450
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,640
I don't care if it's just acting.

451
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,510
The boyfriend still deserves a heads-up.

452
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,379
He should be supportive of her career,

453
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,250
not accuse her of being inconsiderate.

454
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,719

00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,020
Petty?

457
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,820
Did you just call me petty?

458
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,720
Don't you know I hate being called that?

459
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,960
And I'm sensitive...

460
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:30,290
- about my acting career!
- Whatever.

461
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,360
- Can you stop this?
- Come on, guys.

471
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,169
Why did they even argue...

472
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,440
if they were just going to make up so easily?

473
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,140
Tell me about it.

474
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,680
Their banter is adorable, though.

475
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,380
Adorable? No. Leaving you speechless? Yes.

476
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,950
How so? I think they're cute.

477
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,850
Let's make up the way they do after an argument.

478
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,290
No way.

479
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,160
I wouldn't argue with you in the first place.

480
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,460
Sure.

481
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,300
I'll head inside, then.

482
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,600
Just like that?

483
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,780
Are you kidding me?

484
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,020
Father.

485
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:05,790
Come on. Neither of them is a kid.

486
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,690
There's nothing wrong with a kiss between adults.

487
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,790

488
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,700
Don't!

489
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,870

- Look at his face.
- Unbelievable. No wonder.

491
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,540

495
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,720
- You too, Mother.
- Sure.

496

Honey, could Bani have ordered these in advance?

510
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,940
- That's so sweet of her.
- I know.

511
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:38,710
Our sweet daughter.

512
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,490
Bani told us that it wasn't her,

513
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,420
so I knew it had to be you.

514
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,630
It's long overdue, but thanks.

515
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,630
It was my pleasure.

516

- Unbelievable.
- I know I startled you.

517
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,000
Here you go.

518
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,539
I still remember the citrus tea...

519
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,540
and gave it my best shot.

520
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:03,710
Try it and see how it is.

521
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,210
Sure.

522
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,450
How is it? Similar, isn't it?

523
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,719
Actually, this tastes better.

524
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,980
- Really?
- Yes.

525
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,649
What citrus tea are you talking about?

526
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,720
You don't need to know.

527
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,890
It's a secret among us guys.

528
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,260
Unbelievable.

529
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,720
Son.

530
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,020
I know you're busy, but clean up from time to time.

531
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,820
Don't skip your meals either.

534
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,489
Thank you.

535
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:23,850
- Please enjoy.
- Thanks.

536
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,620
This is a surprise.

537
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:30,190
You rarely invite me out for a meal.

538
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,560
I signed a deal to work on a commercial.

539

Yes.

542
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,480
Goodness.

543
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,150
When did you turn into such a fine young man?

544

Treating me to a meal with money you earned yourself.

545
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,650
I never thought this day would come.

546

Stop that and dig in.

547
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,930
Sure. I'll enjoy this.

548
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,560
By the way,

549
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,230
you and Bani are back together, right?

550
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,600
How did you know?

551
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,500
Your face says it all.

552
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,570
You have a glow on your face.

553
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,720
(Sang Hyeon)

554
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:31,950
Right.

555
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,860
- Take it.
- That's all right.

556
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,530
I'll take it later.

557
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,060
It's okay to answer his call.

558
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:43,930
He's your boyfriend.

559
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,710
Maybe the three of us...

560
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,340
can grab a meal sometime.

561
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,860
It's not like...

562
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,460
I hated that you were dating other men.

563
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,960
I just felt like...

564
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,300
I was never your priority.

565
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:23,970
That...

566
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,140
upset me.

567
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:32,650
Are you kidding me? As if that would ever be the case!

568
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,220
All this time,

569
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:41,520
I was simply following my heart.

570
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,100
I didn't realize it could hurt you.

571
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,430
I'm sorry.

572
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,070
No. Don't apologize for being right.

573
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,840
I finally...

574
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,210
understand it a bit.

575
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,110
That one should be true...

576
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,350
to their feelings.

577
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,780
I hear Yeol's been doing really well.

578
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,880
The student council says that he's already landing jobs.

579
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,250
That's right.

580
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,580
Lucky him.

581
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,220
I should've studied visual design since it has better job prospects.

582
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,920
Bani, since you studied abroad,

583
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,160
you'll aim to be an artist, right?

584
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,260
No, I'm going to get a job.

585
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,860
That's something crucial I learned while abroad.

586
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,400
I don't know what I'll end up doing,

587
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,440
but I'm going to think it through.

588
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,210
You're here.

589
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:12,620
Hey.

590
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,020
Let me finish this up real quick. Then we can go.

591
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,190
Take your time.

592
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,030
What now?

593
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,100
Do I look attractive when I'm working?

594
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,710
Yes. Not only do you look cool,

595
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,640
but I actually envy you.

596
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,010
You envy me?

597
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,219
You're at the top of your class and have studied abroad.

598
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,920
So hearing such a compliment from you is making me blush.

599
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,760
Right, but you know what you want to do with your career.

600
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,700
On the other hand, I don't know...

601
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,700
what I want to do with my career yet.

602
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,540
You can figure it out now.

603
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,670
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

604
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,840
I can vouch for that.

605
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,410
Based on what?

606
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,810
Because you're my girlfriend.

607
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,690
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

608
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,930
You're all set to go to the US, right?

609
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,760
Should we leave at the end of the month?

610
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,670
Ji Won. I'll go back by myself this time.

611
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:39,500
By yourself?

612
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,400
Why?

613
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,710
You've given up a lot of things for my sake all these years.

614
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,520
I realized that after making friends in college.

615
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,950
That you must have had friends in school too,

616
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:59,320
but you were always by my side when I needed you.

617
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,690
That you must have given up a lot of things for me.

618
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,000
No.

619
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,960
I didn't have to do that.

620
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,999
I have a lot of friends in the US.

621
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,970
And Mom and Dad are there too. So I'll be fine.

622
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,870
I know I can thrive without you there.

623
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:24,650
I realized today...

624
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,380
that it had been a decade since my accident.

625
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
Thank you for playing with me for a decade.

626
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,310
You got home safely, right?

627
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,440
Yes. I got home a moment ago.

628
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,340
I should've escorted you home. I'm sorry.

629
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,010
No, it's all right. I know you're busy.

630
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,820
But we have to go on a date this weekend.

631
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,419
Of course.

632
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,950
I'll finish this before the weekend.

633
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,459
Don't worry about it.

634
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,889
Okay. I'll let you get back to work then.

635
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,060
Text me before you go to sleep.

636
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:11,760
Okay. I will.

637
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,610
This is incredible.

638
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,410
I was away checking the set. You're a lifesaver.

639
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,520
Thank you so much.

640
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,490
No problem. I'm glad I could help.

641
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,890
- Sculpture Department, was it?
- Yes.

642
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,860
Give me a call if you're interested in this field as well.

643
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,899
Yes. Gosh, thank you.

644
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,530
(Art Director Choi Seon A)

645
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,210
It feels good to spend time with you on a date after so long.

646
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,880
Exactly. How long has it been since we were on a date like this?

647
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,550
I wrote down everything I wanted to do with you.

648
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,620
- You have a list for that?
- Yes.

649
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,050
The first thing on the list is...

650
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:11,690
this.

651
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:13,590
(Rings for couples)

652
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,560
- Rings for couples?
- Yes.

653
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,430
I always wanted one.

654
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,260
Getting a ring together is...

655
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,700
What?

656
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,870
Isn't that too sudden?

657
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,270
Let's get a ring together another time. Okay?

658
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,840
Okay.

659
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,709
Let's go.

660
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:37,350
(Rings for couples)

661
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:40,519
My goodness. He never cleans his house.

662
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,550
He's basically living in a mess. Oh, my.

663
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,690
Maybe, I should have called him before coming.

664
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,100
He must be home.

665
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,470
My son, are you home?

666
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,070
Who are you?

667
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,210
- Well...
- Don't come in.

668
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,579
- No, I...
- No!

669
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,150
- No, hold on.
- Stop!

670
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,909
No. This is the right house.

671
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,719
- Oh, no! A thief! What should I do?
- Wait. Hear me out.

672
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,790
- No. Wait.
- Get out of here.

673
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,649
- Wait. Stop it.
- Oh, no.

674
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,660
Don't cross that. Stop right there.

675
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,129
- Hold on.
- Don't come near me.

676
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,459
No, I'm not dangerous or anything. Let me explain why I'm here.

677
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,560
- Mom.
- What?

678
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:30,700
Dad?

679
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,700
"Mom?"

680
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,140
A lot happened while I was parking the car.

681
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,710
I'm so sorry.

682
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,879
You must have been so scared.

683
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,980
No.

684
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,120
I should be apologizing.

685
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,050
It was a ridiculous misunderstanding on my part.

686
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,319
Please excuse my misunderstanding on our first meeting.

687
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,329
My gosh, no. You didn't do anything wrong.

688
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:59,630
We apologize for showing up out of the blue.

689
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,630
I stopped by to drop off some side dishes.

690
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:03,970
But he wasn't home.

691
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,199
I told him the passcode.

692
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,870
- I see.
- Yes.

693
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,640
Gosh, it's very kind of you to bring him side dishes.

694
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:16,809
I guess Bani has her parents to thank for turning out to be...

695
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,879
a warm-hearted girl with a big heart.

696
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,120
Oh, my. You're too kind.

697
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,390
You should be the proud one as Yeol is kindhearted and polite.

698
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:28,190
You raised a very good son.

699
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,660
Gosh, no. I can't take any of the credit.

700
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:35,030
He turned into a man he is now all on his own without my help.

701
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:40,000
Was it when he was eight years old?

702
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:44,709
He had a smaller build than his peers.

703
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,940
So I was quite worried about him.

704
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,050
But he looked at me and said,

705
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,580
"I'll grow big quickly..."

706
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,520
"and protect you, Mom."

707
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,660
"Don't worry about a thing."

708
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,790
That's what he told me.

709
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:08,130
Gosh, hearing such words from him made me feel so reassured.

710
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,470
My gosh.

711
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,570
Oh, my. My goodness.

712
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,940
I'm being so silly, aren't I?

713
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,010
Oh, no.

714
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,980
No, you're not being silly.

715
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,350
Are you serious? Why are you crying?

716
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,920
It reminded me of raising Bani.

717
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,520
Bani too.

718
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,359
She said she would beat up anyone that bothered me...

719
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,820
when she was little.

720
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,290
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

721
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,699
This is very typical of my husband. Everyone knows...

722
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,130
he's a softie for his daughter.

723
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,470
My gosh, I see. Oh, my goodness. How sweet.

724
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,239
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- Goodness.

725
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,570
- Why am I crying?
- My goodness.

726
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:52,910
- So that's what she said.
- Yes.

727
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,290
My group date was a bust again.

728
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,220
What is everyone doing now?

729
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:13,830
- I'm talking to Yeol.
- I'm watching a movie with Dong Ha.

730
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,400
Kot Nim.

731
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,140
Hey.

732
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,880
When we first met, all the guys said...

733
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,180
I was fun to be around and had a great personality.

734
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,889
But when the group date was over,

735
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:39,350
everyone paired off and went their separate ways,

736
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,220
leaving me alone.

737
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:48,030
I wonder what my problem is.

738
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:51,870
Why do you think you're the problem?

739
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,270
Kot Nim, you're a great girl with a bubbly personality.

740
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,210
The problem was...

741
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:02,110
that they all failed to see how amazing you are.

742
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,320
I'm sure he's out there.

743
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,020
A guy who will see how amazing you are.

744
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:24,029
- Have a great time together then.
- Okay.

745
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,899
She can't spend the night here, though.

746
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,769
- Don't be so silly. Have fun, Bani.
- Okay?

747
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:28,969
- See you next time.
- Okay.

748
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:30,340
- Bye.
- We'll get going.

749
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:40,080
My dad is so silly.

750
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:41,850
So is my mom.

751
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:45,190
Bani.

752
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,590
I'm sorry about earlier.

753
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:51,460
You were disappointed, weren't you?

754
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,570
Could you let it slide just this once? Please?

755
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,440
Okay.

756
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,310
You don't mean that. I can see that you're still upset.

757
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,070
No, I'm not.

758
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,710
I think you are.

759
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,780
Fine, yes! I was disappointed. Are you happy now?

760
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,150
Seriously.

761
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:25,390
- What?
- Your hand.

762
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,560
No.

763
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,330
- Give me your hand.
- No.

764
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,500
Come on.

765
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,180
What? That's...

766
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:49,580
What is this?

767
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:07,240
I wanted to buy you a present...

768
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,810
once I received my first advance payment.

769
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:13,740
Then is this why you said no earlier?

770
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:16,680
Right.

771
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,080
This is beautiful.

772
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,250
Then...

773
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:22,480
Can you put this on me too?

774
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:44,510
No relationships can be perfect.

775
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,410
But...

776
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:49,440
there can at least be relationships without regret.

777
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,330
- Yeol.
- Bani, I'm calling you to wake...

778
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,799
Gosh, I've been up for a while.

779
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,300
I wanted to wake you up with this call.

780
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:11,169
But you're already up.

781
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:13,270
The meeting is earlier than I expected.

782
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,570
I see. Good luck with the meeting.

783
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,270
Call me when it's over. I'll come and pick you up.

784
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,510
Okay. See you later.

785
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:21,780
Okay.

Hee Jin. Did you leave yet?

789
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,960
Yes. I'm about to head out now.

790
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,830
See you soon then.

791
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:41,100
Okay. I'll see you at the cafe.

If you feel safe enough to share your vulnerability...

800
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,100
instead of concealing it...

801
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:18,699
The upstairs unit is rented out...

802
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,240
for an event with Chaon Foundation.

803
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,769
It will be quite loud, so tell Yeol and Dong Ha...

804
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:24,409
not to use the studio if possible.

805
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:25,439
- Okay.
- Okay.

806
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,180
Gosh, don't worry about it. We got it.

is in a league of his own.

809
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:34,180
Look at him. He's already an intern.

810
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,590
I had to take the interview to get this internship.

811
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:40,919
- He's good-looking.
- My gosh.

812
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,189
- He's wealthy.
- Oh, my.

813
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:43,530
- And he's competent.
- Goodness.

814
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,760
Which brings us to the question...

815
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,930
Could you go on a group date with us?

816
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,040
- Just this once.
- A group date?

817
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:57,109
You don't have to lift a finger.

818
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,439
Right. You can just show up. We'll take care of everything...

830
