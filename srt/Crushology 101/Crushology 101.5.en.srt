00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:20,753
Hey, Ban Hee Jin.

4
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:24,623
You...

5
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:27,633
Stop being an eyesore already.

6
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:31,733
What is it this time?

7
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:37,273
I...

8
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:44,743
I'm broken.

I...

10
00:00:57,893 --> 00:00:59,293
must have a crush on you.

11
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:55,883
Will you marry me?

12
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:00,973
Ms. Ban Hee Jin?

13
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,083
Ms. Ban Hee Jin.

14
00:04:04,383 --> 00:04:06,083
You're under arrest for megalomania.

15
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,253
Come with us to the police station at once.

16
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:09,953
Hold on.

17
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,883
What do you mean by megalomania?

18
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:13,493
Honey.

19
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,493
Do something.

20
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,293
- Arrest her. - Don't move, Ms. Ban.

21
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:28,403
Did you really think...

22
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:31,473
we could get married?

23
00:05:00,573 --> 00:05:02,803
(Alarm)

24
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:05,843
Seriously.

25
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,853
It was just a one-time booze talking.

26
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:16,623
Stop imagining too far.

27
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:23,293
But...

28
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:26,593
it really was just a booze talk, right?

How did I get home?

32
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:05,163
Did I drink too much last night?

33
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:15,243
I...

34
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,653
must have a crush on you.

35
00:06:27,393 --> 00:06:28,653
You're crazy.

36
00:06:30,863 --> 00:06:32,093
You really are.

37
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:36,233
You've lost your mind.

38
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,503
It can't be true.

39
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:09,293
You're here early.

40
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,833
Well, yes.

41
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:14,933
Because of this.

42
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:21,513
You went home just fine last night, right?

43
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,683
I see.

44
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,653
I guess you don't remember.

45
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:33,953
What?

46
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:38,123
Did I do something again?

47
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,093
You've done...

48
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,603
plenty of things.

49
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,673
You even cried.

50
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:49,103
"Cried?"

51
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:50,443
I beg you.

52
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:53,613
Can't you walk properly?

53
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:56,143
Sorry.

54
00:07:56,783 --> 00:07:58,313
I want to,

55
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:00,353
but my legs...

56
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:03,453
They won't listen to me.

57
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,183
You even picked a fight.

58
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,153
You little...

59
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:09,763
What are you looking at?

60
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:14,063
Look away right now. Do it.

61
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:15,933
Darn you.

62
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,973
You put on a great slapstick comedy.

63
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:23,973
Come on. Let's go in a bit.

64
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:26,073
- Okay. Let's go. - What?

65
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:30,583
Hey, Choon Shik. Where's your energy?

66
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:33,153
How soft.

67
00:08:34,783 --> 00:08:36,323
Darn it.

68
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:39,423
No wonder.

69
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,423
And...

70
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:44,923
There's more?

71
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:48,863
You even confessed your feelings to me.

72
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,773
That wasn't a mistake.

73
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:07,913
What?

74
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:09,883
It wasn't...

75
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:12,383
a mistake.

77
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:37,943
Goodness.

78
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:40,053
My heart was about to explode.

79
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,623
Did I just...

80
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:46,693
confess to her again while I'm sober?

81
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:51,963
My gosh.

82
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:54,632
Now then.

83
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:57,162
Thanks for coming to the meeting...

84
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,133
despite being swamped with exams.

85
00:09:59,503 --> 00:10:01,172
- I doubt... - It'll be a first...

86
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:03,303
- in the upcoming festival. - it was a confession.

87
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:05,903
What did that mean?

88
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:10,943
Don't tell me...

89
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:12,743
it's a new way of bullying.

90
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,423
Right. Now I remember.

91
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:19,753
Those black pupils.

92
00:10:20,423 --> 00:10:21,653
That nasty corner of the lips.

93
00:10:22,593 --> 00:10:23,993
Stay strong today as always.

94
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:26,233
I'm sure.

95
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,993
He's clearly bullying me.

96
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:32,972
Only those who apply can work overnight at school,

97
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:34,003
so please check.

98
00:10:34,803 --> 00:10:37,303
Good luck with your exams. I'll see you after the exam week.

99
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:39,643
- Great work. - Good luck.

100
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:40,973
Good luck.

101
00:10:41,143 --> 00:10:43,643
I have something important going on,

102
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,143
- so I'm leaving first. - Okay.

103
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,083
Why?

104
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:52,553
What's this?

105
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,122
- Remember? - Right.

106
00:10:54,123 --> 00:10:55,423
Did she already leave?

107
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,063
Is it impossible?

108
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:01,063
(I'm a snow crab. I like you snow much.)

109
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:04,963
Hey.

110
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:08,203
Should I be more mannerly?

111
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:09,503
Welcome.

112
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,503
Hey, welcome.

113
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,773
I need to look cool.

114
00:11:16,113 --> 00:11:17,113
Oh...

115
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:22,783
Over here.

116
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,723
Here. Sit.

117
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:33,033
You sure dig in, but beautifully at that.

118
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,763
I couldn't eat lunch.

119
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:36,933
I see.

120
00:11:37,903 --> 00:11:38,963
By the way,

121
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:41,033
what's your ideal type?

122
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,173
Sorry?

123
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,383
A guy who's good at grilling meat.

124
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,913
- Meat? - Yes.

125
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:54,282
It proves how much of a good sense he has.

126
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:55,553
- Is that so? - And...

127
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:58,383
the forearm muscles peeking out while grilling meat...

128
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:00,292
makes the heart pound.

129
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:01,323
I see.

130
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:04,863
Then, how about I...

131
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:07,133
pick the crab meat out for you?

132
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,162
- No, I'm good. - It's okay.

133
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:11,063
What's more, eating snow crabs...

134
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,473
with your hands is the way to go.

135
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:15,533
How big.

136
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:27,613
But I'm really okay.

137
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,393
My forearm muscles.

138
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:35,923
I can do it.

139
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:50,102
Mommy.

140
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,843
That girl has a crab claw on her hair.

141
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:06,023
(Local Bar)

142
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:16,163
I'll be leaving first.

143
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:19,233
Thank you once again for that day.

144
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:24,773
Wait.

145
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:29,143
- Yes? - Where...

146
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:32,783
are you studying for the upcoming midterms?

147
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:35,383
- What? - I want to make up...

148
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:37,183
for today's bad manners.

149
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:45,423
The midterm will be replaced with your project interim evaluation.

150
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:49,333
Even if it's an interim evaluation, it'll be part of your final grade.

151
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:50,903
Don't think of slacking off.

152
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,503
- Okay. - Okay.

153
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,833
You know projects are important starting sophomore year, right?

154
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,203
Only one team's work can be displayed in the main hall.

155
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:03,113
And only one piece will be selected as the best work.

156
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,553
Don't think of helping each other.

157
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:07,883
Think of surviving alone.

158
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,613
- Okay. - Okay.

159
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:11,123
Good luck.

160
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:13,523
Study hard for your exams, okay?

161
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:15,223
I'm always rooting for you.

162
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:16,692
- Thank you. - Thank you.

163
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:17,723
Of course.

164
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:22,363
I'm going to study at the library.

165
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,002
Who wants to come?

166
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:26,233
Me. I planned to study before going home anyway.

167
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:27,433
All right.

168
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,042
By the way, Bani. Are you done with the sketch?

169
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,743
I did. Won helped me out by being the model.

170
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:33,973
Is that so?

171
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:36,273
I'm not done yet.

172
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:42,583
Can't you give me a hand, please?

173
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:44,053
Me?

174
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:47,423
Take your time. I'll be at the library first.

175
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:48,893
Okay.

176
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,093
(Main Library)

177
00:15:12,283 --> 00:15:13,283
Nice.

178
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:23,923
Him again? Of all people!

179
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,893
Hello.

180
00:15:57,593 --> 00:15:58,593
What are you doing?

181
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:01,463
Take a seat.

182
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:05,603
Earlier, I thought you reserved the seat for someone.

183
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:06,903
Yes.

184
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:13,203
For you.

185
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:15,543
Me?

186
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:56,583
Can't you just be honest with me?

187
00:16:57,153 --> 00:16:58,983
What did I do wrong this time?

188
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:03,153
You did nothing wrong.

189
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:05,292
Why on earth are you being like this then?

190
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:06,862
You reserved the seat for me.

191
00:17:06,863 --> 00:17:08,963
And you keep looking at me.

192
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,403
Excuse me.

193
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,033
Can you keep it down, please?

194
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:17,603
Sorry.

195
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:34,523
Do you not really get it?

196
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:39,923
Then think about...

197
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:46,873
why I'm acting like this.

198
00:17:58,883 --> 00:18:00,283
- What? - What's going on?

199
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:01,953
What is it?

200
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,682
Due to an emergency safety inspection today,

201
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,723
the power supply has been interrupted.

202
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:09,652
Please proceed safely to the first floor...

203
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,662
- using the emergency exits. - I have an exam.

204
00:18:11,663 --> 00:18:14,293
- My goodness. - I repeat.

205
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,362
Due to an emergency safety inspection today,

206
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,503
the power supply has been interrupted.

207
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:20,432
Please proceed safely to the first floor...

208
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,873
using the emergency exits.

209
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,303
- Gosh, this is crazy. - It's so dark.

210
00:18:27,043 --> 00:18:28,242
- This is unfair. - This is unbelievable.

211
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:29,413
Hold onto me.

212
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:32,013
Why did this happen?

213
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:40,093
Thank you.

214
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,153
Hold me.

215
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:44,163
Or you might trip.

216
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:14,193
(Main Library)

217
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,103
Are you going to study more?

218
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:26,133
Why?

219
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:28,533
Well...

220
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:30,643
I know a nice place to study.

221
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:32,843
Do you want to go with me?

222
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:35,943
No.

223
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,043
I...

224
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:42,012
I'll just study at home today.

225
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:43,723
Bye then.

226
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:44,953
Hey.

227
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:01,573
(Kot Nim)

228
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,343
- Hello? - Bani, where are you?

229
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:09,213
I'm at school. Why?

230
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,083
Bo Bae found an amazing place.

231
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:12,483
Let's all study there.

232
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:15,113
Sure. Where is it?

233
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:20,923
Thank you so much for today.

234
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,793
No worries. We're on the same team. Of course, I should help.

235
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,963
Ji Won, we found a place to study.

236
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,233
Bani is coming too.

237
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,403
Oh, right. Do you want to have dinner with me?

238
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:37,443
Since you helped me, I want to treat you to dinner.

239
00:20:38,043 --> 00:20:39,573
Well... I'm sorry.

240
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,773
Let's have dinner next time.

241
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:43,883
I'll get going first. You did well today.

242
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:46,113
Thank you.

243
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:54,353
So this is the place to study?

244
00:20:57,263 --> 00:20:58,593
I thought you went home.

245
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:02,533
I know.

246
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:04,733
Why am I here?

247
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,133
Dong Ha said we could study here.

248
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:11,373
But I definitely heard that there would be three people.

249
00:21:15,113 --> 00:21:16,543
I was invited too.

250
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,013
I invited him.

251
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:21,313
He's our friend.

252
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,513
Can I go in?

253
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:26,253
It's neat.

254
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:32,223
Where is Dong Ha, by the way?

255
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:34,093
Dong Ha...

256
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:36,063
is here.

257
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:38,903
Since everyone is here, shall we begin the pork belly party?

258
00:21:39,063 --> 00:21:40,433
- Pork belly? - Yes.

259
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:43,273
We should take enough protein before studying for the exam.

260
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:45,473
Shall we go?

261
00:21:54,753 --> 00:21:56,213
We can't eat meat here.

262
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,893
(Table Repair in Progress)

263
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:04,963
Just give up.

264
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:07,393
I can't.

265
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,063
I must grill the meat today.

266
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,003
I'm hungry.

267
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:17,103
There's a way.

268
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:26,243
Is it really okay to grill the meat here?

269
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:29,052
Of course. It's my room. Who cares?

270
00:22:29,053 --> 00:22:31,353
Do you really have to do this to eat meat?

271
00:22:31,523 --> 00:22:32,723
But it'll be delicious.

272
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:34,123
I haven't had pork belly for a long time.

273
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,093
Right. I didn't know we would eat it in a place like this.

274
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:39,393
Let me grill it then.

275
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:48,303
- Cook my meat well done, please. - Well done? Okay.

276
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:49,373
How about you?

277
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:50,973
Just make it delicious.

278
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,503
Delicious? Okay.

279
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:58,943
Excuse me.

280
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:29,473
It's hot.

281
00:23:36,353 --> 00:23:39,352
I mean, your hand must be so hot.

282
00:23:39,353 --> 00:23:40,653
What? Oh, yes.

283
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:13,723
Eat a lot.

284
00:24:29,973 --> 00:24:32,203
Ji Won, eat quickly.

285
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,243
I'm eating.

286
00:24:34,543 --> 00:24:35,543
Good.

287
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:39,783
By the way,

288
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:41,813
why do you use honorifics only when you talk to me?

289
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:43,753
Sorry?

290
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,123
You call him casually.

291
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:49,593
Why do you use honorifics when you call me?

292
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:57,433
You were kind of scary.

293
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:01,533
And we weren't exactly comfortable in the beginning.

294
00:25:04,243 --> 00:25:05,343
I don't like it.

295
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:10,343
I don't like it when you use honorifics.

296
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:27,333
Oh, my gosh. Why would you not like it?

297
00:25:27,763 --> 00:25:31,333
Come to think of it, we don't have any beverages.

298
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,463
- I'll get it. - I'll join you.

299
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:35,303
Let's go together.

300
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,053
Are you stuck on Bani?

301
00:25:53,283 --> 00:25:54,723
Why are you always with her whenever I see you?

302
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:57,963
We're close.

303
00:25:58,963 --> 00:26:01,363
Oh, you're close?

304
00:26:04,003 --> 00:26:05,603
Are you sure you're just close friends?

305
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,403
Why are you acting like that then?

306
00:26:14,243 --> 00:26:15,273
Excuse me?

307
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,943
If you're going to play with her, you better stop.

308
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,623
I'm not playing.

309
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:30,493
I'm serious.

310
00:26:57,353 --> 00:26:59,922
Don't just grill the meat. You should eat some too.

311
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:01,423
- Let me grill it. - No, it's fine.

312
00:27:01,993 --> 00:27:02,993
Sorry?

313
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:06,023
I love grilling meat.

314
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:08,033
Okay.

315
00:27:16,573 --> 00:27:17,573
What?

316
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:19,503
What's going on? What's this?

317
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:21,873
Is there a fire outside?

318
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:24,883
- That's horrible. - Dong Ha!

319
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:27,313
The smoke! It's because of this!

320
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:29,713
I think it's because of the smoke.

321
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:31,923
Water.

322
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:35,893
- Dong Ha! - No!

323
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:03,713
I'm doomed.

324
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:39,723
Gosh.

325
00:28:44,593 --> 00:28:45,663
Hee Jin.

326
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:53,463
What are you doing?

327
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:56,303
I... This...

328
00:28:57,443 --> 00:28:58,473
Come out.

329
00:28:59,543 --> 00:29:00,543
Darn it.

330
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:04,743
Let me see. Did you not get hurt?

331
00:29:06,183 --> 00:29:09,513
No. Well, the equipment is wet.

332
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:10,883
Who cares about the equipment?

333
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,083
What if you had been hurt?

334
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:15,123
But those are expensive.

335
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,423
So you're really not hurt, right?

336
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:23,163
No.

337
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:25,303
I'm fine.

338
00:29:45,523 --> 00:29:47,893
Are you sure you don't need help?

339
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,223
It's okay.

340
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:51,123
We should clean up the mess.

341
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:58,833
You guys must've been surprised.

342
00:30:00,403 --> 00:30:01,433
Go home and take a rest.

343
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:06,103
We'll get going first then.

344
00:30:06,743 --> 00:30:08,213
Let me know if you need anything.

345
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,473
Okay.

346
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:28,033
Bye, my love.

347
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:41,873
Get in my car, everyone.

348
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:43,643
I'll drive you home.

349
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:46,383
No, it's fine. You must be tired too.

350
00:30:48,383 --> 00:30:49,613
How can you go home like that?

351
00:30:54,793 --> 00:30:55,793
I guess you're right.

352
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:58,123
Wait here. I'll get my car.

353
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:05,163
This means I can cross "water park" off my list for summer this year.

354
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,063
Tell me about it.

355
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,173
You said there was no way.

356
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:15,613
- What? - Him.

357
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:17,713
You said he didn't like you.

358
00:31:18,983 --> 00:31:20,413
As if.

359
00:31:20,683 --> 00:31:22,483
Wasn't it obvious?

360
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:24,253
Didn't you see love dripping from his eyes?

361
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,023
I thought he was Timothee Thalamet.

362
00:31:26,883 --> 00:31:28,053
It's Chalamet.

363
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,453
Right, Thalamet. Timothee Thalamet.

364
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:33,162
Timothee Chalamet.

365
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:35,033
Thalamet. Timothee Thalamet.

366
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:36,863
Did I say it wrong?

367
00:31:52,313 --> 00:31:54,653
(Ban Hee-nuisance I Can't Stand)

368
00:31:59,923 --> 00:32:00,993
Could she be asleep?

369
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:05,793
You said he didn't like you.

370
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:07,632
As if.

371
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:09,132
Wasn't it obvious?

372
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:10,533
Didn't you see love dripping from his eyes?

373
00:32:15,873 --> 00:32:20,643
(Hwang Jae Yeol I Loathe)

374
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:30,883
Hello?

375
00:32:31,623 --> 00:32:32,883
You weren't asleep.

376
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:36,453
Right. Not yet.

377
00:32:37,793 --> 00:32:39,763
Why are you calling this late?

378
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:42,533
No reason. I was just wondering if you got home all right.

379
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,863
It was also to hear your voice.

380
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:51,073
By the way, how are things at the studio?

381
00:32:52,473 --> 00:32:54,003
I explained the situation to the building manager...

382
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:55,243
and tidied up the best I could for now.

383
00:32:56,413 --> 00:32:57,983
Hold on.

384
00:32:58,783 --> 00:33:00,143
Don't you think you'll catch a cold?

385
00:33:00,483 --> 00:33:04,253
Right. I do have the chills,

386
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,653
but it's nothing serious.

387
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:06,953
You have the chills?

388
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,153
You know what? Just go to bed already.

389
00:33:10,693 --> 00:33:11,863
Don't forget to tuck yourself in.

390
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:14,593
Right, sure.

391
00:33:15,263 --> 00:33:16,333
Then,

392
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:18,403
good night.

393
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:19,733
Sure.

394
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:28,543
What on earth was that?

395
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:31,513
You even confessed your feelings to me.

396
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:34,283
That wasn't a mistake.

397
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:36,483
Then think about...

398
00:33:40,283 --> 00:33:41,553
why I'm acting like this.

399
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:42,753
Who cares about the equipment?

400
00:33:43,293 --> 00:33:45,093
What if you had been hurt?

401
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:47,933
Does he...

402
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:50,363
really like me?

403
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,243

(Bani)

405
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,923
You're going soft, Jae Yeol.

406
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:35,272
Are you going to work on your project this afternoon?

407
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,773
Yes, for a bit.

408
00:34:36,973 --> 00:34:38,383
What about you, Ji Won?

409
00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:42,482
I'm tired today, so I'll be heading home early.

410
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:44,053
Why? Are you not feeling well?

411
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:47,952
I wasn't able to get a good night's sleep last night.

412
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:48,953
I see.

413
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:52,693
They say we sleep less as we grow older.

414
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:55,933
It's not like that.

415
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:58,632
We'll have lunch ourselves then.

416
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:00,003
- Sure. - Good.

417
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,972
What's wrong? Did you catch a cold?

418
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:07,503
Could that be it?

419
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:09,643
I was drenched from head-to-toe last night.

420
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:11,043
I don't have a fever though.

421
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:18,453
She couldn't sleep and has the shivers.

422
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,023
She hasn't been able to keep her eyes open.

423
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:22,123
She's really sick, okay?

424
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:23,753
What?

425
00:35:24,153 --> 00:35:25,293
I need cold medicine.

426
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:27,692
General, nasal, and throat.

427
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,293
Pills, syrup, or powder.

428
00:35:29,663 --> 00:35:31,703
I'll take everything that does the trick.

429
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:33,703
Everything?

430
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:38,473
Gosh, I'm stuffed now.

431
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:41,643
I'd give anything to take a nap right now.

432
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:44,583
But we should work hard since we ate, right?

433
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:46,483
- Good luck to us. - Let's do it.

435
00:35:55,223 --> 00:35:56,323
You have the chills?

436
00:35:57,453 --> 00:35:59,593
You know what? Just go to bed already.

437
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:01,333
Don't forget to tuck yourself in.

438
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:02,993
Are you kidding me?

439
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:04,763
No way.

440
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,863
One oat latte, coming up.

441
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,143
- Hi. - Hey.

442
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:18,483
Well...

443
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:20,783
Well...

444
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:23,513
I'm sorry about yesterday.

445
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:27,752
Don't be. We enjoyed the meal.

446
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,353
Still, I'm the reason you...

447
00:36:31,163 --> 00:36:33,063
I hope you have another good day, then.

448
00:36:33,763 --> 00:36:35,063
I'll be getting to my class.

449
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:41,433
Just a second.

450
00:36:53,013 --> 00:36:55,013
This is the play I'm in.

451
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:56,913
You should come see it.

452
00:36:59,323 --> 00:37:00,323
What?

453
00:37:01,123 --> 00:37:02,893
It's for all the meat you grilled.

454
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:05,293
I'll see you that day.

455
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,103
("Romeo and Juliet")

456
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:15,033
No way.

457
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:18,243
My forearm muscles finally paid off!

458
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:23,873
Do you see them? My gosh.

459
00:37:24,113 --> 00:37:25,513
Good job, boys.

460
00:37:34,383 --> 00:37:35,523
Hey, friend.

461
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:40,123
What's going on? You looked dead up until yesterday,

462
00:37:40,563 --> 00:37:41,762
but now you're beaming.

463
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:42,963
I was reminded once again...

464
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:44,563
that hard work...

465
00:37:45,403 --> 00:37:47,063
doesn't betray you.

466
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:50,473
Whatever.

467
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,773
Gosh. Hi, Ms. Lim.

468
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:01,483
Professor...

469
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,453
Hey.

470
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:17,903
Are you kidding me?

471
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:21,933
I was going to tell you,

472
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:24,472
but there was never the right time.

473
00:38:24,473 --> 00:38:25,742
You've been too busy.

474
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:27,203
Is it a professor this time around?

475
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,173
Does he know...

476
00:38:30,913 --> 00:38:32,112
that I'm your son?

477
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:34,213
I haven't told him yet.

478
00:38:35,953 --> 00:38:36,953
Why not?

479
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:40,223
Even you must know...

480
00:38:40,983 --> 00:38:42,223
that this whole situation is messed up.

481
00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:47,123
What can I do when I only found out about his job after we got together?

482
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:48,693
Are you saying we should've broken up?

483
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:53,732
Besides, I'm not cheating on my husband...

484
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,273
nor dating a student.

485
00:38:55,973 --> 00:38:58,972
Aren't I free to date a man...

486
00:38:58,973 --> 00:39:00,503
that seems decent?

487
00:39:01,713 --> 00:39:05,943
Rather than wishing for my happiness,

488
00:39:06,283 --> 00:39:08,213
you make it sound like I did something wrong.

489
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:13,253
To you,

490
00:39:14,483 --> 00:39:15,953
I never matter.

491
00:39:18,493 --> 00:39:19,523
What did I expect?

492
00:39:20,723 --> 00:39:21,793
You only took custody of me...

493
00:39:23,563 --> 00:39:25,763
so that you'd get child support.

494
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:29,002
- What? - You only said you'd raise me...

495
00:39:29,003 --> 00:39:30,133
in return for getting a building of his.

496
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:32,373
Did you think I didn't know?

497
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:35,773
Now that you have what you wanted,

498
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:38,113
I no longer...

499
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,783
matter to you.

500
00:39:42,983 --> 00:39:44,013
You...

501
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:46,623
- How could you... - Whatever.

502
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:48,923
Just forget it.

503
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:54,163
Don't care about me like you've been doing so far...

504
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,063
and do whatever you want.

505
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:00,263
Date anyone and do as you please.

506
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:04,873
I'm done...

507
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,543
caring about it.

508
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:14,183
So what if I got a building from him?

509
00:40:14,953 --> 00:40:16,252
What about it?

510
00:40:16,253 --> 00:40:18,223
Wasn't I entitled to that much?

511
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:21,852
I raised you well giving you everything you needed.

512
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,753
What more do you want from me?

513
00:40:26,823 --> 00:40:29,763
I finally want to enjoy my life.

514
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:33,163
Is that too much to ask? Is it?

515
00:41:51,043 --> 00:41:52,083
Jae Yeol?

516
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:07,493
I didn't get a good look the last time I was here.

517
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,763
It's a mess, right?

518
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,163
I guess.

519
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,303
Anyway, what were you up to?

520
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:23,843
I was working on the basics for the interim evaluation.

521
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:25,883
I see.

522
00:42:28,183 --> 00:42:30,153
It's more fascinating up close.

523
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:33,883
It might seem that way at first,

524
00:42:34,223 --> 00:42:36,453
but it's just like a sketch.

525
00:42:39,063 --> 00:42:40,223
This isn't my first time.

526
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:44,033
Sorry?

527
00:43:01,983 --> 00:43:03,883
Your hair is down today.

528
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:05,883
You normally have it up.

529
00:43:06,653 --> 00:43:08,423
My hair? I forgot.

530
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:12,593
How did you know though?

531
00:43:24,673 --> 00:43:25,743
I told you.

532
00:43:26,343 --> 00:43:27,573
This isn't my first time.

533
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:39,853
Gosh.

534
00:43:41,993 --> 00:43:43,353
I should do it later.

535
00:43:44,523 --> 00:43:45,593
Here.

536
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:51,453
There you go.

537
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:00,303
I have something for you.

538
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:08,143
I bought some just in case.

539
00:45:09,413 --> 00:45:10,743
Take them when you're not feeling well.

540
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:13,943
Hold on.

541
00:45:14,313 --> 00:45:16,383
Weren't these from you?

542
00:45:17,983 --> 00:45:19,083
What are those?

543
00:45:19,153 --> 00:45:21,793
They were left on my desk earlier.

544
00:45:22,423 --> 00:45:23,923
I thought they were from you.

545
00:45:28,663 --> 00:45:30,263
Take these instead.

546
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:32,733
I asked for everything that did the trick.

547
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,703
Take what I got for you.

548
00:45:37,633 --> 00:45:38,673
Okay?

549
00:45:41,543 --> 00:45:43,343
Sure. Thanks for these.

550
00:45:50,053 --> 00:45:51,083
Then,

551
00:45:52,023 --> 00:45:53,123
I'll get going.

552
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:55,523
And...

553
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:58,793
Call me whenever you feel bored.

554
00:46:06,603 --> 00:46:07,633
Or...

555
00:46:10,003 --> 00:46:12,073
just call me whenever you want.

556
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:17,343
Sure.

558

(Chaon Hospital)

561
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:55,083
Yes. I'm going to wrap things up and head out soon.

562
00:46:55,753 --> 00:46:57,383
You must have been bored to work alone.

563
00:47:08,263 --> 00:47:09,263
(Senior Partner Bani)

564
00:47:09,264 --> 00:47:10,893
I wasn't alone the whole time.

565
00:47:11,133 --> 00:47:13,003
Yeol stopped by for a moment.

566
00:47:25,513 --> 00:47:27,683
Okay. Be on standby, everyone.

567
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:32,082
Sir, you can come this way.

568
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,123
You can stand here.

569
00:47:38,293 --> 00:47:39,363
Yeo Reum.

570
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,393
We'll start shooting in five minutes.

571
00:47:42,133 --> 00:47:43,663
Okay. I got it.

572
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:59,813
(How are you?)

573
00:48:09,193 --> 00:48:11,393
This is how one makes a glorious return.

574
00:48:11,523 --> 00:48:13,322
She's the most successful alumna of the Media...

575
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,863
and Public Relations Department and the youngest sports announcer.

576
00:48:15,863 --> 00:48:16,993
I will get a job...

577
00:48:17,163 --> 00:48:19,063
at a TV station just like her no matter what.

578
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,503
Someone like her wouldn't date just anybody, right?

579
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:24,833
Does she date idol stars, actors,

580
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,473
or guys with rich parents?

581
00:48:29,713 --> 00:48:31,473
No. My grandparents are rich.

582
00:48:32,783 --> 00:48:33,783
- I see. - It's his grandparents.

583
00:48:35,183 --> 00:48:36,383
Port cutlets?

584
00:48:38,253 --> 00:48:39,283
- No way. - My gosh.

585
00:48:41,183 --> 00:48:43,523
Han Yeo Reum will be the MC at this year's festival.

586
00:48:43,693 --> 00:48:44,792
It's Han Yeo Reum.

587
00:48:44,793 --> 00:48:46,623
She's been blowing up these days.

588
00:48:47,023 --> 00:48:49,633
My gosh, it's been so long since I saw her in person.

589
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:51,693
You know that she's super popular these days, right?

590
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:54,363
- She's so beautiful. - Gosh, she's coming to our school.

591
00:48:54,563 --> 00:48:56,133
- She's gorgeous. - Right.

592
00:48:56,503 --> 00:48:57,573
Hey.

593
00:48:57,933 --> 00:48:59,273
Why are you already thinking about the festival?

594
00:48:59,343 --> 00:49:00,943
I thought you guys had one more exam left.

595
00:49:01,473 --> 00:49:03,472
- Gosh. - Come on.

596
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,513
My goodness, I didn't mind that I had forgotten about it.

597
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:08,013
Why do you keep bringing up our exams?

598
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:09,883
- Read the room. - Don't ruin our good mood.

599
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:16,092
The theme of our sculptures is body language.

600
00:49:16,093 --> 00:49:18,662
Each sculpture portrays happiness,

601
00:49:18,663 --> 00:49:21,023
sadness, and anger through gestures and poses.

602
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,762
The proportions are balanced, and the details are thorough.

603
00:49:24,763 --> 00:49:25,833
This is good.

604
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:29,273
Yoo Ri, you can start working with plaster now.

605
00:49:30,203 --> 00:49:31,233
Well done.

606
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:32,773
- Thank you. - Okay.

607
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:39,783
Did you not have enough time?

608
00:49:40,983 --> 00:49:41,983
Pardon?

609
00:49:42,553 --> 00:49:43,683
Why is yours lacking refinement?

610
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:45,283
What were you thinking?

611
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:50,523
I'll try to improve it.

612
00:49:51,923 --> 00:49:53,462
Forget about the details.

613
00:49:53,463 --> 00:49:55,193
You'll need to redo the frame.

614
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:57,563
Do you think this can keep you at the top of the class?

615
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:07,273
Won, you're next.

616
00:50:17,953 --> 00:50:18,953
Bani.

617
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:21,783
How about the special meal today? It's been a while.

618
00:50:22,923 --> 00:50:26,523
I wanted to go home early and rest up today.

619
00:50:26,663 --> 00:50:27,923
Let's take a rain check.

620
00:50:28,863 --> 00:50:29,863
Okay.

621
00:50:36,603 --> 00:50:38,173
- Right there. My gosh, yes. - Up here?

622
00:50:40,503 --> 00:50:41,573
My gosh.

623
00:50:42,613 --> 00:50:44,843
Why don't you take the season off?

624
00:50:44,943 --> 00:50:46,113
How could I?

625
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:48,182
To provide for our daughter...

626
00:50:48,183 --> 00:50:49,183
who needs a lot of financial support,

627
00:50:49,184 --> 00:50:50,853
I must keep earning money when I still can.

628
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:55,283
We can't afford to send her abroad, but we must help her graduate.

629
00:50:58,193 --> 00:50:59,623
You know what?

630
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:03,333
I'm so relieved that she always gets the scholarship.

631
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:04,893
Right.

632
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:08,403
- She's doing us a favour. - Yes.

633
00:51:08,973 --> 00:51:09,973
My gosh.

634
00:51:09,974 --> 00:51:12,073
Goodness, your whole body is aching.

635
00:51:23,383 --> 00:51:25,622
Our interim evaluations are posted on the academic affairs page.

636
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:28,723
(Our interim evaluations are posted on the academic affairs page.)

637

(Check Grades)

638
00:51:32,363 --> 00:51:34,393
(Sculpture 1: B plus, Plaster 1: B plus)

639
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:40,363
My grades are mediocre in other subjects too.

640
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,603
Call me whenever you feel bored.

641
00:51:52,713 --> 00:51:56,183
(Ji Won)

642
00:51:58,783 --> 00:51:59,853
Hello?

643
00:52:00,683 --> 00:52:03,323
Bani, can you come out for a moment?

644
00:52:05,023 --> 00:52:06,063
What?

645
00:52:14,503 --> 00:52:15,833
What's this about?

646
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:18,403
Let's go for a drive.

647
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:20,473
Now?

648
00:52:20,643 --> 00:52:21,743
Yes.

649
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:27,043
I'm not in the mood to go for a drive.

650
00:52:28,683 --> 00:52:29,753
Let's go.

651
00:52:44,863 --> 00:52:45,933
Bani.

652
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:48,563
Doesn't it feel good to be out?

653
00:52:51,673 --> 00:52:53,503
Yes. You're right.

654
00:52:54,343 --> 00:52:56,243
It does feel good now that I'm out.

655
00:53:15,663 --> 00:53:19,863
My gosh, the breeze is nice, and the view is amazing too.

656
00:53:23,703 --> 00:53:26,773
I always wanted to go for a drive and come to the Han River.

657
00:53:28,503 --> 00:53:29,643
I'm glad to hear that.

658
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:34,883
Thank you, Ji Won.

659
00:53:36,953 --> 00:53:39,323
You brought me here so you could cheer me up.

660
00:53:42,493 --> 00:53:43,623
To be honest,

661
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:48,263
I was anxious after getting the professor's feedback.

662
00:53:49,663 --> 00:53:51,633
I was worried that I might lose...

663
00:53:54,133 --> 00:53:56,233
my scholarship next semester.

664
00:53:59,673 --> 00:54:03,273
My parents are working hard to put me through art school.

665
00:54:06,483 --> 00:54:07,983
You have a lot of time.

666
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:10,313
Don't worry too much.

667
00:54:11,783 --> 00:54:14,183
Well, if you don't think it's going well,

668
00:54:14,953 --> 00:54:16,393
I'll take over and carry the team.

669
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:18,193
You trust me, right?

670
00:54:21,523 --> 00:54:23,033
So I can be a freeloader?

671
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:24,293
If that's what you want.

672
00:54:28,803 --> 00:54:29,873
You know what?

673
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,373
It feels liberating to tell you what's on my mind.

674
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:46,723
I had so much fun today. Drive safely.

675
00:54:47,353 --> 00:54:48,752
Okay. See you tomorrow at school.

676
00:54:48,753 --> 00:54:49,753
Okay.

677
00:54:54,393 --> 00:54:55,493
You startled me.

678
00:54:56,163 --> 00:54:57,233
Dad.

679
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:59,263
How long have you been standing there?

680
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:02,303
Who is that handsome guy?

681
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:05,533
- Is he your boyfriend? - No, he's not.

682
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,543
He's my junior partner. Don't get your hopes up.

683
00:55:09,043 --> 00:55:11,773
Okay. But a junior partner can turn into a boyfriend too.

684
00:55:12,013 --> 00:55:14,643
Seeing his face reminds me of my younger days.

685
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:17,213
I like him. He gets a green light from me.

686
00:55:17,553 --> 00:55:19,752
No, Dad. Hear me out.

687
00:55:19,753 --> 00:55:21,422
He's really not my boyfriend. Not him.

688
00:55:21,423 --> 00:55:23,323
Okay. I got you.

689
00:55:23,723 --> 00:55:25,293
"Not him?"

690
00:55:26,763 --> 00:55:28,623
You must have a crush on someone.

691
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,432
My gosh, whatever. I'm going in.

692
00:55:31,433 --> 00:55:33,633
You can tell me. Come on. Talk to me.

693
00:55:34,703 --> 00:55:36,502
- Whatever. I'm going back in. - Come on.

694
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:39,673
Tell me. Come on, Bani. Wait.

695
00:55:46,613 --> 00:55:47,783
Seriously.

696
00:55:55,423 --> 00:55:57,152
(Cold Medicine)

697
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:58,793
I asked for everything that did the trick.

698
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:01,763
Take what I got for you.

699
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:04,093
Okay?

700
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,003
You must have a crush on someone.

701
00:56:43,673 --> 00:56:44,673
Bani.

702
00:56:54,883 --> 00:56:57,483
My crush.

703

(Student Council Room)

704
00:57:44,963 --> 00:57:46,833
The weather is amazing today.

705
00:57:47,633 --> 00:57:49,533
You know, it's making me want to play hooky.

706
00:57:50,103 --> 00:57:51,803
I know, right?

707
00:57:52,443 --> 00:57:54,203
A picnic would be perfect today.

708
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:57,773
Do you need to work on your sculpture again tonight?

709
00:57:59,683 --> 00:58:01,043
Yes. Probably.

710
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:03,813
I see.

711
00:58:04,413 --> 00:58:05,413
Bani.

712
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,123
Ji Won.

713
00:58:10,293 --> 00:58:11,523
You guys came to school together.

714
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:14,123
We ran into each other over there.

715
00:58:14,363 --> 00:58:16,293
Gosh, is coming to school together a problem?

716
00:58:18,733 --> 00:58:21,203
Aren't you tired? You went home late last night.

717
00:58:21,433 --> 00:58:24,073
I'm fine. I had a good night's sleep.

718
00:58:24,433 --> 00:58:25,673
How are you feeling?

719
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:27,643
The breeze from the Han River last night was a bit chilly.

720
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,073
I'm fine.

721
00:58:32,213 --> 00:58:34,483
I think you're running a fever.

722
00:58:42,053 --> 00:58:43,253
She's not.

723
00:58:47,463 --> 00:58:49,893
If you're sick, make sure to take the medicine I gave you.

724
00:58:52,093 --> 00:58:53,103
Okay.

725
00:59:08,813 --> 00:59:09,953

726

Hey, look.

727
00:59:28,163 --> 00:59:29,733
- My gosh. - She's so pretty.

728
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,302
- It's Han Yeo Reum. - You look so pretty.

729
00:59:31,303 --> 00:59:32,843
- My gosh, no way. - I can't believe this.

730
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:34,103
- Is that really her? - Yes.

731
00:59:34,273 --> 00:59:36,073
- You look so pretty. - I'm a fan.

732

Unfortunately,

733
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:05,073
I realized this just as I figured out how I felt.

of a heart-fluttering love story like this...

738
01:00:26,893 --> 01:00:28,023
would be someone else.

741
01:01:34,463 --> 01:01:35,562
Did you not miss me?

It's not like he and I are dating.

01:01:39,933 --> 01:01:42,203
- Are you all right? - You're such a sweet guy.

745
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:44,533
Well, I'm kind of worried about her.

746
01:01:44,903 --> 01:01:46,103
Are you sure this isn't a crush?

747
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:47,843
Be careful, will you?

748
01:01:48,543 --> 01:01:49,543
You haven't changed.

749
01:01:50,013 --> 01:01:51,813
I thought I should tell you.

750
01:01:52,173 --> 01:01:54,182
I told you I was serious that time.

751
01:01:54,183 --> 01:01:55,243
What about you?

752
01:01:56,153 --> 01:01:57,313
My feelings for Bani...

753
01:01:58,713 --> 01:01:59,723
are genuine.
