(All places, organizations, characters,)

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,060
(incidents, and backstories in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:20,391
Let's go hang out somewhere else.

4
00:00:20,392 --> 00:00:21,392
Okay.

5
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,562
Wait for me.

6
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:31,872
When I was a kid,

7
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,342
I chose a fairy tale book based on...

8
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:37,311
its cover, whether it had a handsome man.

9
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:39,372
("The Crybaby Prince")

10
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:06,471
Getting the light and darkness right is important...

11
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:07,472
when drawing with a pencil.

12
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:09,672
Think of the lightest part as the origin.

13
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:12,872
Follow its path, and it gets darker. Easy, right?

14
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:15,242
That's when it hit me.

15
00:01:16,512 --> 00:01:19,211
My heart pounds at handsome men,

16
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,922
making me a softie for good looks.

17
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:33,961
I sublimated this overwhelming sensation...

18
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:35,402
into art.

19
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:42,242
With that, I got into the Sculpture Department.

20
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:04,891
You're unbelievable, Bani.

21
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:05,892
Exactly.

22
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:07,601
You have such discerning taste in art.

23
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:09,462
Your boyfriend must be a looker.

24
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:10,732
Bani!

25
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:20,382
The first boyfriend I have chosen is...

26
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:36,892
(Ko Bong Soo, Yein University, Bani's first-ever boyfriend)

27
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:39,332
Bong Soo!

28
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,742
Say hi to him. He's my boyfriend.

29
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:54,982
My name is Ko Bong Soo.

30
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:01,021
Bani must not care about looks when dating guys.

31
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:04,622
Right? I guess she only looks at the inner beauty.

32
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:15,702
(Kwon Bo Bae, Nam Kot Nim)

33
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:18,972
Don't you go for looks?

34
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:20,442
Why are you dating him?

35
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:27,482
Bani!

36
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:30,382
I like you.

37
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,222
I'm serious.

38
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:42,492
I like you.

39
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:43,562
(I like you.)

40
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:52,202
I like you!

41
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:03,282
(I like you.)

42
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:05,352
Isn't it obvious?

43
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:07,621
He adores me tons.

44
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,422
(Officially started dating)

45
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:15,992
That's all I need.

46
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:18,332
Nothing is more important than feelings.

47
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:21,232
Even so, this doesn't feel all that right.

48
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:24,701
What can we do about it?

49
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:27,502
As long as Bani is happy, we should be too.

50
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,042
Hello.

51
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:23,262
(Episode 1: A Dynamic New Semester)

52
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:47,482
Fresh air with zero fine dust.

53
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:49,652
A bright sunny day.

54
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:52,052
And the refreshing breeze.

55
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,022
Everything is perfect.

56
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:57,531
But of course, the most perfect thing is...

57
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:58,632
Bani!

58
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,532
Bong Soo!

59
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:05,772
Bani!

60
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:13,112
My undoubtedly happy love life.

61
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,781
Listen, Bani.

62
00:06:15,782 --> 00:06:18,152
How about a trip this weekend? The weather will be great.

63
00:06:18,282 --> 00:06:20,622
"A trip?" I love going on trips.

64
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:23,152
When should we go? Saturday or Sunday?

65
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:26,822
If you want, we can go on Saturday and return on Sunday.

66
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,561
You mean an overnight trip?

67
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:30,732
Yes. Is it a problem?

68
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,102
Oh, and this.

69
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:39,832
Ta-da.

70
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:42,471
What's this? Is it for me?

71
00:06:42,472 --> 00:06:43,472
Yes.

72
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:44,511
I bought it, thinking it'd look good on you.

73
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:45,512
Pretty, right?

74
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:47,241
It's gorgeous!

75
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:48,642
Hold on. Let me put it on you.

76
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:51,812
I'm getting nervous.

77
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:55,482
I'll put it on you.

78
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,182
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:23,712
Is that it?

80
00:07:23,782 --> 00:07:25,212
Do you think "I'm sorry" is enough?

81
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:27,282
- You bumped...
- Sorry.

82
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:29,952
- How dare you...
- Bong Soo.

83
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:31,921
- It still looks new.
- But he...

84
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:33,762
I can tell the pearls are real.

85
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,262
Watch where you're going, okay?

86
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:41,562
Bong Soo. How do I look?

87
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:44,072
Pretty, isn't it? I love it.

88
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,232
Right?

89
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:54,012
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

90
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,712
- Hey.
- Hi.

91
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:04,292
Kot Nim.

92
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:09,121
Here's your mocha latte.

93
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,932
- Enjoy.
- Wait.

94
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:13,191
You're my ideal type.

95
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,132
For real. You're so pretty.

96
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:17,702
I see.

97
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:20,242
But I've got the nastiest personality.

98
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:21,672
What?

99
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:23,142
Enjoy your coffee.

100
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:25,612
Right. Keep up the great work.

101
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,512
Bo Bae. Isn't this really pretty?

102
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:33,282
Bong Soo has great taste.

103
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,982
It's all right, but not great.

104
00:08:36,352 --> 00:08:37,422
"All right?"

105
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:39,422
How is this just "all right?"

106
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,561
Why are you so mean when it comes to my boyfriend?

107
00:08:42,562 --> 00:08:43,861
Stop it, will you?

108
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:45,692
If we're asking questions, let me ask you one.

109
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:47,601
You have high standards for men.

110
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:49,662
But why did you ignore your boyfriend's looks?

111
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:51,331
Is there a need to ask?

112
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:53,032
- It's because...
- Kwon Bo Bae.

113
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:58,012
What? Why are you here? Weren't you going straight home?

114
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,211
Didn't you say you needed this?

Thanks.

117
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:09,322
- Was your name Ban...
- It's Ban Hee Jin.

118
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:11,392
I remember telling you last time.

119
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,762
Did you?

120
00:09:16,062 --> 00:09:17,632
I'm leaving first. Keep up the good work.

121
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:18,792
Bye.

122
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,802
Look at him.

123
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:25,932
Good-looking guys like him have no interest in me.

124
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:28,971
Are you saying...

125
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:31,142
that's why looks don't matter to you for your boyfriend?

126
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:32,572
Stop kidding me.

127
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,882
I know that a face like his isn't good enough for you.

128
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:37,412
That's ridiculous.

129
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:40,952
I wonder if you can say that even when you meet someone...

130
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:42,682
incredibly handsome.

131
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,262
My gosh.

132
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,292
Oh, no.

133
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:22,492
Oh, my gosh.

Oh, right. Let's see.

The girls were all so pretty.

150
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,411
Of course. And I agree with you.

Oh, yes! She's a beauty.

don't say it behind their back.

- Hi.

I see. As expected of the department rep.

(Jung Geun Cheol)

187
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:26,142
Oh, wait.

188
00:13:27,612 --> 00:13:28,642
Hello?

189
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:32,052
Of course. What did I say? It won't be before long.

190
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:33,681
Who's that?

191
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,581
Go on the trip, and it's a done deal.

192
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,352
I already dropped a hint about being an overnight one.

193
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:46,562
You know, right?

194
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:49,102
How much effort I've put into sleeping with Bani.

195
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:51,432
- Is he crazy?
- What in the world?

196
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,342
Yes. Bani, no matter what.

197
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:57,171
I've been looking for the chance to sleep with her...

198
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:58,772
since the day we started dating.

199
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:02,081
Gosh, but she was playing so hard to get.

200
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:04,812
I'm telling you, I couldn't even make any attempts.

201
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,781
I'm not sure if she's quick-witted...

202
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:09,221
- or really slow.
- What?

203
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:10,222
Hey, Yeol.

204
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:12,251
- What's this broadcast?
- I pulled cheap tricks,

205
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:13,721
- suggesting we rest somewhere, - What is he talking about?

206
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,022
but it didn't work.

207
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,531
That's why I'll make her drink...

208
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:19,192
the second we get to the destination.

209
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:23,232
He's talking about Bani, right?

210
00:14:23,632 --> 00:14:25,232
I'm going to kill that punk today.

211
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:28,172
Since we'll be drunk,

212
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:30,771
she'll get the message if I humour her...

213
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:31,812
and get the mood going.

214
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,952
Hey. Did you seriously sweet-talk her into it?

215
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,552
My wish is her command.

216
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:43,081
For real?

217
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,522
Honestly, aren't I way out of her league?

218
00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:48,192
I hit on her because she looked easy, okay?

219
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:49,462
Seriously?

220
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:51,932
I'll just keep hitting on her.

221
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:53,462
Why are you dating her?

222
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,802
Simply put, to sleep with her.

223
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:02,342
- Gosh.
- I told you, didn't I?

224
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,242
That she was easy.

225
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:15,721
I'll make it happen for sure for all the time...

226
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:17,052
and effort I put into her.

227
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,892
What? That necklace?

228
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:23,162
I used it to soften her up to go on the trip.

229
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,332
It's fake anyway.

230
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:28,202
Looking for one that looked identical was tough.

231
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:34,202
Hey! What a wacko.

232
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:35,972
What?

233
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,472
The mic.

234
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:42,682
Oh, my.

235
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:46,452
Bani.

236
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:51,392
Bani! Oh, no!

237
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:56,522
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:12,972
We'd like to make an announcement.

239
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,641
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience...

240
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:17,181
caused to the students of Yein University...

241
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:19,012
due to incorrect broadcast content.

242
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:21,882
- My gosh.
- We'd like to apologize once again.

243
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,851
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience...

244
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:26,592
caused to the students of Yein University...

245
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:28,822
due to incorrect broadcast content.

246
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:35,432
(Bong)

247
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:46,442
Oh, Hee Jin.

248
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,512
So it's...

249
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,112
It's...

250
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,812
It's all my fault.

251
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:56,181
But you're misunderstanding what I said.

252
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,182
I didn't mean it.

253
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,251
You're saying I'm misunderstanding after saying those things yourself?

254
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,062
I was just trying to show off to my friend...

255
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:02,661
and went overboard.

256
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:04,332
Do you think it makes sense?

257
00:17:04,462 --> 00:17:06,531
It's true.

258
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:08,731
You know how much I like you.

259
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:09,832
Please believe me.

260
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:14,302
You jerk.

261
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:16,241
He's Ko Bong Soo who studies Philosophy.

262
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:17,242
Hey.

263
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,312
You're not even human.

264
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:22,442
It's humiliating.

265
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:27,982
It's Ban Hee Jin.

266
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,092
I can't do this anymore.

267
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:35,792
Hey.

268
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:37,792
You should also stop pretending.

269
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:39,862
Did you really not know my intention?

270
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:43,102
You wanted it too. Don't act like a victim only now.

271
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,332
What? Why?

272
00:17:47,672 --> 00:17:49,242
You were all smiles when things were good.

273
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:50,472
But now you're embarrassed...

274
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:51,672
because your true colours might be exposed in front of everyone?

275
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:54,812
You're nothing special, but I've been putting up with you.

276
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:58,252
You're nothing special, but I've been putting up with you.

277
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:26,912
Hey.

278
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,512
I'm going to say this just once, so listen carefully.

279
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:31,811
I only dated you...

280
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:33,982
because you begged desperately.

281
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,752
Hey, I could meet a good-looking guy too!

282
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:40,492
Don't you dare show me that face from now on.

283
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:42,422
It's your lucky day.

284
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:43,692
You jerk!

285
00:18:55,572 --> 00:18:57,302
Oh, my gosh. That was unbelievable.

286
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:04,341
The call cannot be connected.

287
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:05,842
She's not picking up.

288
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,241
Gosh. Seriously?

289
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,312
(Real-time Fiery Fist at Yein University)

290
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:11,512
(Gosh, Fiery Fist at Yein University is here.)

291
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:13,111
(- That guy is trash. - He should drop out of school.)

292
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,112
(But honestly, the girl has an issue too.)

293
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,782
Are they crazy?

294
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,892
"She brought it upon herself?"

295
00:20:18,522 --> 00:20:19,691
Are they joking?

296
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:21,061
(- Fiery Fist at Yein University. - This is going to be so fun.)

297
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:22,561
(Ban Hee Jin, Sculpture Department, Yein University)

298
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:24,162
(- It's embarrassing. - I'm so glad she punched him.)

299
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:49,982
Bani.

300
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:16,412
It's all my fault.

301
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,911
What are you talking about? It's not your fault.

302
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:20,921
He's trash.

303
00:21:20,922 --> 00:21:21,922
No.

304
00:21:23,422 --> 00:21:25,622
Just because he said he liked me,

305
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:28,962
I let him have his way.

306
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:31,192
I like you.

307
00:21:31,662 --> 00:21:32,732
I like you!

308
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,232
I'm just...

309
00:21:39,202 --> 00:21:41,402
I'm just regretting everything.

310
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,502
What do you regret the most?

311
00:21:45,342 --> 00:21:47,242
The fact that I thought it was all good...

312
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:50,312
as long as he liked me.

313
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:54,282
Actually, what was the most important...

314
00:21:56,752 --> 00:21:58,192
was my feelings.

315
00:21:59,692 --> 00:22:01,392
It's okay because you know now.

316
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:04,092
What's important is the future.

317
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:06,191
The future?

318
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,192
Yes.

319
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:10,602
The future?

320
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:25,952
I've made up my mind.

321
00:22:28,622 --> 00:22:29,722
Listen carefully.

322
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:36,522
I'm going to start dating good-looking people too!

323
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:42,762
There you go!

324
00:22:43,032 --> 00:22:45,802
That's what I wanted to hear for so long!

325
00:22:45,972 --> 00:22:47,772
Yes. Go for it.

326
00:22:48,372 --> 00:22:49,541
Please do that.

327
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:51,612
I dated someone who said he liked me,

328
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,442
but he turned out to be trash anyway.

329
00:22:55,512 --> 00:22:57,382
I just want to have a crush...

330
00:22:58,512 --> 00:23:00,652
on someone I like too.

331
00:23:09,662 --> 00:23:11,032
She's sleeping so quietly.

332
00:23:11,662 --> 00:23:12,762
Is she dead?

333
00:23:14,632 --> 00:23:15,801
Fortunately, she's breathing.

334
00:23:15,802 --> 00:23:16,802
(Kim Hyun Kyung, Bani's mother, Ban Yeong Min, Bani's father)

335
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:19,901
- Oh, my goodness.
- Gosh.

336
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:22,601
If you're up, wash up quickly and eat.

337
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:24,411
I've made a refreshing hangover soup for you.

338
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:26,041
How about the other girls?

339
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:28,212
They had breakfast and left a long time ago.

340
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:31,512
Gosh, stop dawdling and get up quickly. You should go to school.

341
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:35,451
I should. I should go to school.

342
00:23:35,452 --> 00:23:37,252
I should go and take a leave of absence.

343
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,452
- "A leave of absence?" - "A leave of absence?"

344
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,402
Honey.

345
00:23:49,632 --> 00:23:51,372
Can you ask Bani...

346
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:54,502
if she really wants to take a leave of absence?

347
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:55,842
I will.

348
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,342
Oh, gosh.

349
00:23:58,472 --> 00:24:00,941
What's the reason this time?

350
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:01,981
Why do you want to take time off...

351
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,982
as soon as the new semester starts again?

352
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:05,581
- "Again?" - "Again?"

353
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:06,582
Yes.

354
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,351
Don't you remember?

355
00:24:08,352 --> 00:24:09,721
You said you wanted to move to another school...

356
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:11,121
as soon as the new semester began and made a fuss.

357
00:24:11,122 --> 00:24:13,492
Oh, right.

358
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:15,492
I remember.

359
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:20,731
Let me go to another school!

360
00:24:20,732 --> 00:24:21,801
Let me move!

361
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:24,872
Bani, no matter how much you want to do it,

362
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:29,472
you can't follow the student teacher to go to school in Gangwon Province!

363
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:30,672
What about it?

364
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:32,741
The water is clean, the air is nice, and it makes me happy.

365
00:24:32,742 --> 00:24:36,042
What's wrong with that? Just let me go!

366
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:43,652
Coming.

367
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,152
Oh, gosh.

368
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:49,062
Hello.

369
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,961
We moved in next door today.

370
00:24:51,962 --> 00:24:53,992
And my mother asked me to give you some rice cakes.

371
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:56,861
Oh, yes.

372
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,572
I heard someone was moving in. Was it today?

373
00:25:00,172 --> 00:25:02,542
- You didn't have to do this.
- Thank you.

374
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,712
He was her first love.

375
00:25:13,752 --> 00:25:16,151
If it weren't for him,

376
00:25:16,152 --> 00:25:17,851
she would've moved to Gangwon Province.

377
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:18,891
Oh, gosh.

378
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,092
No. He's not the reason I didn't go.

379
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:23,322
Anyway,

380
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:26,462
I've made up my mind for sure this time. So don't stop me.

381
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:32,332
- I'll get going.
- All right.

382
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:41,011
If a strikingly handsome guy appears,

383
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:43,582
she'll never say she'll take a leave of absence again.

384
00:25:44,782 --> 00:25:46,952
- A handsome guy like you.
- What?

385
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:49,622
What is this? A signal?

386
00:25:50,522 --> 00:25:51,921
Shall we go to the room?

387
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:53,022
I'm ready.

388
00:25:57,692 --> 00:25:59,832
(Application for Leave of Absence)

389
00:26:13,742 --> 00:26:15,412
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

390
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,812
I'm kind of lost.

391
00:26:18,082 --> 00:26:19,582
Do you know how to get to the library?

392
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:51,682
What is this perfectly measured beauty?

393
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,822
Is this the Renaissance...

394
00:26:55,252 --> 00:26:56,452
I've only heard about?

395
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:06,632
Or...

396
00:27:07,332 --> 00:27:09,902
is it a golden ratio of a Greek sculpture?

397
00:27:20,812 --> 00:27:22,042
He has charm.

398
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,482
He has great charm.

399
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:31,321
I feel like he would be choosing flowers...

400
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:32,992
with sad eyes somehow.

401
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:36,892
At that moment, the owner of the flower shop comes out and asks.

402
00:27:37,762 --> 00:27:39,792
Is it for your girlfriend?

403
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:42,002
Then he smiles without a word.

404
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,702
I don't know why. He just has to.

405
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:50,401
Then...

406
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,412
he puts the flowers in a vase beautifully.

407
00:27:55,982 --> 00:27:57,812
Let me tell you where he is.

408
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,212
It's his sick girlfriend's hospital room.

409
00:28:02,152 --> 00:28:03,382
How are you feeling today?

410
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,321
Then his delicate and dainty girlfriend...

411
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:07,522
would answer.

412
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:13,962
"Same as always."

413
00:28:14,632 --> 00:28:17,702
Oh, my gosh. Why does she have my face?

414
00:28:17,802 --> 00:28:19,532
Get it together, Ban Hee Jin.

415
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:29,282
I'm sorry. I was thinking about something else for a moment.

416
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:31,412
Where do you want to go again?

417
00:28:31,452 --> 00:28:33,982
Where is the library?

418
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:35,482
What?

419
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,751
Is this...

420
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:39,552
(Sculpting Technique)

421
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:41,092
Are you a freshman in the Sculpture Department?

422
00:28:41,692 --> 00:28:43,362
No, I'm not.

423
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,962
Mom, Dad, I've made up my mind.

424
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,132
I'll never leave Yein University.

425
00:28:54,702 --> 00:28:56,842
Let's go. I'll take you there.

426
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:06,382
Why were you by yourself?

427
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,382
Did you not make friends yet?

428
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:11,022
I'm a bit shy around new people.

429
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:13,322
I see.

430
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,762
It's okay. I understand it can be awkward.

431
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:17,492
You bumped into me thanks to that.

432
00:29:19,432 --> 00:29:20,691
Actually, I'm the Sculpture Department's representative...

433
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:21,932
this semester.

434
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:24,331
If you don't know anything, feel free to ask me.

435
00:29:24,332 --> 00:29:25,502
I'll tell you everything.

436
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:27,332
Sure.

437
00:29:27,972 --> 00:29:29,772
How about your course registration? Did it go well?

438
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,342
It must've been hard as a freshman.

439
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:32,811
I was a bit late,

440
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,572
so I just registered for the remaining classes.

441
00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:36,682
You did? You probably don't have a long break between classes then.

442
00:29:36,912 --> 00:29:37,982
It's a bummer.

443
00:29:38,212 --> 00:29:39,351
I would've scheduled all the classes for you...

444
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:40,482
if we had met just a week earlier.

445
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,582
Oh, have you tried the special meal at school?

446
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,552
You must try it.

447
00:29:45,022 --> 00:29:47,091
Actually, it's a little expensive.

448
00:29:47,092 --> 00:29:48,162
Let's eat together...

449
00:29:48,592 --> 00:29:49,922
next time.

450
00:29:52,032 --> 00:29:53,192
Yes. Let's do that.

451
00:29:55,918 --> 00:29:56,862
(Main Library)

452
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:58,502
Thank you for taking me.

453
00:29:58,832 --> 00:30:01,442
No need to thank me. I just did what I should do.

454
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:03,741
If there's something you don't know,

455
00:30:03,742 --> 00:30:05,942
feel free to contact me at the number I gave you earlier.

456
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:08,212
I have a lot of past exam papers.

457
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:09,382
Okay.

458
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,211
I'll get going then.

459
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:13,752
Let's definitely meet up next time.

460
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:15,252
Okay.

461
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:17,152
Bye.

462
00:31:06,572 --> 00:31:07,702
No way.

463
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:10,902
Who is that man possessing sublime beauty?

464
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:14,542
A sharp jawline, a cold gaze,

465
00:31:15,012 --> 00:31:16,082
and chilly lips.

466
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,152
There's something to him.

467
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,152
There's definitely something to him.

468
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,252
Even the hottest summer weather would be blasted away.

469
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:30,322
He has that refreshing vibe to him.

470
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:33,662
Let's see. On the back of his bike...

471
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:36,602
would be his high school sweetheart.

472
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,302
That girlfriend of his...

473
00:31:39,502 --> 00:31:43,042
must have dark hair with dark eyes...

474
00:31:44,842 --> 00:31:45,872
Me?

475
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:09,901
Why did I add my face again?

476
00:32:09,902 --> 00:32:12,372
Stop picturing you with them, Ban Hee Jin.

477
00:32:14,472 --> 00:32:16,542
I'm glad I didn't take time off from school.

478
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:19,272
This is the Almighty telling me to stay.

479
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,422
("The Ultimate Male Divinity" by Ban Hee Jin aka Bani)

480
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:48,802
I see you have good taste.

481
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:51,502
It's by the top second-year student in our department.

482
00:32:51,942 --> 00:32:54,212
With this piece, she received the highest score in history.

483
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,781
When it comes to artistic talent,

484
00:32:56,782 --> 00:32:58,012
she'll be the most famous.

485
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:03,982
Hold on.

486
00:33:04,352 --> 00:33:06,352
You kind of look like him.

487
00:33:08,622 --> 00:33:10,162
Even more with that smile.

488
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:13,232
Enjoy.

489
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,602
What's his problem?

490
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:06,052
That was unbelievably annoying.

491
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:15,422
Excuse me.

492
00:34:16,462 --> 00:34:18,062
I was just about to put my things in it.

493
00:34:20,132 --> 00:34:21,132
So?

494
00:34:24,402 --> 00:34:25,672
Shouldn't it go...

495
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:27,602
to whoever occupies it first?

496
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:44,122
I can finally function again.

497
00:34:44,422 --> 00:34:46,222
Nothing cures a hangover like cream buns.

498
00:34:46,322 --> 00:34:47,551
What you're saying...

499
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,391
is that you ran into not 1 but 2 handsome guys.

500
00:34:49,392 --> 00:34:50,392
Back to back.

501
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:53,392
I had no idea our campus was this beautiful.

502
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,862
The campus...

503
00:34:55,632 --> 00:34:56,662
is full of light.

504
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:57,932
Is it bright?

505
00:34:59,272 --> 00:35:00,302
Lucky you.

506
00:35:00,402 --> 00:35:02,642
I'd also like to encounter good looking guys like that.

507
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:03,771
Tell me about it.

508
00:35:03,772 --> 00:35:06,412
We had better things to do then work on our art.

509
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:09,411
The new semester event is keeping us from having our eyes blessed.

510
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:12,112
Still, they look pretty when gathered like this.

511
00:35:12,252 --> 00:35:13,812
They remind me of cherry blossoms.

512
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,281
I'd love to have...

513
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:18,592
cherry blossom petals flutter around me and my boo.

514
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:23,522
I doubt that's in my cards though.

515
00:35:24,462 --> 00:35:26,792
It wouldn't be impossible if you put your mind to it.

516
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:28,762
You vowed to only date good-looking guys.

517
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:30,861
Enjoy cherry blossoms, lock eyes with love,

518
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,571
smack those lips together, and do it all.

519
00:35:32,572 --> 00:35:34,472
You're taking it too far with the kissing.

520
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:48,582
(Student Council Room)

521
00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:06,802
Creative Work of Art by Youth.

522
00:36:07,002 --> 00:36:08,432
We need to get in.

523
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:10,302
Can we submit it by tomorrow?

524
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,172
- I'm almost done.
- Okay.

525
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:16,012
Let's do this, Yeol. Let's get us a room.

526
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,512
I'm done on my end.

527
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:20,012
I hope they get us a room.

528
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:22,122
We'll have a studio free of charge.

529
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:24,052
I hear they have other benefits too.

530
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,451
We'll get in.

531
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:27,192
I stayed up countless nights trying to finish this.

532
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,262
Jae Yeol.

533
00:36:30,162 --> 00:36:31,192
This is for you.

534
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,232
Sure. Thanks.

535
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:41,272
Jae Yeol, you're the best.

536
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:45,972
This is why you're my role model.

537
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:48,171
The one who stole women's hearts as soon as the semester began.

538
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,212
Who could he be?

539
00:36:49,282 --> 00:36:52,512
He's my pride and joy as well as yours.

540
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,182
- Moreover, the whole department...
- Hey. Shut it.

541
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,252
If you're going to be loud, take this and get lost.

542
00:37:01,822 --> 00:37:03,922
Could us humble beings have something this precious?

543
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,032
- Are you sure?
- Are you sure?

544
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:11,872
- We'll enjoy it.
- Thank you.

545
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:30,922
That should do it.

546
00:37:35,662 --> 00:37:38,632
(Yeinies)

547
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:40,032
Unbelievable.

548
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:45,671
Have you ever gotten anything like this before?

549
00:37:45,672 --> 00:37:46,972
Of course I have.

550
00:37:48,272 --> 00:37:50,572
Talk about a human air purifier.

551
00:37:52,072 --> 00:37:53,211
How refreshing.

552
00:37:53,212 --> 00:37:54,442
Yeol, have one.

553
00:37:54,642 --> 00:37:56,241
- It's yours, so have one.
- I'm good.

554
00:37:56,242 --> 00:37:57,611
- He's right.
- Thanks to you...

555
00:37:57,612 --> 00:37:59,181
We got it thanks to you, so have one.

556
00:37:59,182 --> 00:38:00,781
- At least have one.
- Have this instead, then.

557
00:38:00,782 --> 00:38:02,351
- Go on.
- I'm good.

558
00:38:02,352 --> 00:38:04,322
- Open wide.
- I said I was good.

559
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:06,452
Watch out!

560
00:38:38,722 --> 00:38:39,752
Are you all right?

561
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:41,752
I hope you weren't hurt.

562
00:38:43,892 --> 00:38:44,922
What a relief.

563
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:47,092
That...

564
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:50,802
Oh, no.

565
00:38:51,502 --> 00:38:52,532
My gosh.

566
00:38:53,702 --> 00:38:55,342
Did it crack?

567
00:38:56,472 --> 00:38:57,902
Check, will you? See if it's still working.

568
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:01,172
What about our work?

569
00:39:28,402 --> 00:39:30,402
(Yeinies)

570
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,122
What now?

571
00:39:42,552 --> 00:39:44,652
Our blood, sweat, and tears were in that.

572
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:46,292
Well,

573
00:39:47,122 --> 00:39:50,792
I only reacted thinking you were in danger.

574
00:39:54,532 --> 00:39:56,602
This was never my intention.

575
00:40:00,802 --> 00:40:02,902
I should've known better and I'm sorry.

576
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,072
Please forgive me.

577
00:40:08,212 --> 00:40:09,242
Whatever.

578
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:12,712
What will you do about my tablet?

579
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,422
Of course I should pay for a new one.

580
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,522
Do you even know how much it costs?

581
00:40:18,722 --> 00:40:21,191
Well, I'll do what I can to...

582
00:40:21,192 --> 00:40:22,792
(Tablet Pro 13 Gen 7 WiFi 256GB Gray, 2,000 dollars)

583
00:40:25,762 --> 00:40:26,832
Is it 2,000 dollars?

584
00:40:28,132 --> 00:40:29,202
Is that 2,000 dollars?

585
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:31,032
That costs 2,000 dollars?

586
00:40:31,202 --> 00:40:32,272
That's expensive.

587
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:38,742
Would it be possible...

588
00:40:39,612 --> 00:40:41,342
to pay you back monthly?

589
00:40:42,012 --> 00:40:43,642
Does she think he's a department store?

590
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,611
Who pays back on an instalment basis?

591
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:46,812
We could at least give her three months.

592
00:40:46,982 --> 00:40:49,422
I'll get you the money as soon as possible.

593
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:50,982
I'm...

594
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:53,592
I'm terribly sorry.

595
00:41:03,162 --> 00:41:04,232
- Wait.
- Hold on.

596
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:08,072
Your number.

597
00:41:09,772 --> 00:41:11,302
Give me your number before you go.

598
00:41:19,782 --> 00:41:21,381
Hi.

599
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:23,252
- Hey.
- What took you so long?

- Are you doing better?
- What?

604
00:41:34,362 --> 00:41:35,432
What? Why?

605
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,162
You were all smiles when things were good.

606
00:41:37,402 --> 00:41:38,531
But now you're embarrassed...

607
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:39,632
because your true colours might be exposed in front of everyone?

608
00:41:39,902 --> 00:41:42,031
You're nothing special, but I've been putting up with you.

609
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,101
Right, I forgot.

610
00:41:43,102 --> 00:41:45,471
I'm the pushover girlfriend of Yein University.

611
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,672
Of course I'm all right.

612
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,142
I had been all right.

613
00:41:57,022 --> 00:41:58,052
That's a relief.

614
00:41:58,122 --> 00:42:00,321
I was seriously worried...

615
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:01,722
that you might take time off from school.

616
00:42:04,092 --> 00:42:05,162
I know.

617
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:08,932
Maybe I should consider that.

618
00:42:22,442 --> 00:42:23,841
Why should I...

619
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,582
when life is this beautiful?

620
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:28,752
You came.

621
00:42:28,982 --> 00:42:30,181
- Have a seat here.
- Sure.

622
00:42:30,182 --> 00:42:31,682
He's so handsome!

623
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,122
No way.

624
00:42:37,162 --> 00:42:38,492
Attention, please.

625
00:42:38,862 --> 00:42:41,262
We'll start with Group A.

One by one,

627
00:42:42,862 --> 00:42:44,832
you'll introduce yourselves.

628
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,571
Finally, a hottie joined our department.

629
00:42:47,572 --> 00:42:49,202
Right? Isn't it a joy?

630
00:42:49,342 --> 00:42:50,901
- By the way, how did you...
- Hello.

631
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,512
get to know the grandson of Chaon Group's chairman?

632
00:42:52,642 --> 00:42:54,471
- Freshman of 2025...
- I was startled to say the least.

633
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:57,442
- I hope we get along.
- You see, on my way to school...

634
00:43:00,782 --> 00:43:02,282
- I'm next.
- Hold on.

635
00:43:02,352 --> 00:43:03,982
- Hello.
- What was that?

636
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:05,352
Chaon Group.

637
00:43:06,022 --> 00:43:07,722
He's the grandson of the group's chairman.

638
00:43:08,692 --> 00:43:09,762
Didn't you know?

639
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,432

647

will be your partner for the year.

- Hi.
- Hello.

651
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,861
Should I pour you a drink since you're my senior?

652
00:43:49,862 --> 00:43:50,862
What?

653
00:43:50,863 --> 00:43:52,972
Gosh, why would you call me that?

654
00:43:53,572 --> 00:43:54,831
Allow me to pour you a glass.

655
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,202
Don't be absurd. I should pour you one first...

656
00:43:57,442 --> 00:43:58,572
since you're my senior partner.

657
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:00,542
Gosh, please.

Besides, I can't handle any alcohol.

660
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,752
It was to get you to ease up.

661
00:44:06,882 --> 00:44:08,752
Be comfortable around me.

662
00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:10,582
How could I?

663
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:13,892
Not when I found out something huge.

664
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:16,322
You're the grandson of Chaon Group's chairman.

666
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:21,092
