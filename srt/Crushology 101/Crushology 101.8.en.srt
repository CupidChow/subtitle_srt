Please introduce yourself.

5
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,240
Hi.

6
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,680
I'm Cha Ji Won in the Sculpture Department.

7
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,910
How good-looking!

8
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,290
Do you two already know each other?

9
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,690
Yes.

I'm Bani's partner's junior.

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,160
Ji Won mustered up the courage to come onstage.

12
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,530
It's a waste to let him go just like that, right?

13
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,130
- Yes!
- Yes!

14
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,100
In the hopes that Ji Won's feelings...

15
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,740
are delivered well to Hee Jin,

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,740
how about a ten-second eye contact?

17
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,580
- Yes!
- Yes!

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,990

26

Are you two going out starting today?

27
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,200
Well...

28
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,530
No wonder you hung out together every day.

29
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,100
It was weird you weren't dating each other.

30
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,670
Since it's late, let's tidy up what's necessary today...

31
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,900
and continue tomorrow.

32
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,070
Okay.

33
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,140
Let's go.

34
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,610
Wait for me.

35
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,010
Ji Won.

36
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,080
Why did you come up onstage?

37
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,320
That's because...

38
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,920
I wrote the card.

39
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,460
You're the one who actually wrote it?

40
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,140
You've been looking down since earlier.

41
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,940
Did something unpleasant happen?

42
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,880
Why didn't you tell me that someone dropped by my house...

43
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,650
when I was asleep?

44
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,720
I did...

45
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,020
say that a friend came by.

46
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,060
Yeo Reum.

47
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,230
Your taxi is here.

48
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,530
I see.

49
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,630
- Okay. I'll be right there.
- Great.

50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Sir. She's on her way.

51
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,620
Why are you still here?

52
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,030
You're not in the student council.

53
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,890
To help Bani out.

54
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,970
Why did you go up onstage earlier?

55
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,470
That card.

56
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,970
You didn't write it, did you?

57
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,210
Why do you think I didn't?

58
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,280
Or else what?

59
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,380
- Did you write it?
- That's...

60
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,380
Whatever.

61
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,420
I don't need to hear it.

62
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,590
If you wrote the confession...

63
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,560
but didn't appear before Bani,

64
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,830
that'd mean your feelings weren't that serious.

65
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,300
You've...

66
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,270
changed.

67
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,110
You're crossing the line a lot...

68
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,850
for a guy she's just friends with.

69
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,090
You're right.

70
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,490
I am crossing the line.

71
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,630
I saw you struggling to make up your mind.

72
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,430
I just can't let Bani date...

73
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,600
someone like you.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's why...

75
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,640
I'll go to her.

76
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
To Bani.

77
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
Bani.

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,900
We need to talk.

79
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,540
About what?

80
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,970
It's something private.

81
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,410
Text me when you're free.

82
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,610

It's a waste to let him go just like that, right?

thank you to the two who came up onstage.

We hope you have a happy ending.

111
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,180
- Great work.
- Great work.

112
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,920
Gosh, it took two hours just to tidy things up.

113
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,790
I know, right?

114
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,020
It would've taken us much longer had you not helped us.

- It's nothing. Great work.

By the way, where did the camera we left there go?

118
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,430
Yeol took it yesterday to transfer the data.

119
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,140
For real? This is bad.

120
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,970
What's wrong?

121
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,880
The camera we used for our social media photos is in there.

122
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,010
I'll call Yeol and have him bring it over now.

123
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,610
Let me go get it.

124
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,790
Doesn't Yeol have to put together...

125
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,350
the festival footage by today?

126
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,520
With how busy he is,

127
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,190
having him come here for that feels wrong.

128
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,500
True. Then I'll leave it to you, Bani.

129
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,600
Bani.

130
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,570
But...

131
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,840
does it have to be you?

132
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,870
What?

133
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,340
The one getting the camera.

134
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,510
Someone else can do it.

135
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,620
He wanted to talk.

136
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,550
I might as well hear him out while I'm getting the camera.

137
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,400
Bani.

138
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Don't date anyone who makes you wonder about his intention.

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,570
(See you later at 7pm.)

140
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,490
You looking down yesterday bothered me too much.

141
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,420
You haven't eaten yet, right?

142
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,130
Your studio is better than I imagined.

143
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,000
How did you know this place?

144
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,600
Ho Dong told me.

145
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,270
And it seems like you've wrapped up your work.

146
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,350
I came at the perfect time.

147
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,650
I've got nothing to say to you.

148
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,320
Leave.

149
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,750
Come on.

150
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,920
I'll leave after we eat this.

151
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,420
The festival was tiresome.

152
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,930
Think of this as our little after-party.

153
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,230
I'll leave if you won't.

154
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Yeol.

155
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,740
Fine.

156
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,750
Let's hear it since you came willingly.

157
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,980
What was that reason of yours?

158
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,990
Weren't I a burden?

159
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,060
You and I together looked lousy, no?

160
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,590
I thought about what you meant for ages, but I couldn't get it.

161
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,430
While my imagination ran wild,

162
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,330
you had left for your exchange program.

163
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,540
I realized that moment...

164
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,810
that you had already thought of breaking up with me.

165
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,980
I had no idea, like some fool,

166
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,450
then got ghosted.

167
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,950
All right.

168
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,920
Tell me.

169
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,350
Why did you leave me like that?

170
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,260
What did I do that was so wrong to you?

171
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,330
I can finally breathe after all that self-blame.

172
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,430
But why did you have to appear now and make a mess of me again?

173
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,600
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,210
I had no idea you'd be in so much pain.

175
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,910
I just...

176
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,350
Back then, I just thought that would protect our relationship.

177
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,810
So tell me, will you?

178
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,750
What is the reason?

179
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,160
See?

180
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,490
You're not going to tell me.

181
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,530
Even now, you're looking down on me.

182
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,900
And you planned to return to me?

183
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,710
Don't make me laugh.

184
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,280
I will never...

185
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,120
go back to that time.

186
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,380
We need to talk.

187
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,850
It's something private.

188
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,150
Text me when you're free.

189
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,420
I'll be waiting.

190
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,020
Are you here to see Yeol?

191
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,690
I'm here to get something.

192
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,890
I see.

193
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,970
I came for this.

194
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,270
Bye.

196
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,650
Do you...

197
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,590
have feelings for Yeol?

198
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,820
Sorry?

199
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,460
The two of us...

200
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,700
had to be apart for a reason...

201
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,730
and didn't break up for good.

202
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Yeol.

203
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,500
He will come back to me soon.

204
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,810
I thought it'd be good for you...

205
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,480
to make it clear.

206
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,850
What if he doesn't go back?

207
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,790
- What?
- It's just an assumption.

208
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,230
We'll handle it ourselves.

Oh, Ji Won.

218
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,770
What brings you here?

219
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,400
I came to pick you up.

220
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,000
- All the way here?
- Yes.

221
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,470
I want to go to school with you.

222
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,250
Oh, my gosh.

223
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,690
Are you wearing perfume?

224
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,060
Yes.

225
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,290
Why? Do you not like it?

226
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,490
No, it's really nice.

227
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,930
That's a relief. I chose it after much thought.

228
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,010
How did the conversation go yesterday?

229
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,740
With Yeol?

230
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,510
I couldn't meet him.

231
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,190
Excuse me.

232
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,340
All good now.

233
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,410
Thanks.

234
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,580
Let's go.

(Main Library)

236
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,230
Hello.

237
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,130
Yes.

238
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,270
Did you borrow this book? I was looking for it too.

239
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,340
I see.

240
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,940
Unfortunately, only one person can borrow it.

241
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,710
Unlike humans,

242
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,110
books can only be read by one person at a time.

243
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,380
What?

244
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,750
I believe I picked this up a second earlier than you.

245
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,390
So I'm afraid I can't give it to you.

246
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,890
My self-respect won't allow me...

247
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,090
to give even this to you.

248
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,290
Goodbye then.

249
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,600
Gosh. But still,

250
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,640
don't worry too much.

251
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,140
I read fast.

252
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,610
I'll read it quickly and return it.

253
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,060
The festival was received so well...

254
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,260

I'd love to,

259
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,770
but I'm supposed to meet someone here.

260
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,070
- Let's eat together next time then.
- Sure.

261
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,680
- Bye.
- Bye.

264
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,990

It's Yeol.

268
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,710
- Yeol.
- Yeol.

269
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,640

She is.

Oh, my gosh.

277

287
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,420

- It's over for her, isn't it?
- "Fraud?"

Are you all right? The company is in complete chaos.

It's Han Yeo Reum.

- What is she going to do now?
- Is this true?

299
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,130
- Is this true?
- If this is true, it's horrible.

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,700
- How many victims are there?
- I think it's true.

00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,570
You said you were just saying it.

371
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,480
Mom.

372
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,880
I'm going to break up with Yeol.

373
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,650
So...

374
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,580
if you borrow money from his mother...

375
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,990
just one more time,

376
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,920
we're over too.

377
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,360
Got it?

378
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,890
Don't you ever...

379
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,630
contact his mother again.

380
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,670
I don't understand.

381
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,800
We were fine until yesterday.

382
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,440
- How can you break up with me now?
- It's just...

383
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,310
that you're...

384
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,780
too much for me.

385
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,350
What?

386
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,260
I don't like who I am...

387
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,990
when I'm with you.

388
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,470
I left Seoul after that...

389
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,880
to study for the exam and work part-time.

390
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,210
What about the exchange student thing?

391
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,320
It was an excuse.

392
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,630
If you were struggling that much,

393
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,330
- why didn't you tell me even once?
- Because I didn't want you...

394
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,270
to find out about it.

395
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,840
At least to you,

396
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,650
I didn't want to look pathetic.

397
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,880
If I did,

398
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,050
it would've killed me.

399
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,800
Don't look at me with pity in your eyes.

400
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,700
I'm perfectly fine now.

401
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,610
I did nothing wrong,

402
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,650
so a clarification statement will be released.

403
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,750
But what's even better...

404
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,150
is that you...

405
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,420
came to me.

406
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,130
I'm not the same person I used to be.

407
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,200
I won't leave you this time...

408
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,000
even though this blew up in my face again.

409
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,150
Gosh, I need to get out of here.

410
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,880
Yeol.

411
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,620
How about some fresh air?

412
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,120
Just this once.

413
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
Come on.

414
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,660
- Ten, nine, eight, - Ten, nine, eight,

415
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,830
- seven, six, five, - seven, six, five,

416
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,230
- four, three, two...
- four, three, two...

417
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,260
What is it?

418
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
What?

419
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,530
What do you mean?

420
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,670
Bani, you were looking at me.

421
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,540
Well,

422
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,280
I still feel bad that you got hurt because of me.

423
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,080
I'm also grateful.

424
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,080
If you're that grateful,

425
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,150
share a meal with me.

426
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,790
- What?
- Let's...

427
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,190
eat something delicious this weekend,

428
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,890
Bani.

429
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,060
We were adorable back then,

430
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,260
weren't we?

431
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,500
(Yeol and Yeo Reum)

432
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,660
Yeo Reum, wait.

433
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,230
Can we come in here like this?

434
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,930
Why not? We'll soon go here, won't we?

435
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,540
Hey, over there. Come on.

436
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,720
We'll take classes together here...

437
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,890
and eat together afterward.

438
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,160
Will we have the time for that when we're in different departments?

439
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,260
Hang on. Weren't you going to follow me around?

440
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,530
That's what couples on TV shows do.

441
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,440
Well,

442
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,900
that depends on how you do.

443
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,570
What? Seriously?

444
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,110
I can't have that.

445
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,950
I'm putting it in writing so you can't say otherwise.

446
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,860
(Yeol and...)

447
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,230
(Yeo Reum)

448
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,800
What do you think?

449
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,870
Don't I have pretty handwriting?

450
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,610
It's not as pretty as you.

451
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:53,150
(Yeol and Yeo Reum)

452
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,820
It's late now.

453
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,590
Let's go.

454
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,040
Come on.

455
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,780
Are you sure about that?

456
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
Hey, come on.

457
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,250
(Art Hall)

458
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,310
Bani, let's go.

459
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,830
We should also go.

460
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,120
Stay here for the night.

461
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:16,490
You can help yourself to the water and snacks in the fridge.

462
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,590
What about you?

463
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,060
I have work left to do for my project,

464
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,700
so I'll sleep at the studio.

465
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,880
Gosh, that's good.

466
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,650
- Bani, are you home?
- Yes.

467
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,360
What's going on? Why are you cooking for a change?

468
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,890
Oh, this?

469
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,060
It's our wedding anniversary tomorrow.

470
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,300
Your father works hard every day, preparing a nourishing dish for me,

471
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,830
so this is the least I can do.

472
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,730
I'm making a broth for the hot pot in advance.

473
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,670
Dad would love it.

474
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,110
What?

475
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,280
My daughter.

476
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,210
What is it?

477
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,080
What do you mean?

478
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,920
Is...

479
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,890
something up?

480
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,090
What?

481
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,060
You don't sound like yourself...

482
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,430
and seem paler than usual.

483
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,900
Are you okay?

484
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:45,880
No.

485
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,750
Goodness, Bani.

486
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,450
I'm not okay at all.

487
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,420
This is way too painful.

488
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,610
Did you sleep this uncomfortably all night?

489
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,180
Now I feel guilty.

490
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,110
I thought we could have breakfast together.

491
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,550
I packed a few things.

492
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,490
From now on,

493
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,320
I'll be sleeping at home again.

494
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,430
- Will you be all right?
- Yes.

495
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,900
A clarification statement was released.

496
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,100
Things died down, so I think I'll be fine.

497
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,140
That means you can sleep in your own bed again.

498
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:35,490
(Bani...)

499
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,900
(Bani, I like you!)

500
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,180
There's somewhere I wanted to go after breakfast.

501
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,010
Let's eat and head over there.

502
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,620
Why are we here?

503
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,120
You always wanted a turntable...

504
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,560
for your own studio.

505
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,330
I saw that you didn't have one.

506
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,400
- Forget it.
- Why?

507
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,130
I wanted to get you one for your birthday...

508
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,170
but never got around to it.

509
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,710
It's been eating away at me.

510
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,510
Excuse me.

511
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,720
Can this be delivered?

512
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,950
Yes, of course.

513
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,430
It's nice to be out on the weekend.

514
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,530
You can hit me up at any time.

515
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,110
This is so cute.

516
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,650
Umbrellas are over there.

517
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,020
Which do you prefer? This one?

518
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,330
Don't we only need one?

519
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,790
I doubt it'll rain all day.

520
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,230
Sure. We'll take this.

521
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,430
Okay.

522
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,200
- I'll get this for us.
- Sure.

523
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,320
It's pouring outside.

524
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,150
You should wait here. I'll buy us an umbrella.

525
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,090
You must be feeling hungry now.

526
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,760
Let's go eat.

527
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,700
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Come on.

528
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,150
I hope steak is okay.

529
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:54,950
I booked a table...

530
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:56,820
at our usual place.

531
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,590
What's on your mind?

532
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,530
It's nothing.

533
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,120
This place is stunning.

534
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,050
- The food here is really good.
- Really?

535
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:41,800
Hello.

536
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:45,230
We meet again.

537
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,000
I'm sorry.

538
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,310
We must have made a mistake.

539
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,640
I just checked our tables.

540
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,380
This four-person table is the only one available right now.

541
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,520
It sounds like you know each other. If you don't mind,

542
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,120
could you sit together?

543
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,660
If you're uncomfortable, we can go somewhere else.

544
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:13,890
No.

545
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:16,230
I don't mind if we sit together.

546
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,550
Enjoy.

547
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,950
Bani, try this too.

548
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,490
Okay. Thank you.

549
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:44,290
You must be quite happy, Hee Jin.

550
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:48,830
Your boyfriend seems like a sweet guy.

551
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,170
This crossed my mind when I saw you before.

552
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,170
You two...

553
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,910
make a good couple.

554
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:08,210
In a way, I acted as a matchmaker for you.

555
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,780
So this feels rewarding.

556
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,620
When I look at you two,

557
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,660
you remind me...

558
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,030
of me and Yeol when we started dating.

559
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,540
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

560
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,770
Wipe it with this.

561
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,240
My gosh, okay.

562
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,990
Excuse me. I'm going to use the restroom.

563
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,230
I'll need to use the restroom too.

564
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,370
What is this?

565
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,710
Ban Hee Jin.

566
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,350
You're so pathetic.

567
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,830
Are you dating him now?

568
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,900
Don't date him.

569
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,270
I don't want you to date him.

570
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,970
You're crossing the line right now. You know that, right?

571
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:43,940
Why do you care whether or not I'm dating Won?

572
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,950
- It's none of your business.
- No, it is my business.

573
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,820
Why do you keep torturing me like this?

574
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,390
Why do you keep stealing my attention?

575
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,190
Why did you come to a place like this with him?

576
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,720
And why do you keep bothering me in my head?

577
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,330
Seriously.

578
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,900
You're driving me crazy.

579
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:16,510
Exactly.

580
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:20,180
Let's not pay attention to each other now.

581
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,920
So we don't bother each other.

582
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,170
Are your clothes okay?

583
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:48,610
Yes. I think I can just wash them.

584
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,910
I'm sorry for the disturbance.

585
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,520
Don't be.

586
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,430
Bani, why don't we go?

587
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:10,600
Your clothes are ruined too.

588
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,530
Okay. Let's go.

589
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,210
We'll get going now.

590
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,800
You're not going to eat?

591
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,640
The food will get cold.

592
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,280
You should...

593
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,790
eat.

594
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,550
I don't have an appetite.

595
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,820
Why not?

596
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,290
Is it because of Hee Jin?

597
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,700
Am I wrong?

598
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,710
Your mind has been somewhere else...

599
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,310
the whole time you were with me today.

600
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,740
After running into Hee Jin,

601
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,780
you've been anxious the whole time.

602
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,560
Unbelievable.

603
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,630
Why did you have to make me feel so unwanted?

604
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,600
If you were going to do this,

605
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,140
you shouldn't have come running to me then.

606
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,410
Right.

607
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,580
It was my fault.

608
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,960
I shouldn't have gone to you to begin with.

609
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,600
You're right.

610
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,070
I've been thinking about her...

611
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:35,270
the whole time I was with you.

612
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,880
I thought of her even when I couldn't see her.

613
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:43,650
But when I saw her,

614
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,520
it was harder to stop thinking about her.

615
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,160
So...

616
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:57,130
I'll be honest with my feelings starting now.

617
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,100
- Hey, Hwang Jae Yeol.
- I...

618
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,670
can't put off...

619
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,540
going to her any longer.

620
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:14,980
If you leave now,

621
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,890
you know that it's really over between us, right?

622
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,660
You know that...

623
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,600
things were over between us a long time ago.

624
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,120
Yeo Reum.

625
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,120
Han Yeo Reum.

626
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,000
I'm sorry.

627
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,310
I didn't know you were going through a tough time.

628
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:16,480
I only hated you for leaving.

629
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,180
But...

630
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,890
I can't go back to you now.

631
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,930
So...

632
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:43,070
let's break up for real this time.

633
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,580
Yes?

634
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,810
Is there an arcade around here?

635
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,840
How about the punching machine? You're good at that.

636
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,410
Wait, no.

637
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,250
Why don't we call your friends and hang out? It's been a while.

638
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,220
Bani!

639
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:49,430
Bani.

640
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,200
Don't go.

641
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,720
I'm sorry. I think I should go.

642
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:28,430
I'm sorry...

643
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:33,000
for being so harsh on you earlier.

644
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,540
I know I said awful things to you,

645
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,440
but there was only one thing I have been meaning to tell you...

646
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,410
this whole time.

647
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,520
I like you.

648
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,080
Cut. Okay.

649
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,650
- Okay!
- Two, three.

650
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:02,580
(Crushology 101)

651
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,580
Say hello to my girlfriend.

652
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,090
We have a lot in common.

653
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,990
So we click really well.

654
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:10,820
- What are you doing here?
- Ban Hee Jin.

655
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,020
Your life should be ruined...

656
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,830
- like mine.
- Jae Yeol! Over here!

657
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,400
What have you done?

658
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:17,930
- Bani.
- But...

659
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:19,800
your boyfriend must be upset.

660
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,300
Everyone thinks Won is your boyfriend.

661
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,400
Why aren't you dating anyone?

662
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:26,740
Actually, there's someone I like.

663
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:28,070
Isn't that Bani?

664
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,380
Where did you see her?

665
