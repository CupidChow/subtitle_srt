I promised myself.

Listen carefully.

6
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:34,791
I'm going to start dating good-looking people too!

I started getting tangled up with handsome guys.

And very intensely...

12
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:07,891
at that.

13
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:14,031
You.

14
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:17,771
What are you?

15
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:27,451
Well...

16

17
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:37,761
Sorry.

18
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:40,130
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,161
Seriously.

20
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,691
I'm terribly sorry.

21
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:44,731
Stop right there!

22
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,431

How do you know that punk?

27
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:10,721
You see...

28
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,361
You can say we're in a debt relationship.

29
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:17,301
I broke that guy's tablet.

30
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:20,371

Do you know him?

33
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:32,681
Excuse me.

34
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:35,011
I was just about to put my things in it.

35
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:37,881
Shouldn't it go...

36
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:39,851
to whoever occupies it first?

37
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:41,791
I'm in a similar situation.

We're not on good terms.

39
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:48,961
Running out of the blue made me hungry.

40
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:53,001
Should we go and get that special menu we talked about?

41
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:56,771
How is this the special menu?

42
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:59,241
Is it any good?

43
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:17,061
What's this?

44
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:20,031
This rice bowl is on a whole other level.

45
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:21,760
Of course.

46
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,561
As for this rice bowl,

47
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:25,860
it's the perfect combination...

48
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:27,701
of the cooks' heartfelt cooking skills and Korean MSG.

49
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:31,041
I didn't know the school had such a cafeteria.

50
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,240
To think I never had this delicious dish before.

51
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:39,280
How unfair.

52
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:41,210
This is actually the faculty's cafeteria.

53
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:43,581
You can only come and dine with a professor.

54
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:47,321
But I laid the groundwork so well that...

55
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:49,521
the cooks let me have this menu in secret.

56
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:58,101
Let's...

57
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:00,901
get along really well.

58
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,401
Sure thing.

59
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:06,811
That was a scrumptious meal.

60
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:09,341
Coffee will be on me.

61
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:12,011
No way. A meal and coffee come as a set.

62
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:14,011
Today will be my treat.

63
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:15,881
Then it'll be on me next time.

64
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:17,121
All right.

65
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:21,421

- Yes.

66
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:30,961

67
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:32,431
About what?

68
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:45,241
Let me guess. Are you posing like a model?

69
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:52,851
I got it. An ad for a coat?

70
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:55,491
No. Think outside the box.

71
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:58,391
This statue.

72
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,031
Doesn't it sort of resemble me?

73
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:08,601
Are you trying to make me believe that you look like the statue?

74
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:11,141
How can someone say it outright?

75
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:12,801
You're hilarious.

76
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:15,611
Let's get going.

77
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:18,310
How are you aware that you have a sculpted face?

78
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,481
Don't people usually play dumb even if they know it?

79
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:22,480
It doesn't suit you at all.

80
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:24,951

85
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:38,901
Okay. I'm on my way.

86
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:44,541
Bani. This is a bummer.

87
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:46,541
I have to get going.

88
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:48,811
I'll treat you to coffee next time. I'm sorry.

89

Don't worry.

90
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:52,580
Get going. You must be in a hurry.

91
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:53,581
Okay.

92
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:58,721

99

I...

100
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:34,221
didn't ignore your calls.

101
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,291
I touched the wrong button.

102
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:38,691
What?

103
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:40,730
Are you planning to apologize and then bolt again?

104
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:41,761
No.

105
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:45,501
Come with me.

106
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:49,871
If everything becomes mechanized and mass-produced,

107
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:53,140
we will lose the beauty of our daily lives.

108

You're right.

113
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:11,191
But won't your friends' notes...

114
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:14,891
be better than mine?

115

134
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:20,661

This won't do.

147
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:49,051

148

Yes.

00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:37,661
Jay's exhibition?

190
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,171
I can enjoy the exhibition, as well as settle my debt.

191
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:44,941
It's killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

192
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:47,541
Yes! This is it.

194
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:56,410
Welcome. This way, please.

- Are you okay, kid?

197
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:08,931
Thank you.

198
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,231
Are you okay?

200
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,081
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

201
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:35,391
What?

202
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:37,991
Why is a work of art talking?

203
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,021
Right.

204
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:41,831
So this is an exhibition.

205
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:43,601
Or should I say, an emergency?

206
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:47,371
I can't breathe because of your looks.

207
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,011
May I...

208
00:12:00,781 --> 00:12:01,781
Yes?

209
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:03,621
take photos of the artwork?

210
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:07,350
Oh, of course.

211
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,150
It's fine as long as you have the flash off.

212
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:11,991
(Young Artist Biennale)

213
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:19,831
If you're taking photos,

214
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:23,741
the piece next to it is better than this one.

215
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:27,271
I see.

216
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:31,281
Is it because this isn't the main piece?

217
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:32,741
What?

218
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:35,611
No. That's not it.

219
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,980
I think this artist uses light and shadow differently...

220
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:40,321
depending on the angle,

221
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:44,160
allowing you to feel different emotions...

222
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:45,291
within one piece.

223
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:50,091
It can look bright from one angle...

224
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:52,701
and sad...

225
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:56,371
from another.

226
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:01,811
But capturing that in a photo is tough.

227
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:05,441
You know a lot about the artwork.

228
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:08,151
It's just that...

229
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:11,781
I'm a fan of this artist.

230
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:16,691
A fan who looks into the artist's intention.

231
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:20,391
This artist must feel honoured.

232
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:24,431
I'll enjoy the exhibition with my eyes.

233
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:26,201
Thank you.

234
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:28,701
No problem.

235
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,441
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

236
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:42,881
I'd regret it if I just left.

237
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:45,351

238
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:47,221

being hit on?

243
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:10,881
To think I'd really come here.

00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:28,791

I see. Jo Ah Lang.

249
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:41,111
I surprised you earlier, didn't I?

250
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:44,311
This is a first for me.

251
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:46,081
It's okay.

252
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:50,111
As you said, the coffee here is good.

253
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:51,881
That's a relief.

(Sculpture Department)

255
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:02,091
So you're studying sculpture at Yein University.

256
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:05,801
No wonder you explained the artwork so smoothly.

257
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:08,571
No way.

258
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:11,771
I simply couldn't stop myself as a big fan of Jay.

259
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:15,410
Jay will be a guest lecturer at our university soon.

260
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:17,381
I already applied for the lecture.

261
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:20,181
You must really like him.

262
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:23,581
Oh, right.

263
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:26,781
Do you remember the title of the piece we saw?

264
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:29,951
The title...

265
00:15:31,421 --> 00:15:33,491
It was "Destiny."

266
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:46,471
Here's your pork cutlet.

267
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:50,440
Today's main dish is pork cutlet.

268
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:53,141
As for the garnish, we have bread, salad, and...

269
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,280
I'm home.

270
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:56,751
- You're here.
- Hi.

271
00:15:57,221 --> 00:16:00,221
My daughter came at the perfect moment.

272
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:02,890
You said you wanted to have pork cutlet.

273
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:04,690
So I made one.

274
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:07,190
That's awesome. I was so hungry.

275
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:08,960
You were? Wash your hands and take a seat.

276
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:10,031
Okay.

277
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:12,960
Oh, my.

278
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:15,301
All right.

279
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:17,001
Ta-da.

280
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:19,001
Ta-da.

281
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:21,270
Thank you for the food.

282
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,671
I hope you enjoy it.

283
00:16:23,411 --> 00:16:24,411
It looks delicious.

284
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,280
Hold on. Let me cut it for you.

285
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:29,451
- It's fine. I'll do it.
- Come on.

286
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,351
- Remove your knife and fork.
- Dad.

287
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:35,890
Anyone would think that her arms are much stronger than yours.

288
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:37,220
Why are you cutting it for her?

289
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,221
Baby.

290
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:41,661
This is not about strength. It's about love.

291
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,091
You know what?

292
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:46,201
The moment I met your mom, I made up my mind.

293
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:49,931
That I will cut her pork cutlet for the rest of my life.

294
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:55,070
You make me feel lonely again!

295
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:56,411
Oh, my gosh.

296
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,641
Come to think of it, I've never heard of it.

297
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:01,381
How did you meet?

298
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:05,381
Your mother and I... How should I put it?

299
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:08,050
It was like destiny.

300
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:10,761
You always say it's destiny.

301
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:13,491
Your father is known for giving meaning to everything.

302
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,031
Why? We're supposed to meet.

303
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:20,231
I'm waiting for you.

304
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:23,001
A girlfriend?

305
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:26,000
Nonsense. There's no way you have a girlfriend.

306
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,471
Hurry up. I'm waiting for you.

307
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,311
Hello? Hey!

308
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:33,041
This traitor.

309
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:34,481
Watch out!

310
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:42,921
- A volleyball?
- I'm sorry.

311
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:45,061
I couldn't control my strength while serving.

312
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:56,301
Oh, it's fine.

313
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:57,971
I actually want to thank you.

314
00:17:58,341 --> 00:17:59,371
Okay then.

315
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:02,811
What's the matter?

316
00:18:06,081 --> 00:18:07,781
I like volleyball.

317
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:13,250
That's not destiny. It's a coincidence.

318
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:15,820
Honey, it's not just a coincidence.

319
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:16,920
Listen.

320
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:19,290
I was passing by at that moment...

321
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,790
while you were practising.

322
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,601
And I was hit by the ball you tossed by mistake.

323
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:26,830
What are the odds...

324
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:28,971
that all these coincidences...

325
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:31,071
would align so perfectly?

326
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:34,911
Right? You think I'm right?

327
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:37,010
I don't know.

328
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:38,981

329
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:41,611

330
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:43,751

- Okay.

00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:02,291
Are you okay?

374
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:05,801
Yes.

375
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:14,941
It became muddy after it rained last week.

376
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:16,211
Thank you.

377
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:20,741
The mud is all over your pants.

378
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:23,310
It's fine.

379
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:24,721
I'm used to getting dirt on my clothes.

380
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:26,351
Hye Won.

381
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,961
These are new clothes.

382
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:42,371
That's why you shouldn't go around as you like.

383
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:46,901
I'm glad you didn't get hurt, though.

384
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:49,271
Are you guys close?

385
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:53,311
Why are you asking something like that?

386
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:54,411
Why?

387
00:25:54,412 --> 00:25:56,451
Can't I ask your friend about that?

388
00:25:58,451 --> 00:25:59,481
Oh, right.

389
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:06,291
When did you change your name on my phone?

390
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:08,761
Why? I'm your first love.

391
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:11,301
You said I was the first woman you loved in your life.

392
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:13,201
Gosh.

393
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:16,071
Cha Hye Won. Nobody can stop you.

394
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:27,081
Why are you looking at us like that?

395
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:28,551
Sorry?

396
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:30,181
No.

397
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,051
You guys really look like close siblings.

398
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:34,651
We're quite close.

399
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:37,791
As you can see, my brother adores me a lot.

400
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:40,161
Yes.

401
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:42,361
Let me see your hands.

402
00:26:44,661 --> 00:26:45,830
Did you receive the timetable?

403
00:26:45,831 --> 00:26:46,860
(Did you receive the timetable? The class is at 3pm.)

404
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:48,101
The class is at 3pm.

405
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:50,801
Jae Yeol.

406
00:26:51,371 --> 00:26:54,541
Can you please come with us just once?

407
00:26:55,271 --> 00:26:57,471
I definitely said I wouldn't go on a group blind date.

408
00:26:58,481 --> 00:27:00,141
I knew it.

409
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:03,111
Jae Yeol. They're dance majors.

410
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:04,650
If you don't come,

411
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:06,021
they won't meet us.

412
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:07,420
Just this once, please.

413
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:10,120
- Please.
- Jae Yeol, I won't ask you again.

414
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:11,991
Can you please come with us just this once?

415
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:13,590
Please.

416
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,060
What did they do...

417
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:16,330
for him to make them kneel?

418
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:17,631
Just once.

419
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,000
No matter how good-looking he is,

420
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:21,270
I shouldn't get involved with someone...

421
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,370
who has a personality like that.

422
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:24,431
- Jae Yeol.
- Please.

423
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,641
- Just once. Please.
- Just once.

424
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:28,271
Can you?

425
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:30,310
We're talking. What are you looking at?

426
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:31,711
- Jae Yeol.
- Jae Yeol, can you really not...

427
00:27:32,411 --> 00:27:33,610
- Jae Yeol.
- Where are you going?

428
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:34,611
Jae Yeol.

429
00:27:35,051 --> 00:27:36,551
- We're doomed.
- You...

430
00:27:38,621 --> 00:27:39,651
Hey.

431
00:27:40,881 --> 00:27:43,151
Why are you so startled as if I'm a ruthless debt collector?

432
00:27:46,391 --> 00:27:49,691
Did I catch you when you were running away without taking notes?

433
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:51,061
What?

434
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:54,161
No. I was on my way.

435
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:58,601
I sent 200 dollars in the morning.

436
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:00,001
Did you see it?

437
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:01,641
That's 1-10th of the money you owe.

438
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:04,371
I'll pay you back the rest of the money soon.

439
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,251
- Why do you look like that?
- What?

440
00:28:13,821 --> 00:28:14,851
This?

441
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:25,131
Put this on.

442
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,401
No. I'm fine.

443
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:36,911
Just put this on.

444
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:38,811
No.

445
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:41,651
I'm really fine.

446
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:45,181
If your clothes get dirty, I'll have you pay you even more.

447
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:47,351
- So you'll walk around like that?
- Yes.

448
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:50,351
I'd rather walk around looking like this than having more debt.

449
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:52,691
Hey.

450
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:54,861
I won't charge you for my clothes. Will you put it on now?

451
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:01,871
It's because I don't like how you look right now.

452
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:03,131
- Stay strong today as always.
- Yes. I'll stay strong.

453
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:09,971
Hey. It's misspelled.

454
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:12,801
I got it.

459
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,231
Your drawing is nice.

460
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:46,571
A sculpture major is indeed different.

461
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:19,101
Why does the sunlight have to shatter on those eyelashes?

462
00:31:23,871 --> 00:31:27,581
Why does the wind have to tickle that hair?

463
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,321
Get it together, Ban Hee Jin.

464
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,721
Don't let that face fool you.

465
00:31:39,391 --> 00:31:40,621

Here you go.

468
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:56,810
I'll get going then.

469
00:31:56,811 --> 00:31:58,741
Sure. I'll see you in tomorrow's class.

470
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,551
Are you sure...

471
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:11,861
you're having her around just to take notes?

472
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:14,121
What are you getting at?

473
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:18,031
Nothing. It's amusing, that's all.

474
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:37,111
What? He'll see me in tomorrow's class?

475
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:39,550
Am I supposed to take his notes tomorrow too?

476
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:41,381
Will today repeat itself?

477
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:44,991
Hey, Bo Bae.

478
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:46,261
Bani!

479
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:48,690
What on earth? Did you hurt your arm?

480
00:32:48,691 --> 00:32:49,931
Oh, this?

481
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:52,161
It's what I needed for drama class.

482
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:53,861
You had me worried.

483
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:55,401
I thought you got hurt.

484
00:32:56,431 --> 00:32:59,001
- Are you off to work part-time?
- Yes, I have the graveyard shift.

485
00:32:59,941 --> 00:33:02,341
Wait. Can you hold on to this for me...

486
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:03,640
while I go to the restroom?

487
00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:04,980
Sure thing. I'll be out here.

488
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:06,311
- Thanks.
- No problem.

489
00:33:08,911 --> 00:33:11,181
No way. This looks so real.

490
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:14,321
It fits.

491
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:15,521
Seriously?

492
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:18,151
Did you hurt your arm?

493
00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:19,991
What?

494
00:33:20,821 --> 00:33:21,831
Oh, this.

495
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:28,161
You were fine earlier today.

496
00:33:28,671 --> 00:33:29,771
When did this happen?

497
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:32,571
You see...

498
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:34,571
It seems bad.

499
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:37,411
Then you won't be able to take notes in class.

500
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:43,411
I know.

501
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:45,521
I should've been aware of that.

502
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:47,951
How can I make up for this?

503
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:52,661
Forget it.

504
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:54,891
Recovering should be the priority,

505
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:56,431
so focus on that.

506
00:33:56,761 --> 00:33:57,791
Sure.

507
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:04,101
Nice!

(Surim Elementary School)

509
00:34:08,611 --> 00:34:10,540
The mural last year...

510
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:12,040
by Yein University's art students...

511
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:14,141
was a huge hit with our children.

512
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:17,380
I ask that you do another good job this year.

513
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:18,421
- Sure.
- Sure.

514
00:34:19,021 --> 00:34:21,080
You can work on the mural...

515
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:22,721
in groups of two.

516
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:24,960
Shall we begin, then?

517
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:26,120
- Got it.
- Sure.

518
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:27,260
We should partner up.

519
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:29,161
Hey, you'll work with me.

520
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:30,791
What?

521
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:32,931
You hurt your arm and won't be able to work much.

522
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:34,601
I'll do it for you.

523
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:07,931
It's okay. I can do this much.

524
00:35:08,701 --> 00:35:10,331
As if I'd be comfortable...

525
00:35:11,371 --> 00:35:12,571
with an injured person working beside me.

526
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:17,011
What's going on? Why is he suddenly being nice to me?

527
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:19,481
He's only making me feel guilty.

528
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:38,401
Just take a seat.

529
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:41,530
I can work just fine with my other hand.

530
00:35:41,531 --> 00:35:43,401
What if you end up hurting that one too?

531
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:44,901
Stay seated.

532
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:49,411
But you'll be doing all the work alone.

533
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:52,711
Well,

534
00:35:53,711 --> 00:35:55,281
you put in the work taking my notes.

535
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:57,181
I can do...

536
00:35:58,011 --> 00:35:59,251
about this much for you.

537
00:36:11,661 --> 00:36:14,761
He'll throw a fit once he finds out I lied about my arm.

538
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:18,031
Maybe I should come clean.

539
00:36:26,981 --> 00:36:28,911
What do I do?

540
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:31,681
I can't say it.

541
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:47,331
- Pass me the paint.
- Sure.

542
00:36:48,531 --> 00:36:49,701
- What...
- What?

543
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:10,051
Hold on. How is your hand?

544
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:12,561
Are you okay?

545
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:14,091
Yes, I'm fine.

546
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:17,031
- What about you?
- Gosh.

547
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:19,501
I'm more than fine.

548
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:26,801
You're fine as well?

549
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:28,641
Yes, I'm perfectly fine...

550
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:57,771
Let me get this straight.

551
00:37:58,801 --> 00:38:00,371
You lied?

552
00:38:03,911 --> 00:38:05,141
You faked an injury...

553
00:38:05,381 --> 00:38:06,610
so that you wouldn't have to take my notes?

554
00:38:06,611 --> 00:38:07,941
It's not like that.

555
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:11,751
I never initially intended to lie to you

556
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:18,220
It's tough, isn't it?

557
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:20,291
- Maybe we'll do that.
- Sure thing.

558
00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:22,791
- This could be better, though.
- But...

559
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:33,071
That's right. Your arms are fine, so you should work hard.

560
00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:37,171
- Up there. You missed a spot.
- Okay.

561
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:40,541
Over here as well. The brush strokes aren't even.

562
00:38:41,781 --> 00:38:42,811
Move faster.

563
00:38:58,631 --> 00:38:59,631
Bani.

564
00:39:00,531 --> 00:39:01,561
Hey, Ji Won.

565
00:39:02,871 --> 00:39:05,501
- Here.
- Thanks.

566
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:07,371
I'm truly grateful for the other day.

567
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:10,170
If it hadn't been for you, Hye Won could've been badly hurt.

568
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:12,841
Don't mention it. All is good since nothing happened.

569
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:15,281
This is just what I was craving.

570
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:18,820
Is that coffee too?

571
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:21,151
I can't drink coffee, so this is Solomon's seal tea.

572
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:25,690
You're like an old man.

573
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:28,561
Why? Solomon's seal tea is nutty and refreshing.

574
00:39:31,431 --> 00:39:33,801
By the way, how are you doing with that debt of yours?

575
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:37,000
Don't even get me started.

576
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:38,770
My whole body is aching...

577
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:41,041
from all the note-taking I have to do in return.

578
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:44,311
I still have 1,800 dollars more to go.

579
00:39:46,111 --> 00:39:47,441
When do I pay it all back?

580
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:51,281
- If it's bad, I could...
- What?

593
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:23,681
Go for it.

594

That's it!

595
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:32,521
Bani.

596
00:40:33,091 --> 00:40:34,360
This seems like a long shot.

597
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:35,790
(Who's the Strongest at Yein University?)

598
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:39,761
Come on. You're saying that because you don't know her.

599
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:41,931
Let me tell you about Bani.

600
00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:44,570
The Sculpture Department is known...

601
00:40:44,571 --> 00:40:45,601
as the athletic department of the College of Art.

602
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:09,231
Her physical strength is acknowledged by all its students.

603
00:41:10,531 --> 00:41:11,531
I expected no less.

604
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:12,861
What on earth?

605
00:41:12,862 --> 00:41:14,331
- No way.
- My gosh.

606
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:24,671
Do you need a hand?

607
00:41:26,911 --> 00:41:28,211
Bani...

608
00:41:28,381 --> 00:41:30,151
might even be able...

609
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:32,120
to lift the earth.

610
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:34,321
- You'll know once you see her.
- See for yourself.

611
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:35,790
What's going on?

612
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:37,791
Wait, isn't that the note-taker?

613
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:39,491
Bani, right?

614
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:41,090
- Where?
- Over there.

615
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:42,160
What's she up to, though?

616
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:44,391
Next up is Ban Hee Jin of the Sculpture Department.

617
00:41:44,591 --> 00:41:46,400
- Strength Showdown?
- Go, Bani!

618
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,360
- I get it.
- It's the punch machine.

619
00:41:48,361 --> 00:41:49,930
That's actually my expertise.

620
00:41:49,931 --> 00:41:51,570
- As if.
- Seriously.

621
00:41:51,571 --> 00:41:53,201
- It's all about the twist.
- Oh, please.

622
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:55,341
Go, Sculpture Department!

623
00:42:24,271 --> 00:42:25,271
No way.

624
00:42:25,272 --> 00:42:26,900
- Go, Bani!
- My gosh.

625
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:29,010
You're the best!

626
00:42:29,011 --> 00:42:30,011
I got it.

627
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:31,911
Isn't she the pushover girlfriend?

628
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:34,610
The one who punched that guy from the media club.

629
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:35,680
- Oh, right.
- Exactly.

630
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,851
They weren't kidding about her iron fist.

631
00:42:38,081 --> 00:42:40,750
A punch like that would've crushed his ribs.

632
00:42:40,751 --> 00:42:42,390
- She's in first place.
- No way!

633
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:43,790
Bani, you're the best!

634
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,420
- Go, Bani!
- Can you believe it?

635
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:46,990
That's amazing!

636
00:42:46,991 --> 00:42:48,021
Yes!

637
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:49,761
That puts her in first place.

638
00:42:50,261 --> 00:42:51,731
That was perfect!

639
00:42:56,431 --> 00:42:57,931
Go, Bani!

640
00:43:01,471 --> 00:43:02,810
Congratulations.

641
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:04,871
My gosh. Thank you so much.

642
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:07,481
I can't believe I actually won this.

643
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:09,681
Does this mean you'll finally settle your debt?

644
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:10,811
Yes.

645
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:14,821
Then, how about basketball?

646
00:43:16,891 --> 00:43:17,951
Ji Won.

647
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:20,461
One's debt should be cleared as soon as possible, right?

648
00:43:21,691 --> 00:43:23,291
Can you wait here a second?

649
00:43:26,461 --> 00:43:27,461
We need to prepare for the contest.

650
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:28,501
- So...
- Hey.

651
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:30,601
Yeol.

652
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:36,471
What is she up to now?

653
00:43:41,681 --> 00:43:42,711
What is it?

654
00:43:45,011 --> 00:43:46,021
Here you go.

656

What's this?

657
00:43:53,191 --> 00:43:54,660
It's a tablet.

658
00:43:54,661 --> 00:43:57,491
I settled my debt, so I no longer owe you 2,000 dollars,

659
00:43:57,661 --> 00:43:59,201
nor do I need to take notes for you.

660
00:44:00,301 --> 00:44:01,301
Well,

661
00:44:02,001 --> 00:44:03,401
I apologize for everything.

662
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:09,311
- You did well.
- Thanks.

663
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:10,971
- Shall we get going?
- Sure.

664
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,811
The way you threw that punch was inspiring.

665
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:16,451
That was nothing.

666
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:18,810
Did you see that?

667
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:19,951
Does one punch like so?

668
00:44:28,421 --> 00:44:30,161
What was that?

669
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,201
No way.

670
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:39,470
I expected nothing less from a chairman's grandson.

671
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:40,701
I've never been in an imported car before.

672
00:44:41,341 --> 00:44:42,371
That again?

673
00:44:43,611 --> 00:44:44,911
Fine, I'll stop teasing you.

674
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:46,741
I'll give you a ride from time to time.

675

681
00:45:01,561 --> 00:45:02,591

693
00:45:49,941 --> 00:45:51,211
Don't even try.

694

Sorry.

00:45:56,581 --> 00:45:57,910

It's all right. I get that a lot.

699
00:46:07,761 --> 00:46:09,460
Of course. It'd be annoying...

700
00:46:09,461 --> 00:46:11,131
for someone with that face not to know he's handsome.

701

- You get my stamp of approval!
- Mine too.

702
00:46:13,131 --> 00:46:14,600

Did you want this?

717

Forget it. Have as much as you want.

736
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:15,081
Hey.

737
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:21,321
I accidentally broke his tablet.

738
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:23,131
Then...

739
00:48:24,061 --> 00:48:26,260
- who is this guy?
- This guy...

740
00:48:26,261 --> 00:48:28,701
(Jo Ah Lang)

741
00:48:32,301 --> 00:48:33,740
He asked for my number...

742
00:48:33,741 --> 00:48:34,841
when I was working at the exhibition.

743
00:48:34,941 --> 00:48:36,341
We had a cup of coffee together too.

744
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:38,911
What? Then he totally hit on you.

745
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,440
So there are two possible guys who could be your boyfriend?

746
00:48:41,441 --> 00:48:42,510
What? Boyfriend?

747
00:48:42,511 --> 00:48:44,310
My gosh. You're getting ahead of yourself again.

748
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:45,350
What's the harm in that?

749
00:48:45,351 --> 00:48:46,950
You said you wanted to date a handsome guy now.

750
00:48:46,951 --> 00:48:48,251
Both of them are handsome.

751
00:48:48,351 --> 00:48:51,391
Their good looks put them on the shortlist for your boyfriend.

752
00:48:51,891 --> 00:48:53,421
They are good-looking, indeed.

753
00:48:54,621 --> 00:48:55,891
As for this guy,

754
00:48:56,531 --> 00:48:58,391
his presence is a breath of fresh air.

755
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:00,730
Should I say his face...

756
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:02,801
satisfied my decade-long craving for artistic beauty?

757
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:05,331
Then you can satisfy your craving for dating with him too.

758
00:49:05,731 --> 00:49:07,741
But I got him a new tablet.

759
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:09,211
So I won't be seeing him anymore.

760
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:11,011
More importantly, he's quite rude.

761
00:49:11,611 --> 00:49:12,641
Yes.

762
00:49:12,811 --> 00:49:14,441
Then what about him?

763
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:15,741
Watching him is...

764
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:17,811
like getting a jolt of caffeine.

765
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:21,781
One look at his face is enough to wake you up from a sleepy state.

766
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,691
You can keep him by your side like a cup of coffee.

767
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:28,120
But if you met him for the first time that day,

768
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:30,031
shouldn't you take time and be more careful?

769
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:34,400
You're right.

770
00:49:34,401 --> 00:49:37,171
I only know his name and age.

771
00:49:38,331 --> 00:49:39,341
Well,

772
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:42,370
hate turns into love.

773
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:43,810
Strangers...

774
00:49:43,811 --> 00:49:45,571
become lovers. Am I wrong?

775
00:49:46,341 --> 00:49:47,380
Yes.

776
00:49:47,381 --> 00:49:50,151
No one knows from where and in what form destiny will come.

777
00:49:51,011 --> 00:49:53,280
So even if you don't think he could be your boyfriend,

778
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,481
you should check again.

779
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,961
They're so handsome.

780
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:02,321
Hey.

781
00:50:03,331 --> 00:50:04,431
You're also handsome.

782
00:50:05,831 --> 00:50:07,661
- You're pretty too.
- My gosh.

783
00:50:07,861 --> 00:50:09,771
- Tone it down, will you?
- Okay.

784

(Women's Division, Latest tablet)

785
00:50:16,711 --> 00:50:17,741
Hey.

786
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:20,141
By the way,

787
00:50:20,981 --> 00:50:23,311
was I really that harsh on Ban Hee Jin?

788
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:25,251
- Bani?
- Yes.

789
00:50:25,951 --> 00:50:27,981
Gosh. Do you even have to ask?

790
00:50:28,581 --> 00:50:30,290
You were more than just harsh on her.

791
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,221
I felt so awful watching you torment her.

792
00:50:32,761 --> 00:50:35,321
Imagine how awful it must have been for her to fake an arm injury.

793
00:50:36,031 --> 00:50:37,860
I understand that you're sharp-tempered.

794
00:50:37,861 --> 00:50:39,561
But you were especially harsh on her.

795
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:43,301
Hwang Jae Yeol.

796
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:45,631
- Hwang Jae Yeol.
- What?

797
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:48,341
I'm a nice guy, so I can be easygoing with you.

798
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:50,611
But I've never met someone who could be nicer than me.

799
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:53,111
If it were someone else, they would have taken some time off.

800
00:50:53,281 --> 00:50:55,740
Or they would have done this.

801
00:50:55,741 --> 00:50:57,781
Or this.

802
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:00,681
Like this.

803
00:51:01,381 --> 00:51:03,150
Hey.

804
00:51:03,151 --> 00:51:05,190
- Just go to sleep already.
- Okay.

805
00:51:05,191 --> 00:51:06,891
- Go to sleep.
- That hurts. Okay.

808
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:00,041
What do you want to drink? It's my treat today.

809
00:52:00,241 --> 00:52:01,881
- Iced Americano for me.
- Okay.

810
00:52:02,341 --> 00:52:03,511
I'd like to order, please.

811
00:52:12,121 --> 00:52:13,391
How beautiful.

812
00:52:14,121 --> 00:52:15,191
Pardon?

813

What?

I'm sorry, sir.

I'm quite busy right now.

819
00:52:34,841 --> 00:52:36,650
And I have a nasty temper.

820
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:38,081
You won't be able to handle me.

821
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:40,581
It's okay because I'm very easygoing.

822
00:52:41,051 --> 00:52:43,621
My friend has quite the temper too, but I've been very accommodating.

823
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:48,521
So you're not going to order?

824
00:52:50,461 --> 00:52:51,991
Two iced Americanos, please.

825
00:52:53,731 --> 00:52:55,161
Please wait.

00:52:55,831 --> 00:52:58,071
Okay. Please take your time.

- Bo Bae.
- You're here.

Give one to Kot Nim when she comes by later.

Right.

Good for you. Have fun.

- I'm off now.
- Okay.

Hey.

00:53:43,381 --> 00:53:44,981
I guess they're friends.

841
00:53:45,951 --> 00:53:47,721
Had I known, I would have gotten to know her better.

842
00:54:00,801 --> 00:54:01,901
Hey, Ban Hee Jin.

843
00:54:05,331 --> 00:54:06,541
Why are you ignoring my message?

844
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:09,301
I didn't ignore your message. I just didn't answer it back.

845
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:11,241
That's the same thing.

846
00:54:11,611 --> 00:54:13,081
I didn't have anything to say to you.

847

Hey, did you seriously participate in the showdown yesterday...

848
00:54:18,281 --> 00:54:19,651
to give me a new tablet?

849
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:23,351
Yes. Why?

850
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:28,691
So the only solution you came up with was using brute force?

851
00:54:31,691 --> 00:54:33,730
Wouldn't it have been easier...

852
00:54:33,731 --> 00:54:35,361
to take notes instead of doing the showdown?

853
00:54:36,671 --> 00:54:38,101
Why do I have to do that?

854
00:54:40,371 --> 00:54:41,401
What?

855
00:54:42,941 --> 00:54:44,071
I'll get going.

856
00:54:44,571 --> 00:54:46,071
I settled my debt.

857
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:48,611
There is no reason for us to see each other now.

858
00:54:53,451 --> 00:54:55,681
What? I never said I wanted to keep seeing you.

859
00:54:58,221 --> 00:55:00,391
It's liberating now that I don't have to see you now.

860
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:05,461
Darn it.

00:55:14,671 --> 00:55:15,900
I saved you a seat.

- Hey.
- Okay.

- Bani.
- Yes.

Do you remember the title of the piece we saw?

The title...

880
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:54,641
It was "Destiny."

881

00:57:04,211 --> 00:57:06,421
is the probability of all these coincidences...

falling into place?

00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:13,321
Hello.

892
00:57:42,781 --> 00:57:45,851

894
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:06,441

902

I didn't tell you on purpose, so I could surprise you.

01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:10,861
Too bad.

913
01:01:12,391 --> 01:01:15,031
Pardon? What do you mean?

914
01:01:16,401 --> 01:01:17,431
I...

915
01:01:19,271 --> 01:01:20,671
need to keep seeing you.

(Crushology 101)

917
01:02:36,141 --> 01:02:38,911
What if those guys say they like you?

918
01:02:39,311 --> 01:02:40,481
Does he...

919
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:44,390
really like me?

920
01:02:44,391 --> 01:02:45,521
Isn't that Bani?

921
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:48,520
Then does it mean you guys are dating now?

922
01:02:48,521 --> 01:02:50,661
Well, he didn't ask me out officially.

923
01:02:51,091 --> 01:02:54,431
Do I look better with my hair down or up?

924
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:56,701
A predetermined destiny...

925
01:02:57,431 --> 01:02:58,431
can be good...

926
01:02:59,031 --> 01:03:00,401
or bad.

927
01:03:01,371 --> 01:03:02,441
This is about Ban Hee Jin.

928
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:04,371
We can't let Ban Hee Jin and Jo Ah Lang...

929
01:03:05,171 --> 01:03:06,341
see each other.
