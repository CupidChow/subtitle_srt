(See you later at 7pm.)

4
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,300
Has he still not read your message?

5
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,670
No, not yet.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,740
What if my pasta plans get cancelled?

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,410
How about we get that pasta together?

8
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,520
No, it's okay. He's probably on his way.

9
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,849
Thank you for giving me a ride, Ji Won.

10
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,160
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

11
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,590
Bye.

12
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,130
What kind of situation is this?

13
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,870
You kissed me on purpose in front of her, didn't you?

14
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,120
Bani. It's not like that.

15
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,960
I don't want to talk right now.

16
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,810
- Hey.
- Welcome back.

17
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,449
Didn't you have dinner plans?

18
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,079
Oh, right. Since you were having pasta,

19
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,690
we were about to have some too.

20
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,649
Join us if you haven't had dinner.

21
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,720
Come.

22
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,430
Hee Jin?

23
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,570
What?

24
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,869
Did you have to go that far?

(Han Yeo Reum)

26
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,170

(Episode 7: Misunderstanding and Understanding)

29
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,230
- Bani.
- Let's talk for a minute.

30
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,120
How should I interpret what happened yesterday?

31
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,420
What?

32
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,320
You kissed me out of the blue without a word.

33
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,360
How am I supposed to understand that?

34
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,399
Bani. Yesterday, I...

35
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,430
Does that mean we're dating now?

36
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,210
I was right.

37
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,450
You used me.

38
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,720
- What do you...
- I thought you were different.

39
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,090
But you're not.

40
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,740
(City Hall Station)

41
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,190
You're here early.

42
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,720
Yes.

43
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,920
Don't you have a student council meeting today?

44
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,730
I do. I just stopped by to drop my bag off.

45
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,800
What is it?

46
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,440
What? Well...

47
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,940
You left this in my car yesterday.

48
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,240
I thought I lost it.

49
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,050
Thank you.

50
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,350
I couldn't have pasta last night.

51
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,620
Yeol had an urgent matter and couldn't make it.

52
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,630
You should've called or texted me.

53
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,630
I would’ve driven back.

54
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,570
Maybe I should have.

55
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,070
We can have pasta together later.

56
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,640
I'd better get going. See you.

57
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Bye.

58
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,600
If there are no objections,

59
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,670
we'll finalize these roles. Okay?

60
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,670
We got the flyers for the festival.

61
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,040
I think it's best to hand them out today.

62
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,979
Anyone want to be the mascot?

63
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,740
(Student Council Room)

64
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,080
Gosh, I'm so tired.

65
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,820
- What?
- Do you want to do it?

66
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,390
- Do what?
- Okay.

67
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,020
Hwang Jae Yeol wants to do it.

68
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,360
- Nice, Hwang Jae Yeol.
- As expected of the emperor.

69
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,169
Guys, please come to the art festival.

70
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,040
You're invited to The Artists' Night.

71
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,410
Look at our mascot.

72
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,650
The Prince of Visual Design sure is different.

73
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,450
To think you'd be able to pull off such a cute costume.

74
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,650
Let go while I'm being nice to you.

75
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,030
I've got no time for this right now.

76
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,260
Bani.

77
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,230
Hey, Ji Won. What brings you here?

78
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,800
You seemed busy, so I came to cheer you on.

79
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,010
Have some coffee as you work.

80
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,940
Thank you. I was actually feeling thirsty.

81
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,180
Thank you for the coffee.

82
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,720
Is there still a lot left?

83
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,720
Yes, quite a lot.

84
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,090
We just started the distribution.

85
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,760
Why don't I help you out a little?

86
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,629
- Please come to the art festival.
- I surely will.

87
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,470
Isn't he so handsome?

88
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,970
I'm a junior.

89
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,840
- Please come to the art festival.
- Okay, I will.

90
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,510
- See you again.
- See you.

91
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,950
- Please come to the art festival.
- Okay.

92
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,350
Ji Won. I'll go get some more flyers.

93
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Sure.

94
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,030
Hwang Jae Yeol.

95
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,700
Let's talk after we're done.

96
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,970
Remember what you said?

97
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,110
That you were sincere.

98
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,580
What?

99
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,310
Your feelings for Bani.

100
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,150
You made a fool out of her when she trusted you.

101
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,960
Is that your way of showing your sincerity?

102
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,600
Don't mislead her.

103
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,699
Bani. Yesterday, I...

104
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,460
Does that mean we're dating now?

105
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
I was right.

106
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,410
You used me.

107
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,590
Bani.

108
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,960
Should we wrap up for the day?

109
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,730
- Okay.
- Let's get some coffee.

110
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,170
Ta-da. Enjoy.

111
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Thanks.

112
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,070
You're practically a part-time worker here.

113
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,580
Of course. I've filled in numerous times already.

114
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,280
Bo Bae's last show is tomorrow, right?

115
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,510
Yes.

116
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,520
The after-party of Bo Bae's show.

117
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,980
Why not hold it at my place?

118
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,590
- Can we do that?
- What about your sister?

119
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,319
It's okay. Hye Won went to our parents' place today.

120
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,689
She'll stay there for a few days.

121
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,359
If so, we have no reason to refuse.

122
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,430
You'll go, right?

123
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,660
Well, if that's the case,

124
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,030
- I'm in.
- Nice.

125
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,440
I'll make the preparations. You simply have to come over.

126
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,640
Is this the class of a wealthy man?

127
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,240
Should we wear a dress or something?

128
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,080
- Make it a silk dress.
- Okay.

129
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,290
("Romeo and Juliet")

130
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,490
Romeo.

131
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,660
Why?

132
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,230
Why didn't you leave any poison for me?

133
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,040
Here's a knife.

134
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,820
We will...

135
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,350
meet again.

136
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,479
I really like how you interpreted Juliet...

137
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,050
as a more proactive woman compared to the original.

138
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,890
Especially, Juliet's expression...

139
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,220
when she drew her knife in Act Five was...

140
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,460
Okay. Good.

141
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,560
You did a great job.

142
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,799
It's indeed great to have a boyfriend.

143
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,070
You ease my mind.

144
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,540
You did so well.

145
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,770
Let's go.

146
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,419
Come to the art festival.

147
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,389
(The Artists' Night)

148
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,920
Come to the art festival.

149
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,430
Oh, hello.

150
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,630
You're promoting the festival.

151
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,670
Why are you doing it by yourself?

152
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,909
Well...

153
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,480
Do you need help?

154
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,450
It won't take long if we do it together.

155
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,380
Bo Bae's play will end soon.

156
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,880
Shouldn't we go?

157
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,650
I heard they would take pictures later, so if it's for a moment...

158
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,389
Or how about you and I go first?

159
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,629
Hey, what are you talking about?

160
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,299
Why? You're a member of the student council.

161
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
It'd be better for you to help him than us.

162
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,369
It's fine.

163
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,299
Come on. You can't do this by yourself.

164
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,070
That's a lot of leaflets.

165
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,070
You can have a nice time, just the two of you.

166
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,010
- No.
- What?

167
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,220
I'm sorry.

168
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,969
What? What's the matter?

169
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,980
Yeol.

170
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,240
What do I do?

171
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,120
Hey.

172
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,420
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

173
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,000
Thank you.

174
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,270
I get to have such a luxurious after-party thanks to you.

175
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,800
Thank you for coming.

176
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,270
Actually, I've never invited someone to my place.

177
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,309
Please invite us anytime.

178
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,380
I'll come right away.

179
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,080
Come on.

180
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,349
Let's eat. Let me know if you need more.

181
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,449
No way.

182
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,780
Even just taking a bite of each of these dishes would make me full.

183
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,150
Thank you.

184
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,419
Thank you.

185
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,450
Thank you.

186
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,990
- It's so good.
- Is it good?

187
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,800
Try this too.

188
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,610
Hey. The after-party is an excuse...

189
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,940
to feed Bani, isn't it?

190
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,810
Of course, it is. Why do you ask?

191
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,080
He's her boyfriend.

192
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,450
A boyfriend, not even a crush.

193
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,950
Hey. I didn't know...

194
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,720
and even bought flowers.

195
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,560
Hey.

196
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,930
Have you been rejected even before confessing your feelings?

197
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,770
I have.

198
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,740
I can't even confess to her,

199
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,880
but I'd at least like to talk to her.

200
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,320
- What?
- Do you know...

201
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,890
what kind of face people make...

202
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,750
when they hate someone?

203
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
I do.

204
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,630
Because I've been feeling it...

205
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,200
for the past few days.

206
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,900
I can't even talk to her...

207
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,300
or look at her because of that.

208
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,240
So how can I apologize?

209
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,010
No. Am I in the position to apologize?

210
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,850
There's nothing I can say.

211
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,320
I can't say anything because I did wrong.

212
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,250
It's all my fault.

213
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,130
I'd hate someone like me too.

214
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,700
I'm selfish and do as I want.

215
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,699
And I always ruin everything.

216
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,700
Hey, you're not that bad.

217
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,369
My gosh.

218
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,580
What's wrong with you, Hwang Jae Yeol?

219
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,980
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

220
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,160
I'm so full.

221
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,620
Me too.

222
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,390
Oh, right.

223
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,160
Did something happen between you and Yeol?

224
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,130
What? Why?

225
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,970
When they met earlier,

226
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,500
something felt off.

227
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,640
Oh, it's just...

228
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,240
It's all over now.

229
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,110
It seemed he still had feelings for Yeo Reum.

230
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,590
He's a lost cause.

231
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,660
Hwang Jae Yeol.

232
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,060
Bani, I thought you deserved much better from the beginning.

233
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,200
I agree.

234
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,469
We don't want you to date someone...

235
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,700
who still has feelings for his ex.

236
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,399
There are other men in the world.

237
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,610
Forget about him. It's over now.

238
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,780
Gosh, I'm mad.

239
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,690
What?

240
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,259
Did I finish it already?

241
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,890
Hey. You're drunk. Stop drinking.

242
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,360
I'm not drunk.

243
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,400
- Go to bed.
- Don't!

244
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,110
Hey.

245
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,780
You know...

246
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,680
Do you know what torments me the most?

247
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,290
The fact...

248
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,790
The fact that I hurt her.

249
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,790
The fact that Bani was hurt...

250
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,430
because of me.

251
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,010
That's...

252
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,580
what hurts me...

253
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,810
and torments me the most.

254
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,690
I'm sorry, Bani.

255
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,460
Bani.

256
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,559
(Han Yeo Reum)

257
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,230
- What are you doing? Are you home?
- I'm so sorry.

258
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,169
(Yeol)

259
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,170
(How are you doing?)

260
00:23:58,171 --> 00:23:59,840
(Did you really have to do that? I won't waver.)

261
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,500
(Mom)

262
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,210

263

(Mom)

264
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,800
I knew it.

265
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,569
They acted like they would have a party all night.

266
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,130
But they fell asleep like that.

267
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,870
Aren't you tired?

268
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,140
No. I look totally fine, right?

269
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,010
My body is so used to this because I worked all night for a long time.

270
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,320
Hold on.

271
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,820
Thank you.

272
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,320
Here.

273
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,030
It's good now.

274
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,630
Ji Won.

275
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,369
You can't be this kind...

276
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,830
with that handsome face.

277
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,540
What?

278
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,440
I mean, I'm not going to think that way,

279
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,110
but other women might misunderstand.

280
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,050
Why won't you think that way?

281
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,650
Sorry?

282
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,590
And...

283
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,890
I don't do this to any woman.

284
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,570
The night view is amazing.

285
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,340
- The night view?
- Yes.

286
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,409
Is it because nothing is blocking the view?

287
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,680
I can see the stars so clearly.

288
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,620
It's beautiful.

289
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,620
I know.

290
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,730
It's beautiful.

291
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,290
Gosh, my head hurts.

292
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,780
I'm always on your side. Cheer up.

293
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,380
From Cute Dong Ha.

294
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,560
I was right.

295
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,800
You used me.

296
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,030
- What do you...
- I thought you were different.

297
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,040
But you're not.

298
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,630
Aren't we preparing too much?

299
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,530
Come on. This is the highlight of the festival. It isn't too much.

300
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,470
When I think about it, people are really amazing.

301
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,499
I'd hate it if someone confessed their feelings to me publicly.

302
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,570
Why? Isn't it quite touching?

303
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,680
It means they like you so much that they want to let everyone know.

304
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,139
That's what I'm saying. Why would they let everyone know?

305
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,850
They can just say that to me privately.

306
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,780
Here.

307
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:37,120
(I thought of you when I was walking yesterday.)

308
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,460
(I want to be with you on Christmas.)

(First Love)

313
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,990
- Yes.
- When are you coming?

314
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,090
- I'm coming soon.
- Don't be late.

315
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,790
Okay. See you later.

316
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,030
See you.

317
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,900
Hey!

318
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,339
Gosh!

319
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,340
Why are you doing this? Let go of me!

320
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,509
It's you, right?

321
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,440
You're the crazy woman who's been cheating with my husband.

322
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,139
You old fox,

323
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,040
couldn't you find anyone else? How dare you seduce my husband?

324
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,510
You should know your place!

325
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,180
Let go of me before you talk!

326
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,389
Don't get physical. Talk it out.

327
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,020
Are you crazy?

328
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,090
I didn't seduce him!

329
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,429
It's your husband who went after me.

330
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,730
Why are you accusing me?

331
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,260
Right.

332
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,430
You should be shameless like that.

333
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,900
You'd have to be that shameless to commit adultery.

334
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,670
Right?

335
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,210
Everyone, look at her!

336
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,409
Oh, my gosh.

337
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,940
Here we have someone...

338
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,880
who had an affair with a young professor...

339
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,819
and still claims that she did nothing wrong!

340
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,820
Gosh.

341
00:30:16,821 --> 00:30:19,120
That's not true! What's wrong with you?

342
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,520
- What's going on?
- My gosh.

343
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,690
Who are you?

344
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,600
I'm sorry.

345
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,810
What are you doing?

346
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,080
Why do you apologize?

347
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,450
Stop and just follow me.

348
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,150
Do you think this is enough?

349
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,360
- Is that it?
- I mean...

350
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,260
You should listen!

351
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,700
Let go of me.

352
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,800
What's wrong with you?

353
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,100
Are you crazy?

354
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,270
What are you doing?

355
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,940
And what are you doing?

356
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,139
Why did you apologize to her?

357
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,410
Get it together!

358
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,240
Don't you know what's wrong?

359
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,150
What did I do wrong?

360
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,180
I'm the biggest victim here.

361
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,249
I was fooled by a married man...

362
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,820
and got my hair pulled by a woman who is much younger than me!

363
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,490
So why did you apologize to her?

364
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,600
As if I really had an affair!

365
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,570
Mom.

366
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,380
Aren't you ashamed?

367
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,750
Don't you feel guilty?

368
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,080
You're embarrassing me...

369
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,120
and driving me crazy.

370
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,590
I'm embarrassing you?

371
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,960
What do you even take me for?

372
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,870
I haven't done anything to deserve this from you.

373
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,740
They're the ones who made me look like a fool.

374
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,440
Why should I be blamed for trusting him?

375
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,280
Isn't he the one to blame for taking advantage of my feelings?

376
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,320
(Orthopaedics)

377
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,890
Thank you.

378
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,419
I hope I didn't interrupt anything important.

379
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,889
You didn't. Besides, that shouldn't be an excuse.

380
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,890
It's for you of all people.

381
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,700
I've had dinner and will be getting to work.

382
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,010
Who are you this excited to text back?

383
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,750
No one. I was just wondering if her project was going well.

384
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,550
As if. It's more like you just want to see her.

385
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,720
Why don't we get...

386
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,120
something good to eat once you're done here?

387
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,159
Look at you changing the subject.

388
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,730
You're not even denying it anymore.

389
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,090
What is it, Ji Won?

390
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,530
Did you fall for someone for the very first time?

391
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,430
Don't be ridiculous.

392
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,710
My first love is you. Did you already forget?

393
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,260
Why should I be blamed for trusting him?

394
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,990
Isn't he the one to blame for taking advantage of my feelings?

395
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,610
(Bani)

396
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,080
That's not true! What's wrong with you?

397
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,230
I'm sorry.

398
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,510
Come on.

399
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,680
Are you kidding me?

400
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,070
Thanks.

401
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,300
Right.

402
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,190
Here.

403
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,160
Thanks.

404
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,570
Would you like to go to the 63 Building with me?

405
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,940
Right now?

406
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,390
Why do you call this...

407
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,820
the 63 Building?

408
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,960
Because you must walk up...

409
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,590
exactly 63 steps to get here.

410
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,960
I see.

411
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,070
I come here to dry my coveralls or fabric.

412
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,770
Coming up here puts me in a good mood.

413
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,840
It washes some of my troubles away.

414
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
You're right.

415
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,290
You were probably...

416
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,820
a bit shaken earlier.

417
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:08,530
I'm sure what happened shook you up more.

418
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,900
This isn't the first time my mom's been in this mess.

419
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,340
Still, I never seem to get used to it.

420
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,510
I try to believe she has changed her ways,

421
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,150
only to be disappointed again.

422
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,050
But I guess...

423
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,730
I don't have the right to judge her.

424
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,660
Endless disappointments.

425
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,440
Now I know that's how you felt.

426
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,420
I'm sorry...

427
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,660
for disappointing you.

428
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,330
I got carried away...

429
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,970
and acted selfishly.

430
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,470
But...

431
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,970
it's really not what you think.

432
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,910
I wasn't trying...

433
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,150
to take advantage of you.

434
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,390
I know what I did was wrong.

435
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,790
But at the time,

436
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,260
I was trying to hold onto you in any way I could.

437
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,870
You had every right...

438
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,710
to feel the way you did.

439
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,280
I'm really sorry.

440
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,070
Goodness. I didn't know someone was there.

441
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:36,179
I'm afraid this place must be locked up...

442
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,910
at night.

443
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,210
Head back down already.

444
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,250
Right. We're so sorry. We'll head down right away.

445
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,350
- Good. Hurry on down.
- Yes, sir.

446
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,960
We should get going.

447
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,700
Sure.

448
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,379
(Rewriting a legend on the court)

449
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,990
(Coach Kim Hyun Kyung's philosophy of the game)

450
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,990
- This is incredible.
- Really?

451
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,660
- Who came up with this idea?
- Me, of course.

452
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,959
- I'm home.
- I expected no less.

453
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,660
- Hey.
- You're home?

454
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,830
Yes.

455
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,429
I see Mom did an interview.

456
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,430
- Yes.
- Yes.

457
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:33,930
Here. Check out this photo.

458
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,799
Stunning, right?

459
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,870
(What do you value the most as a coach?)

460
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:40,039
If only the interview had been longer.

461
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,040
Darn it.

462
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,580
What?

463
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,210
Why did they have to stick his photo in there?

464
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,250
Why? Who is it?

465
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,489
Your mom's ex-boyfriend.

466
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,590
I see.

467
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,359
- What?
- They were the talk of the town.

468
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,630
The sports star couple of the century.

469
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,730
That's ancient history.

470
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,400
Your mom was a star in her field,

471
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:07,129
but this punk had it going for him as well.

472
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,700
He was like a celebrity.

473
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,600
Everyone around me said...

474
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,210
I stood no chance against him.

475
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,240
However,

476
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,210
I never gave up.

477
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,550
Why?

478
00:41:19,551 --> 00:41:21,980
Because love is reserved only for the brave.

479
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,620
"Did you think that would make me yours?"

480
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,250
"You're mine."

481
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,790
Gross!

482
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,290
See? I ended up winning the lady.

483
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,260
This is why you must always be brave.

484
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,930
Like your dad. Come here.

485
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,369
No, tighter.

486
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,409
Watch that side.

487
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,840
- Hold on.
- Check here.

488
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,210
- One, two, three.
- Gently.

489
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,950
- Careful.
- Sure.

490
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,250
- There.
- Yes.

491
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,120
By the way, when will Yeol get here?

492
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,030
You know what Yeol had to go through yesterday.

493
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,260
I doubt he'll be up for any of this.

494
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,260
Even I'd be feeling down.

495
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,500
Don't you agree?

496
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,170
Whatever.

497
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,110
Jae Yeol came down with something today.

498
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,140
What do you mean? Is it bad?

499
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,010
It's just a cold and the shivers,

500
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,150
but he hasn't been able to eat or sleep.

501
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,650
Apparently, he's been dealing with it all on his own.

502
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,860
That being said,

503
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,260
are you busy today?

504
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,870
Thanks, again. You only have to get him this.

505
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,770
I think it's around here somewhere.

506
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,540
Right. That must be it.

507
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,350
What brings you here?

508
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,950
Well,

509
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,190
I'm here to see Yeol.

510
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,860
Yeol's asleep.

511
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,860
Should I wake him up?

512
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,200
No.

513
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:54,940
All right, then.

514
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,199
Can you make sure he gets this?

515
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,410
(Heartwarming Porridge)

516
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,580
Also,

517
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,180
please tell him that Bani was here.

518
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,390
What? How did you get in?

519
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,630
Your passcode is still the same.

520
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,370
Don't get any ideas.

521
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,429
I called your phone,

522
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:04,240
but you weren't picking up even though I could hear it ringing.

523
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,710
I only came out of concern.

524
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,480
(Heartwarming Porridge)

525
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,820
A friend dropped it off.

526
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,930
- You should go.
- Shouldn't you see a doctor?

527
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,770
You have a terrible fever.

528
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,670
Didn't I tell you...

529
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,410
that I no longer have the patience for you?

530
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,710
So please,

531
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,410
just leave.

532
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,950
It hurts to even see you.

533
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,990
How long is this going to continue?

534
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,860
It wasn't just you. It was just as hard for me.

535
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,900
I had my reasons back then.

536
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,770
So?

537
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,670
What?

538
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:13,610
Don't say it like you had no choice.

539
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,640
In the end,

540
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:19,780
the choice you made was yours.

541
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,730
I got you some medicine.

542
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,500
Eat your meal...

543
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,900
and make sure to take it.

544
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,770
All right?

545
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,200
(Hwang Jae Yeol)

546
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:29,950
Bani.

547
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,190
Hey.

548
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:35,120
Fruit delivery.

549
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,590
Enjoy some sweet and tasty fruit.

550
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:41,630
Enjoy.

551
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,830
- Dad.
- Yes?

552
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:47,230
Did it really not bother you?

553
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,470
Mom's ex-boyfriend.

554
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,640
You said he had everything going for him.

555
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,840
Of course,

556
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,510
it bothered me.

557
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,310
How could it not?

558
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:06,090
Even I could see she was better off with him.

559
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,160
How did you keep pursuing her...

560
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,330
despite thinking that?

561
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,400
How should I put it?

562
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,830
I knew...

563
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,700
that I couldn't be with anyone but your mom.

564
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,000
I was already so in love with her. What choice did I have?

565
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,740
Since my love began budding,

566
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,940
I had to see it through.

567
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,860
You were pretty cool, Dad.

568
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,890
- Thank you for the fruit.
- Sure.

569
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,069
I'm leaving now. Call me if there's a problem.

570
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,240
Wait, Ji Won.

571
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,000
Will you be coming home late tonight?

572
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,409
- Why do you ask?
- There was an exhibit...

573
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,539
I wanted to go to.

574
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,679
And it ends today.

575
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,180
If you're not busy, can you come with me?

576
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,010
I see.

577
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,950
I feel awful.

578
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,480
But I don't think I can today.

579
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,890
Is this the first time you're saying no to me?

580
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,290
I'm sorry.

581
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,660
I'm going to the school festival with Bani today.

582
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,699
But I'll take you to another exhibit next time. I promise.

583
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,730
I'm sorry.

584
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,200
The school festival?

585
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,310
Yeol. You got the stuff from Bani, right?

586
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,480
What did you just say?

587
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,019
Did you get the tablet PC yesterday?

588
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,120
No, not that part.

589
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,250
You asked whom?

590
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,320
Bani.

591
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,990
What? Did you not see each other?

592
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,860
A friend dropped it off.

593
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,429
Hey, Yeol.

594
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,530
Hey, where are you going?

595
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,100
The rehearsal will begin any minute now.

596
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,570
Come on. You need to man the camera.

597
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,340
(Yein Hall)

598
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,119
It's just a departmental festival, but this is a great turnout.

599
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,149
You bet.

600
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,250
Art school festivals are the most popular ones.

601
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,220
What's that?

602
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,760
You don't know what this is? We've done this every year.

603
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,259
It's called the Confession Tree.

604
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,269
You can write out your confession and hang it on the tree.

605
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,030
The MC will read it one at a time.

606
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:37,440
Simply put, it's like making a public confession.

607
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:41,140
What do you say? Would you like to write one?

608
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,610
I worked really hard on making that.

609
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,679
Wait. I think the girls are here.

610
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,380
- We should slowly head over.
- Sure.

611
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,879
(I want to be with you on Christmas.)

612
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,919
(The Artists' Night)

613
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,920
Bani. Over here!

614
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,300
Hello.

615
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:04,890
- She's over there.
- Gosh.

616
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:08,390
- She looks gorgeous.
- Oh, my. Hey.

617
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,760
- Look over there.
- It's Han Yeo Reum.

618
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:14,400
- She's so pretty in person.
- No way.

619
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
This is awesome.

620
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,540
Hello, everyone.

621
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,410
I'm your host for The Artists' Night.

622
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:28,950
I'm Announcer Han Yeo Reum. Nice to meet you all.

623
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,290
Returning to my alma mater is certainly stirring up...

624
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,930
a wave of sentimentality.

625
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:45,369
I'm especially honoured to be the MC of my alma mater's festival.

626
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,770
I'm slightly nervous.

627
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:49,899
Even if I make a mistake,

628
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,739
you'll be kind enough to let it slide, right?

629
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,540
- Yes!
- Yes!

630
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,180
Then...

631
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,780
let us begin The Artists' Night now.

632
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,150
Yeol.

633
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,090
A moment, please?

634
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,440
What?

635
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,710
My microphone isn't working.

636
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,570
Could you fix it one more time?

637
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,280
Are you all right?

638
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,749
Gosh. Of course, I am.

639
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,450
Why wouldn't I be okay?

640
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:47,820
Thank you.

641
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:48,309
Give it up, go all out

642
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,820
It's time to scream out

643
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:01,789
Not to feel lonely

644
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,660
I do my own dance

645
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,170
- Two, three.
- Two, three.

646
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:22,720
All right. There can't be a festival without this program.

647
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,550
It's time for the Confession Tree.

648
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,619
The event with the Confession Tree matched countless men and women...

649
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,719
- even when I was attending here.
- Right.

650
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,390
- It's a popular event.
- Gosh.

651
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:37,230
As expected, many students participated in this event today.

652
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,500
I wonder if we'll get to see new couples forming tonight.

653
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,939
Let me draw one now.

654
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:48,139
(The Artists' Night)

655
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,410
(Thanks for the other day.)

656
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:59,450
(The Artists' Night)

657
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,090
"Seung Min."

658
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:02,959
"How about..."

659
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,760
"some late-night snack with me after the festival?"

660
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,330
Me?

661
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,330
- Go, Seung Min.
- My gosh.

662
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,630
What an ingenious idea to flirt with late-night snacks!

663
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:14,700
Seung Min, the guy who's about to get some late-night snacks.

664
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,740
Please come on up.

665
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,839
- Let's go!
- Yes!

666
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,839
- Let's go!
- Hey, cutie!

667
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,110
Let's go, Seung Min!

668
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,880
Hello.

669
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,880
Hello.

670
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:32,050
I'm Hyun Seung Min, a sophomore and a sculpture major.

671
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:37,020
- You look handsome!
- Nice to meet you.

672
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,960
Seung Min.

673
00:57:38,961 --> 00:57:43,100
Do you have any idea who wrote this confession card to you?

674
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,400
Yes.

675
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,470
- Really?
- Oh, my!

676
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,710
Let's find out if she's indeed the one he's thinking of.

677
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:57,210
I'm looking for the lovely girl who hung the confession card.

678
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:58,610
Where are you?

679
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,849
- Who is it?
- Where is she?

680
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,010
It's me.

681
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,220
Please come up to the stage.

682
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,650
- Go for it.
- You're so cool!

683
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:13,290
- Yes!
- Nice!

684
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:14,790
All right.

685
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,859
How about holding each other's gaze for ten seconds?

686
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,829
(The Artists' Night)

687
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,900
- All right.
- Oh, my.

688
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,500
Let's all count to ten together.

689
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,440
Start.

690
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:28,740
- Ten, nine, - Ten, nine,

691
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,880
- eight, seven, six, - eight, seven, six,

692
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,850
- five, four, - five, four,

693
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,850
- three, two, one.
- three, two, one.

694
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,690
Let's go!

695
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,460
- Congratulations!
- How lovely!

696
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,410
(Bani, I want to be with you on Christmas.)

697
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,880
- Why did she stop?
- What's going on?

698
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,690
What is it?

699
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,020
- What is it?
- I have no idea.

700
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:23,500
- What?
- What's wrong?

701
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,000
What is this?

702
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:27,500
"Bani."

703
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:28,800
What?

704
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,140
"I want to be with you..."

705
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,210
- Oh, my.
- Christmas?

706
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:34,770
"on Christmas."

707
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:37,310
- Oh, my.
- Bani.

708
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,910
He's thinking about Christmas already?

709
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:44,020
Just the mention of that is making my heart flutter.

710
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,850
All right then. Bani.

711
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,520
Could you come up to the stage?

712
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,100
Hey, Ban Hee Jin.

713
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,869
Don't just stand here. Go on.

714
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,000
- Go on.
- Go on.

715
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:06,040
- Go on.
- Go on.

716
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:10,180
- Go on.
- Go on.

717
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:18,419
(The Artists' Night)

718
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,520
Oh, my!

719
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:22,720
Hello.

720
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,660
I'm Ban Hee Jin, a sophomore and a sculpture major.

721
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,259
- Good luck!
- Yes!

722
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:29,800
- Good for you!
- Nice!

723
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,500
Someone has written a confession card to you.

724
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,200
Did you expect to get a card?

725
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,770
- No.
- I see.

726
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:46,080
Then you must be flustered and quite surprised.

727
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:49,880
Perhaps, the writer could be feeling more nervous than you now.

728
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,420
But we ought to meet him onstage. Don't you agree?

729
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:55,050
- Yes!
- Yes!

730
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,490
I can't wait...

731
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,890
to find out who it is.

01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,000
I'm looking for the man who wrote this confession card.

733
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,070
Please come up to the stage.

735
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,510
- Come on.
- Where is he?

736
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:23,649
- What? No one is going up.
- I don't see anyone.

737
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,419
- What's going on?
- Seriously?

738
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,650
- How come no one is going up?
- I don't see anyone going up.

739
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:30,019
- What is this?
- Come on.

740
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,919
- Was this a prank?
- Oh, no.

741
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,159
- This is so embarrassing.
- Maybe, no one wrote this.

742
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,590
- Who is it? Why isn't he coming up?
- No one is going up

743
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:37,760
- Oh, no.
- What's going on?

744
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:39,770
- What's this?
- Come on.

745
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,229
- What is this?
- What?

746
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,200
Maybe, this was a prank.

747
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,810
- Look behind you.
- There he comes.

748
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,310
- No way.
- It was him!

750
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,430
Rolling.

751
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:52,899
- Okay. Action.
- Okay.

753
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,269
You're crossing the line a lot...

754
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:58,970
for a guy she's just friends with.

755
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,369
I saw you struggling to make up your mind.

756
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:04,310
I just can't let Bani date someone like you.

757
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,840
Hee Jin.

758
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:09,050
The two of us didn't break up for good.

759
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,820
This is between us, so we'll talk about it by ourselves.

760
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,550
Don't date anyone who makes you wonder...

761
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:15,550
about his intention.

762
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,789
This is way too painful.

763
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:19,830
That's why I'll go to her.

764
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:21,590
Seriously. You...

765
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,130
drive me crazy.
