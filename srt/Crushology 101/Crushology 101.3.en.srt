00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,820
Hey, Ban Hee Jin.

4
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,030
Too bad.

5
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,960
Pardon? What do you mean?

6
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,530
I...

7
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,800
need to keep seeing you.

8
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,350
How come?

9
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,510
What?

10
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
My shirt.

11
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,790
Give me back my shirt.

12
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,970
Oh, your shirt?

13
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,840
All right. I'll return it to you later today.

14
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,640
You must give it back today.

00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,530
Here. Your shirt.

18
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,870
We're done, right?

19
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,370
We won't need to see each other ever again.

20
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,640
You're right. Let's not see each other again.

21
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,210
There's no reason to anyway.

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,180
Exactly.

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,210
Excuse me first.

24
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,740
You two haven't met before, have you?

25
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,309
He's Yeol, the department rep of Visual Design.

26
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,310
And she's Bani, the department rep of Sculpture.

27
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,850
You're the department rep?

28
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,550
So you're the department rep.

29
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,879
What's this? Do you two know each other?

30
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,920
No.

31
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,790
Nice to meet you.

32
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,030
We'll start with the group meeting right away.

33
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,069
(Arts University Alumni Interview)

34
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,600
Bani is in charge of casting.

35
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,500
Let's settle with these roles.

36
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,169
What's left is deciding which alumni to interview.

37
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,010
Who do we interview?

38
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,380
Among the graduates...

39
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,520
How about Mr. J, who gave a lecture last time?

40
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,850
But he doesn't accept any interviews.

41
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,320
I heard he recently turned down all famous magazine interviews.

42
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Is that so?

43
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,160
Then who should we interview?

44
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,190
The one casting should decide that.

45
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,660
Sorry?

46
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,830
Cast the most famous graduate, okay?

47
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,700
We're all set here, right? The meeting ends here.

48
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,540
For real? What's up with him this time?

49
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,950
Here's your meat.

50
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,520
By the way, how did you end up at the Arts University?

51
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,460
Things just worked out that way.

52
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,359
Jae Yeol.

53
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,090
I heard you were the top student in your department your first year.

54
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,500
Didn't you also win several big competitions?

55
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,199
- Seriously?
- Yes.

56
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,500
As I thought, your looks weren't everything.

57
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,540
What a fool's gold.

58
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,780
What was that just now?

59
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,020
I said, "What a fool's gold."

60
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,250
I meant the meat.

61
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,960
Look. There's too much fat.

62
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,929
I love the fatty part.

63
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,929
Meat without fat isn't meat.

64
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,229
Pork belly is all about the fat.

65
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,130
- Guys.
- It looks good.

66
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,010
Bunny!

67
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,609
What does the bunny...

68
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,879
- from Paradise say?

Two.

87
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,290
- Three.
- Three.

- Intertwine your arms!
- Intertwine!

89

- Intertwine your arms!
- Intertwine your arms!

90
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,630
Stop. I'll just drink double the amount.

91
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,469
- No, do it.
- Intertwine your arms!

92
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,169
- Intertwine your arms!
- Intertwine your arms!

93

95
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,240
Enough!

96
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,980
It hurts! You...

97
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,149
Is your head made of a rock?

98
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,120
My head hurts more!

99
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,760
Whatever. Forget it.

100
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,330
- Come on!
- No way!

101
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,059
- Boohoo!
- Boohoo!

102
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,100
Why are we drinking if nobody will follow the rules?

103
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,170
- Drink.
- Gosh.

104
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,199
Boohoo!

(Rinds, Salt-grilled Meat, Beef Tripe)

106
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,980
Jae Yeol. Can't we go for round two?

107
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,840
You can do that at each of your houses.

108
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,879
Go straight home. Don't make a detour.

109
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

110
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,650
- Thank you.
- Get in.

111
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,850
Bye.

112
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,320
- Bye.
- Bye.

113
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,550
- You too.
- You okay?

114
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,359
- Bye.
- Take care.

115
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,860
- I'm sobering up.
- Oh, gosh.

116
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,530
- No.
- Stop.

117
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,670
Guys.

118
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:46,069
- Oh, gosh.
- You can take him, right?

119
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,699
- We can, right?
- I can't see a thing.

120
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,539
- Don't worry.
- I can't see a thing.

121
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,969
- Wake up.
- Stand up, will you?

122
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,539
- Text me, Dong Ha.
- Okay. Bye.

123
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,140
- Come with me.
- Let go.

127
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,260
I almost got wet.

128

Darn it.

129
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,650
I hate him!

130
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,420

No.

135
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,570

137
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,910

Say hi to my beloved ride, Sparkle.

139

140
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,150
Don't look down on Sparkle.

This is all because Sparkle brings good luck.

148
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,680
How about a ride to celebrate?

149
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,350
No thanks.

150
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,050
Why not? I'll give you a ride.

151
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,759
- Hop on just once.
- Hey.

152
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,120
- I'll drive safely.
- Get down.

153
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,390
The artist from yesterday.

154
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,300
He's the one you said hit on you, right?

155
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Yes.

156
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,070
Did you really not know?

157
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,430
I didn't.

158
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,240
To think he'd be Mr. J.

159
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,710
But why the long face?

160
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,050
How do I put it?

161
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,380
It just feels like a dream.

162
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,620
That I'd meet him like that.

163
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,090

Can you look this way, Ji Won?

168
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,410
I knew it.

169
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,009
Because the model is a masterpiece,

170
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,550
the sketch looks good even with minimal effort.

171
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,780
Now that I look at it, you have talent in modelling.

172
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,180
I don't have talent in modelling...

173
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,490
but talent in looks.

174
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,690
Seriously.

175
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,530
I can't get used to your personality.

176
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,940
Bani. Are you free for a minute?

177
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,510
What brought you to school?

178
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,210
I had some business nearby...

179
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,150
and stopped by to see you.

180
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,920
Can I look at your sketches?

181
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,460
What?

182
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,760
But there's nothing much in here.

183
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,930
Come on. I just want to have a look.

184
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,270
Here.

185
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,250
They look good.

186
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,880
The proportions are stable.

187
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,750
You're better than I was as a student.

188
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,260
That's impossible.

189
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,690
But still, thank you.

190
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,670
Is there something you want to say?

191
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,370
You see...

192
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,110
It's nothing.

193
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,720
What is it? Just tell me.

194
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,520
Do you mind being interviewed as an alumnus?

195
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,990
- "Interviewed?" - Yes.

196
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,660
The student council is conducting an interview.

197
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,930
And the members want to interview you.

198
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,860
I see.

199
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,440
I'm asking just in case.

200
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,270
Don't let it bother you.

201
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,870
I'll do it. The interview.

202
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,940
Seriously?

203
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,380
But don't you turn down interviews?

204
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,580
You're the one asking, so I can't say no.

205
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,360
What do you think about Sparkle?

206
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,530
Can you feel her wild speed?

207
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,330
Speed, my foot.

208
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,100
Even a baby would be faster than this.

209
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,370
Sparkle and I still have to work on our teamwork.

210

211
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,710

212
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,050
My gosh.

213
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,820
Didn't he just pat her on the head?

214
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,390
What's this? I thought you two had a thing.

215
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,760
But she already had a guy.

216
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:38,810
(Welcome. New to pulling all-nighters?)

217
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,150
We're going to interview Mr. J.

218
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,180
Really?

219
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,089
My gosh. He's known for not giving interviews.

220
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,120
How did you do that?

221
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,290
I'll do it. The interview.

222
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Seriously?

223
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:00,360
You're the one asking, so I can't say no.

224
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,370
It seems the conversation with him about the interview went smoothly.

225
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Yes. He agreed to give an interview.

226
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,380
That's great.

227
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,310
Well...

228
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,850
It seems he really likes you.

229
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,420
He knows I'm a fan.

230
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,750
He treats his fan in a very special way.

231
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,520
He might not like you as a fan.

232
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,660
No way.

233
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,559
I already feel like I became a successful fan.

234
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,000
So even this feels like a dream come true.

235
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,570
Bani.

236
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,110
Can you go somewhere with me tomorrow?

237
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,080
Where?

238
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,510
Do you have a model in mind?

239
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,620
Not yet.

240
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,420
The most expensive one would be the best, right?

241
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,490
Come on. What's that attitude?

242
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,819
It's not a birthday gift for just anyone.

243
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,920
It's for your sister.

244
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,930
You should get something pretty, not just expensive.

245
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,430
Is that how it is?

246
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,170
Oh, how about this? This is pretty.

247
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,280
- Yes. It's pretty.
- So I can get a camera for free?

248
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,080
Gosh, I feel so lucky.

249
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,780
Oh, Bani.

250
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,920
Hello.

251
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,890
We've met again.

252
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,660
- Do you know me?
- The locker.

253
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,800
Can you not recognize faces or are you just forgetful?

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,600
Oh, my. I'm sorry, man.

255
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,510
No worries.

256
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,280
Oh, gosh. I've found a gem.

257
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,150

Oh, my. Handsome young man.

261
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,160
You dropped your wallet.

262
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,730
Oh, my.

263
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,900
Yes.

264
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,730
A man should have at least that much confidence.

265
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,440
I'm sorry,

266
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,040
but I think this belongs to this handsome young man.

267
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,610

- You're welcome.

268

Have a good one.

269
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,550
Do you have high self-esteem...

270
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,750
or are you just easily mistaken?

271
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,530
They're cute.

272
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,600

Hey, Mr. Mistaken.

277
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,910
Why don't we grab something since we're here?

278
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,140
It's on me.

279
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,450
- No, I don't want to.
- Why not?

280
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,980
By the way, he really has everything.

281
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,580
He's rich and handsome.

282
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,150

283

He's the grandson of the chairman of Chaon Group.

284
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,590

286

- Oh, yes!

287

Did you buy this?

288
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Why?

289
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,090
I love it. It's so pretty.

291
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,329
When you get a camera, you should decorate it.

292
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,330
Decorate the camera.

293
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,130
What? How do you know?

294
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,670
Someone told me.

295
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,640
Who? Is it the girl named Bani?

296
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,870
Yes.

- Is it here?
- It's not.

It's not?

307
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,450

00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,140
You make videos.

- Sure.

- I'll go later.
- Let's go.

327
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,620
- I'll unpack our things.

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,090
I'll get going. Enjoy the food, baby.

368
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,170
I thought it was just you and me today.

369
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,770
I didn't know there was someone else.

370
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,110
It's just because...

371
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,550
it's nice to see you both.

372
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,320
Why does he date you?

373
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,590
It seems my age is closer to his age than yours.

374
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,860
Come on.

375
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,890
Age isn't important these days.

376
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,800
People can date anyone as long as they like each other.

377
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,170
Aren't you sick of it?

378
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,770
Sick?

379
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,000
Why would I be sick of it?

380
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,610
There's nothing to be sick of when you're loved by someone.

381
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,250
Hurry up and eat. It's getting cold.

382
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,080
Where are you going?

383
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,460
Enjoy the food your boyfriend made.

384
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,990
I've lost my appetite.

386
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,970
Yeol!

(Dream Up Art Prep School)

388
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,260
Yeol. Are you going to have dinner before you go?

389
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,830
How about a pork cutlet?

390
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,600
I'm supposed to eat out with my mom today.

391
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,900
Oh, no.

393
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,970
- Yes, Mom. It's over now.
- Son. What do I do?

394
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,310
I don't think we can have dinner because something came up.

395
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,650
Okay.

396
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,620
- I see.
- I'm sorry, son.

397
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,120
I'm going to be very late tonight.

398
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,920
So don't wait for me and go to bed.

399
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,190
Okay.

400
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,099
- Shall we have a pork cutlet?
- Yes!

401
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,430
How about going to an Internet cafe after that?

402
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,830
- Deal.
- Oh, yes! Let's go.

403
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,940
- Let's go to a new place today.
- Okay.

404
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,240
Over there.

405
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,970
Isn't she your mother?

406
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,520
Something you want to eat?

407
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,050
Okay.

408
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,990
Did I see it wrong?

411
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,320
I'm visiting Mr. J's studio thanks to you.

412
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,860
I can't believe how lucky I am.

413
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,489
It's all thanks to Mr. J.

414
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,690
- This place is so nice.
- Yes.

It's Mr. J.

416
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,400
He's cool.

417
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,010
But why are Yeol and Dong Ha not coming?

418
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,550
Why did you come out of that room?

419
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,950
It's our room.

420
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,550
Is your studio right next to Mr. J's?

421
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,760
Yes.

422
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,600
I'm all ready. Shall we begin?

423
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,270
It's your first solo exhibition in Korea.

424
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,040
Is there anything that stands out as memorable to you?

425
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,080
Most people talk about the main artwork,

426
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,720
but "Destiny" is actually my favourite.

427
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,190
A predetermined destiny...

428
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,120
can be good or bad.

429
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,390
I wanted to explore both sides,

430
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,190
and there was a fan who recognized that.

431
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,400
That was the most memorable.

432
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,430
Because it made me happy.

00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,980

Mr. J, I have a question.

Yes?

- in college?
- Me?

445
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,339
It's amazing.

They say it takes one to know one.

551
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,480
Maybe you're what you say he is.

552
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,780
What?

553
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,910
I'm not!

554
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,230
Bani.

555
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,000
Hey, Ji Won.

556
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,170
Is this Solomon's seal tea?

557
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,200
- That's right.
- Of course.

558
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,340
Do you have plans after classes today?

559
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,840
Shall we go and have today's special?

560
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,540
I'm having a pyjama party with my friends.

561
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,910
- A pyjama party?
- Yes.

562
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,050
If you're not busy today, would you like to join us?

563
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,420
Am I allowed?

564
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,660
Of course!

565
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,960
Sure thing, then.

566
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,730
Let's go.

567
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,670
Just a second.

568
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:07,899
I'm not feeling well...

569
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,199
and can't be in class as the model today.

570
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,710
This is bad.

571
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,010
What's wrong?

572
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:15,510
The model for our art class...

573
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,380
called in sick today.

574
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,050
A model not showing up is what the professor hates the most.

575
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,889
Like last time, I could...

576
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,820
It's your class too.

577
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,660
What will you do, then?

578
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,730
I should find...

579
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,900
a replacement.

580
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,770
What?

581
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,610
Is it me she's looking at?

582
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,410
Are you busy right now?

583
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,690
What am I even doing here?

584
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,460
It's nothing challenging.

585
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,030
Just sit still in that chair. Easy, right?

586
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,330
- You...
- It's not easy.

587
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,500
I speak from experience...

588
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,000
when I say modelling for a portrait isn't easy.

589
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,500
It's hard to keep a pose and one needs patience.

590
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,770
But most of all,

591
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,110
one needs to look good.

592
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,720
I still think I should model for the class instead.

593
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,900
Why are you still standing? Get drawing.

594
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:14,920
Of course.

595
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,460
I have a keen eye.

596
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,090
That was the perfect choice for a model.

597
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:26,800
But...

598
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:29,840
why does it feel like he's only looking at me?

599
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,610
What's with that gaze?

600
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,739
Why is he staring at me...

601
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,980
rather than looking away?

602
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,420
This is the same...

603
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,589
as the leading man and woman in a movie...

604
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,320
falling for each other.

605
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:51,319
As if.

606
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,360
He's more like the villain.

607
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,360
Don't be fooled by that demonic gaze.

608
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,909
Thank you for helping out today.

609
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:13,510
(Energy drink)

610
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,250
You sure are shameless.

611
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,749
Is this how you repay me for having your back yesterday?

612
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,760
I was that urgent.

613
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,720
So here I am thanking you from deep down.

614
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,260
(Mr. J)

615
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,070
Hey, Mr. J.

616
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,370
Hi, Bani. Is this a good time?

617
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:40,910
Sure.

618
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,880
If you're free tomorrow, come by my studio.

619
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,610
Tomorrow?

620
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,249
I'm busy with my exhibition...

621
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,850
and won't be free another day.

622
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,490
Sure. Sounds good.

623
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:56,590
- See you tomorrow, then.
- Got it.

624
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,660
Are you meeting that sculptor tomorrow?

625
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,200
Why do you ask? To badmouth him again?

626
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,500
Anyway, thank you for today.

627
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,400
No way.

628
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,400
The rich are surely in a league of their own.

629
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:46,040
I didn't know what you'd like, so I got a bit of everything.

630
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,910
- Is this all right?
- Absolutely.

631
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,380
Everything looks great.

632
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,210
Anyway, my dad left to see my mom today,

633
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,650
so make yourselves at home.

634
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,119
By the way, I didn't have time...

635
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,650
to prepare the proper attire.

636
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,119
Next time, I'll be in silk pyjamas.

637
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,860
Of course. Silk for the young master.

638
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,200
That being said, did your interview go well yesterday?

639
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,900
Yes.

640
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,670
What's that smile just now?

641
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,710
Actually,

642
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,540
Mr. J invited me separately to his studio tomorrow.

643
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,240
- Just you?
- Yes.

644
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,849
How's that for a success story?

645
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,580
He didn't invite you as his fan. It's more of a date.

646
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,850
It'll be just you two...

647
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,720
in his private art studio.

648
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,290
A date?

649
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:37,619
Isn't it more common to go to the theater or something?

650
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,760
That's why this is more exciting.

651
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,630
It's more intimate.

652
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,330
I'm not sure about this. Are you sure it's a date?

653
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,370
What if you end up just helping him in the studio?

654
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,240
As a guy, what's your opinion?

655
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,770
Well,

656
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,910
the company matters more than the location.

657
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,610
It could start off as a work thing, but it could become intimate.

658
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,410
Yes, intimate.

659
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,550
You'll find out once you get there.

660
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,350
If it's truly a date or not.

661
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,190
What is this?

662
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,300
I thought it was a message about an audition.

663
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:16,659
(Film Review of "Fogpiercer")

664
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,729
(I'm a fan of the director, but it was better than expected.)

665
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:18,869
(I'm shocked that you liked a movie by a pretentious wannabe.)

666
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,229
This again.

667
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,470
What? What happened?

668
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:24,199
So this member keeps making insulting comments...

669
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,540
on my Drama and Movie Forum posts.

670
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,170
Darn it.

671
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,989
Oh, my. You look gorgeous today.

672
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,660
Good luck, Ban Hee Jin!

673
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,680
- You're here.
- Hey.

674
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,550
Did you get home safely last night?

675
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,579
Well, I meant to check if you got home safely.

676
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,490
But I fell asleep while waiting.

677
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,550
Yes. I got home safely.

678
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,860
Okay. See you soon.

679
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Ji Won.

680
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:30,870
Do I look better with my hair down...

681
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:33,910
or up?

682
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,880
Well,

683
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,649
since your outfit today gives off a cheerful vibe,

684
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,150
a hairstyle with a lively vibe would be a nice match.

685
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,390
You know like a high bun?

686
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,490
You can use that to tie your hair.

687
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,300
Yes. That's a great idea.

688
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,430
I knew I asked the right guy. You have a good eye.

689
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,900
All good?

690
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:04,770
Yes.

691
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,749
My gosh. Is this a drawing or a picture?

692
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,820
Jae Yeol, it looks just like you.

693
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,260
Darn it. Why did they put this out here?

694
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,960
Ban Hee Jin is great at drawing.

695
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,260
Great, my foot.

696
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,160
Why? It looks great.

697
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,000
Well, how should I put it?

698
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,700
I can feel affection for her model in her drawing.

699
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,180
What affection? Don't be ridiculous.

700
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,680
Hey, that's really important in art.

701
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,890
Yes. Take a look at this one.

702
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:56,390
What is this?

703
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,590
You get something like this when there's no affection.

704
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:00,330
This is Brooding Jae Yeol.

705
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,160
Hey, Bani.

706
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:06,270
We were looking at your drawing just now.

707
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,800
I see. Okay.

708
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:11,500
Do you have an important plan today?

709
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,240
You're looking more dressed up than usual.

710
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,909
I have somewhere to be.

711
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,910
I'll see you guys around.

712
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,350
Bye.

713
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:23,980
Okay, bye.

714
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,290
Hey, we should get going too.

715
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,870
Hey, watch my bike for a second.

716
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,070
I'll go and get some coffee.

717
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,570
Hey, hurry back.

718
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,240
Why is he so adamant on driving this thing?

719
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,850
This is so embarrassing.

720
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,390
Hello.

721
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,760
You can also order over there at the kiosk.

722
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,100
Well,

723
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,700
for some reason, using a kiosk to order...

724
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:16,100
feels so impersonal to me.

725
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,840
I plan to be a regular here.

726
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,640
I'll order here, so you get used to seeing me here.

727
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,680
Sure.

728
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,080
What would you like?

729
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,490
Two cups of hot Americano.

730
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,960
Sure.

731
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:41,630
I guess he's a popular Visual Design major.

732
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,369
- That's funny.
- Its name is Sparkle.

733
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,900
- Oh, my.
- This isn't mine.

734
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,799
Seriously? What is that?

735
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,070
This isn't mine.

736
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:51,670
What's up with the heart?

737
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,440
- That's hilarious.
- Darn it.

738
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:57,540
Have a good day.

739
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,150
Right back...

740
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,450
at you.

741
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,550
- What?
- Right back at you.

742
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,220
You too have a good day.

743
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:08,120
(Yeol)

744
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:11,260
- Hello.
- What's taking you so long?

745
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,459
People keep staring at me.

746
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,230
I see. The assignment about the UI design?

747
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,500
Yes, I actually checked it.

748
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,739
The touch gestures are too alike.

749
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,140
Well, we need to tweak them with a variety of different options.

750
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,569
What are you talking about? What nonsense is this?

751
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,240
Yes, sure. Let's discuss them in person later.

752
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,580
Hello?

753
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,520
I must get going. I have an appointment.

754
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,320
See you tomorrow.

755
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,060
My gosh. My head is all over the place.

756
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:47,130
I forgot the coffee.

757
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,250
Did he step out for a moment?

758
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,650
Gosh, the directions...

759
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,750
Come on.

760
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,319
Good grief. Ho Dong and Choon Shik are having a problem...

761
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,390
finding this place.

762
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,730
You go ahead first. I'll pick them up.

763
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:22,100
Okay.

764
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,050
- What are you doing here?
- You startled me.

765
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,650
You said you had somewhere to be.

766
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:50,520
Yes. And this is the place.

767
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,660
You were meeting him here?

768
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,060
Yes. Why?

769
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,470
Bani.

770
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,080
You should've called me when you arrived. Let's go in.

771
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:12,810
Okay.

772
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,790
Here you go. I brought coffee.

773
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,890
- Thank you.
- Sure.

774
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,110
What's this?

775
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,050
I just started on that. I'm only shaping it for now.

776
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:47,980
How fascinating.

777
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:49,480
Would you like to try it?

778
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,190
- Can I?
- Of course.

779
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:55,859
To submit it by the end of the month,

780
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,690
we must finish filming by this day.

781
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:58,989
Do you think our schedule will be too tight?

782
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:00,359
- Come on.
- Come on.

783
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,129
Dong Ha, you have us.

784
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,830
You don't need to worry about that.

785
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,170
- He's right. Just trust us on this.
- Yes.

786
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,210
Did Choon Shik do that?

787
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,320
When did I do that?

788
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,480
They're two different things.

789
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,290
Bani.

790
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,160
Yes?

791
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:49,740
No.

792
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,850
No.

793
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,380
What's wrong, Yeol?

794
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,220
Did you not eat? Should I order something?

795
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,020
Hey, about that...

796
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,220
I'll order it.

797
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:07,630
Yeol wants to treat us.

798
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,740
Is it because the material is high-quality?

799
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,300
It's so soft.

800
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,310
That's because you're good.

801
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,460
Just focus on carving it along the wood grain.

802
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,930
Here too. Carve it just like this.

803
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,470
Your jjajangmyeon is here.

804
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,370
Oh, jjajangmyeon. That's for us.

805
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:02,920
I must have...

806
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:06,220
put down the wrong address.

807
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:14,990
Then have a good day.

808
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:16,400
Have a good day.

809
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,970
Carry on then.

810
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,210
This is tasty.

811
00:58:27,211 --> 00:58:29,780
- Gosh, this restaurant is great.
- The food is very good.

812
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,410
- Try the tangsuyuk.
- Okay.

813
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,180
Seriously.

814
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:38,120
Are you not going to eat your jjajangmyeon?

815
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,919
- The food is amazing.
- Yes.

816
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,390
Just go ahead and eat your fill.

817
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:47,030
There's a nice park around here. Would you like to go for a walk?

818
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:49,760
Sure, sounds good.

819
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,430
Let's go.

820
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,410
The weather is amazing today.

821
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:02,840
And this gelato is great too.

822
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:04,180
Right.

823
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,650
It's my first time being impressed by gelato.

824
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,680
- Really?
- Yes.

825
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,280
Since meeting you, there have been so many firsts.

826
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,520
The interview and the gelato.

827
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,630
Edit on the 19th. Post production on the 20th.

828
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,730
It is pretty tight.

829
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,330
Let me take off your mic.

830
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,810
(Timecode)

831
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:31,300
(Timecode)

832
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,700
Hey, Yeol. Where are you going?

833
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:44,980
Bani.

834
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:47,180
Wait.

835
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:05,870
All done.

836
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:08,270
Thank you.

837
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,030
Ban Hee Jin.

838
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,490
Let's get you home.

839
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,450
- Jae Yeol.
- Let's get you home.

840
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:00,050
(Crushology 101)

841
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,109
- What?
- Hwang Jae Yeol, that jerk.

842
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,279
What's his problem?

843
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,980
I take it that you're the nosy type.

844
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,389
Then what about you?

845
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:07,589
Are you concerned about Ban Hee Jin?

846
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:10,590
Could it be that they're fighting over Bani?

847
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,160
I'm here to see you.

848
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,460
What are we, exactly?

849
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,870
We can't let Ban Hee Jin and Jo Ah Lang see each other.

850
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,570
You and Bani aren't this close.

851
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,940
Hey, Ban Hee Jin.

852
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,140
You. Stop occupying my head space.
