That didn't take long.

When are you going to school tomorrow?

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,610
At two in the afternoon.

8
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,750
Then, why don't we go together?

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,020
I'll come pick you up here.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,960
Okay.

11
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,960
You should head inside now.

12

00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,700
Okay.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,430
You too.

15
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,040
Bye.

17
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,050

19
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,510

Did I keep you waiting?

23
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,540
No. I just got here.

24
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,449
Did you get some sleep last night?

25
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,479
I did.

26
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,149
I slept like a baby for the first time in days.

27
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,150
Is that so?

28
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,850
I actually couldn't sleep well.

29
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,490
Because I missed you.

30
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,030
Let's go.

31
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,270
Okay.

32
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,570
Do you only have one class today?

33
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,410
Yes. What about you?

34
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,840
I'm free today.

35
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,579
What? Does that mean you're going because of me?

36
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,010
Yes. I want to spend time with you.

37
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,150
Yeol. What's going on?

38
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,390
Are you two actually holding hands right now?

39
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,319
- My gosh.
- Hey.

40
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,220
What I'm seeing right now is real, right?

41
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,390
Is this a prank?

42
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,900

For real?

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,139
Wait. Shouldn't there be a storyline, so how?

46
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,570
Things just happened.

47
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,610
We're leaving first.

48

52

Why are you the one crying?

55
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,259
Come on. Things didn't work out for him.

56
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,870
I see. It's okay. That's nothing new.

57
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,170
Hey. You have us, Dong Ha.

58
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,309
- Stop crying.
- Shall we get pork cutlet?

59
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,310
Yes.

00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,810
If only exam week ends quickly and our break starts.

188
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,539
I already have a list of things I want us to do over the break.

189
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,210
- What are they?
- First off,

190
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,079
going to the ice rink,

191
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,479
getting carp bread and fish cakes from the streets,

192
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,350
and enjoying the first snow. And lastly,

193
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,120
spending Christmas Eve together.

194
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,289
My all-time wish is to spend...

195
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,000
Christmas Eve with my boyfriend.

196
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,370
Okay. Let's do that.

197
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,600
All right. I'm in.

198
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,010
I thought my dad's pasta was the best in the world.

199
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,210
But...

200
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,380
you beat him.

201
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,920
- Really?
- Yes.

202
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,480
Keep it a secret from my dad.

203
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,690
My dad sulks if I don't tell him...

204
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,689
the food he makes is delicious.

205
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,730
He only cooks that dish until I say it's good.

206
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,730
Funny, right?

207
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,830
I've always been curious,

208
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,370
but how are you so close with your dad?

209
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,340
We have a lot in common.

210
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,510
That's why we get along very well.

211
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,350
It's really nice to see you getting along well with your parents.

212
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,829
Are you busy, son?

213
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,459
I might forget your face.

214
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,700
Please come by sometime.

215
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,270
Is it your mother?

216
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,470
Yes.

217
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,410
Have you not seen her since that day?

218
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,150
It seems she misses you.

219
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,920
Why don't you visit her?

220
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,880
I just...

221
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,250
I want to try as well.

222
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,620
But honestly, it's not easy.

223
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,590
It's not like you don't like her or anything.

224
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,790
Actually, I don't know...

225
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,260
how to make peace with my mom.

226
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,440
I was never close to her.

227
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,270
Well...

228
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,310
Then...

229
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,180
why don't you try approaching her?

230
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,850
Or...

231
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,420
- do you need my help?
- What?

232
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,990
(Okay, I will. I miss...)

233
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,389
Wait.

234
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,859
(Okay, I will. I miss you too.)

235
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,059
Why did you send it?

236
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,160
What's the heart?

237
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,030
Trust me just once.

238
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,500
She'll love it.

239
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Give it to me.

240
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,940
Let me unsend it.

241
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,440
This is unusual.

242
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,809
Your reply is so sweet.

243
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,880
It makes me happy.

244
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,140
I told you. I said she'd like it.

245
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,880
Well...

246
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,890
- Let me send her an emoji too.
- No.

247
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,689
Nothing more.

248
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,459
Why? She likes it.

249
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,020
- Let me send it just once.
- I said no.

250
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,330
I'll say yes to this.

251
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,910
Hey, Ko Bong Soo!

252
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
Hey!

253
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,350
I told you not to call me by my name loudly.

254
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,590
Sorry.

255
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,060
That's why I said we should meet outside the campus.

256
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,360
I'm sorry.

257
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,930
It's because people are still talking about the past.

258
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
By the way,

259
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,730
it seems Hee Jin is doing well.

260
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,700
She is, unlike you.

261
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,340
Who is he?

262
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,750
Him?

263
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,880
He's the grandson of the CEO of Chaon Group.

264
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Chaon Group?

265
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,679
Why is someone like him with her?

266
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,190
It was during the art festival.

267
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,490
This guy confessed his feelings to her in front of people.

268
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,159
People from our department said she dumped the trash...

269
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,790
and found a great guy.

270
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,060
You punk.

271
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,729
Here's the trash.

272
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,099
You know Ko Bong Soo, right?

273
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,640
He's Ko Bong Soo, the trash.

274
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,939
(The most romantic confession ever in Yein University)

275
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,340
You little...

276
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,350
(Dogwon Industries Co., Ltd.)

277
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,710
Just a minute.

278
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,490
I was going to wrap up now.

279
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,120
Do you want to have dinner together?

280
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,460
Shall we?

281
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,830
I'm not hungry today.

282
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,530
- You guys go ahead.
- You haven't had dinner yet.

283
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,470
I ate so many snacks that I can still taste it in my mouth.

284
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,400
I have a lot of work too.

285
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,570
Go ahead and have dinner with her.

286
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,110
Okay then.

287
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,379
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

288
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,440
Let's go.

289
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,790
It's my first time to eat just with you.

290
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,520
If we were going to eat anyway,

291
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,890
I wish we'd gone somewhere better than the cafeteria.

292
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,630
No. I like cafeteria food.

293
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,600
That's a relief.

294
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,840
By the way,

295
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,110
why do you not date anyone?

296
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,090
So many people have a crush on you.

297
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,390
I wonder why you don't date anyone.

298
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,460
I...

299
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,600
actually like someone.

300
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,340
Hee Jin.

301
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,940
Bong Soo?

302
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,980
Why are you here?

303
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,820
No matter how much I think about it, it's unfair.

304
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,990
That you're dating someone...

305
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,090
after ruining my life.

306
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,190
- What?
- I knew it.

307
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,390
I wondered why you were so angry.

308
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,699
Was your goal from the start to dump me...

309
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,300
and find a rich guy?

310
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,200
Did you think making a fool out of me...

311
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,900
would help you attract a rich guy and elevate your life?

312
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,539
What on earth are you talking about?

313
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,710
But what do I do?

314
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,340
I can't stand to see that happen, no matter what.

315
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,850
What if you can't?

316
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,420
It seems you're mistaken.

317
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,220
It's not me who ruined your life.

318
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,430
It's you.

319
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,160
Gosh.

320
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,100
Here comes the main character.

321
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,400
Right. It's all my fault.

322
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,070
Everything you said is right.

323
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,210
It's all my fault?

324
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,840
Oh, yes.

325
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,450
Hee Jin.

326
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,960
I'll ruin your life like you ruined mine.

327
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,769
(Yeol)

328
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,069
Hello, Bani. What are you doing?

329
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,940
Yeol! I'm in the department room!

330
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,450
Bani?

331
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,310
Hey, what's the matter?

332
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,850
Hey.

333
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,420
Oh, gosh.

334
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,860
You...

335
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,830
What are you doing?

336
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,470
So...

337
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,240
So what?

338
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,050
Darn it.

339
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,150
Are you okay?

340
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,720
Report to the police first.

341
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Gosh.

342
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,030
You...

343
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,980
Oh, gosh!

344
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,380
Gosh, it hurts!

345
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,010
Wait. My goodness.

346
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,419
We might ask you...

347
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,250
to come to the police station as a witness later.

348
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
Bani!

349
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,060
Are you okay?

350
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,330
Are you hurt?

351
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,360
This is unfair!

352
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,370
- I was just trying to talk.
- That jerk.

353
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,900
That so-called boyfriend of hers got the wrong idea all by himself.

354
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,770
Please be quiet.

355
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,509
- I mean...
- Get in.

356
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,779
Let's talk at the police station.

357
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,309
- Wait.
- Get in.

358
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,750
Hold on!

359
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,480
- Get in the car.
- Wait.

360
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,350
Bani! Wait!

361
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,440
I'm sorry I'm late.

362
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
I came as soon as I could.

363
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,980
Why are you sorry?

364
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,420
You must've been surprised.

365
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,090
I'm fine. I'm worried about you.

366
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,330
Go inside and take a rest. It was a rough day.

367
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,000
Yes. I'll go inside.

368
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,970
Okay. See you later.

369
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,510
- Get home safe.
- Yes.

370
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,370
You're here.

371
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,740
The cut.

372
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,940
- Are you okay?
- What?

373
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,210
This?

374
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,950
I'm sorry. It's because of me.

375
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,620
Why are you sorry?

376
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,660
I didn't get injured much.

377
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,460
I put the Band-Aid just in case.

378
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,900
How about you? Are you okay?

379
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,970
You must've been shocked yesterday.

380
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,330
Honestly,

381
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,310
I still can't fathom what happened.

382
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,280
I don't know what I should do about it either.

383
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,850
Let's try whatever we can.

384
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,020
I'll help.

385
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,090
Bani.

386
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,230
Are you all right?

387
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,530
My goodness.

388
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,870
He’s just trouble from start to finish.

389
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,730
He even ruined your work now.

390
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,800
Is there anything we can help you with?

391
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,570
I'm fine. I'll let you know when I need any help.

392
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,980
You must tell us.

393
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,380
Okay?

394
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
What?

395
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,180
What's this now?

396
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,120
- Why?
- Well...

397
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,520
On the community...

398
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,929
We need to stop people from writing posts like that.

399
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,100
Can you recognize who it is?

400
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,899
It's all a lie.

401
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,999
It's destiny.

402
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,740
- What are you doing?
- Oh, gosh.

403
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,839
You're here.

404
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,010
What's going on? Why are you so surprised?

405
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,739
- I'm not surprised.
- Not at all.

406
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,750
No.

407
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,809
- What is it?
- Nothing.

408
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,420
- Give it to me.
- No. It's nothing.

409
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,750
Give it to me.

410
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,920
You shouldn't give it to him.

411
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,960
Recent updates on the Sculpture Department's Confession Tree Couple.

412
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,059
- I want a prince too.
- I saw them...

413
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,060
passing by the College of Art,

414
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:52,359
- and they looked good together.
- Did something happen?

415
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,459
Ko Bong Soo from the Philosophy Department...

416
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,069
- caused trouble again.
- He's not her boyfriend.

417
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,299
Her rich boyfriend is amazing.

418
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,400
Isn't it insane?

419
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,509
(I envy her so much. She should pay more taxes.)

420
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,979
(It seems they're still dating.)

421
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,380
(I want to have a boyfriend like him.)

422
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,220
What's wrong with them?

423
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,190
Why did they post it at a time like this?

424
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,230
I don't know what to say.

425
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,000
You've been put in an awkward situation because of me.

426
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,830
I'm sure it'll blow over quickly.

427
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,570
Your boyfriend might not be happy about it.

428
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,099
- Sorry?
- I mean...

429
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,570
Everyone thinks Ji Won is your boyfriend.

430
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,710
I wouldn't be happy about it if I were him.

431
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,690
Boyfriend, my foot.

432
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,730
Why do they call him a prince?

433
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,589
(I want a prince too.)

434
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,829
(I saw them passing by the College of Art,)

435
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,859
(and they looked good together.)

436
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,929
(I want to have a boyfriend like him.)

437
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,370
(Bani)

438
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,840
Yes, Bani.

439
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,810
Well...

440
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,910
Have you seen the post?

441
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,990
Isn't it ridiculous?

442
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,549
It was nonsense.

443
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,359
I'm thinking of posting an explanation.

444
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
Bani.

445
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Yes?

446
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,830
I'm fine.

447
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,030
It's not true anyway.

448
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,570
So don't worry about it too much.

449
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,210
You have many things to worry about already.

450
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,440
Yes.

451
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,810
Thank you.

452
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,050
Oh, right. Yeol.

453
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,650
I think I should start working all night from today.

454
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,160
Okay.

455
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,030
You should call me when something happens.

456
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,690
- Sure.
- Okay.

457
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,980
Dong Ha.

458
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,480
- Yes?
- Please help me.

459
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,779
You woke me up...

460
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,180
to do this?

461
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,220
Gosh. This will be enough, right?

462
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,559
Do you think this won't be enough?

463
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Do you want her stomach to explode?

464
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,490
If you're going to do this, just send a snack truck.

465
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:37,930
Oh, right.

466
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,800
I should've done exactly that.

467
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,600
- Why are you telling me only now?
- What?

468
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,710
What?

469
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:53,510
Is it normal for Bani and Won to work so closely together?

470
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,349
Fortunately, not much of it was broken off.

471
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,220
No wonder people think they're dating.

472
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,449
What I meant was...

473
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,219
that someone who's clearly dense...

474
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,929
might misunderstand the situation.

475
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,360
- Hey. You should leave.
- What?

476
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,200
Thanks.

477
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,630
Wait. Hold on.

478
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,670
- Inside, there's...
- Bani.

479
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,770
How about a late-night snack?

480
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,680
I was kind of getting hungry, so this was great timing.

481
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,079
Eat up, okay? Dig in.

482
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,750
- That'll keep you energized.
- Sure.

483
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,650
Did you really buy all of this for us to eat?

484
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,690
Not "us." Just Bani.

485
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,890
You're freeloading.

486
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,260
Careful. You'll get it on your sleeve.

487
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,840
I didn't want her to ruin her clothes.

488
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,370
I didn't say anything.

489
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,550
I'm going to the rest room to wash my hands.

490
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:04,950
Sure.

491
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,320
Ji Won.

492
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,230
Aren't you interested in studying abroad?

493
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,600
I wouldn't mind you staying there for good.

494
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,360
That's out of the blue.

495
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,370
Why are you studying in Korea when you're loaded?

496
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,600
How about the US?

497
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,910
It's a long flight there which is perfect.

498
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,740
- That's why the US is good for me?
- Yes.

499
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,450
A global talent. That suits you.

500
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,720
If you're not going to move to the US,

501
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,420
I suggest you keep a moderate distance. Got it?

502
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,600
I appreciate you helping Bani out,

503
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,470
but keep a distance of 30cm at all times.

504
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,770
I'm not joking.

505
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,560
You're home.

506
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,790
You're home late. Have you eaten?

507
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,230
I have.

508
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,330
What is it?

509
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,360
Is something up?

510
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,680
Mom, Dad.

511
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,780
There's a good chance...

512
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,519
that I won’t receive the scholarship for next semester.

513
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
What?

514
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,859
Why, though?

515
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,130
Don't you think you'll get good enough grades?

516
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,399
I mean, if you don't get it, then you don't get it.

517
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,900
- It's fine.
- He's right.

518
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,599
We're grateful for the scholarships you've already received.

519
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,239
And here I thought it was something serious.

520
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,909
My daughter, did you think...

521
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,739
we wouldn't be able to pay your tuition?

522
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,309
Exactly. We've got it covered,

523
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,239
so there's no need for you to worry about it.

524
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,950
Okay? Good.

525
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,210
- Honey.
- Yes?

526
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:19,379
Scholarships were never something I could receive.

527
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,919
I didn't even know how to spell the word.

528
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,420
- How do you spell it?
- I have no idea.

529
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,860
- It starts with S.
- Don't worry.

530
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,330
Or is it Z?

531
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,740
You know what?

532
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,070
Just do whatever you can, Hee Jin.

533
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:07,360
Here's to another good day. My Bani's the best. You've got this!

534
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,679
Go, me! I can do this.

535
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,810
(Bani: Go, me! I can do this.)

536
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,819
Are you going to redo the arm?

537
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,020
Yes. I'll have to attach it afterward.

538
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,630
Ji Won, would it be okay to use plaster on this?

539
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,259
It might need a layer of fabric...

540
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,300
Bani.

541
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,750
- Bani, I'll get more water.
- Sure.

542
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,790
(Yeol: Are you done at the studio? Call me when you're heading home.)

543
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,059
(Yeol: Are you done at the studio? Call me when you're heading home.)

544
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,260
Are you done at the studio?

545
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,260
Call me when you're heading home.

546
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,310
What the...

547
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,450
When did I fall asleep?

548
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,070
(Are you done at the studio? Call me when you're heading home.)

549
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,180
The phone is turned off. After the tone...

550
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,150
I don't think she came home last night.

551
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,090
Really? She made it home.

552
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,820
Ban Hee Jin!

553
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,530
Get up.

554
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,130
When did you get home?

555
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,360
After midnight.

556
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,939
Get up for now. You need to go to school.

557
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,000
Come on.

558
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,080
The phone is turned off. After the tone...

559
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,530
Who is it?

560
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,940
I'm Bani's boy...

561
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,270
I mean, I'm Bani's friend.

562
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,080
Bani's friend?

563
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
Yes.

564
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,449
I've heard on many occasions that you were good-looking,

565
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,620
but I had no idea you were this easy on the eyes.

566
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,420
I wouldn't say he's easy on the eyes.

567
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,160
Anyway, it's good to meet you.

568
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,660
I'm Bani's father.

569
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,590
Oh, right.

570
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,429
I'm Hwang Jae Yeol. It's a pleasure to meet you.

571
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,670
We already greeted one another.

572
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,570
- Please make yourself at home.
- Are you squeezing my hand?

573
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,870
Of course not.

574
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Right.

575
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,740
Why are you here this early in the morning?

576
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,879
- Well...
- As if this counts as early.

577
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,650
You probably want to go to school with her.

578
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,120
Right.

579
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,750
You're awake. Come here and join us for breakfast.

580
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,490
- Sit.
- Jae Yeol, what are you doing here?

581
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,460
Please enjoy.

582
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,500
Right. I'll enjoy the meal.

583
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,409
It's been ages since I enjoyed...

584
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,439
a home-cooked meal as delicious as this.

585
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,379
Right? You rarely get to enjoy one when you live alone.

586
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,579
Since you're here, why don't I pack some food for you?

587
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,580
Hold on.

588
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,849
Don't I get a say since I did the cooking?

589
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,619
Is there anything in particular you like?

590
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,819
He likes rolled omelets.

591
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,759
With a lot of chopped spring onions and carrots.

592
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,589
He also likes doenjang stew with soft tofu and not regular tofu.

593
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:47,029
Oh, right. He also likes shredded braised chicken.

594
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,400
- I see.
- Shredded braised chicken?

595
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,600
Bani, it's amazing how you know all his favourite dishes in detail.

596
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,470
What about you?

597
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,370
Do you know what Bani likes?

598
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,050
She likes everything that you make, sir.

599
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,180
That's why I wanted to try it myself.

600
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,720
It's delicious.

601
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,059
- Is it good?
- Yes.

602
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,059
Then can you explain what you like and why you like it...

603
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,529
in excruciating detail...

604
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:18,489
- to me?
- Why would you dive into detail?

605
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,000
- We should let the kids eat.
- Please enjoy.

606
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:23,300
Here.

607
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,030
This is bulgogi.

608
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:29,810
Thank you.

609
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:36,750
Look at you eat everything that's given to you.

610
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,180
Is it good?

611
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,520
I like bulgogi myself.

612
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,190
Don't get any on the floor. It's my job to clean up.

613
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,759
- I enjoyed the meal.
- I'm glad to hear that.

614
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,259
Feel free to drop by anytime if you'd like breakfast.

615
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,059
- Sure.
- Shouldn't you ask me...

616
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,060
since I do the cooking?

617
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,370
Come by whenever you want. You should get going too.

618
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:00,870
Then, take care.

619
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,040
- I'm off to school.
- Sure.

620
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,110
Come on. Let's head inside.

621
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,680
- Make your way to school.
- Sure.

622
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,229
It's been a while since I last saw my mom...

623
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,100
smile so warmly like that.

624
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,629
My dad's usually the talkative one,

625
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,870
but he was holding back his words to seem serious.

626
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,610
Jae Yeol.

627
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,980
Are you upset with me?

628
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,060
I couldn't reach you and that worried me.

629
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,260
Sorry.

630
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,259
I worked late into the night...

631
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,060
and fell asleep the second I got home.

632
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,230
Next time, no matter how late it is,

633
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,400
please reply to me first. Got it?

634
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,370
Got it. I promise to do that.

635
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,540
I'm sorry.

636
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,210
Sure.

637
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:45,370
No wonder it was quiet in here.

638
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
Actually,

639
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,260
there's someone I like.

640
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,590
Have you told her how you feel?

641
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,900
No.

642
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,170
Why not?

643
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,540
Because I can't.

644
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,980
Right now, I'm good with just being by her side.

645
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,800
(November 28, Friday)

646
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,040
(Conclusion: The Durability of Love and a New Direction)

647
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,880
Bani.

648
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,550
What?

649
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,249
When did you get here?

650
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,450
Are you done for today?

651
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,090
Yes.

652
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,730
Let's go then.

653
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:51,960
It's getting late.

654
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,740
Okay.

655
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,209
(Art Hall)

656
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,280
I really thought there were more people in the room.

657
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,010
I guess I was asleep for a long time.

658
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,480
Jae Yeol.

659
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:18,890
Yes?

660
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,260
I'm sorry. What did you say?

661
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,100
Nothing.

662
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,440
The final evaluation is tomorrow, right?

663
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,840
Yes.

664
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,390
Everything will work out well.

665
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,769
The police arrested A who ran an investment scam...

666
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,870
by promising high returns through a business venture.

667
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,439
Over the year, A encouraged a total of 28 victims to invest...

668
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,209
in an environmental project that didn't exist.

669
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,479
A is under suspicion...

670
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,720
of swindling three million dollars as investment funds.

671
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,989
I can't believe there are still investment scammers like that.

672
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,319
Good grief.

673
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,420
In the beginning, I was cautious.

674
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,059
- But we have known...
- Are you leaving already?

675
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,330
- each other...
- Eat before you head out.

676
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:33,060
I'm good. I'm too sleepy to be even hungry.

677
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,200
- Where's Dad?
- He left early this morning.

678
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,300
- I see. Is that so?
- I heard there was a patent too.

679
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:41,040
- Okay.
- Okay. Have a good day.

680
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,009
Thanks. See you later at home.

681
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,110
Okay.

682
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,210
I received the dividend.

683
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,210
I started to believe that the business was making money.

684
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,549
My landlord suddenly asked me to increase the deposit.

685
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:52,920
- My gosh.
- So I didn't know what to do.

686
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,420
But then I thought this could help me with the deposit.

687
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,619
So I trusted A and invested all of my money.

688
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,719
(Park Jun Yeon, Victim)

689
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,520
How am I going to face my family?

690
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,329
The police have expanded their investigation...

691
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,859
- with the possibility that...
- What?

692
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,229
there may be more victims.

693
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,729
They also announced that...

694
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,730
they're looking for a solution to retrieve the funds.

695
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:13,170
I'd like to thank you for your hard work over the year.

696
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,040
Yoo Ri's piece will be the main piece.

697
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,680
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

698
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,079
Good luck with your exhibition.

699
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,449
And go home early today.

700
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,120
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

701
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,250
- My gosh.
- Yoo Ri.

702
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,189
- Seriously?
- Congratulations.

703
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,890
- Good for you.
- I told you she was good.

704
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,059
I know what happened to you wasn't fair.

705
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,560
But I had to be fair with my evaluations.

706
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,560
You understand that, right?

707
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,830
Yes.

708
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,430
Let's go.

709
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,400
- My gosh. Nice.
- Let's go.

710
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,980
I'm sure yours would have been the main piece.

711
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,450
No. Your piece deserves to be the main piece.

712
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,549
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

713
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,550
Sure.

714
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,090
Let's go, Yoo Ri.

715
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,530
Are you all right?

716
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,140
Yes. There's nothing I can do.

717
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,470
I still managed to finish my piece.

718
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,410
To be honest, I'm worried about my scholarship.

719
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,350
(Mommy)

720
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:36,620
Yes, Mom.

721
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,760
Bani. What do we do?

722
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,060
What? What's wrong?

723
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,800
I'm at the police station.

724
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,030
The police station?

725
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:54,840
(Seongcheon Police Station)

726
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:56,940
Seriously.

727
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,839
You must not have been thinking straight...

728
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,979
seeing how you invested that much money in one venture.

729
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,850
How could you invest all of our 50,000 dollars?

730
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,880
There's a limit to one's stupidity.

731
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:09,650
It's just that...

732
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,720
your body has been in so much pain lately.

733
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,290
Bani was upset for losing her scholarship.

734
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,160
Hey...

735
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:21,200
I wanted to be helpful in some way.

736
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,570
I really thought they were a trustworthy friend.

737
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,870
Your so-called trustworthy friend scammed you.

738
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:32,940
I'm sorry.

739
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,980
I'm sorry, Bani.

740
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,650
Yes.

741
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,590
Okay.

742
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:51,990
Come on. Try it.

743
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,129
What is it?

744
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,830
What was the call about? Why did you sound so serious?

745
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,740
Remember the contest we entered?

746
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,310
We passed the preliminary round!

747
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,549
- What?
- What?

748
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:10,550
The one we submitted...

749
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,550
- over the break?
- Yes.

750
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:13,520
We didn't get a call about that, so I assumed we didn't pass.

751
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,189
Passing the preliminary means we'll get an award, right?

752
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,190
Right?

753
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,800
- Hey, Bani.
- Hey.

754
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,800
Remember the contest we entered? We passed the preliminary round.

755
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,100
- Really?
- Yes.

756
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,409
So winning an award is guaranteed.

757
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,840
They'll announce the winner of the Grand Award next month.

758
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,410
They just called me to request additional assignments.

759
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,980
That's great news.

760
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,310
Congratulations.

761
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,490
What about you?

762
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:52,150
How did your final evaluation go?

763
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,560
Mine won't be the main piece.

764
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,330
But it's fine.

765
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:06,400
It didn't catch me by surprise.

766
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,239
Yeol.

767
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,169
Let's go and celebrate!

768
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,410
- We want beef.
- Come on, it's your treat.

769
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:17,350
You guys ought to celebrate with a big party tonight.

770
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,480
Well, it won't be a big party.

771
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:23,720
Do you want to come?

772
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:27,160
No. The winners should celebrate it together.

773
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,860
I've gotten pretty tired from several all-nighters lately.

774
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,800
I'm going to rest up at home.

775
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,160
Okay.

776
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,700
Congratulations once again. I really mean it.

777
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:40,070
Okay. Thank you.

778
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,440
Sure.

779
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,360
Bani.

780
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,260
What? What are you guys doing here?

781
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,670
What do you think?

782
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,600
We knew you would be moping around, so we're here.

783
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,140
Get up. Let's go out.

784
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,340
No. I want to rest up at home tonight.

785
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,009
Hey, don't be silly.

786
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,410
You need to get some fresh air at times like this.

787
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,350
And a few drinks wouldn't hurt either.

788
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:27,050
Come on. Get up.

789
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,180
Let's go out. Please.

790
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,170
How's your dad holding up?

791
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,340
He's been apologizing nonstop...

792
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,410
when I should be the one apologizing in fact.

793
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,710
Come on. Why would you say that?

794
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,450
It feels like I'm only making things harder on my parents.

795
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:01,180
My father must've been desperate to do what he did.

796
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,160
This time around,

797
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,890
you were just unlucky.

798
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:14,130
You can do well next semester and get the scholarship.

799
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:21,300
But that's not a guarantee either.

800
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,240
Honestly,

801
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,910
I don't even know if I can continue to pursue art.

802
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,850
My dream to become an artist...

803
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,290
feels like a selfish dream now.

804
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:39,690
I want to comfort you.

805
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,360
But I can't because I'm in the same boat.

806
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,190
Right.

807
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,360
Is this the reality of art majors and athletes?

808
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,810
I'm already looking forward to this.

809
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,580
Guys.

810
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:05,580
I'm sorry.

811
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:07,820
I think I should be with Bani today.

812
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,489
Come on. You're our captain. You can't flake out on us.

813
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,219
Or I'll join you later.

814
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,560
Why don't you guys go without me?

815
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,460
Then join us no matter how late it is.

816
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:18,860
Okay.

817
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:20,099
Do join us later.

818
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,430
- Let's go.
- You have to come.

819
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,940
Bani.

820
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,680
Why don't we grab a delicious meal together?

821
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,950
(Bani. Why don't we grab a delicious meal together?)

822
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,849
- No?
- I told you to stop.

823
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,349
- No, I don't want to.
- Come on.

824
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,720
- Dong Ha.
- Seriously.

825
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,330
Hey, isn't that Bani?

826
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,230
What? Yes.

827
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,470
I thought she was meeting up with Yeol.

828
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:58,700
Right.

829
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,810
(Bani. Why don't we grab a delicious meal together?)

(Lee Dong Ha)

831
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:19,720
- Hey.
- Yeol.

832
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:21,760
Well,

833
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:24,030
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

834
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:27,160
You said you were spending time with Bani tonight.

835
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,230
But she's drinking here.

836
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,040
Where is she?

837
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,549
- Let's drink a little more.
- Hey.

838
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,650
Get a grip.

839
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,520
My gosh.

840
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,619
We ordered the cab to the street over there.

841
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,649
What about you, Bani?

842
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:52,490
I'm going to order one too. You guys should go.

843
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,390
Text me when you get home.

844
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,830
Okay. We'll get going now.

845
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:00,260
- We'll get going.
- Okay. Get home safely.

846
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,900
- Bye.
- No. I'm not going to...

847
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:04,130
Hey.

849
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,020
Are you all right?

850
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,360
Yes.

851
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,460
Of course. I'm all right.

852
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,700
I'm just...

853
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,700
sleepy. That's all.

854
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,020
What are you doing right now?

855
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,339
I get that you're in the same department...

856
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,740
and each other's senior and junior partner.

857
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:30,750
But enough is enough.

858
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:33,150

About yesterday...

But you must know how he feels about you.

863

That program in the US. I got in.

864
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,310
Congratulations, Bani.

865
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,150
There was a motorcycle accident here.

866
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,850
Don't worry about how things might turn out.

867
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,660
Just follow your heart for now.

868
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,390
I'll go to the US with you.
