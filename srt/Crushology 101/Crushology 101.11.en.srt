Ultimately, I couldn't convey my true feelings,

4
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,170
and we missed each other.

5
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
(I like you.)

6
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,720
We were too far away from each other...

7
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,820

19
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,200
a gap that couldn't be closed...

20
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,339
formed in our hearts.

Bani.

24
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,029
My sweetheart. Great work.

25
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,200
Good job out there.

26
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,399
You guys had it tough hanging out with my parents...

27
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,569
while I was gone.

28
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,010
No way. You had it tough coming back to Korea.

29
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,380
I didn't hit me until last night.

30
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,080
But you're really back.

31
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,609
Gosh, my sweetie.

32
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,780
You went through so much in such a faraway country.

33
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,320
I'm sure living without us in a foreign country...

34
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,219
- was a challenge.
- Goodness.

35
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,689
- Look at all your tears.
- Gosh.

36
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,759
Stop crying.

37
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,860
Some might think I'm leaving and not returning.

38
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,399
She's right, Mr. Ban. We should hold her welcome-back party.

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,099
Let's go. I'll make a huge feast.

40
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,259
- Come on.
- I'll do it.

41
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,599
- Let me.
- I'll push it.

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,000
- Goodness, it's been ages.
- Let's go.

43
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,720
Nice timing.

44
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,420
I was about to order dinner.

45
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,719
What's this?

46
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,790
Why are you still here at this hour?

47
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,920
Don't you have a date today?

48
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,930
I don't,

49
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,290
but it's not by choice.

50
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,030
How come?

51
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,100
Bo Bae is having dinner at Bani's...

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,440
You see...

53
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,740
Bani came back to Korea today.

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,780
She's returning to school this semester.

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,430
It was only for a year.

56
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,459
But seeing Bani here still feels unreal.

57
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,460
Me too.

58
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:36,060
Me being here right now feels like a dream.

59
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,729
It'll be worse at school, right?

60
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,670
That'll be dreamy in a different way.

61
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,409
You're now the so-called bloody junior.

62
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,440
Stop it.

63
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,010
Didn't Won come back last week?

64
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,449
He did.

65
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,610
He wanted to have a get-together once I was back in Korea.

66
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,020
That's a given.

67
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,520
I will soon set a date for it.

68
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,360
What about you, Bo Bae? Are things okay with your boyfriend?

69
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,390
I guess.

70
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,460
Dong Ha must be in total bliss.

71
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,930
Of course.

72
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,170
He’s been on a roll since he started dating her.

73
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,000
Not long ago, he and Yeol...

74
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,740
They...

75
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,379
created something together.

76
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,280
It's already a big hit.

77
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,450
Bani.

78
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,490
You and Yeol never talked after you left for the US, right?

79
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,660
No.

80
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,489
You two will bump into each other at school.

81
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,560
Will you be okay?

82
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,730
We're not in the same department.

83
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,259
And I won't have time for other things...

84
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,830
while adjusting to school.

85
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,640
I applied for a work-study scholarship.

86
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,210
When did you do that?

87
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,280
Oh, right. I need to enrol in an elective.

88
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,980
Do you have any recommendations?

89
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,110
How about the elective I'm taking?

90
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,920
I heard it's an easy class.

91
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,880
- What is it?
- History of popular music.

92
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,090
But I wonder if it's still open.

I got it.

97

Things are looking good already.

98
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,570
On that note, Bo and Bani. Let's toast again.

99
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,640
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

100
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,190
Good thing we made the effort to come out here, right?

101
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,060
It's not cold either.

102
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,200
Is it because I'm with you?

103
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,400
No, because I've got heater packs.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,340
I'm kidding.

105
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,070
Of course, it's not cold because you're with me.

106
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,510
Come here.

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,150

What comes to mind when you think about...

116
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,520
the excitement of a new semester?

117
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,960
As for me, the campus couple,

118
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,890
the flower of college life, pops into my head.

119
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,559
Even now, some must be spending a lovey-dovey time...

120
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,730
with their loved one somewhere on campus.

121
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,700

123
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,240
All right.

124

My girlfriend, the prettiest in the world, will drink one of the mochas.

125
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,280
Please make it special.

126
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,750
- Okay.
- Can I get my stamp here?

127
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
No way.

128
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,720
But today must not be exciting and sweet to everyone.

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,189
from "University Today," a campus magazine.

185
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,819
I’m reaching out in hopes of...

186
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,190
interviewing you for our upcoming new semester special.

187
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,560
"University Today?"

188
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,669
(Your wait listed course is open.)

(Class: History of Popular Music)

190
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,239
(You have been enrolled.)

191
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,040
(Timetable)

192
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,010
I got in.

193
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,820
Bani.

194
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,019
- Hey.
- Hi.

(History of Popular Music)

196
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,460
- Did you eat?
- No.

197
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,259
The professor gave a full lecture.

198
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,530
I had to come right away.

199
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,589
I should've packed you a sandwich.

200
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,300
No, it's okay.

201
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,670
Dong Ha is also taking this class. Are you okay with it?

202
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,740
Of course. It's not like we're strangers.

203
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,780
- Bo Bae!
- Dong Ha!

204
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,280
I see. I didn't know Bani was here.

205
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
Lee Dong Ha.

206
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,890
Hey.

207
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,889
What brings you here?

208
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,560
(Lecture Room 8)

209
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,660
I got into this class just now.

210
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,230
What?

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,100
Let's go inside.

212
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,870
Jae Yeol.

213
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,470
What is it?

214
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,740
You see...

215
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,110
I heard from somewhere that this class was a mess.

216
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,850
The professor is super strict.

217
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,720
There are no breaks either.

218
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,379
Why don't we take a different class?

219
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,190
No way. I barely got this one.

220
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,549
Please.

221
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,660
Take this class, and you'll regret it for life.

222
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,089
Believe me. I beg you.

(History of Popular Music)

224
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,600
- Why isn't he coming inside?
- I know, right?

225
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,730
I'll get us a much better class.

226
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,030
One hundred times better?

227
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,300
No, 1,000 times better. Please?

228
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,940
If that's what you wish.

229
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,440
You can go alone.

230
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,540
(Lecture Room 8)

231
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,430
The lectures will be hands-on.

232
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,329
We will be listening to music.

233
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,469
(Evaluated with Reports)

234
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,770
We will be looking back on the history of popular music.

235
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,160
Let's wrap up here and I'll see you all in the regular class.

236
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,799
Thank you.

237
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,330
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

238
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,690
It's not like I didn't expect it.

239
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,320
If he had been happy to see me, that would've been weird.

240
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,090
It's okay.

241
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,870
Do you like Solomon's seal tea by any chance?

242
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,840
Ji Won.

243
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,430
I feel so much better now.

244
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,840
I missed Korea so much because of this.

245
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,280
Who feels homesick because of cafeteria food?

246
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,850
It's not cafeteria food. It's special food.

247
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,410
Seeing you say that...

248
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,080
makes it feel like no time has passed at all.

249
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,820
I feel the same.

250
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,490
Until when are you going to stay in Korea?

251
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:23,020
I'll probably go back with Hye Won in a month.

252
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,490
That's sooner than I thought.

253
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,299
It seems Hye Won has been doing well.

254
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,700
I saw her having a party on social media.

255
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,269
She neglects her studies.

256
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,940
She's busy having fun.

257
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,910
Have you met Yeol?

258
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,920
Yes. I saw him,

259
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,890
but it seemed he'd already moved on.

260
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,389
I thought we might be able to go back to how it used to be...

261
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,900
once we saw each other again.

262
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,770
But it was my selfish desire.

263
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,140
Since I'm here, it'd be nice to see Bo Bae and Kot Nim.

264
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,440
Would they be busy?

265
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,739
I actually told them...

266
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,180
- that you were back.
- Oh, they're over there.

267
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,510
Ji Won.

268
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,520
- How have you been?
- Great.

269
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,320
Take a seat.

270
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,099
This drink I have at the start of the semester.

271
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,599
I go to college just for this.

272
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,640
By the way, why are you guys still in school?

273
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,439
Did you decide not to join the military?

274
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Gosh, I was so happy until now.

275
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,009
- Dong Ha.
- What?

276
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,340
I'll join the military next semester.

277
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,309
Don't be sad when we're gone.

278
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,949
He doesn't understand you.

279
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,850
I know. He hasn't changed.

280
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,550
Yeol, is everything okay?

281
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,019
You look more sentimental now.

282
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,060
I agree.

283
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,029
Come on. People might think you bumped into your ex...

284
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,200
on the first day of the semester.

285
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,000
They're fated if he did.

286
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,610
No way.

287
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,440
You can't fool me.

288
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,480
You didn't, right?

289
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,890
Will you really be okay?

290
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,330
- With what?
- Taking the same class with Bani.

291
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,530
Oh, no.

292
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,270
I should just cancel it.

293
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,539
Both of us will feel uncomfortable.

294
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,370
Why would you feel uncomfortable?

295
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,510
You said he pretended he didn't see you.

296
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,110
You should just ignore him and not worry about it.

297
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,280
He might've acted like that because he was flustered.

298
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,650
It might be different when you guys meet next time.

299
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,720
As if she wasn't flustered.

300
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,489
Even so.

301
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,059
"It's been a while. How have you been?"

302
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,860
He could've greeted her like that at least.

303
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,500
Dong Ha said...

304
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,000
once he turns away, he never looks back.

305
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,940
And that he's cold and heartless.

306
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,680
He could feel that way.

307
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,580
Honestly,

308
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,620
I think I was selfish.

309
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,450
It's all in the past.

310
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,230
Why would I not be okay with it now?

311
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,759
But still, taking the same class with her...

312
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,899
is a completely different matter.

313
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,229
I don't care.

314
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,770
Let's put our hands together.

315
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,510
Hey.

316
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,079
Hey. You drank so much soju.

317
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,580
Did you drink it all at once?

318
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,600
Hey, where are you going?

319
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,600
A convenience store.

320
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,100
What?

321
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,840
I had no idea!

322
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,870
I didn't mean to do that.

323
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,180
It's not difficult to ask her how she has been.

324
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,660
- Okay!
- Oh, gosh.

325
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,989
I lost again.

326
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,159
You said you're bad at sports. Why are you so good at this?

327
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,430
I was on the basketball team until high school.

328
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,539
That's why you wanted to play basketball.

329
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,839
Oh, my gosh. I was scammed.

330
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,769
You lost anyway.

331
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,609
So you buy us drinks as you promised.

332
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,579
Okay. I'll have...

333
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,679
any carbonated drink.

334
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,380
I want something cold.

335
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,649
Okay. I'm going to play this again once I'm back.

336
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,250
So wait right here. Okay?

337
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,459
Yes!

338
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,719
Let's play one more time.

339
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,060
(50 percent discount when using convenience store pay)

340
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,980
Thank you.

341
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,080
Sure.

342
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,150
I guess you came to buy beverages.

343
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,590
Yes.

344
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,430
This is really good.

345
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,230
Yes. I thought so.

346
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,600
Yes.

347
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,110
Are you going to drink them all?

348
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,810
What? No. These are for my friends.

349
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,550
I see.

350
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,780
- Would you like to have one?
- No. I drank...

351
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,420
No.

352
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,320
I drank a lot of water.

353
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,390
Okay.

354
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,930
Bye then.

355
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,730
Jae Yeol.

356
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,230
Yes?

357
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,240
That drink...

358
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,710
Oh, I'm sorry.

359
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,279
You have your hands full. Let me open it for you.

360
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,310
No.

361
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,750
Are you okay?

362
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,460
Yes. I'm fine.

363
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,970
I'll throw this away.

364
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,300
Bye then.

365
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,320
As expected.

366
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,499
I think it's a little salty. Try it.

367
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,500
What?

368
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,830
- It tastes good.
- It does?

369
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,499
Bani, eat a lot.

370
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,340
- Yes.
- Okay.

371
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,639
Did you say hi...

372
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,940
to your friends yesterday?

373
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,310
Yes.

374
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,380
Everyone must've been so happy to see you.

375
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,230
No.

Are you okay?

377
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,710
Yes. I'm fine.

378
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:08,180
I'll throw this away.

379
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,050
Bye then.

380
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,020
Not everyone was.

381
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,519
- What?
- What?

382
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,090
- Sorry?
- It's nothing.

383
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:23,230
Oh, right. Is today your first day working at the library?

384
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,600
Yes.

385
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,640
It must be hectic as soon as you're back in school.

386
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,280
I was almost late.

387
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,380
Jae Yeol. You left this yesterday.

388
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,519
- Thanks.
- What happened yesterday?

389
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,689
You said you would go... to a convenience store,

390
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,719
but you went home without telling us.

391
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,890
I know.

392
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,019
Why do you ask?

393
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,990
He mustn't have been in the mood to drink.

394
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,700
Actually, taking the same class with Bani...

395
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,500
was bothering you too, right?

396
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,030
- No, it wasn't.
- Don't deny it.

397
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,170
Never mind. You won't see her anyway.

398
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,410
What?

399
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,080
What did you say?

400
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:12,750
Bo Bae said Bani might drop the class.

401
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,979
Honestly, it must be uncomfortable for her too.

402
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,890
Even I feel uncomfortable.

403
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,359
Jae Yeol, what's done is done.

404
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,160
Just let the past go...

405
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,130
and come with us to the group blind date.

406
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,900
- Finally?
- Yes.

407
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,929
Jae Yeol, I think the time has come.

408
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,669
You can just sit still.

409
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,239
We'll take care of everything.

410
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,799
Just give up everything, will you?

411
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,739
Do you think he's crazy enough to go on a group blind date?

412
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,009
Do you think he'll date someone else in the college?

413
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,679
Who cares? We're still young.

414
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,309
- Young, my foot.
- We're young and full of passion.

415
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,249
- Jae Yeol, just once.
- Just once.

416
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,710
Please.

417
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,180
I'm not going to date someone in the college anymore.

418
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,020

420
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,029
Are you holding hands?

421
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,030

Jae Yeol, are you not going to class?

515
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,650
so why didn't they reach out to me?

516
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,960
Could it be because I look young for my age?

517

524
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,160

527
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,280
I wondered how you were doing.

528
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,219
I doubt we were close enough...

529
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,020
for us to be thinking about one another.

530
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,260

00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,550
But,

535
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,320
I no longer have feelings for Bani.

536
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,820

537
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:15,300
and now we're nothing more than good friends.

540
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,310

Right.

547
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
No way.

00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,790
What?

552
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,329
Spring sure smells nice.

553
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,689
- Why did you style your hair today?
- What?

554
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,030
- Are you dating someone?
- Because it's spring.

555
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,730
It's not a good look on you.

556
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,470
- Maybe he has a date.
- Guys, I'll get going.

557
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,440
Hey, it's Jin Hyun Oh.

558
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,010
Who?

559
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,450
He plays basketball at Gaun University.

560
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,620
He played competitively and has been popular since high school.

561
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,720
He often plays basketball on our court too.

562
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,729
Right. Jin Hyun Oh.

563
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,130
I think I heard his name recently.

564
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,129
Oh, it's him.

565
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,429
The PE major chosen by "University Today."

566
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,330
Yes, that's him.

567
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,970
Hold on.

568
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,570
Why is he with Yeol's ex-girlfriend?

569
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,810
- Why you...
- Shut it.

570
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,309
They seem friendly.

571
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:43,740
- What?
- Seriously?

572
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,380
- Come on.
- Where's your common sense?

573
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:47,550
Darn it.

574
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,290
(Something is going on between Bani and Hyun.)

575
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:54,950
Who is this?

576
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,690
A guy who lived next door.

577
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:01,960
He's not just a guy.

578
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,930
You look suspicious.

579
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,830
What? No.

580
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,400
Hey, why are you looking at it so closely?

581
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,970
Come on. It's more suspicious when you're trying to hide it.

582
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,940
Was he...

583
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,840
your first love or something like that?

584
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,350
No. It's not like that at all.

585
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,680
Her first love.

586
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,020
Her first love!

587
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,429
Is he still not over her?

588
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,490
- Shut it.
- Quiet!

589
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,370
What brings you to my school?

590
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,400
I had a basketball game with my friends.

591
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,270
I thought we could meet up since I was already here.

592
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,840
Do you come here often to play basketball?

593
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,740
Fairly often.

594
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,710
But I don't come here just to play basketball.

595
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:53,950
I come here for other reasons too.

596
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,480
I was here the year before last for the Art School Festival.

597
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,520
The year before last? I was here back then.

598
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,590
We could've bumped into each other.

599
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,230
I actually wrote something for you.

600
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,660
What was it?

601
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,570
A Confession Tree card.

602
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,780
(I want to enjoy the first snow with you.)

603
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,520
(I want to spend Christmas with you.)

604
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:36,489
(Bani, I want to spend Christmas with you.)

605
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:38,060
You're the one who wrote that?

606
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,330
Yes.

607
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,730
I never thought it could be you.

608
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,829
I remembered...

609
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,700
how our families used to celebrate Christmas together.

610
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:55,680
Well, I didn't get to spend Christmas with you that year.

611
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,580
By the way, you haven't changed a bit.

612
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,220
You haven't grown since you were a kid.

613
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,720
No way. I've grown at least a centimetre taller!

614
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,260
What are you doing this weekend?

615
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,400
Me?

616
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,200
I don't have anything planned. Why?

617
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,650
I've never been on a set like this before.

618
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,789
Seeing how you're doing a fancy interview like this,

619
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,060
you must be famous, indeed.

620
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,660
Hey, Bani.

621
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,599
What? What are you doing here?

622
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,029
One of my seniors asked me to help on the set at the last minute.

623
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:55,270
But what are you doing here?

624
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:56,539
Oh, him?

625
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,040
He used to be my next-door neighbour until middle school.

626
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,410
He said he was doing an interview, so I tagged along.

627
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,640
- Then he's your first crush?
- Hey!

628
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,580
You know what? I'll let you guys get acquainted.

629
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,520
Hello. I'm Bani's best friend. My name is Nam Kot Nim.

630
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,519
I look forward to working with you today.

631
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,859
I hope you and Bani have a good time today.

632
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:16,960
Thanks.

633
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,190
We'll start shooting now.

634
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,029
Wait. Where's the other guy?

635
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,100
I'm right here.

636
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,320
This is my better side.

637
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:51,350
What on earth has gotten into them?

638
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:02,459
(New Semester Interview)

639
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,659
All right. Jae Yeol, you're also a key member...

640
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,699
of a creative group, Handsome Dolphins.

641
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,569
We hear that you have already received...

642
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:11,739
many offers from prominent production companies.

643
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,910
How does it feel?

644
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,280
Our creative works were well-received by many people.

645
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,839
I'm grateful for that.

646
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,179
As you are already building a solid career,

647
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,249
we're curious to find out about your goal after graduation.

648
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,650
I will focus on growing my team for the time being.

649
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,389
I'd like to create something original...

650
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,890
instead of joining someone else's project.

651
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,889
My goal is to grow Handsome Dolphins...

652
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:33,159
into an independent production group,

653
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,230
not a mere creative group.

654
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,560
I see. This is the last question.

655
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,000
Are you guys...

656
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,920
Are you guys currently in a relationship?

657
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:59,220
Jae Yeol, could you answer that first?

658
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,470
No.

659
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:23,479
I'm sure you're quite popular on campus.

660
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,280
Why are you not dating anyone?

661
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,780
I just...

662
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,720
want to focus on my creative work now.

663
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,930
Then what about you, Hyun Oh?

664
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,200
I have never been in a relationship.

665
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:46,830
That's unexpected.

666
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:51,840
Nothing ever captured my heart the way sports did.

667
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,010
Nothing except for one person.

668
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:02,450
My first love.

669
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,860
- Your first love?
- Yes.

670
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,550
Great job today.

671
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:38,179
You can expect to be paid sometime this week.

672
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,350
- I see.
- Oh, right. Here you go.

673
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,489
It's a ticket to ride the hot air balloon...

674
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:43,559
over the Han River.

675
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,960
If there's someone special, you can take her there.

676
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,130
Thank you.

677
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,039
This is a ticket to ride the hot air balloon.

678
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,570
Do you want to ride it with me tomorrow?

679
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:14,720
Why not?

680
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,120
Nothing except for one person.

681
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,490
My first love.

682
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,999
This is a ticket to ride the hot air balloon.

683
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,430
Do you want to ride it with me tomorrow?

684
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,940
Why not?

685
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,389
Could you drop me off here?

686
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,160
Sure.

687
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,800
Thank you.

688
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,900
(Complimentary Voucher for 2, Hot Air Balloon at Han River)

689
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,270
It's always been you for Bani.

690
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:16,210
When she was in Korea and in the US.

691
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,289
Dong Ha, can you come with me...

692
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,390
I'm sorry. I'm going hiking tomorrow with Bo Bae.

693
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:35,830
Hey, the movie is starting. I'll talk to you later.

694
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:58,620
(Cha Ji Won)

695
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:06,630
Hello?

696
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:09,700
Do you like...

697
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,230
hot air balloons?

698
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,870
I didn't know this place was still operational.

699
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,440
It's been ages since we came here.

700
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,440
You used to come here all the time.

701
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,210
Stopping by this place was your after-school routine.

702
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,380
This was practically my staple.

703
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,680
- Here you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

704
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,050
Let's dig in.

705
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,100
You still eat it the same way as before.

706
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:52,440
This is the best way to enjoy the food here.

707
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:54,369
Try it now.

708
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:55,810
It tastes exactly the same.

709
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,350
- It tastes the same, right?
- Yes, totally.

710
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:10,660
Right. Was the guy from yesterday your ex?

711
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,390
How did you know?

712
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:14,929
Are you guys currently in a relationship?

713
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,860
Jae Yeol, could you answer that first?

714
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,540
No.

715
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,640
Are you still hung up on him?

716
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,220
Did your taste in guys change?

717
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,420
What?

718
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,190
He's the polar opposite of me.

719
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:49,860
Your ideal type used to be me.

720
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:55,199
How did you know that?

721
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,370
It was obvious that you had feelings for me back then.

722
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:05,980
Gosh, I was only a kid back then.

723
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:08,380
Slow down.

724
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:16,360
Hey.

725
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,630
Why must I do this with you on a weekend?

726
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:22,290
I thought I told you. We're riding the hot air balloon.

727
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,830
I didn't know you were serious.

728
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:28,900
Who knew you meant it when you said we'd be riding that together?

729
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,440
That's enough.

730
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,570
Since you decided to come, stop complaining and take this.

731
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,080
It's tasty, at least.

732
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,030
I knew it.

733
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:02,730
You had an ulterior motive for coming here.

734
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:15,280
Is he Bani's first love?

735
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:28,290
Jae Yeol.

736
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,600
What are you still doing here?

737
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:35,600
You're not going to do anything?

738
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,460
Thank you.

739
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,790
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

740
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:37,930
Jae Yeol.

741
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,030
Don't get on it.

742
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,210
What's your problem?

743
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,600
Don't get on it.

745
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,209
We didn't even have a chance to talk after you came back.

746
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:37,019
We broke up a long time ago.

747
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,950
But why does it feel like it just ended?

748
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,649
Bani. You're never supposed...

749
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:42,949
to go back to your ex.

750
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,690
I waited a long time for you. What's on your mind?

751
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,159
Bani. What I wanted...

752
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,760
to tell you was...

753
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:50,960
I'm sure he's out there.

754
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,100
Someone who will see you for who you are.

755
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:54,630
Then are you not interested in me?

756
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,600
What do you think about me?

757
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,670
Remember my first love I mentioned?

758
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:00,110
It was you.
