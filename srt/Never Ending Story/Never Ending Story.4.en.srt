1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:04,963
Come on in.

2
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:12,303
Wow, your place is cleaner than I expected.

3
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,057
Cleaner than you thought?

4
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,144
Well, yeah, I live alone.

5
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:22,397
If you don’t keep up with it, it turns into a mess fast.

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,234
I’m jealous. My place is always a disaster.

7
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,155
Go ahead, sit down.

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,990
I’ll whip up some snacks real quick.

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,365
Sure.

10
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,340
Is this like a member logbook?

11
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,812
What the heck is this?

12
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,356
Name: Kim Do-yoon. Occupation: Novelist.

13
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:10,904
Personality: Rarely shows emotion, doesn’t talk much, but sharp observer.

14
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,741
His eyes keep lingering in my head.

15
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,789
This feels like more than just being a fan.

16
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,250
- Do-yoon.

17
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,294
- Want to start with a beer?

18
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,254
Yeah, sure.

19
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,649
What were you doing?

20
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,111
Just reading a book.

21
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,447
What book?

22
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,827
A book about fitness.

23
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:05,792
Then should we make this official as our first running partner session?

24
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,015
Have you been writing well these days?

25
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,897
No, not really.

26
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,777
Why? Is something wrong?

27
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:56,217
Honestly, I just can’t come up with any ideas.

28
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,555
That’s partly why I started working out.

29
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,186
I thought maybe getting in shape would help spark something.

30
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,692
That’s actually a great idea.

31
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,781
Taking the first step takes a lot of courage, and it’s not easy.

32
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,368
But you’ve already made that leap, Do-yoon.

33
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,331
I’m sure new ideas will start flowing.

34
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,251
You think so?

35
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:34,672
Do-yoon?

36
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,928
Would it be okay if I shared a plot idea with you?

37
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,932
You have a story synopsis, Hyun-woo?

38
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:45,808
Yes.

39
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,894
If you’re okay with it.

40
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,396
As your fan, Do-yoon,

41
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,317
and as someone who loves novels,

42
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,903
I’ve had a few ideas.

43
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,573
Hmm...

44
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:08,164
The main character slowly changes after meeting someone.

45
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,877
At first, they found the person annoying,

46
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:20,134
but strangely, being near them made it easier to breathe.

47
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:28,101
So little by little, they open their heart.

48
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,397
But then...

49
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,233
The other person might not even realize it.

50
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,114
Is this really a story for a novel?

51
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,368
Yes, it is.

52
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,251
Please, tell me more.

53
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,969
Thanks to you, I had a really great time today.

54
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,639
Do-yoon.

55
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,202
It’s a leaf.

56
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,332
Oh, I’m sorry.

57
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,587
Do-yoon, why did you close your eyes?

58
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,174
Uh, well...

59
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,346
Did you think I was going to kiss you or something?

60
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,472
Huh?

61
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,016
Just kidding.

62
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,107
But you know what?

63
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,277
I can hear your heartbeat, Do-yoon.

64
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,656
I’m not the only one hearing it, right?

65
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,245
It’s so quiet here...

66
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,501
Your heartbeat changes depending on the situation.

67
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,629
But your heartbeat, Do-yoon,

68
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,673
thump thump thump...

69
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,179
It sounds like the rhythm of excitement.

70
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,851
So I want to respond too.

71
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,355
I'm feeling excited too.

72
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,459
On a street where cherry blossoms are falling,

73
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,295
they share a romantic kiss.

74
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,011
The two are different but strangely similar.

75
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,265
They both have walls in their hearts.

76
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,146
So breaking down those walls is simpler than you think.

77
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,901
How?

78
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,365
Just by being there with them.

79
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,203
Casually, slowly.

80
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,793
And then, before you know it...

81
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:47,300
they become someone who can't live without you.

82
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:57,059
In the end, does that person fall in love?

83
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,065
Yes, probably from the very beginning.

84
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,658
It's a story, of course.

85
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,544
I think I talked too much in front of the writer.

86
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,839
What I just told you—

87
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,759
please take it as reference only.

88
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,553
It’s a bit scattered with no clear beginning or end.

89
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,431
No, it was great.

90
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,937
It was a story good enough to make even a stopped heart beat again.

91
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,607
Really?

92
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,986
It sounded even better coming from you, the writer.

93
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,824
Next time, tell me your story, not just mine.

94
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,494
Alright.

95
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,497
But you can’t fall asleep if it’s boring.

96
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,040
No way.

97
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,418
I’ll be taking notes while I listen!

98
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,754
You’re funny too.

99
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,798
Oh, I’m serious though.

100
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,717
Let me grab a pen and some paper real quick.

101
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,261
I'll start writing now.

102
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,346
It’s okay.

103
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:16,722
Let’s toast first.
