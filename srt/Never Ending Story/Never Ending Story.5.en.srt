00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:47,422
Thanks for yesterday. You really helped me out.
Here, have this. See you at the gym!

2
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:56,139
Wow, he's so sweet.

3
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,442
Huh?

4
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,401
Do-yoon!

5
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,444
You're here?

6
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:10,612
Yeah.

7
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,158
You’re a bit late today.

8
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,368
I was working on a script before coming.

9
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,204
Ooh~

10
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,040
Then after today's workout,

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,584
you’ll probably be bursting with ideas, right?

12
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,253
We'll see.

13
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,591
Let’s warm up first.

14
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,593
Today...

15
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,346
Let’s start with some back exercises.

16
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,389
Okay.

17
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,143
You look a bit nervous, Writer.

18
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,146
It's your first time training back muscles, right?

19
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,068
Then I’ll make sure to teach you properly today.

20
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,611
Shall we?

21
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,578
Alright, let’s start with back training today.

22
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,082
It’s tricky because you can’t really see those muscles.

23
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,127
I’ll show you first.

24
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,683
Don’t just pull with your arms.

25
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,852
Drop your shoulders...

26
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,855
and use the muscles in your lats.

27
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,610
Like this.

28
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,155
Imagine you’re folding wings behind you.

29
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,575
Alright.

30
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,118
Your turn, Do-yoon.

31
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,578
Take a seat.

32
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,927
You’re using just your arms right now...

33
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,596
Hold on a sec.

34
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,140
Let me show you again.

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,685
Mind if I touch your back?

36
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,396
Oh, my back?

37
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,857
So you can feel the movement...

38
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,193
It’ll help you understand the exercise better.

39
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,443
How’s that?

40
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,780
Whoa, that’s wild.

41
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,115
I can actually feel it.

42
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,995
Now it’s your turn, Do-yoon. I’ll help you.

43
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,257
Relax your arms here...

44
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:22,887
One more time.

45
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,699
Do-yoon, you’ve really improved!

46
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,659
Really? You think so?

47
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,663
Wanna wrap up with some cycling?

48
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,790
Sure.

49
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,709
Let’s go.

50
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,513
You trust me, right?

51
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,390
I’ll set the pace for us.

52
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,976
Okay, I trust you.

53
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,856
Then let’s go for it!

54
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,337
Let’s take a short break, Do-yoon.

55
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,385
You're not stopping because of me, right?

56
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,222
Wouldn’t want you to collapse.

57
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,766
You’ve got writing to do, remember?

58
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,815
Oh, listen to this.

59
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,028
What is it?

60
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,167
It’s the song I always listen to when I run.

61
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,334
He matched my pace.

62
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,005
And let me rest when I got out of breath.

63
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:54,010
When I said I was okay, he pushed me a bit more.

64
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:04,604
It felt like... he’d known me for a really long time.

65
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:42,016
Sir, I think I can send the script by the end of the week.

66
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:51,734
I found someone who actually inspires my ideas.
