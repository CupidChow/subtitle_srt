1
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,053
- Hyunwoo?

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,348
- I’ve been hearing weird rumors lately. You know anything?

3
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,439
Weird rumors?

4
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,025
Like what?

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:31,114
They’re saying you’ve been getting too close to a certain member.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,952
Some people are even saying you two might be dating.

7
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,080
If the CEO hears about this...

8
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,374
...it could ruin the gym’s image.

9
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,043
That’d be a disaster.

10
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,087
You’re not actually together, right?

11
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,010
We’re not dating.

12
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,470
Who would even date who?

13
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,681
I’m just being nice ‘cause he’s a member.

14
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,529
- We’re not dating.

15
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,114
- Seriously, who would date who?

16
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,950
- I’m just being polite because he’s a member.

17
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,044
Hyunwoo, you really need to be more careful.

18
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,587
Lately, among the members...

19
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,297
...there’s talk about a trainer and a guy being too close.

20
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,800
It’s not the first time I’ve heard it, either.

21
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,595
I was just being friendly, that’s all.

22
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,348
That’s exactly the problem.

23
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,851
This place is for personal training...

24
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,019
...not for dating.

25
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:25,603
And—

26
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,690
A guy liking another guy?

27
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,026
How do you think people are gonna take that?

28
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,448
All sorts of rumors could start spreading...

29
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,284
...and that could ruin the gym’s image.

30
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,035
What are you gonna do then?

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,459
Liking someone… is that really such a problem?

32
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,005
To be honest...

33
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,008
I really like you.

34
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:55,967
No, actually—

35
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,303
I like *him*.

36
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:05,059
But does it really matter if it’s a guy or a girl?

37
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:10,064
What matters to me... is the person.

38
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,610
Everything else doesn’t mean a thing.

39
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,993
That’s a nice sentiment, Hyunwoo... but the world’s not that simple.

40
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:27,999
Precisely because the world’s complicated... there are things worth protecting.

41
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:34,631
Whether it’s the person or the feeling... I’m never giving up.

42
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,174
- Dohyun!

43
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,012
What are you doing here?

44
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,931
We’ve been looking everywhere for you.

45
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,141
Looking for me?

46
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,561
Why?

47
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,736
Oh, this?

48
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,365
I don’t need it anymore.

49
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,952
Or anything else, really.

50
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,247
Are you...

51
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,874
Did you hear what they said back at the gym?

52
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,921
Yeah... I heard it.

53
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:04,012
Honestly, I thought Hyunwoo and I had gotten really close.

54
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,723
More than just friends.

55
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,685
But Hyunwoo...

56
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:16,733
I guess... I was never more than just another member to him.

57
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,778
Realizing it was all just in my head...

58
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,364
...made me feel so small.

59
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,783
I’m sorry.

60
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,577
I didn’t mean to pressure you.

61
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,287
No, that’s not it.

62
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,290
I don’t just see you as a member, Dohyun.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,668
At first, it was as a fan...

64
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,087
...and then as a member.

65
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,090
But the more time we spent together...

66
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,092
The more time we spent together...

67
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,804
I realized I laughed the most when I was with you.

68
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,766
And I felt the happiest.

69
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,227
And here...

70
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,190
...you’ve taken up a place in my heart.

71
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:07,408
The storybook characters... don’t they sound a lot like us?

72
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,371
I want to be your main character too, Dohyun.

73
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,083
Just like the ones in the story...

74
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:20,088
I want us to love each other — sweetly, happily.

75
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,215
Hyunwoo...

76
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,677
That’s why... I can’t let you go, Dohyun.

77
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,304
Not even for a second.

78
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,682
Hyunwoo...

79
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,852
Do you really mean that?

80
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,855
That we’ll be together?

81
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,942
It’s not an easy thing to do in Korea.

82
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,654
Are you really okay with that?

83
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,615
What do other people’s opinions matter?

84
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,036
What matters is that we’re together right now.

85
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,540
I’m only looking at you, Dohyun.

86
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,252
So, Dohyun... you look only at me too.

87
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,046
Hyunwoo...

88
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:41,043
Then... shall we keep writing our story together?

89
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,382
I’d love that.

90
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,037
- Did you see the article about Dohyun the writer?

91
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:21,250
- It’s blowing up! Total box office hit!

92
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,252
- The book's selling out everywhere.

93
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:28,049
- Even the TV networks are dying to interview Writer Dohyun!

94
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,553
- So, I was thinking… What about tomorrow—no, later today?

95
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,972
- Let’s do the interview right away!

96
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,017
But the thing is...

97
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,602
I’ve got something important today.

98
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,773
- Important? What could be more important than an interview?

99
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:50,071
I’ve got a date... with the person I love the most.

100
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,824
- Can’t the date wait until later...?

101
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:58,120
Sorry, sir. I’ll get back to you another time.

102
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,086
Are you really okay not going? We can always reschedule the date.

103
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,173
The interview matters too, but what matters most right now...

104
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,008
...is you, Hyunwoo.

105
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,011
And today’s date spot — it’s somewhere I’ve really wanted to go.

106
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,972
Alright.

107
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,267
Today, allow me to escort you.

108
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,101
Shall we?

109
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:21,894
Huh?

110
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,022
I can’t move my body...

111
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,192
What? Why? Are you okay?

112
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,487
I think... I just stalled.

113
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,325
What the— You really scared me!

114
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,495
So you're not gonna do it?

115
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,502
You’re seriously unbelievable.

116
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,840
let’s go
