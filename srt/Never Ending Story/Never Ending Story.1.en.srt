1
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,230
Is it okay

2
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,150
for us to be like this?

3
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,910
What's wrong with us right now?

4
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,870
Just...

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,040
I'm a little scared

6
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,330
Just...

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,670
Just trust me and follow me

8
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:30,970
Hello

9
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,970
- What? Did you just wake up?

10
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,010
- Hey, what time is it right now?

11
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,720
I fell asleep after working late yesterday

12
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,690
- You're making excuses to write again

13
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,860
- You didn't fall asleep while drinking, did you?

14
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,110
No, I didn't

15
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,030
But why? What's going on?

16
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,320
- No

17
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,200
- This is the second episode of NeverEnding Story

18
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,870
The CEO even contacted me to ask when it will be serialized

19
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,200
What should I do if I can't write?

20
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,750
Please ask them to wait a little longer

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,260
- They said we really can't fall behind on the serialization now

22
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,850
- Please make sure to send it by this week

23
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,020
- They say this will be the last time they grant an extension

24
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,270
Got it

25
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
But what am I supposed to do if I can't write?

26
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,650
- Hey

27
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,740
- Stop drinking and eating ramen all the time

28
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,320
- Go out and try to exercise a bit

29
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,870
You know exercise isn't my thing

30
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,500
- Where is the talent for exercise?

31
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,290
- To be healthy, you just have to do it

32
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:49,840
- And

33
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,710
- Dating a bit - Does it make sense that a guy who claims to write romance

34
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,130
novels has been single for years?

35
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,300
- Don't do that, let's go on a blind date this time

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,800
Ah~

37
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,720
Got it, I'll send it

38
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,810
by this week. Bye

39
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,230
Ah~ I'm going crazy, really

40
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,360
How am I supposed to write this by the end of this week?

41
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,370
I haven't even started yet

42
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,450
What should I do if I can't come up with any ideas?

43
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,710
We have newly opened

44
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,800
We have newly opened

45
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,110
That's too much

46
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,690
It's not easy to make this

47
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,370
Oh, my head!

48
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,000
I think I drank too much yesterday

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,210
I'm really dying here

50
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,840
Hello, this is a new gym

51
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,590
that just opened up in front of here

52
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,880
It's okay

53
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,100
I made it with great care

54
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,390
You don't have to come, but please don't throw it away

55
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,810
Yes

56
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,790
Why can't I think of anything other than this cliché?

57
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,550
Gym

58
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,020
Should I really exercise?

59
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,340
Hello

60
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,300
Oh yes

61
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,220
Is this your first time here?

62
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,100
I'm trying to exercise a bit

63
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,850
Feel free to try

64
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,600
exercising comfortably and then decide on registration

65
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,270
Yes, thank you

66
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,790
Isn't this something we can still manage?

67
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,850
What? It's

68
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,350
easy

69
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,420
Yeah, this much is necessary to be able to say I worked out somewhere

70
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,820
Just a moment

71
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,160
That was close

72
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,450
Are you okay?

73
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,290
Ah, yes

74
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,090
Oh, it's okay. I'm sorry

75
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,920
No, there's nothing to be sorry about

76
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,800
It seems like you increased the weight too quickly

77
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,220
It's common for first-timers to do that

78
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,890
I thought it felt light, so I was just going to stretch it a little

79
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,980
You must be a writer because you have a rich imagination

80
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,900
What about me being a writer?

81
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,580
Oh, a few days ago, I

82
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,700
saw you holding the manuscript of Neverending Story while handing out flyers

83
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,660
Are you the writer Doyun?

84
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,460
How do you remember that?

85
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,510
I really like novels

86
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I got completely hooked after watching episode 1

87
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,010
But why hasn't the next episode been uploaded?

88
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,060
I check it every day

89
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,480
Were you a fan?

90
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,440
Yes, absolutely

91
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,230
I've never been in love,

92
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,980
but I suddenly feel like I want to date for no reason

93
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,440
The writing and the atmosphere are really nice

94
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,900
The emotional line is truly delicate and just...

95
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,700
I was so excited, I'm sorry

96
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,370
No

97
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,670
Thank you

98
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,630
Such words

99
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,960
I haven't been able to listen lately

100
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,850
Shall I teach you some exercises?

101
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,560
We can't let our writer get hurt

102
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,150
Yes, thank you
