1
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,470
Hyunwoo

2
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,650
Did you come, Doyun?

3
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,030
Yes

4
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,780
Ah, this is my friend who runs with me

5
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,330
Hello, I'm Jin Seung-wook, Hyun-woo's friend

6
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,080
I'm Hyun-woo's closest friend

7
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,040
Ah, yes, hello

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,840
Oh, right, Hyunwoo

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,130
I heard you opened a gym recently,

10
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,470
and there are a lot of Hyunwoos there, right?

11
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,220
Yes, I'm really glad about that

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,350
Hey, so if I go, will you also give me personal training?

13
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,810
Hey, come by anytime

14
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,850
If it's you, I'll give you free personal training

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,600
Oh, really? As expected,

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,190
Kim Hyun-woo is the best

17
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,610
I'll be right back; I'm just going to the bathroom

18
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,780
Ah, please feel free to go

19
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,000
What am I hoping for?

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,340
I just came here to exercise

21
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,820
Shall we start heading out for a run now?

22
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,240
What about that friend of yours?

23
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,120
Oh, Seung-wook?

24
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,910
I left early because I had something urgent to do

25
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,380
It was tough because my friend talked a lot every time we ran,

26
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,290
but it's a relief

27
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,960
Actually, it's nice to run just the two of us, isn't it, Doyun?

28
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,970
Really?

29
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,600
Then shall we go run around excitedly now?

30
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,100
How was your day?

31
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,360
It felt really good to run after a long time

32
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,530
I was always stuck in my room and felt like I was lacking oxygen,

33
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,200
but now I feel completely refreshed

34
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,740
That's a relief

35
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,250
By any chance

36
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,080
Then would you like to have a beer today?

37
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,380
Is it beer?

38
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,010
Oh, can you not drink?

39
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,630
No, that's not the case

40
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,640
It's that I'm on a break this week

41
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,640
Oh, then

42
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,690
Oh, but

43
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,610
I think it would be nice to eat with Hyunwoo

44
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,860
- Really?

45
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,950
Then would you like to drink at my house?

46
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,830
At Hyunwoo's house?

47
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,620
Restaurants these days are just expensive and not tasty at all

48
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,330
- I'll prepare some delicious snacks for you at home

49
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,920
Ah

50
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,050
Are you feeling very uncomfortable?

51
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,470
Then, a pub around here...

52
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,850
No, it's good

53
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,740
Oh, but wasn't that person earlier the writer Doyun?

54
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,990
Yes, that's right

55
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,330
Are you close with that person?

56
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,290
Did you recently register at our gym?

57
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,120
Ah

58
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,590
No, he was originally a very famous bestselling author

59
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,300
But these days, looking at the content, it's really not that interesting

60
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,010
Well, writing isn't an easy task

61
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,390
No, I've been seeing a lot of negative comments lately;

62
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,770
it's totally outdated

63
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,060
Seung-wook, that's a bit harsh

64
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,610
No, what's the big deal?

65
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,950
This is what you say when there's nothing there

66
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,530
What?

67
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,160
Hey

68
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,450
Even if this place doesn't exist right now, that's not something you should say

69
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,120
Hey, you're joking, so why are you acting like this?

70
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,250
You said you're not even close with that person anyway

71
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
There's a limit to how far you can joke around

72
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,680
And that someone is...

73
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,600
That prank leaves an indelible scar

74
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:35,190
I'm sorry, but I hope you just leave today
