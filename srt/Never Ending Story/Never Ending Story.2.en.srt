1
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,730
Mina and Jeongmin are

2
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,940
Sitting on the bench

3
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,610
A verbal fight

4
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,450
Ha... what is this?

5
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,160
It's so obvious,

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,490
this feeling again

7
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,880
I was almost annoyed by your eye smile

8
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,720
Why do I keep thinking about those eyes?

9
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
- Mina was caught off guard by a strange smile she had never seen before -

10
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,900
This isn't cliché, is it?

11
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,260
Is there none today?

12
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,850
It might not be there originally

13
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,230
I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up again

14
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,030
- Did you come?

15
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,160
I need to do leg workouts today

16
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,920
- Over there

17
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,510
How much time do you have left?

18
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,930
Go ahead,

19
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,350
I've finished everything

20
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,940
Thank you

21
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,950
- Over there

22
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,460
Did you work out hard today?

23
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,010
Trainer

24
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,050
I can see you're doing well on your own since you're sweating

25
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,430
Did you come?

26
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,430
I came right after finishing

27
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,440
my morning class

28
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,440
That can't be true

29
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,690
I was waiting for you

30
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,570
You were waiting?

31
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,040
Oh, then I can't disappoint the author with this, can I?

32
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,580
Are you available tomorrow, by any chance?

33
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,340
Tomorrow?

34
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,380
Would you like to go running together tomorrow?

35
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Running is really good for your body too

36
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,890
The writing will probably turn out well

37
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,480
Yes, that's good

38
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,980
Could you show me your phone?

39
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,980
Is it a mobile phone?

40
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,370
This is my number, and I'll send you the location later

41
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,790
And my name is Hyunwoo

42
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,040
Ah, yes

43
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,460
Hyunwoo

44
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,420
See you tomorrow, Writer Doyun

45
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,850
Hyunwoo: See you at Hangang Park tomorrow!

46
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,440
Hyunwoo: Oh, and you can come in comfortable clothes!

47
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,810
Hello

48
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,100
- Doyun

49
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
- Are you all set?

50
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,320
Ah, yes

51
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,190
I'll go out in a bit

52
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,950
- Just come carefully to the address I sent you!

53
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,450
Yes

54
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,240
See you later

55
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,420
Hyunwoo!
