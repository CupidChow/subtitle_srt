1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,340
I was notified

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,220
by the task force today

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,660
that I have to go in
for questioning tomorrow.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,620
Who is the real mastermind behind
Dongping's organized crimes,

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,380
and who is

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:24,980
protecting them.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,260
Your wife helped them purchase the mine,

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,980
and you prosecuted the case.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,780
You and your wife were just their tools.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,660
You're their protectors.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,900
You can speculate all you want,

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,780
but I implore you to verify your claims

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,140
before making accusations.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,140
If you have no proof,

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,820
don't ask me to prove my innocence.

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,260
When I show you the proof,

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,380
will I have to
show you an arrest warrant?

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,340
What are you hiding?

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,060
What are you afraid of?

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,840
[In the Name of Justice]

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,840
[Episode 30]

22
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,820
Son,

23
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,740
I have a question for you:

24
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,700
if

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,460
some close friends of yours

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,020
sneaked into the teacher's office

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,140
and saw the exam paper,

28
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,940
and though you didn't take part,

29
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,300
they

30
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,700
still

31
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,260
tipped you off

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,780
on some key questions

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,180
which helped you ace the test,

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,900
would you tell the teacher

35
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,220
after finding out what they've done?

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,020
Of course.

37
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,220
I have to report it to the teacher.

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,580
But you got a high score
because of that.

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,060
But I didn't look at
the exam paper myself,

40
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,540
nor did I do anything wrong,

41
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,500
so I'd definitely
report it to the teacher.

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,740
Aren't you worried your friends

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,700
will feel betrayed by you?

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,100
I'd be doing it for their own good.

45
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,460
Isn't that what you

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,900
and Mom always teach me?

47
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,300
But everyone knows you're good friends,

48
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,900
including the teacher.

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,100
Aren't you worried

50
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,540
the teacher might think
you were in on it together?

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,580
But if I don't report it,

52
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,780
and the teacher finds out later,

53
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,500
wouldn't that be harder to clear up?

54
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,140
I'm sure you're already aware that the

55
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,100
Provincial Political and Legal Affairs
Commission sent a special task force.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,300
But do you know why?

57
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,380
It's right here in this meeting room

58
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,700
where we've had countless meetings

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,220
about the Wan Hai case

60
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,300
over the past three years.

61
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,700
The verdict just came out,

62
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,020
and the provincial office has already
raised questions.

63
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,140
First, they cleared
the Zhang Wenjing Case,

64
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,980
then they found new problems
in the Wan Hai Case.

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,700
At every meeting,

66
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,660
you said everything was fine.

67
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,500
So why are we

68
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,260
facing such serious problems now?

69
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,260
Are there more problems coming?

70
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,540
What else can go wrong?

71
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,900
Can anyone here tell me?

72
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,980
Upon notice
from the Provincial Committee,

73
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,660
I've already briefed Mr. Jianing.

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,860
Some of you may face investigation

75
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,540
and interviews by the task force.

76
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,340
I hope everyone

77
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,900
can stay alert

78
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,260
and open-minded,

79
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,420
while ensuring proper coordination

80
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,660
within their own departments.

81
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,340
How long have Sun Fei and
Jiang Hongjun been in custody?

82
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,460
Ms. Lan, it's been three days.

83
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,660
The director of the Political Department

84
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,820
of Dongping Judicial Bureau

85
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,820
will temporarily oversee the sub-bureau.

86
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,340
Three days?

87
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,700
Then they must have concrete evidence.

88
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,060
As the lead official
in charge of the investigation,

89
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,500
you need to personally

90
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,020
review the case files carefully

91
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,900
identify all potential issues,

92
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,180
and hand them to me.

93
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,180
Yes, ma'am.

94
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,420
And I want it fast.

95
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,700
Yes, I understand.

96
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,460
Same for you two's departments.

97
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,060
The directors must go through
the case files personally

98
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,180
and report the potential issues
back to me.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,780
We will investigate internally

100
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,980
and aim to uncover any faults ourselves.

101
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,580
Taking initiative
is the best way to cooperate.

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,620
We'll keep each other updated

103
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,500
around the clock these days.

104
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,380
My phone will be on 24/7.

105
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,020
Lastly, I want to say,

106
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,780
I sincerely hope that no one
is found at fault,

107
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,540
and that all of you

108
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,500
will stay out of trouble.

109
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,420
Everyone,

110
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,420
there are a lot of case files to review,

111
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,700
and we're short on time,

112
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,540
so get started.

113
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,700
Based on the evidence we currently have,

114
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,940
the two key charges against Wan Hai-

115
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,940
forced deal and assault-

116
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,740
have both been overturned.

117
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,580
The Wan Hai case is largely

118
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,420
confirmed as a miscarriage of justice.

119
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,380
The Wanchuan Mining Accident

120
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,060
is a subsequent incident
of the Wan Hai case

121
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,860
and is still under investigation.

122
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,700
Check this out.

123
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,420
Have some water.

124
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:11,940
Thank you.

125
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:12,780
Have some wate.

126
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,060
We need to interview

127
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,140
and question

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,540
relevant officials

129
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,700
from various departments

130
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,900
involved in the Wan Hai Case.

131
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,060
Xu Yanwu from the police department.

132
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,660
Wen Qin from the Court.

133
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,980
Li Renjun from the Procuratorate.

134
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,860
Any duty-related crimes

135
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,300
will be thoroughly investigated.

136
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,820
Why are you still up?

137
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,820
I was notified

138
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,940
by the task force today

139
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,380
that I have to go in
for questioning tomorrow.

140
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,860
Task Force?

141
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,700
The Task Force
for Wanchuan Mining Accident,

142
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,100
supervised by the
Provincial Anti-Crime Office,

143
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,060
coordinated by

144
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,620
the Provincial Procuratorate,

145
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,340
with support from the
Provincial High People's Court

146
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,300
and Provincial Public Security Bureau.

147
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,060
Why do they want to see you?

148
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,980
To talk about the Wan Hai Case,

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,660
the mining accident,

150
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,820
Qiao Zhenxing's death,

151
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,020
and who is the real mastermind
behind Dongping's organized crimes,

152
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,700
and who is

153
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,340
protecting them.

154
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,340
Honey,

155
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,220
tell me honestly,

156
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,060
are your recent dealings

157
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,380
with Chen Shenglong

158
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,700
and the Tianlong Company

159
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,740
all legitimate business?

160
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,820
We've already filed for eminent domain

161
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,740
over Hongjia Village

162
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,940
because we plan to build

163
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,660
a battery plant there,

164
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,620
so that's the only area I need.

165
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,580
I won't do

166
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,260
partnerships.

167
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,220
It's either buy it all or nothing.

168
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,140
Full ownership is the only way

169
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,940
I can be fully devoted.

170
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,260
Why do you think

171
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,740
I sold you the house in Dadu Xishan
at half price?

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,380
How do you think
you got the house worth millions?

173
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,420
You want to back out?

174
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,260
Let me tell you-no way!

175
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,820
The Wans' mine

176
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,700
is a generous gift from me.

177
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,140
Now that you're in a
political-business partnership,

178
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,820
accepting this house
can give others leverage over you,

179
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,820
it could even lead to
duty-related crimes.

180
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,220
Answer me,

181
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,060
are your business dealings legitimate?

182
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,980
He's responsible
for the mining accident.

183
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,540
I've basically become his protector.

184
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,540
Long wanted to

185
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,100
break into the new energy sector.

186
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,380
Yun's connection

187
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,460
really helped Zijian a lot.

188
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,020
Yun got him Wanchuan Mining,

189
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,420
which ensured Long's first step
in the new energy sector.

190
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,580
Mr. Chen

191
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,340
is practically family to me,

192
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,860
and Zijian is like a brother to me.

193
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,900
Besides, we didn't buy the house,

194
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,860
Long gave it to us
as an employee benefit.

195
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,780
It's a clearance sale.

196
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,300
Anyone would've paid the same prize.

197
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,740
Which company is involved now?

198
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,100
Tianlong Company.

199
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,620
Do you have any dealings
with the Tianlong Company?

200
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,220
Tianlong Company? Yeah!

201
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,140
Isn't Chen Zijian, the general counsel,

202
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,700
your brother-in-law?

203
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,140
There is no material evidence

204
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,660
to corroborate these crucial parts,
only witness testimony!

205
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,500
The chain of custody

206
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,300
in the Wan Hai case is intact,

207
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,340
and the prosecution remains sound.

208
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,780
When I checked Tianlong's tax records,

209
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,300
I heard Mr. Qiao had also been there.

210
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,900
I will report that you replaced
the prosecutor on your own,

211
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,740
and I'll sue you for malfeasance!

212
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,700
My wife Liu Yi is the deputy director
of the Development Zone.

213
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,020
She helped Chen Shenglong
acquire Wanchuan Mining,

214
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,140
[Presiding Judge]
and I was in charge

215
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,340
of the Wan Hai Case,

216
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,420
you don't think that makes me
seem like their protector?

217
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,260
Come...

218
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,820
come with me tomorrow.

219
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,060
I can't.

220
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,380
I can't go.

221
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,220
I... I won't be able to explain it.

222
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,500
Renjun,

223
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,260
please don't say anything.

224
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,660
I'm trying very hard
to cut ties with them

225
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,180
and make things right.

226
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,260
Please believe me.
I just need a little more time.

227
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,020
Renjun,

228
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,300
if they start investigating me,

229
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,700
I'm finished.

230
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,020
What will happen to this family?

231
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,420
What about our son?

232
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,340
Qiqi's still young.

233
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,940
He needs a family.

234
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,620
Renjun.

235
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,180
Mr. Li,

236
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,820
it's been a while.

237
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,900
Mr. Li, hello.

238
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,500
We are the with the special Tack Force.

239
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,580
We've asked you here

240
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,620
to clarify some details

241
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,500
about the Wan Hai case.

242
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,060
This conversation
is strictly confidential.

243
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,900
Your cooperation is appreciated.

244
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,180
Mr. Li,

245
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,780
what's your view on the Wan Hai Case?

246
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,820
Do you think

247
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,500
there has been any wrongdoing?

248
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,420
No, I don't think so,

249
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,540
otherwise, we wouldn't have
prosecuted it.

250
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,300
During Qiao Zhenxing's time
as lead prosecutor,

251
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,300
the case was twice sent back
for further police investigation.

252
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,100
After you took over,

253
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,100
did you verify the issues

254
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,300
he raised?

255
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,660
During his handling of the case,

256
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,180
we discussed it many times.

257
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,100
I believe

258
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,980
his approach was flawed.

259
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,780
So you

260
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,420
took him off the case?

261
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,700
The Wan Hai Case has been going
for two years.

262
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,700
Maybe you should

263
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,140
take a break.

264
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,500
Why was I taken off?

265
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,380
Did I make mistakes or abuse my power?

266
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,100
It was decided
by the Party Leadership Group.

267
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,860
Who chaired
the Party Leadership Group meeting?

268
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,660
I served as the acting chair.

269
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,660
So you chaired that meeting

270
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,540
and decided to

271
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,740
replace the lead prosecutor.

272
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,660
Do you think that decision

273
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,460
has interfered with the investigation

274
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,740
or obstructed the case?

275
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,220
The Party Leadership Group

276
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,300
holds the highest level of authority

277
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,500
and has the final say
over court affairs.

278
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,300
Alright.

279
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,780
After Zhang Wenjing was exonerated,

280
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,900
did you still stand by the Wan Hai Case?

281
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,460
Just because Zhang Wenjing's case
was a mistrial

282
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,780
doesn't mean the Wan Hai Case is wrong.

283
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,860
If a prosecutor mishandled
the Zhang Wenjing case,

284
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,500
you don't think he could've

285
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,020
done the same with the Wan Hai case?

286
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,140
One bad apple doesn't mean

287
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,860
you should throw out the whole basket.

288
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,100
You don't think the rest of the apples

289
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,140
are contaminated?

290
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,340
That's your opinion. I disagree.

291
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,700
Like you mentioned,

292
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,380
our approaches are different.

293
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,540
After Shao Xiaoyan
retracted her testimony

294
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,060
and Zhang Wenjing's case was dismissed,

295
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,500
doubts arose about the KTV Assault case.

296
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,660
Why didn't you
follow up the investigation

297
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,740
and verify Wu Xiaotian's statement,

298
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,980
but instead pushed the case forward
with the same approach?

299
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,020
The materials provided by the police
were clear

300
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,220
and the chain of custody was intact,

301
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,060
so I trusted their judgment,

302
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,860
especially since time was tight.

303
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,780
What if someone admits
to framing Wan Hai?

304
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,060
You mean when Wu Xiaotian
retracted his testimony.

305
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,500
Yes.

306
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,380
Wu Xiaotian retracted his testimony,

307
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,060
so do you think
the Wan Hai Case is airtight?

308
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,540
Ms. Zheng,

309
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,380
at that moment he hadn't recanted,

310
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,780
so I had to proceed based on...

311
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,740
I mean now.

312
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,660
I asked,

313
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,140
now that Wu Xiaotian has
retracted his testimony,

314
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,260
do you still think
the Wan Hai Case is airtight?

315
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,420
Yes, I admit.

316
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,980
I placed too much faith in the materials

317
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,660
from the police investigation.

318
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,820
Like I said, time was tight,

319
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,180
so some oversights

320
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,780
were unavoidable.

321
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,820
Is that all?

322
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,700
I advanced the case

323
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,300
too hastily,

324
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,220
and as a result,

325
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,220
my approach was flawed.

326
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,500
Beyond these,

327
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,860
are there some deeper reasons?

328
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,900
Ms. Zheng, I don't quite understand.

329
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,340
What do you mean by "deeper"?

330
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,700
In hindsight,

331
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,500
I may have been

332
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,300
a bit to eager for fast results.

333
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,140
And?

334
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,620
What else?

335
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,780
Ms. Zheng, what you're trying to say

336
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,900
is that I was negligent,

337
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,020
committed malfeasance,

338
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,420
and intentionally mishandled the case,
right?

339
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,780
Could that be possible?

340
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,260
Since everything's out in the open,

341
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,260
let's just be direct, shall we?

342
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,740
Why don't you let Hong Liang take over
the questioning now?

343
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,300
Hong Liang,

344
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,940
come on, it's your turn.

345
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,500
Can I have some water?

346
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,420
Thanks.

347
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,100
I had

348
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,700
a private talk

349
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,620
with Mr. Li once

350
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,580
when Xie Hongfei

351
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,780
was under
the Guidance Group's investigation.

352
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,780
He said that after everyone

353
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,940
was suddenly pulled off
the Wan Hai case,

354
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,540
there weren't enough personnel
handling it.

355
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,300
Then, in such

356
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,460
a short time,

357
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,860
you took over as lead investigator.

358
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,180
Was that consistent
with standard procedure?

359
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,460
Ms. Lan proposed it,

360
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,820
and the Central Political and Legal
Affairs Commission approved it.

361
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,540
I don't know if there was

362
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,420
a procedural problem.

363
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,620
When Xie was handling the case,

364
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,780
you deemed lawyer Zhang Wenjing

365
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,380
as a core member of the mafia,

366
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,540
was that the investigative organ's
decision

367
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,860
or the prosecution office's.

368
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,700
The prosecution office's.

369
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,340
So how does your office-
from the Party Leadership Group

370
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,420
to the Procuratorial Committee-

371
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,180
think of Xie Hongfei?

372
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,740
Xie

373
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,340
is an experienced prosecutor

374
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,580
with solid expertise,

375
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,940
and the approval
for Zhang Wenjing's arrest

376
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,180
passed the Procuratorial Committee.

377
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,140
On a personal note,

378
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,260
you and Liu Yun just bought a new house.

379
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,860
You've really

380
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,420
done your research

381
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,420
on me, haven't you?

382
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,740
Yeah,

383
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,220
but I still have to ask you
about the details.

384
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,580
What's the development's name?

385
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,300
Dadu Xishan.

386
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,300
When did you buy it?

387
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,620
Around mid-April.

388
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,020
More precise.

389
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,180
Around the 15th, give or take.

390
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,380
Wan Hai's verdict was announced on April?

391
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,180
April 2nd.

392
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:22,860
The 2nd.

393
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,940
So who's the developer?

394
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,860
The Tianlong Company.

395
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,180
Did you buy it at market price?

396
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:31,740
No.

397
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,900
It was a model unit

398
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,660
with some small damage,

399
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,100
so the price

400
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,580
was below market

401
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,700
by

402
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,820
1.42 million.

403
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,180
That... that much?

404
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,700
No,

405
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,260
I've already asked Liu Yun

406
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,860
to pay up the difference.

407
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,060
When did she pay it?

408
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,140
At the end of May.

409
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,820
More precisely?

410
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,180
Around the 26th or 27th.

411
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,380
So May 26th or May 27th.

412
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,860
And the developer

413
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,140
is

414
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,900
Tianlong Company,

415
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,500
owned by Chen Shenglong.

416
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,540
Yes, I'm aware.

417
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,380
Do you know him personally?

418
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,180
I've met him twice.

419
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,100
Can you specify those two times?

420
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,740
Once

421
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,340
was at Li Yanxin and Cheng Zijian's
engagement party.

422
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,460
I was there too, why didn't I see him?

423
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,140
You had to leave early for a meeting.

424
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,900
He arrived afterward.

425
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,660
Why was he there?

426
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,300
To celebrate their engagement.

427
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,020
How much money did he give them?

428
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,420
I don't know, but it was more than
what you gave.

429
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,340
And when was the second time
you met Chen Shenglong?

430
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,140
The second time was right after

431
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,540
the Wan Hai verdict.

432
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,140
It happened to be my birthday,

433
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,980
and I wanted to organize
a simple family dinner.

434
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,340
Liu Yun booked a restaurant,

435
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,420
and by chance,

436
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,740
Chen Shenglong was there
and came over for a toast.

437
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,780
What do you mean
he was there "by chance"?

438
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,580
Tianlong Company

439
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,660
owned that restaurant.

440
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,860
Who did you say made the reservation?

441
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,580
Liu Yun.

442
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,860
Mr. Lan asked her to find a small,

443
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,300
quiet venue.

444
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,660
She didn't know where to go,

445
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,300
so she asked Cheng Zijian for help.

446
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,980
He recommended this restaurant,

447
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,460
but she didn't know it was owned

448
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,500
by Tianlong Company at the time.

449
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,620
Did Cheng Zijian attend the dinner?

450
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,100
No, he didn't.

451
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,420
Who did?

452
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,700
There were Ms. Lan,

453
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,660
Wen Qin,

454
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,020
Sun Fei,

455
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,380
Xu Yanwu,

456
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,860
Xie Hongfei,

457
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,620
Liu Yun, and me.

458
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,980
So they all went there.

459
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,860
And what's the relationship
between your wife Liu Yun

460
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,420
and Chen Shenglong?

461
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,980
Please, you can't say anything.

462
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,300
If they start investigating me,

463
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,340
I'm finished.

464
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,980
What will happen to this family?

465
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,420
What about our son?

466
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,820
Qiqi's still young.

467
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,020
He needs a family.

468
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,100
I believe it's strictly professional.

469
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,300
Their work overlaps.

470
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,100
Some of Tianlong's business

471
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,940
falls under Liu Yun's jurisdiction.

472
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,860
What part of their business?

473
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,460
Real estate development.

474
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,860
No, wait.

475
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,860
It was Wanchuan Mining.

476
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,340
Wan Hai's Wanchuan Mining.

477
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,300
Yes.

478
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,940
And now Chen Shenglong is planning to

479
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,100
acquire Wanchuan Mining from Wan Hai,

480
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,860
did you know that?

481
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,940
Yeah, I've heard.

482
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,820
You've heard.

483
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,260
So did you decide to

484
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,540
pay up the price difference

485
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,020
on your Dadu Xishan property

486
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,460
after the Wanchuan Mining

487
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,420
Accident?

488
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,540
No, no, Hong Liang.

489
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,900
The mining accident isn't the reason

490
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,580
we decided to pay the difference.

491
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,260
It was my personal judgment

492
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,260
that the apartment was questionable,

493
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,700
so I decided to cover the difference.

494
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,100
It has nothing to do with the accident.

495
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,260
They're two separate things.

496
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,100
Did... did I make myself clear?

497
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,780
Was that clear?

498
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,980
So, when you say "questionable",

499
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,660
do you mean

500
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,420
the decor,

501
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,780
- the construction or...
- The price difference.

502
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,660
The price difference?

503
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,100
Yes.

504
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,460
Alright.

505
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,380
You said it was your personal judgment,

506
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,820
let me tell you
what I'm seeing objectively.

507
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,100
Fact one:

508
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,460
Your wife, Liu Yun, and Chen Shenglong

509
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,540
have overlapping work responsibilities

510
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,060
and business dealings.

511
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,340
Under Liu Yun's lead,

512
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,700
you bought a property

513
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,940
in Dadu Xishan, a Tianlong Company's

514
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,260
development.

515
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,220
And

516
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,980
after the Wanchuan Mining Accident,

517
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,820
the two of you then

518
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,300
decided to cover the price difference.

519
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,900
Fact two:

520
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,580
After the Wan Hai verdict,

521
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,620
Secretary Lan Jingming of the Central
Political and Legal Affairs Commission,

522
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,140
Presiding Judge Wen Qin,

523
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,100
Prosecutor-General Li Renjun of the
Dongping Municipal People's Procuratorate

524
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,100
and his wife Liu Yun,

525
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,020
and Dongping Police Chief Xu Yanwu

526
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,340
all gathered

527
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,500
at a restaurant owned by
Chen Shenglong's Tianlong Company,

528
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,180
with Chen Shenglong himself present.

529
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,660
Fact three:

530
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,060
Not long after the verdict,

531
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,380
you met with Wan Hai again.

532
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,620
Why?

533
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,980
And as for Prosecutor Xie Hongfei,

534
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,140
he tried very hard to persuade me,

535
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,100
preaching law, justice, and all that.

536
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,700
I was wondering
what was his real message?

537
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,140
Then I figured it out-

538
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,660
it was a trade-off.

539
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,860
If I plead guilty,

540
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,900
and he will reduce my sentence.

541
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,340
A win-win.

542
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:36,940
It was a follow-up visit.

543
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,460
So was you meeting Wang Yu

544
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,300
also a follow-up?

545
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,420
You couldn't have pulled this off alone.

546
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,820
Someone inside helped you.

547
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,220
Some made connections,

548
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,460
some provided the funds,

549
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,660
and some did the dirty work.

550
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,420
Once we uncover the truth,

551
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,300
this won't be just

552
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,020
a casual chat anymore.

553
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,860
Either show me the proof,

554
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,260
or I'm leaving.

555
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,220
So why did you go to see Wang Yu?

556
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,220
Is it possible

557
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,740
that

558
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,780
after the verdict in the Wan Hai case,

559
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,980
you weren't quite at ease?

560
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,460
Maybe you started doubting

561
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,740
how airtight the case really was,

562
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,760
and wanted to reinvestigate it

563
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,780
and double-check the facts?

564
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,300
Is that it?

565
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,620
Did your investigation lead anywhere?

566
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,180
Or did it go nowhere?

567
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,180
Or that you don't want to share
what you found?

568
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,660
Now more than ever,

569
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,740
you need to think clearly.

570
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:07,880
[Wang Yu - Cheng Zijian]

571
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,300
Dongping has faced its share of storms,

572
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,420
[Wan Hai]
and every storm has brought

573
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,780
[Wan Hai]
a certain level of destruction.

574
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,020
But I think

575
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,620
Dongping can't go back to the old way
this time.

576
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,460
We should've fixed the real issues
at the source long ago.

577
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,500
Hong Liang, with all your talk,

578
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,580
you're basically trying to say

579
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,340
I'm

580
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,620
their protector, right?

581
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,900
No, no. That's fine.

582
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,060
You can speculate all you want,

583
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,900
but I implore you

584
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,260
to verify your claims

585
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,580
before making accusations.

586
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,740
If you have no proof,

587
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,340
don't ask me to prove my innocence.

588
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,300
Li Renjun, you're not being honest.

589
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,180
We're here

590
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,980
on behalf of the highest authority,

591
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,460
and we expect you to be truthful

592
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,900
and forthcoming

593
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,820
in this interview.

594
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,260
We hope you will

595
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,100
cherish this chance.

596
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,020
You don't need to ask me for proof now!

597
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,540
When I show you the proof,

598
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,660
will I also have to show you
an arrest warrant?

599
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,820
Where do you want to stand?

600
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,620
What are you hiding?

601
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,340
What are you afraid of?

602
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,140
Why not just tell the truth?

603
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,300
Wan Hai is innocent!

604
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,460
We're not mobsters!

605
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,660
Tell them that you're not mafia,

606
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,340
that Wang Yu set you up!

607
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,820
You were the first to accuse Wan Hai
of being mafia.

608
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,660
And you're also

609
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,300
the one who benefited the most

610
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,780
after he was sentenced.

611
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,460
Wang Yu reported Wan Hai

612
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,980
because Wan Hai

613
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,940
took over his Freight Hub, right?

614
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,100
Then why didn't he say anything
back then?

615
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,860
He even went to

616
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,940
work for Wan Hai.

617
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,460
Only after the assault case

618
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,860
was closed,

619
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,820
which was six months later,
did he bring it up.

620
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,300
Yeah, what was he waiting for?

621
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,460
[Cheng Zijian, Hong Bin]
So did this Mr. Chen Shenglong

622
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,500
want to

623
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,780
take over his Freight Hub?

624
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,300
I'm quite close with Xie,

625
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,980
and during the Wan Hai case,

626
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,220
we sometimes

627
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,860
watched each other's backs.

628
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,540
So Wanchuan Mining
and the Battery Plant

629
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,060
are part of our overall plan,

630
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,820
and taking over Wanchuan Mining

631
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,540
is key to that plan.

632
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,260
This is like the story of
The Peasant and The Snake.

633
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,540
I was bitten by the snake,

634
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,100
but it's not deadly.

635
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,300
I'll survive.

636
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,380
Chen Shenglong

637
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,220
eliminated his competition

638
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,420
using legal tactics.

639
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,140
Wang Yu.

640
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,540
Who is this?

641
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,380
Li Renjun.

642
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,420
Where are you?

643
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,420
Why do you care where I am?

644
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,940
I know you're at the Freight Hub.

645
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,620
I'm downstairs.

646
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,540
Come down and let's have a talk.

647
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,660
I don't have time to talk. I'm busy.

648
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,020
This is your chance.

649
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,220
We can either talk here,

650
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,500
or I'll have to invite you
to the Procuratorate.

651
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,860
Go ahead.

652
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,300
What do you want to talk about?

653
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,900
Do you know where I'm coming from?

654
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,580
The Task Force.

655
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,740
Do you know what that means?

656
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,420
It's formed by the
Provincial Procuratorate

657
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,540
to investigate the Wan Hai case
and the mining accident.

658
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,540
I'm here to give you a chance

659
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,300
to turn yourself in.

660
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,380
Of course,

661
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,420
if you want,

662
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,420
I can go with you

663
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,900
and clear things up.

664
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,820
Clear what up?

665
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,700
Tell them that
you're Chen Shenglong's pawn,

666
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,540
and the Tianlong Company
has been scheming

667
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,460
to take Wan Hai's mine.

668
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,180
Tell them that you framed Wan Hai

669
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,300
to get his Freight Hub.

670
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,820
Tell them that

671
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,620
you'll be the key witness.

672
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,620
You watch too many crime flicks.

673
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,740
Are you gonna tell me
I can be a state's witness?

674
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,740
You say I'm a pawn?

675
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,860
Can you prove I were

676
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,740
Chen Shenglong's pawn?

677
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,260
Do you have evidence that
Chen Shenglong has been scheming

678
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,260
to take the mine?

679
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,260
Wang Yu,

680
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,540
I can find out everything.

681
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,460
You think the Task Force can't?

682
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,620
I'm warning you,

683
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,340
don't fool yourself

684
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,300
or expect a miracle, understand?

685
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,140
Tell me,

686
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,220
can the Task Force

687
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,340
fix the mess in Dongping?

688
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,220
Can the Task Force

689
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,180
bring down Chen Shenglong?

690
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,380
They colluded with officials
to frame Wan Hai,

691
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,860
caused a deadly mining accident,

692
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,140
and used Dongping's judicial system

693
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,540
as a weapon against rivals.

694
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,460
Wang Yu, I'm telling you,

695
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,460
no one involved in this

696
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,340
will get away!

697
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,460
No one's getting away?

698
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,460
Fine. No one gets away then.

699
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,900
You think you can get away?

700
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,020
What about your wife?

701
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,980
Your wife helped them get the mine,

702
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,580
and you prosecuted the case.

703
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,220
You and your wife were just their tools.

704
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,460
You're their protectors.

705
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,500
You're in no position to lecture me.

706
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,540
Where did you really come from?

707
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,220
You said you came from the Task Force?

708
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,100
Have you told them about this?

709
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,860
I don't think so.

710
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,380
Then what did you come here

711
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,260
trying to scare me?

712
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,580
Wang Yu,

713
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,340
you think I'm trying to scare you?

714
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,060
You can look it up yourself

715
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,420
and see how many years

716
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,940
you could get for what you've done.

717
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,500
I can tell you now

718
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,420
that you're looking at
over ten years behind bars

719
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,900
for these offenses.

720
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,700
If you don't believe me,

721
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,900
check for yourself.

722
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,420
I'm giving you a chance

723
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,260
to turn yourself in,

724
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,380
and maybe it could reduce your sentence.

725
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,300
But if you wait for the police
to arrest you,

726
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,180
it'll be a whole different story.

727
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,900
Give it some thought.

728
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,900
Come to me when you decide.

729
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,460
Go on.

730
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,580
Leave.

731
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,140
I've been playing cards for years.

732
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,140
Who are you trying to fool?

733
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,820
I get it now.

734
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,060
Are you scared?

735
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,020
What should I say
if I go turn myself in?

736
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,180
That your wife

737
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,140
was forced by Chen Shenglong,

738
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,660
that I'm his pawn,

739
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,260
and I framed Wan Hai?

740
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,300
Did you not mishandle the case?

741
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,100
You just want to
clear your own name, don't you?

742
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,500
Why are officials always like this?

743
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,220
They all want benefits

744
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,060
but run at the first sign of trouble.

745
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,180
What kind of person are you?

746
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,700
