Li Renjun.

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,010
He called me yesterday.

10
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,010

Yes, the three of us were together.

both of them, well, the three of us

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,220

23
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,780
his are just that little bit loftier.

24
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,130
As in, he's not the type

25
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,570
who'd be a stickler for every case.

26
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,340

who's a friend in need.

Of course, I understand

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,460
that this arrangement of yours

125

127
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:23,660

Verifying a report letter

129

when it's based on no evidence

130
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,660
is quite difficult indeed.

131
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,700
So

132
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,010
you were hoping that

133
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,180
Hong Liang may investigate discreetly

134
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,010
while in the group,

135
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,460
am I right in saying that?

136
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,940
Zhang Wenjing's claims of innocence

137
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,610
do need deeper probing.

138
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,460
But for the Wan Hai case,

139
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,340
from intervention to prosecution,

140
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,940
we've spent over two years on it.

141
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,340
It's apparent

142
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,770
how our comrades at Dongping City

143
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,850
treat this case. Truly,

144
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,650
they're extremely cautious.

145
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,130
Personally, I think

146
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,180
the Wan Hai case

147
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,300
shouldn't pose such a big problem.

148
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,490
Furthermore,

149
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,060
as everyone knows,

150
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,980
Hong Liang is
from the Eleventh Division.

151
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,130
If he's going to Dongping with the team,

152
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,820
that means the Provincial Procuratorate
suspects misconduct

153
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,980
in Dongping's public security organs,

154
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,530
both in the Wan Hai case

155
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,610
and Zhang Wenjing's issue.

156
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,250
We'll investigate Zhang Wenjing's claim,

157
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,180
certainly.

158
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,610
And we'll get to the bottom of it.

159
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,530
Any problems,

160
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,340
and we'll raise it
to the Municipal Procuratorate.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,700
We'll correct any mistakes.

162
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,940
And if it's correct,

163
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,130
we'll also support
the Municipal Procuratorate,

164
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,700
and advance the case development.

165
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,610
To investigate or advance the case,

166
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,980
you must go to Dongping anyway.

167
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,820
Right.

168
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,530
Hong Liang is from Dongping.

169
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,460
He understands Dongping's situation

170
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,610
better than you do.

171
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,340
So him joining this Guidance Group

172
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,250
is beneficial.

173
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,890
The anonymous letter mentioned Li Renjun

174
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,250
and

175
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,460
Qiao Zhenxing.

176
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,580
Both were his classmates.

177
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,300
He's related to both these key people.

178
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,130
So the Party Committee placing him

179
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,300
in this Guidance Group is no issue.

180
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,300
Mr. Zhang.

181
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,700
I think that's even more inappropriate.

182
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,300
Why?

183
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,220

184
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,610
They're familiar.

00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,300
Yes.

186
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,250
People will talk!

187
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,610
- I... I think what she's saying is...
- Hong Liang.

188
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,420
Did I ask for your opinion?

189
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,220
This is the Party Committee's decision.

190
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,060
If the letter's contents are true,

191
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,370
then all the more
should the Eleventh Division

192
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,610
be involved in the Guidance Group.

193
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,650
You deliberately trying to mess this up,

194
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,300
Qiao Zhenxing?

195
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,010
There's insufficient evidence,

196
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,820
so I let them fall back and investigate,

197
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,940
what's the problem?

198
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,940
That's fine,

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,700
but you've done this twice now,

200
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,850
and always on the verge of

201
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,130
the prosecution review's cut-off day.

202
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,490
The Police have done further searches

203
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,700
and you find their evidence wanting, no?

204
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,060
Thing is, on several key points,

205
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,530
there's no evidence, only witnesses.

206
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,490
How can we prosecute on no solid proof?

207
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,370
But you've delayed this twice.

208
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,220
Legally you can only do so twice.

209
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,530
Beyond that you can't push a case.

210
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,370
Precisely because so many problems exist

211
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,220
that we're exhausting all legal means.

212
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,180
We still have prosecutorial rights.

213
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,060
I request

214
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,650
to investigate autonomously.

215
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,490
Mr. Li.

216
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,220
Well...

217
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,490
What...

218
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,300
what did they ask?

219
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,730
Just a few questions, such as

220
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,420
did Qiao behave oddly in recent days.

221
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,420
Aside from complying, we...

222
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,820
can't do much else.

223
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,370
Zhang Wenjing's protests of innocence

224
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,850
plus this incident with Qiao...

225
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,250
Say, will the Provincial Procuratorate

226
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,580
form some opinion about us?

227
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,610
What do you think?

228
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,940
Everything's happening all at once.

229
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,530
How can they not?

230
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,460
Then Mr. Li,

231
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,770
how should I proceed with my work?

232
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,300
Do I re-examine Wan Hai's case,

233
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,460
or do I investigate Zhang Wenjing fully?

234
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,820
Give me your instructions.

235
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,250
Wait for instructions
from the Provincial Procuratorate.

236
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:50,730
OK.

you're close with Qiao Zhenxing.

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,180

Let me lay down some ground rules.

244
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,370
Qiao Zhenxing's death just occurred,

245
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,250
so Dongping Police

246
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,100
is definitely investigating it now.

247
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,580
Before they come to any conclusions,

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,850
we can't use any investigative means.

249
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,180
We can't let people think that

250
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,700
our Procuratorate has any opinion

251
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,420
or attitude on this.

252
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,370

and will obey all arrangements.

258
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,730
Good.

00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:53,980

I didn't sign your resignation report,

271
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,730
so perhaps you've still got questions.

272
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,220

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,890
what would your take be?

285
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,490
Doesn't make sense.

286
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,420
Then flip it.

287
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,770
If Qiao Zhenxing were clean,

288
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,890
and Li Renjun were not,

289
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,130
and Li's got a hand in Qiao's death,

290
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,530
what would you think?

291
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,580
Impossible.

292
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,820
If both of them

293
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,180
were problematic…

294

that's the complexity of the case there.

And Qiao Zhenxing's fingerprints
were detected on the bottle.

571

The DNA on the wine bottle also matched.

572
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,180

00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,700
that Qiao Zhenxing

Have we obtained the CCTV footage
for that road?

580

745
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,460
[Assistant Prosecutor, First Division]
From CUPL,

746
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,220
- Master of Criminal Law,
- Nice to meet you.

747
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:41,810
Let's work well.

748
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,900
and also the backbone
of our First Division.

749
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,220
Then please introduce

750
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,380
your colleague
from the Eleventh Division.

751
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,860
It's embarrassing, we...

752
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,330
The Eleventh Division isn't as

753
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,980
impressive as the First Division.

754
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,490
Speaking of introductions,

755
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,660
let's not even get to me.

756
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,330
I mean,

757
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,810
Zhang Huai'en, he...

758
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,420
You alright?

759
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:01,770
Sorry.

760
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,220
Sorry.

761
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,620
Mister, any tissue?

762
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,420
Yea, over there.

763
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,090
Well...

764
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:07,980
Ms. Zheng,

765
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,490
I won't prattle on.

766
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,860
I'm also a Master of Criminal Law,

767
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,010
and Bai Ziyan's junior.

768
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,660
Here, tissue.

769
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,090
Preliminary autopsy's done.

770
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,810
Estimated time of death?

771
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,860
It's on the 26th,

772
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,250
between 5 to 7 PM.

773
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,570
Any obvious external wounds
on the deceased?

774
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,900
No hematoma, bruise, or contusion.

775
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,420
Meaning, there were

776
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,620
no scuffles or struggles with others
before death.

777
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,770
Plus, blood alcohol content was at

778
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,810
172.4 mg per 100 ml,

779
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,700
with alcohol metabolites such as

780
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,140
ethyl glucuronide
and ethyl sulphate detected as well.

781
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,380
In other words,

782
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,660
alcohol was consumed before death.

783
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,810
And at the moment of death, the deceased

784
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,940
was intoxicated.

785
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,980
He must've downed
a whole bottle of wine.

786
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:54,700
Yes.

787
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,770
And around his nose and mouth,

788
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,770
there's a pale reddish
mushroom-shaped foam.

789
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,380
This is consistent with
death by drowning.

790
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,380
Another thing is,

791
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,050
tests on the deceased's alveoli
and other organs

792
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,010
revealed high concentrations of diatoms.

793
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,650
It can be inferred
that death was due to drowning.

794
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,530
We're preparing to do
the diatom test immediately,

795
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,820
comparing the diatom components
in his lungs' air sacs

796
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,380
with water samples at the scene,

797
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,210
to confirm whether
he drowned at the scene.

798
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,900
Water samples have all been collected.

799
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,130
Mr. Sun.

800
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,460
What say you?

801
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,130
OK.

802
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,130
Here goes.

803
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,980
According to our current

804
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,650
understanding of the situation

805
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,260
based on test results,

806
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,860
although we won't eliminate
the possibility of homicide,

807
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,090
we're more inclined toward

808
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,380
the information from physical evidence

809
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,570
gathered by
the Criminal Investigation Team,

810
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,940
and a reasonable

811
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,170
logical deduction.

812
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,130
That's it?

813
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:00,740
Alright then.

814
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,860
My turn now.

815
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,610
Dear sub-bureau colleagues.

816
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,610
Within such a short time,

817
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,340
your ability to do
such detailed investigative work

818
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,130
is commendable,

819
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,260
just on that point alone.

820
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,860
On behalf of the bureau,

821
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,940
for your hard work
in this recent period,

822
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,050
I extend my thanks.

823
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,300
And at the same time,
I hope you'll keep it up.

824
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,090
I saw the reports.

825
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,610
But allow me to ramble a bit.

826
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,610
Firstly,

827
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,210
this diatom experiment,

828
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,740
time is of the essence.

829
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,460
Water sample from the deceased's lungs

830
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,010
and samples from the scene,
where the victim fell

831
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,610
are to be compared.

832
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,860
It's the best way to prove that Qiao

833
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,050
died by drowning,

834
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,820
and to find the place of drowning.

835
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,900
Secondly, the pickaxe.

836
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,050
For the pickaxe to only have
Qiao Zhenxing's fingerprints

837
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,610
should ring some alarms.

838
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,900
Or perhaps,
Qiao Zhenxing wiped the fingerprints

839
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,010
before using the pickaxe.

840
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,420
Thirdly,

841
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,860
it's the phone.

842
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,570
Qiao Zhenxing's phone

843
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,740
might very possibly
be a crucial clue in this case.

844
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,420
Don't take it lightly.

845
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,780
Of course.

846
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,300
We must display

847
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,900
the esthetics
of our Dongping Procuratorate.

848
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:11,900
Li.

849
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,010
Mr. Li.

850
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:15,820
Mr. Li.

851
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:16,860
The car's here.

852
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,460
Come.

853
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:23,980
Ms. Zheng.

854
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,420
Can't believe we meet again so soon.

855
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,380
Welcome.

856
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,570
We're indebted to you, Mr. Li.

857
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,490
No trouble at all.

858
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,300
You're here to care for us and help us.

859
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,260
Ms. Zheng, these are some of the
Dongping Procuratorate staff

860
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,170
involved in the Wan Hai case.

861
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,460
It's a huge case, two years.

862
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,530
It's been tough on them.

863
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,010
Yes.

864
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,090
Dear colleagues.

865
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,490
Here's your colleague from
the Provincial People's Procuratorate's

866
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,570
Guidance Group.

867
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,820
Let's welcome her
with a round of applause.

868
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,170
A few words, Ms. Zheng?

869
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,650
No need for speeches.

870
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,740
Everyone, thank you.

871
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,490
It's been over two years,

872
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,610
no easy task.

873
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,090
But let me add.

874
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,530
Please do

875
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,740
cooperate with
the Guidance Group's work.

876
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,530
Sir, ma'am,

877
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,530
it's too cold outside, let's head in.

878
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,260
Sure, let's.

879
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,170
This way, please.

880
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,900
Smooth journey, it seems.

881
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,170
Yes, safe and sound.

882
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,460
Reporting.

883
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,380
Come in.

884
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,090
Mr. Xu,

885
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,170
you called?

886
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,300
Yes.

887
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,010
How much do you know

888
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,490
about this Hong Liang?

889
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,460
Hong Liang?

890
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,010
I know him.

891
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,610
Wasn't he from our procuratorate?

892
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,780
Then he transferred
to the Provincial Procuratorate.

893
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,090
He's classmates
with my elder brother Li Renjun.

894
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,010
They get along well.

895
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,170
They close?

896
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,050
Yes,

897
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,780
I suppose.

898
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,420
When they're in college,

899
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,780
I once stayed in their dormitory, even.

900
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,530
What about it, Mr. Xu?

901
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,690
The Provincial Procuratorate sent
a Guidance Group

902
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,010
to Dongping for a case.

903
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,940
This Hong Liang

904
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,780
is one of the Guidance Group members.

905
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,650
He's from the Provincial Procuratorate's
Eleventh Division.

906
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,210
That's got nothing to do with me, right?

907
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,860
Not like I committed
malfeasance in office.

908
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,610
All is not well in Dongping now.

909
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,210
There's Wan Hai's case,

910
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,940
Zhang Wenjing's ruckus,

911
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,740
and then your brother.

912
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,010
These few cases are all thrown in.

913
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:16,940
It's sensitive.

914
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,340
I heard that

915
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,980
staff from this sub-bureau had held
a case analysis meeting.

916
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:21,820
No new developments.

917
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,900
Got to wait longer.

918
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,210
Alright, I'll take my leave.

919
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,170
Qin Feng.

920
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,980
Everything I said to you just now,

921
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,900
once you exit this office,

922
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,860
not a single word must leave your lips.

923
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,130
Got it.

924
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,380
Password, six zeros.

925
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,340
They're here.

926
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,860
Please alight, sir, ma'am.

927
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,050
Give this to me.

928
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:21,300
Come.

929
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,650
Watch the steps.

930
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,780
Here, this way.

931
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,340
Hello.

932
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,260
Let me.

933
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,170
Mister, your room card.

934
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:40,610
Alrighty.

935
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:41,980
Ms. Zheng, this is yours.

936
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,170
Yours.

937
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,090
This is yours and Mr. Hong's.

938
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,300
Watch your footsteps, slowly.

939
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,010
We're here, sir, ma'am.

940
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,340
This way,

941
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:00,940
here.

942
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,530
Ms. Zheng.

943
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,900
The two of us are in this room.

944
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,340
Thanks.

945
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,860
What's on your mind?

946
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,780
That Guidance Group

947
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,050
arrived in Dongping today.

948
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,650
Hong Liang

949
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,490
came along too.

950
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,940
What's he coming for?

951
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,340
I'm thinking,

952
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,900
why don't we invite Hong Liang

953
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,170
to dinner at home?

954
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,460
Sure,

955
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,010
you're classmates.

956
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,780
[Liu Yun, Deputy Director]
Since he's in Dongping,

957
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,820
[Pingshan Development Zone Committee]
you've got to welcome him.

958
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,490
He's got rules to abide.

959
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,610
That's his business.

960
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,690
It's your business to invite him.

961
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,900
Forget it, he won't come anyway.

962
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,130
How do you know he won't?

963
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,090
Give him a call.

964
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,690
Mr. Hong, your phone.

965
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,420
Mr. Hong.

966
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,570
Yes?

967
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,380
Have you eaten?

968
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,010
Why?

969
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:52,980
Well,

970
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,820
I'd like to invite you
to dinner at home.

971
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,050
Liu Yun's

972
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,420
already cooked the dishes.

973
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:06,690
What,

974
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,780
something stopping you?

975
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,420
I'm from the Guidance Group,

976
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,940
the vice group leader even.

977
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,860
We just arrived today.

978
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,980
How'd it look if I go to your place

979
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,050
and have dinner,
you think I'm free to do that?

980
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,570
Just hurry and don't dawdle,

981
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,010
I'm hanging up.

982
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:23,980
Geez.

983
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:35,940
It won't be appropriate.

984
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,170
With that report letter,

985
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,090
he's a target of investigation.

986
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,170
I don't suggest you go.

987
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,860
He's an investigation

988
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,300
target,

989
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:46,690
but

990
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,530
I'm not the one investigating,

991
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,130
I'm to observe him.

992
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,780
By internal management regulations,

993
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,860
you can't contact
an investigation target on your own.

994
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:55,780
That's a rule.

995
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,940
Ms. Zheng.

996
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,300
Then,

997
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:02,210
according to my work guidelines,
tell me,

998
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:03,900
how do I observe

999
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,380
without contact?

1000
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,380
Then you should've consulted Mr. Sun,

1001
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:08,610
not tell me about it.

1002
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,090
Then Mr. Sun would think as if I'm not

1003
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,130
listening to Ms. Zheng
on this work trip.

1004
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,820
That won't do either.

1005
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,780
If it seems like we're not united

1006
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,740
you can just sell me out.

1007
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,690
Hong Liang,

1008
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,300
you're from the Eleventh Division.

1009
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,260
While I

1010
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,260
am of the First Division.

1011
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,170
Come in!

1012
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,570
Come on now.

1013
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,380
Don't take off your shoes.

1014
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,010
Hurry.

1015
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,530
Hong Liang's here.

1016
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,940
Hurry and tell me.

1017
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:50,860
Qiao,

1018
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,570
