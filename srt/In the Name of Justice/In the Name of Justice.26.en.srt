Jiang Hongjun's been taken away.

194
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,220
He's...

195
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,340
currently being held in Jiangnan City,

196
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,130
and it's already been a full day.

197
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,130
Jiangnan?

198
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,460
Who took him?

199
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,010
People from the procuratorate.

200
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,530
And seems that

201
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,340
the police were involved too.

202
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,980
It's a joint operation,

203
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,980
and

204
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,010
a pretty high-level one.

205
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,370
How do you know all this?

206
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,180
His...

207
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,420
His family

208
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,060
was extremely upset.

209
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,100
And I

210
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,700
also wanted to understand

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,460
the situation,

212
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,700
so I used some 'means'.

213
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,010
Mr. Xu.

214
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,180
No matter what,

215
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,300
Jiang Hongjun is

216
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,940
the captain of
Criminal Investigation Unit.

217
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,300
But no one

218
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,340
has informed us

219
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,980
about this incident

220
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,420
or given us
any kind of explanation until now.

221
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,530
Don't you think

222
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,940
that's a bit inappropriate?

223
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,580
Look,

224
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,490
can you maybe

225
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,220
make a call to Jiangnan City,
or to the provincial level,

226
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,490
see what's really going on?

227
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,370
Make a call?

228
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,940
And what exactly should I say
in that call?

229
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,420
If he had done nothing wrong,

230
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,420
would he be in custody?

231
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,300
Tell me,

232
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,100
was Jiang Hongjun the person in charge

233
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,220
of investigating the mine accident?

234
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,460
Yes.

235
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,370
Was he also in charge of

236
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,460
the Qiao Zhenxing case?

237
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,100
Yes.

238
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,420
But Jiang Hongjun

239
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,250
is the backbone
in our Criminal Investigation Unit.

240
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,980
We assign major cases to him

241
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,250
all the time.

242
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,370
Then I'm curious.

243
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,370
How could such an outstanding officer

244
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:33,700
just get

245
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,370
taken into custody for no reason?

246
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,220
Indeed.

247
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,940
There are

248
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,300
still some things

249
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,890
I'm trying to understand.

250
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,010
Sun Fei.

251
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,130
At this point,

252
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,850
you're still not gonna tell me?

253
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,820
Does Jiang Hongjun
have a problem or not?

254
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,730
Tell me!

255
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,730
Yes or no?

256
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,610
His wife told me

257
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,770
they found

258
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,890
several million yuan in cash

259
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,250
at home yesterday.

260
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,180
Millions in cash?

261
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,100
Does he even realize who he is?

262
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,180
He's the captain
of Criminal Investigation Unit!

263
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,100
Do you understand
the implications of this?

264
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,650
Mr. Xu, please don't get upset.

265
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,220
I mean,

266
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,100
is there some kind of

267
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,060
misunderstanding here?

268
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,820
Even for an ordinary citizen,
having millions at home

269
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,010
is also a big deal!

270
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,490
Yes.

271
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,300
Tell me,

272
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,890
besides the mine accident

273
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,700
and the Qiao Zhenxing case,

274
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,060
was he involved in the Wan Hai case?

275
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,060
Yes...

276
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,770
Who assigned him to it?

277
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,370
Jiang Hongjun

278
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,820
definitely has issues.

279
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,490
So, is it possible that
the cases he handled

280
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,650
also have problems?

281
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,060
You were the ones

282
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,130
who fought to take on those cases.

283
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,850
I handed them over to you

284
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,700
because I trusted you,

285
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,370
because Ms. Lan trusted you.

286
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,460
Now you're asking me for an explanation?

287
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,460
How about you give me one first?

288
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,890
Sir...

289
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,250
Sorry...

290
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,250
Go.

291
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,180
Whatever happens,

292
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,180
report to me immediately.

293
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,580
Hello, Ms. Zheng.

294
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,980
I'm the director of Procuratorate Office
Stationed in Prison, Wang Huashan.

295
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:28,940
Hello.

296
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,490
Didn't expect your visit today.

297
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,700
You came for...?

298
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,180
The organization has made it very clear,

299
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,580
no asking, no leaking.

300
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:36,940
Please, come in.

301
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,890
How's Wan Hai doing lately?

302
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,060
You know prisoners.

303
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,730
Make a scene when they first get here,

304
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,220
but quiet down once they're inside.

305
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,940
Wan Hai's got coronary heart disease,

306
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,250
can't engage in heavy physical labor,

307
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,100
so we've been lenient.

308
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,180
We have him working in the kitchen.

309
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,010
Emotionally,

310
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,890
he's distant.

311
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,850
Doesn't talk to people much.

312
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,890
A while back,

313
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,290
he got into a dispute

314
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,700
because of the accident
at his family's mine.

315
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,900
We've talked to him seriously
about this.

316
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,090
Thank you.

317
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,330
Leaders,

318
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,050
why are you here again?

319
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,570
I told you

320
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,620
to believe in the law.

321
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,860
That hasn't changed.

322
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,010
We are the Task Force

323
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,250
under the supervision
of Haidong Anti-Crime Office,

324
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,770
coordinated by
Haidong Provincial Procuratorate,

325
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,660
and supported by
Haidong High People's Court

326
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,620
and Public Security Bureau.

327
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,140
We're here this time

328
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,460
to re-investigate

329
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,010
the Wan Hai case,

330
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,770
the Qiao Zhenxing case,

331
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,010
the Wanchuan Mining Accident,
and related matters.

332
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,620
We're digging deep into

333
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,810
the political and legal
protection networks behind these cases

334
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,090
and possible official misconduct.

335
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,090
We hope you'll cooperate.

336
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,380
Come on,

337
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,380
don't joke with me.

338
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,810
First, it was the Guidance Group,

339
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,380
now, the Task Force.

340
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,250
All this back and forth,

341
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,250
didn't I still end up in here?

342
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,090
Just forget it.

343
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,090
Let's just leave it at that.

344
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,250
In this regard,
you're not even as strong as your son.

345
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,980
What do you mean?

346
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,010
The reason we set up a Task Force

347
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,380
is because of Wan Chao's report.

348
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,220
He didn't give up.

349
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,140
But look at your attitude.

350
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,570
Wait, what?

351
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,250
He...

352
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,460
He...

353
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,050
What did he report?

354
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,490
Wan Chao reported that

355
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,010
the mine accident wasn't an accident,
it was man-made.

356
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,140
He gave us the evidence he had.

357
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,490
That's great.

358
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,090
Then

359
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,770
where is he now?

360
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,700
Have you put him under protection?

361
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,660
He is currently wanted
by Dongping Police.

362
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,420
His whereabouts are unknown.

363
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,770
We're also looking for him.

364
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,090
Then what are we even
talking about here?

365
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,860
How about this,

366
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,810
you find him,

367
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,660
then we talk, okay?

368
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,380
We'll do our best to find him

369
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,220
and keep him safe.

370
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:19,980
Please believe me.

371
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,330
I believe.

372
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,660
You just said

373
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,050
a whole bunch of fancy words.

374
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,330
I can tell you're determined.

375
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,330
Digging into the protection networks
behind all this,

376
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,900
but can you really?

377
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,900
How do you dig?

378
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,180
How far can you go?

379
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,380
Uncle.

380
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,860
Chao.

381
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,180
Uncle.

383
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,180
Why did you come this late?

384
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,530
I'm starving.

385
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,140
You think I didn't want to come sooner?

386
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,180
I can't come here during the day.

387
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,770
Did you bring me hot food?

388
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,860
Yeah, look.

389
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,860
It's good stuff.

390
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,050
I never realized before

391
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,980
how delicious
these raisins and nuts are.

392
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,250
If you like it, eat more.

393
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,940
How did our life get like this?

394
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,940
Even eating a hot meal
has to wait until midnight.

395
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,420
Uncle.

396
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,220
I thought about it during the day.

397
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,730
I can't stay here.

398
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,730
Take a chance,

399
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,290
I've got to get out.

400
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,570
At least leave Dongping.

401
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,900
I'll leave tomorrow.

402
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,900
Are you crazy?

403
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,860
Where are you going?

404
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,220
Where would you even go?

405
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,940
The cops are looking for you.

406
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,220
Cameras on every street.

407
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,570
That red hair of yours
stands out everywhere.

408
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,140
Even if the police can't catch you,

409
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,660
what if they catch you?

410
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,290
Them again.

411
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,490
Can you tell me, uncle?

412
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,050
Who are they?

413
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,380
Didn't you say someone
besides the police

414
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,460
was chasing you that day?

415
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,420
Uncle,

416
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,570
can I trust you?

417
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,860
What do you mean?

418
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,330
If you don't trust me, who do you trust?

419
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,290
Then tell me,

420
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,860
have the cops come
looking for you the past few days?

421
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,330
Or anyone else?

422
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,980
Asking about the accident?

423
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,250
Why would the cops come to me for?

424
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,050
What's there to investigate?

425
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,330
The mine case has been determined.

426
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,570
It's a work safety issue.

427
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,290
- What else is there to check?
- Just tell me, has anyone come or not?

428
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,220
No.

429
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,770
Really?

430
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,330
Are you deaf? No.

431
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,900
Then let me be straight with you.

432
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:20,940
Uncle,

433
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,090
it wasn't just an accident.

434
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,700
It's man-made sabotage.

435
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,010
I have proof.

436
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,460
And I already gave it to someone.

437
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,620
What proof?

438
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,730
Who did you give it to?

439
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,050
You handed it over,

440
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,860
and then what?

441
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,570
Have you been contacted?

442
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,810
How can they contact me?

443
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,660
I'm now wanted by Dongping Police.

444
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,860
That's why I asked you,

445
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,090
has anyone come to see you?

446
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,180
Has anyone come to see you?

447
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:02,940
Chao.

448
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,490
You're so stupid.

449
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,180
Have you thought this through?

450
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,180
You really trust those people?

451
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,530
All they do is say nice things.

452
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,570
Which one of their promises
ever came true?

453
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,490
Zhang Wenjing.

454
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,460
Zhang Wenjing was released.

455
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,050
What about your father?

456
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,940
He still got sentenced.

457
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,220
What good did it do?

458
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,250
You said it yourself,

459
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,570
it was man-made.

460
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,010
Then think about it,

461
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,330
if they dare to kill someone,

462
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,490
what won't they do?

463
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,490
They want the mine.

464
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,900
Then who

465
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,050
are 'they'?

466
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,620
Tell me.

467
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,730
I don't know who they are!

468
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,380
Right now, I just want this thing

469
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,900
to be over safely as soon as possible.

470
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,570
Who is it?

471
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,290
Nobody.

472
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,570
Hello, please don't hang up.

473
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,140
The number you dialed is currently
on another call.

474
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,400
[Wan Hong]

475
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,900
Who called you?

476
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,620
Was it them?

477
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,570
You're in touch with them,

478
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,220
can't you just tell me who they are?

479
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,290
I just can't tell you!

480
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,730
If I tell you,

481
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,860
you'd be dead
before you even knew what happened.

482
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,900
If you had listened to me,

483
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,090
and sold the mine like I said,

484
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,220
would there have been a mine accident?

485
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,420
Would people have died?

486
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,090
Would you still be out here,
not being able to go home?

487
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,700
Wan Hong!

488
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,220
Have I not told you before,

489
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,250
don't bring up selling the mine?

490
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,140
You bring it up again,

491
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,700
I swear I'll kill you.

492
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,050
Who are you threatening, huh?

493
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,900
I'm your uncle!

494
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,460
You stay here.

495
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,570
Don't go anywhere.

496
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,220
Eat more walnuts,
help your brain work better.

497
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,160
[Wan Hong]

498
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,770
Mr. Chen.

499
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,290
Busy man, huh?

500
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,810
Can't even pick up the phone.

501
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,530
No, I wouldn't dare.

502
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,700
I just didn't hear it earlier...

503
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,220
No signal just now,

504
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,330
so I pressed decline.

505
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,810
It's been a few days.

506
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,900
We've missed you.

507
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,050
Mr. Chen,

508
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,330
did you need something?

509
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,940
Just checking in.

510
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,940
Did you speak to your brother

511
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,010
about what we discussed last time?

512
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,460
Yes, I did.

513
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,180
So what do you think?

514
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,700
Yes or no?

515
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,980
Give me a straight answer.

516
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,010
Look,

517
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,290
Mr. Chen,

518
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,660
I just think

519
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,530
this isn't something we can rush.

520
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,810
We have to take it slow.

521
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,490
There was just
that huge accident at the mine,

522
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,250
if I talk to him about selling now,

523
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,010
won't that set him off?

524
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,380
He'll definitely blow up.

525
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,700
So, Mr. Chen, you have to believe me.

526
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,420
Do it at my pace.

527
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,050
I'll find the right time,

528
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,090
and talk to him.

529
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,090
Mr. Chen?

530
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:55,900
Hello?

531
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,220
What did you talk about
with your brother?

532
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,620
Not much.

533
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,570
Just some small talk.

534
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,660
Did you mention the mine accident?

535
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:08,940
Yes.

536
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,900
But I didn't go into details.

537
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,250
And did your brother ask about Wan Chao?

538
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,940
He did. I told him not to worry.

539
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,290
I said Wan Chao's fine, very safe.

540
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,660
Mr. Chen.

541
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,530
Please, don't overthink it.

542
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,250
Don't get me wrong.

543
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,290
I really don't know
where Wan Chao is now.

544
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,220
I just said that

545
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,050
to reassure my brother.

546
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,090
Think about it,

547
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,050
he's locked up right now.

548
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,180
He can't do anything to help.

549
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,460
He'll just get worried.

550
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,140
Honestly,

551
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,330
if something really happens
to his precious son,

552
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,010
with my brother's temper,

553
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,250
he can do anything.

554
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,730
No one can stop him.

555
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,860
Then we can forget about
selling the mine.

556
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,250
So what I said to him

557
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,860
was all for your sake.

558
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,140
Am I right, Mr. Chen?

559
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:19,900
Right.

560
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,460
That makes sense.

561
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,490
Then I'll wait for your update.

562
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,620
Okay.

563
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,530
Don't worry, Mr. Chen.

564
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,660
I'll talk to him soon.

565
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,570
This deadbeat

566
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,180
is lying!

567
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,570
Go

568
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,010
find Chao.

569
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:11,940
Hello?

570
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,010
Dear auntie,

571
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,980
why do you call me

572
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,220
during work hours?

573
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,940
I've got something serious to tell you.

574
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,250
Do you remember Jiang Yuan?

575
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,290
Jiang Min's brother.

576
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,380
Old secretary's son.

577
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,810
I told him to come to you.

578
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,730
Isn't he abroad?

579
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,050
He's back.

580
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,700
Wants to start a business.

581
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,570
I looked into his company's credentials,

582
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,250
looks solid on all fronts.

583
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,810
If you can help, please do.

584
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,570
Oh, and his company's name,

585
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,180
let me have a look.

586
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,900
It's

587
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,290
Yuanli New Energy

588
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,380
Technology Group Co., Ltd.

589
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,460
Got that?

590
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,380
New energy?

591
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,140
He's doing new energy too?

592
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,530
Yes.

593
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,940
He says he wants to tap into
Dongping's copper and nickel resources

594
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,700
to produce new energy vehicles.

595
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,570
His factory site plan
has already been approved,

596
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,090
right in Hongjia Village
of your Development Zone.

597
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,570
So I told him to reach out to you.

598
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,050
Hongjia Village?

599
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,940
And the plan has been approved?

600
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,460
Auntie, are you sure?

601
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,220
I'm sure.

602
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,460
I saw the pre-approval document myself.

603
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,660
We've already submitted the application

604
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,460
for the land expropriation rights
in Hongjia Village.

605
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,660
If you have time,

606
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,810
please help move it along.

607
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,810
We're planning to

608
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,140
build a battery plant there.

609
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,180
Hello?

610
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,770
Hello?

611
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,050
I am listening.

612
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,980
If you can support, then do it.

613
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,010
As long as

614
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,980
it doesn't violate
any rules or regulations.

615
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,810
Okay, I got it.

616
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,980
I have a meeting later.

617
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,700
I gotta go.

618
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,140
Hello, Mr. Chen, it's me.

619
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,980
Where are you?

620
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,400
[Land Use Plan of Yuanli Group
New Energy Battery Plant Phase I]

621
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,660
Auntie.

622
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,180
Auntie.

623
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,730
You are?

624
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,490
It's me, Yuan,

625
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,460
Jiang Yuan.

626
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,180
Oh, I remember.

627
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,770
You remember?

628
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,660
Yuan.

629
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,730
Aren't you abroad?

630
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,700
I'm back.

631
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,180
I just came to visit you.

632
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,730
Where's my uncle?

633
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:26,860
He's inside.

634
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,700
Inside.

635
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,770
Old man.

636
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,010
Hurry.

637
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,860
Uncle.

638
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,700
Look who's here.

639
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:32,980
Hurry.

640
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,380
This is?

641
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,730
Liang's brother-in-law.

642
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,010
Jiang Yuan.

643
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,220
Long time no see.

644
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,940
Long time no see.

645
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,700
He just got back from overseas.

646
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,290
Come on.

647
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,090
Let's go.

648
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,700
Mr. Hong.

649
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,940
Got important guest today?

650
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,290
What a grand entrance, so impressive.

651
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,570
I can tell he's important right away.

652
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,220
He's Jiang Yuan,

653
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,730
Liang's brother-in-law.

654
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,090
Mr. Jiang.

655
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,570
Nice to meet you.

656
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,770
Very sharp-looking.

657
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,620
Du!

658
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,810
Quit dawdling, hurry up!

659
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,620
Help with the things.

660
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,730
Just having you here is enough,

661
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,620
you didn't have to bring anything.

662
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,250
Let's document the good life.

663
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,420
Enough.

664
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,810
- Come inside.
- Later,

665
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,700
share those things with our neighbors.

666
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,900
Okay.

667
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,220
Yuan, let's go in first.

668
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,700
You go inside.

669
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,620
Okay.

670
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,220
Stop that, Hong Yi.

671
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,660
Enough shooting.

672
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,420
How nice, look.

673
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,810
Everyone says it tastes great,

674
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,660
so I brought it for you.

675
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,490
Said it's good for older folks.

676
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,530
How is it?

677
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,050
How long are you staying this time?

678
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,380
This time,

679
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,860
I might not go back.

680
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,660
And we may

681
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,980
see each other a lot more often.

682
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:34,860
What do you mean?

683
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,570
Actually, I came back this time

684
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,860
for a project

685
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,570
in the new energy sector.

686
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,220
You know that piece of land
in our village

687
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,620
that got zoned for industrial use?

688
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,860
We're gonna take

689
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,860
that land.

690
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,140
So all this fuss

691
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,660
about the land expropriation
is related to your company?

692
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,530
Yes.

693
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,380
And I'm telling you,

694
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,700
if this goes through,

695
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,290
the village economy

696
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,900
will shoot right up.

697
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,660
It'll also create a lot of jobs.

698
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,940
Why didn't you say so earlier?
If I'd known...

699
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,290
You know what,

700
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,530
the village committee

701
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,140
asked me to give my opinion many times,

702
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,980
but I didn't go.

703
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,420
Really?

704
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,980
If I'd known you were involved in

705
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,140
this expropriation,

706
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,050
I would've shown up in full support.

707
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,980
That means a lot coming from you.

708
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,770
Let me be honest with you,

709
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,860
I'm here today

710
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,770
to ask you

711
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,050
for a favor.

712
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,490
Go on.

713
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,900
The thing is,

714
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,460
the land

715
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,380
has been approved for us.

716
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,090
But there are so many people
in the village,

717
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,620
and since we joined in

718
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,700
a bit late,

719
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,730
there might be some pushback.

720
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,730
I think

721
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,900
it's best if we can

722
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,380
sit down
and talk things through together.

723
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,530
So you're talking about

724
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,010
this matter?

725
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,460
Yes.

726
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,730
Xingzi,

727
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,620
Jiang Yuan came to the village.

728
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,140
I sent you the video.

729
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,300
Looks like he's here for the land.

730
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,090
Okay.

731
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,210
Got it.

732
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,780
You keep an eye on it.

733
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,490
Wait for my signal.

734
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,570
Okay...

735
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,340
I got it.

736
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,340
Uncle,

737
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,570
we're family.

738
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,260
I won't beat around the bush.

739
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,610
I know everyone wants
what's best for the village,

740
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,420
and wants to secure the interests.

741
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,300
You're highly respected around here,

742
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,570
so I was hoping you could

743
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,570
help talk to the others

744
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,530
when you have time.

745
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,820
If anyone has concerns or requests,

746
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,740
tell them to bring them to me.

747
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,980
I'll do my best to find solutions.

748
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,690
Okay.

749
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,570
Not a big ask.

750
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,860
A young man wants to start a business

751
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,420
and build up his hometown,

752
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,690
that's a good thing.

753
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,860
This old man should help,

754
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,050
I'll do my best.

755
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,690
Thank you so much.

756
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,340
Well,

757
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,130
let me toast you with tea first,

758
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,530
we'll drink properly in a bit. Okay?

759
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,170
Come on.

760
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,860
Okay.

761
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,300
I know

762
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,090
the land in Hongjia Village is good.

763
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:12,940
But there's nothing we can do.

764
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,900
The Planning Bureau
has approved it for them.

765
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,460
And

766
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,820
this Yuanli Group

767
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,940
does have some serious backing.

768
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:25,650
Mr. Chen,

769
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,090
I really tried my best.

770
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,690
In fact, you might want to consider

771
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,420
moving into new energy.

772
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,490
Global demand

773
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,090
for nickel in batteries keeps growing.

774
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,980
And

775
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,780
there's a copper-nickel mine

776
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,940
right here in our Development Zone.

777
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,460
Would you be interested, Mr. Chen?

778
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,650
You can't touch the mine,

779
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,650
and definitely not the land.

780
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,650
Chen Shenglong,

781
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,860
you can't

782
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,210
take this mine.

783
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,570
Forget about it.

784
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,130
Yuanli?

785
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,780
The boss's name is Jiang Yuan, right?

786
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,530
His sister is Jiang Min.

787
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,740
His father is Jiang Xudong,

788
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,010
Vice Chairman of
Provincial Committee of the CPPCC.

789
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,490
Is it right?

790
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,340
You knew each other?

791
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,460
Or

792
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,170
have you

793
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,940
been investigating them?

794
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,900
Would you consider working with them?

795
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,740
I can help connect you,

796
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,820
build that bridge.

797
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,820
Director Liu,

798
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,050
let's eat while we talk.

799
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,820
Mr. Chen,

800
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,170
take your time with your meal.

801
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,460
I've said what I came to say.

802
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,690
I have a meeting later.

803
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,490
I'll get going.

804
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,210
Director Liu.

805
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:41,860
Is Dongping going to build

806
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,010
two new energy battery factories?

807
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,980
What do you mean?

808
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,210
I asked,

809
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,740
is Dongping going to build

810
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,740
two new energy battery factories?

811
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,010
But the only land suitable
for battery factories

812
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,420
is in Hongjia Village.

813
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,860
So I only want Hongjia Village.

814
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:11,780
Mr. Chen,

815
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,900
I understand your feelings.

816
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,610
But I'm limited in what I can do.

817
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,130
And acquiring land

818
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,490
isn't as simple as you think.

819
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,210
Perhaps you can consider another site.

820
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,130
As long as it's
within the Development Zone,

821
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,780
I'll do everything I can to help.

822
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,260
I told you,

823
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,130
I only want Hongjia Village.

824
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,690
Chen Shenglong, what's with the banging?

825
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,940
Watch your attitude!

826
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,130
There's no point talking
if you're like this.

827
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,490
Just think about what I proposed.

828
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,980
If you can accept it,

829
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,690
we'll pick it up later.

830
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:50,610
What are you doing?

831
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,570
What do you wanna do?

832
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,490
Director Liu,

833
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,300
sit down.

834
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,980
I told you I have another meeting.

835
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,010
I also told you to sit down.

836
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,610
You trying to pull some
gangster move on me?

837
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:09,900
Fine,

838
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:10,860
let's talk.

839
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,420
The night

840
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,980
of the mine accident,

841
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,780
your whole family was celebrating

842
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,490
your husband's promotion
to prosecutor-general, right?

843
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,570
Lan Jingming was there too.

844
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,210
She even told you
to return the house to me,

845
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:37,860
right?

846
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,010
Did Cheng Zijian tell you that?

847
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,490
Funny.

848
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,570
While you were toasting and laughing,

849
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,420
the Wan family's mine...

850
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,380
What a coincidence.

851
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,900
Consider it a gift from me
to your whole family.

852
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,900
Partnership?

853
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,050
Not interested.

854
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,650
I'll buy the whole thing.

855
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,940
Only with full control

856
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,570
can I devote myself to it.

857
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,650
We still

858
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,090
want to buy the mine.

859
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,820
Wan Hong can't afford

860
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,340
compensation.

861
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,260
We can take that on too.

862
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,650
Dad!

863
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:46,530
Dad!

864
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,050
Dad!

865
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,010
Dad!

866
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,340
As long as Director Liu

867
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,490
and the leaders of
the Development Zone Managing Committee

868
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,260
can support us,

869
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,300
we're willing to contribute.

870
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,090
You're welcome.

871
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,460
I'm calling the police.

872
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,490
I'm exposing you!

873
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,210
Give me back my phone!

874
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,420
Give it back!

875
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,050
I'm gonna expose you!

876
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,340
I'll make sure you rot in prison
for life!

877
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:27,940
Director Liu,

878
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,780
wasn't it you who brought it up first?

879
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,740
You asked me to

880
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,340
take over the mine

881
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,340
and the new energy project.

882
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,380
That's why I stepped in.

883
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,340
I didn't ask you to
stage a mine accident!

884
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,490
You should thank me.

885
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,380
If I hadn't stepped in,

886
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,380
how would the bank loans
have been repaid?

887
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,130
You killed someone, you know that?

888
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,210
And now you're telling me to back off?
Why?

889
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,010
You're insane!

890
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,980
Why do you think I sold you

891
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,380
the Dadu Xishan house
for half the price?

892
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,570
How did a house worth millions
end up under your name?

893
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,210
This is crime!

894
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,050
You wanna return it?

895
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,010
Absolutely impossible!

896
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,010
And copper and nickel mine.

897
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,460
Are you still human?

898
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,010
Jiang Yuan's behind this...

899
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:49,530
You have no bottom line!

900
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,210
You let him take over!

901
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,460
You're an animal!

902
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,010
I'm an animal!

903
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,610
To you,

904
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,860
to Jiang Yuan and the rest,

905
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,340
I'm an animal!

906
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,050
You used me,

907
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,340
exploited me,

908
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,010
stepped all over me to climb higher.

909
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,090
What do I get?

910
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,300
Nothing at all.

911
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,010
I had to claw my way up.

912
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,210
You left me no choice.

913
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,780
Jiang Yuan.

914
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,340
Yes, sir?

915
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,610
Sit down.

916
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,170
What have you been up to these days?

917
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,780
I told you.

918
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,570
Working on the new energy project.

919
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,340
Where exactly?

920
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,820
That is...

921
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,050
In Dongping, right?

922
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,940
What exactly have you been doing

923
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,490
using my name in Dongping?

924
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,210
Grabbing land? Buying mines?

925
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,820
Even getting into disputes?

926
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,980
Is there such a thing?

927
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,610
You're my son.

928
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,820
What would people think?

929
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,210
Jiang Yuan.

930
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,010
I get that

931
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,260
you want to come back

932
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,460
and make a name for yourself,

933
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,050
but you can't do it under my banner,

934
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,530
especially not where I used to work.

935
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,860
What would people think of you?

936
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,940
Or me?

937
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:40,650
But...

938
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,780
You need to leave Dongping.

939
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,940
I've planned this for three years,

940
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,650
and now you ask me to just leave.

941
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,530
H-How can I?

942
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,210
Three years?

943
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,980
Weren't you studying abroad
three years ago?
