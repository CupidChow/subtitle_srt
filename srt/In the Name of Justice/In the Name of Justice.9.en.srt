1
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,650
What was Qiao Zhenxing
doing on Zhongxing Road?

2
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,220
We haven't found out yet.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,700
Qiao Zhenxing

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,260
drove to the
Forestry Bureau Reservoir alone

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,210
and finished a whole bottle of baijiu.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,050
They said my brother
drank a whole bottle of baijiu.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,690
He didn't drink at all.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,300
How could he go to the Yongqing River

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,850
after drinking a bottle of baijiu?

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,330
That whole area's been
under construction.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,770
The surveillance there
has been down for a long time.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,940
If there's no evidence,
we can investigate.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,690
We can verify it.

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:39,820
If Sun Fei doesn't do it,

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,730
we can take the case back

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,540
and hand it over to the Municipal
Criminal Investigation Detachment.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,330
Worst case,

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,500
hand it over to me.

19
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,050
Right?

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,330
I told you before.

21
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,050
I asked you

22
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,690
for his location records and call logs,

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,650
but you made me stay out of it.

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,130
Qin Feng.

25
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,660
Still working?

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,290
Come to my office now.

27
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,840
[In the Name of Justice]

28
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,840
[Episode 9]

29
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,260
Use your head.

30
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,660
If Wang Yu's problematic,

31
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,850
this whole Wan Hai case falls apart.

32
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,170
You should be clear on that by now.

33
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,980
I'm really sorry,

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,780
Mr. Hong, and Mr. Li.

35
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,610
Some of the department heads

36
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,940
have other meetings to attend soon.

37
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:13,660
Okay.

38
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,730
Fine, I'll let him go.

39
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,010
Li, you have my permission
to go to the meeting.

40
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,290
Be good.

41
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,820
Wait for me outside.

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,890
Oh, okay.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,380
Hong Liang.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,690
This...

45
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,780
This whole speech you just gave…

46
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,130
you're not the only one thinking this way,

47
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,170
right?

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,340
Of the whole Guidance Group,

49
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,780
I'm the actual brain.

50
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,130
Team leader Zheng Yaping

51
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,290
can't even compare with me.

52
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,220
I'm telling you...

53
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,690
Save it. You're the brain?

54
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,260
Do you actually think you can fool me

55
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,010
with that?

56
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,100
We've known each other for years.

57
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,060
Why do you always have to insult me?

58
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,100
Let me make this clear right now.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,290
If your Guidance Group

60
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,690
feels embarrassed
about returning empty-handed

61
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,060
from Zhang Wenjing's case

62
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,010
and wants to fixate on the Wan Hai case,

63
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,980
fine, so be it.

64
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,050
Take it up to the provincial office
and ask Prosecutor Zhang

65
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,780
to send another Guidance Group.

66
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,050
I will cooperate with them,

67
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,900
just like I did with you
on the Zhang Wenjing case.

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,580
Other than that,

69
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,540
do not discuss the Wan Hai case
with me again.

70
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,220
Understand?

71
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,250
You idiot, do you really
not get what I'm saying?

72
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,810
Which part of what I said was wrong?

73
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,100
Think about it.

74
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,140
If it wasn't just my idea,

75
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,540
would we be having this private chat

76
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,580
here in your office?

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,780
I would have

78
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,610
taken you upstairs to meet with

79
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,220
the whole Guidance Group.

80
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,460
Why should I go up there
and talk to them?

81
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:45,980
For God's sake.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,730
Why should you? You don't know?

83
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,610
The Group should come down.

84
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,410
Don't you know exactly why?

85
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,140
The Guidance Group

86
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,220
is here to investigate
the Zhang Wenjing case.

87
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,580
Yeah.

88
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,850
But everything you just went on about...

89
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,580
Zhang Wenjing was only

90
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,540
involved because of the Wan Hai case.

91
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,370
You listen to me now,

92
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:55,980
you are not allowed

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,930
to say another word
about the Wan Hai case.

94
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,540
Can you stop doing

95
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,290
useless, ridiculous nonsense?

96
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,290
Here, my wife gave your wife some tea.

97
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,370
Take it on your way out.

98
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,490
Don't even wanna give it to you.

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,290
Don't try to corrupt me

100
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,250
with your little gifts all the time!

101
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,490
I have professional integrity!

102
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,610
I have a bottom line!

103
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,290
Why hide this better one?

104
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,100
Come in.

105
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,610
Ms. Zheng,

106
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,780
this is Wan Hai's defense lawyer,
Cheng Zijian.

107
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,730
Please take a seat.

108
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,700
Okay.

109
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,660
Mr. Cheng,

110
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,980
let me introduce,

111
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,340
this is...

112
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,170
Nice to meet you, Ms. Zheng.

113
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,850
I met you before
at the commendation meeting

114
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,250
of Haidong Provincial
Political and Legal System.

115
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,810
You were on stage giving a speech.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,980
We were all listening and learning.

117
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,610
You're a nationally recognized
outstanding prosecutor,

118
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,610
one of the top ten
law enforcement officers

119
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,980
in Haidong Province.

120
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,980
A role model for
many young people in our field.

121
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,980
This must be Director Wang Chunxiang.

122
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,980
Many of the cases you have worked on

123
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,460
have been studied over and over
as model examples.

124
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,340
You know us pretty well.

125
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,410
To tell you the truth,

126
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,780
I used to work

127
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,850
in the political and legal system

128
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,340
as a prosecutor.

129
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,340
So I know something about you two.

130
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,100
But I'm not familiar with

131
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,050
this young prosecutor.

132
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,140
I'm Bai Ziyan, Assistant Prosecutor from

133
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,220
First Procuratorial Division of Haidong
Provincial People's Procuratorate.

134
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:33,980
Nice to meet you.

135
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,220
Then let's start.

136
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,050
Ms. Zheng, if there's anything
you need to ask,

137
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,850
go ahead.

138
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,140
I'll tell you everything I know.

139
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,700
Thank you.

140
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,930
Four days after Zhang Wenjing
was officially investigated,

141
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,460
you took over Wan Hai's defense.

142
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,850
And not long after, Wan Hai confessed.

143
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,810
We're curious,

144
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,780
Mr. Cheng,

145
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,100
how did you convince him

146
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,490
to go from resisting

147
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,250
to pleading guilty
and accepting punishment?

148
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,140
Let me ask you,

149
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,340
Am I a gangster?

150
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,220
Are you not?

151
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,610
Whether it is

152
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,340
Provincial Procuratorate
or Municipal Procuratorate,

153
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,370
they're on the same side.

154
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,900
Now, you've been

155
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,900
labeled as the leader
of a criminal organization.

156
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,610
It's a done deal.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,050
Don't get your hopes up.

158
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,780
What hopes do I have?

159
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,460
You know the best.

160
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,780
I just want to serve my sentence earlier

161
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,610
and go home.

162
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,340
Mr. Wang,

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,020
when I took over the case,

164
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,490
Wan Hai had already

165
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,810
decided to plead guilty
and accept punishment.

166
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,810
So that was a coincidence?

167
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,170
You can say that.

168
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,900
But it does make sense.

169
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,140
Imagine that, he's been sitting
in detention for over two years.

170
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,580
His legal awareness
must have improved a lot.

171
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,700
And he's come to terms with it.

172
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,980
Plus, all that shady stuff
of his original lawyer

173
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,100
got dug up by the prosecutors.

174
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,140
There's no point in resisting.

175
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,220
Did you know Wan Hai

176
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,730
before he was arrested?

177
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,490
No.

178
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,580
Have you heard anything about him

179
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,290
or got to know him?

180
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,610
We were total strangers,

181
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,140
how could I get to know him?

182
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,170
Mr. Cheng, do you have a bias

183
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,370
against Wan Hai?

184
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:31,660
Ms. Zheng,

185
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,370
why did you ask that?

186
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,850
You see,

187
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,700
when Zhang Wenjing

188
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,610
was representing Wan Hai,

189
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,220
she argued he was innocent.

190
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,340
But when you took over,

191
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,100
you went straight for a guilty plea.

192
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,890
I want to know why.

193
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,820
Understood.

194
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,250
Ms. Zheng,

195
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,770
I made that decision based on
the chain of evidence

196
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,940
presented by the case-handling organs.

197
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,300
There is no doubt that
Wan Hai was involved in organized crime.

198
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,010
So I can only go with a guilty plea.

199
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,300
I hope he'll plead guilty,
accept punishment,

200
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,610
and get a lighter sentence.

201
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,770
I gave him the tea.

202
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,010
Pretty efficient.

203
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,100
Good job.

204
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,610
Son, time for dinner.

205
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,010
What efficient?

206
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,700
I didn't expect him
to be in my office today,

207
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,610
sleeping.

208
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,530
In your office?

209
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,650
Sleeping?

210
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,130
Like a psycho.

211
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,180
Got pretty aggressive

212
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,460
and ended up arguing with me.

213
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:09,940
What?

214
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,580
For what?

215
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,580
I'm not gonna bore you with the details.

216
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,250
The thing is,

217
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,060
Zhang Wenjing

218
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,420
retracted her confession.

219
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,010
That means
the Guidance Group's job is done.

220
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,850
Shouldn't they pack up and leave?

221
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,820
But they're not going anywhere.

222
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,300
Instead,

223
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,250
now their whole focus

224
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,820
has shifted from
Zhang Wenjing to Wan Hai.

225
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,850
Why?

226
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,250
That's why you argued?

227
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,700
I mean,

228
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,700
aren't you two buddies?

229
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,460
You two are so close.

230
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,580
Didn't he give you any kind of hint?

231
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,460
Hint?

232
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,890
He practically spelled it out today.

233
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,580
Actually, I know exactly

234
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,010
what he meant with every word he said.

235
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,580
But,

236
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,010
why was he doing this?

237
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,940
If you ask me,

238
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,820
you should go talk to him.

239
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,060
He's the deputy leader
of the Guidance Group.

240
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,100
If he knows anything,

241
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,300
he'll tell you.

242
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,890
You eat first.

243
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,340
Are you too embarrassed to ask?

244
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,610
Eat some vegetables.

245
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,580
Hello?

246
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,300
Girl, it's me.

247
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,700
It's been a while. How are you?

248
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,200
[Boss: 6:30 PM, Room 806, Building 1,
Section 3, Dadu Xishan Residence]

249
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,650
Huai'en?

250
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,730
I gotta report to the 'boss' again.

251
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,300
Need me to step out?

252
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,250
Okay.

253
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,480
[Boss]

254
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,370
Good evening, boss.

255
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,850
Appreciate your hard work, boss.

256
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,700
Working late?

257
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,610
Got your message
about the time and place,

258
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,130
but I don't know what it means.

259
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,490
Li Yanxin's engagement party.

260
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,180
Didn't Li Renjun tell you?

261
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,370
Nope.

262
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,420
I heard you two

263
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,250
aren't on good terms because of Qiao.

264
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,300
Who blabbed that?

265
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,300
Who else could it be?

266
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,220
Liu Yun?

267
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,220
Don't tell me you're fine.

268
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,300
She called me directly,

269
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,530
saying I must come with you.

270
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,610
I asked why.

271
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,890
It's because

272
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,420
he and his wife are just so petty.

273
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,730
Okay, enough about this.

274
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,420
Listen,

275
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,180
I'm sure I can't go.

276
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,850
You go on behalf of us.

277
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,370
Boss.

278
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,370
Mind if I

279
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,890
offer another solution?

280
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,420
How about

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,420
you do me a favor

282
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,420
by coming back and going

283
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,130
on behalf of both of us?

284
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,610
Otherwise, it'll be super awkward.

285
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,610
How can I go?

286
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,530
I've got a whole mess
of stuff in Beijing.

287
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,700
The kid's school.

288
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,370
Buying new furniture.

289
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,460
But I don't wanna go.

290
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,730
Then give me a good reason not to.

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,300
I'm the deputy leader
of the Guidance Group.

292
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,580
We have our discipline.

293
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,370
When I went to Qiao's place
to express my condolences,

294
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,940
I got terribly chewed out by my leader.

295
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,610
Do you think I need another reason?

296
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,420
We're both in the system.

297
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,770
Can't we cut each other some slack?

298
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,980
I think your leader was thoughtful.

299
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,340
Look what happened to Qiao now.

300
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,060
You asked me to go to Qiao's house,
didn't you?

301
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,850
And now I'm asking you
to attend the ceremony.

302
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,610
Why won't you do it?

303
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,850
Don't show me that face.

304
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,580
I'm broke, alright?

305
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,610
Last time for that condolence money,

306
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,060
I used my own pocket money.

307
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,010
Now you want me to give ceremony money,

308
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,340
I still have to use my pocket money.

309
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,340
How am I supposed to live?

310
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,700
Have you thought about that?

311
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,850
How exactly am I
supposed to live? Tell me.

312
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,220
How do I survive here alone in Dongping?

313
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,490
That's a lot, 1,888 yuan.

314
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,460
This money is for Li Yanxin.

315
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,420
Make sure she gets it.

316
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,180
Don't go changing it to 1,666 yuan.

317
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,980
Like I'd steal that 222 from you.

318
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,890
Save it.

319
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,650
I already promised them.

320
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,420
You have to go.

321
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,300
Okay, I'm hanging up.

322
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,320
[10th March
Day 12 Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

323
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,200
[10th March
Day 13 Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

324
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,980
Mr. Liu.

325
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,650
This is Youcai.

326
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,650
I've been calling you.

327
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,530
When you see this,

328
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,420
just give me a reply,

329
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,340
Anytime's fine.

330
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:31,850
Youcai.

331
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,180
Hong.

332
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,820
Youcai!

333
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,370
Youcai, don't run.

334
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,650
Why are you running?

335
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,010
It's been over two years.

336
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,820
How many times have I chased you down?

337
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,770
Hong.

338
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,180
What?

339
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,220
You gonna avoid me forever?

340
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,100
It was Wang Yu

341
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,650
who reported you guys.

342
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,010
If you hadn't helped him,

343
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,250
Wang Yu alone couldn't
have pulled this off.

344
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,130
Could he?

345
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,060
I just want to know why.

346
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,100
What did Wang Yu offer you

347
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,100
to make you do something so heartless?

348
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,220
I can understand if it's anyone else.

349
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,580
But I can never figure out
why you did that!

350
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,060
We were brothers who grew up together!

351
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,460
How can you do this to me?

352
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,530
Hong,

353
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,100
listen to me,

354
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,060
get out of here, now.

355
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,250
If Wang Yu knows you're here,

356
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,980
we're all gonna die.

357
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,860
He's a completely different person now.

358
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,330
Come on.

359
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,700
Don't you want me dead?

360
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,490
Let me see how my brother
helps outsiders kill me.

361
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,220
I was blind!

362
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,420
I befriended a traitor!
I deserved it!

363
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:21,900
Hong...

364
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,660
Don't do this, please.

365
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,810
Hong,

366
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,570
I know.

367
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,330
It's my fault.

368
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,050
I regret it very much.

369
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,530
I'm sorry, Hong.

370
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,090
Youcai,

371
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,660
I didn't come here today

372
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,810
to hear you say sorry.

373
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,180
We've been friends for decades,

374
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,090

375

help my family.

376
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,570
Hong,

377
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,460
as long as you get out of here now,

378
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,460
I'll do whatever I can

379
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,460
to help you.

380

Help me move the goods.

382
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,860
You know that

383
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,380
Wang Yu's got me completely stuck.

384
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,180
If I can't ship the ore,

385
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,090
I can't get the money, and I'm dead.

386
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,730
If you help me move this shipment,
I can survive.

387
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,330
Youcai,

388
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,140
my life's in your hands now.

389
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,810
Help me.

390
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,770
Help me.

391
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,700
Don't push me, Hong.

392
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,570
Youcai.

393
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,090
Are you just gonna watch me die?

394
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,980
You want me to get on my knees?

395
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,220
Hong.

396
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,380
Hong.

397
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,980
Wang Yu, he'll kill me.

398
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,460
Forget I was even here.

399
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,420

400
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,700

This is the bar.

405
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,620
I like that terrace.

406

It's huge.

407

You can barbecue there in summer.

408
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,770

Okay, after you.

Hong Liang is here.

428

My dear sister!

439
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,660
Look at you.

440
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,570
Where have you been?

441
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,730
You never came to visit me.

442
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,620
I was making space for you,

443
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,620
so you could date.

444
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,700
Let me finish my task first.

445
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,700
From me and Min, with love.

446
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,940
Thank you, Liang.

447
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,570
Now,

448
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,530
time for a proper introduction.

Come here.

452
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,010
I thought he was a random guy
showing me the way.

453
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,700
Hello, Liang.

454
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,700
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

455
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,050
So handsome.

456
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,330
Not bad.

457
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,900
Of course.

458
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,570
Perfect match.

459
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,220
I have a good taste.

460
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,900

467
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,900

00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,220
Yes…

470
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,700
He doesn't happen to be a lawyer,
does he?

471
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,770
Yes, he does.

472
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,940
The lawyer on the Wan Hai case.

473
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,570
Right, that's my job.

474
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,330
Good.

475
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,980
Don't just stand there. Let's go inside.

476
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,570
Yes, come on.

477
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,420
Let me show you my new home.

478
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,380
It occurs to me

479
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,330
that I have a last-minute meeting at work.

480
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,620
But you just arrived.

481
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,660
Because I just remembered.

482
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,460
Let me make a call.

483
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,380
- Hang on.
- You...

484
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,460
You can't just leave.

485
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,490
Hong Liang.

486
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,180
Ms. Lan.

487
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,250
It's been quite a while…

488
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,140
Gotta meet like this,

489
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,330
talking shop in
someone else's place.

490
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,730
Sorry, my bad.

491
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,380
My bad.

492
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,140
No, don't say that.

493
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,490
Neither of us is at fault.

494
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,380
It's just discipline,

495
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,010
right?

496
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,770
How's your health?

497
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,250
Good.

498
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,090
How is your father?

499
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:28,810
Very good.

500
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,570
He talks about Dongping
and you all the time.

501
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,730
Great...

502
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,700
Dear,

503
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,250
1,888 yuan, exactly.

504
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,220
Alright, everyone's here. Let's start.

505
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,290
We're heading in.

506
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,530
Well…

507
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,250
What's the opinion

508
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,090
of the Guidance Group
about the Qiao Zhenxing case?

509
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,140
Very shocked.

510
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,620
Extremely heartbroken.

511
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,860
I feel the same way.

512
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,330
I remember when the three of you
first joined the office,

513
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,330
everyone was excited.

514
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,460
Looking at you guys,

515
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,730
I thought,

516
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,700
"They are the future
of Dongping procuratorate."

517
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,810
Qiao was a model worker for years.

518
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,620
How did it come to this?

519
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,860
Seeing him go down for a crime,

520
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,220
honestly,

521
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,620
I felt guilty.

522
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,530
I started wondering

523
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,620
whether we have underpaid

524
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,090
our prosecutors.

525
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,050
If he'd had enough money

526
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,050
to send his kid abroad,

527
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,220
maybe he wouldn't have caved
to Wan Hai's temptation.

528
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,980
So I'm thinking that

529
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,900
we must improve benefits

530
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,900
for our prosecutors.

531
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,810
Load it!

532
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,420
Fill it to the brim! More!

533
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:02,860
Chao.

534
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,180
Listen to the walkie.
I'm coordinating this.

535
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,290
How's it going? Is it full yet?

536
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,810
Yes!

537
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,250
Keep loading.

538
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:07,940
Fill every inch.

539
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,980
As much as possible.

540
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,570
Okay.

541
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,530
Once it's full, we move out.

542
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,380
Make sure everything's checked.

543
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,420
No blowouts this time.

544
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:12,770
Hong!

545
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,730
We blew a tire last time.

546
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,380
Hong.

547
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,380
Hong.

548
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,700
I've checked everything.

549
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,050
It's rock solid this time.

550
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,530
Youcai.

551
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,330
No more words.

552
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,420
I feel it all.

553
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,380
Thank you.

554
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,250
Hong.

555
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,940
Don't say that.

556
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,730
I'm just doing what I should do.

557
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,620
Chen Youcai.

558
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,330
What are you doing?

559
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,730
Thank him for what?

560
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,490
If it weren't for him,

561
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,140
would our family have been like this?

562
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,290
By that logic, maybe I should thank you.

563
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,050
Chao,

564

00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,640
[Hong Liang]

754
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,490
Come in.

755
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,140
Mr. Xu.

756
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,140
Here are Qiao Zhenxing's
location records you asked for.

757
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,940
Do you need anything else?

758
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:46,700
That'll be all.

759
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:09,690
Qin Feng.

760
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,170
Still working?

761
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:12,820
Come to my office now.

762
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,460
A fair lady makes
a fine match for a gentleman.

763
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,380
Let's raise a glass to the newlyweds.

764
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,010
Come on!

765
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,940
Thank you, Auntie.

766
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,610
Best wishes to you both.

767
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,530
Thank you, Ms. Lan.

768
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,170
Wish you a long and happy life together.

769
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,690
- Hope you have kids soon.
- Thank you, brother.

770
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,610
Liang.

771
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,210
Congratulations…

772
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,090
Ms. Lan.

773
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,210
Come on, sit down.

774
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,130
Right, hurry.

775
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,610
Help yourselves.

776
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,780
The food's gone cold.

777
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,090
Come on.

778
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,210
What? Got something to say?

779
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,380
I actually need to ask for leave.

780
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,490
Our team leader

781
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,260
just sent me a lot of messages

782
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,460
saying there's a meeting tonight.

783
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,650
I have to be there.

784
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,940
It won't look good if I don't show up.

785
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,690
Then go.

786
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,130
Right?

787
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,090
Thanks a ton.

788
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,050
Thank you…

789
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,420
Then...

790
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,900
Thank you.

791
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,860
Well then,

792
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,780
be a good bridge among departments

793
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,980
and coordinate things as much as you can.

794
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,420
Help Renjun make the Wan Hai case
a great one.

795
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,460
I'll leave you to it then.

796
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,340
Auntie, I'll walk him out.

797
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:20,860
It's okay.

798
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,090
Put on your clothes. Don't catch a cold.

799
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,210
Sorry about this, really.

800
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,940
You guys carry on.

801
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,690
You wanted to see me?

802
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,490
Qin Feng, come here.

803
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,380
Have a seat.

804
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,570
Sit.

805
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,490
How did things go with

806
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,260
comforting Zhou Mei?

807
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,050
She signed it.

808
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,860
She really didn't have a choice.

809
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,940
You didn't see

810
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,530
their condition then.

811
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,130
Mei, Ran...

812
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,090
They completely broke down.

813
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:57,690
Mr. Xu.

814
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,460
Is this case really over?

815
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,900
Is that really how they're
gonna label my brother?

816
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,610
Qin Feng,

817
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,050
you're doing it again.

818
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,690
We talked about this.

819
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,130
First and foremost, you're
a policeman.

820
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,650
Focus on your job.

821
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,380
I need to use the restroom.

822
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,090
You have a look at this document.

823
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,820
Alright, bye now. It's freezing.

824
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,380
I'm heading back in.

825
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,650
What is it?

826
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,460
Why are you being all secretive?

827
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,420
Your brother-in-law

828
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,490
is Wan Hai's defense lawyer.

829
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,050
The Guidance Group
didn't know about this?

830
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,780
Looks like I may need to

831
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,780
have a word with Ms. Zheng.

832
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,420
That's some sloppy work.

833
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,380
How long have they been together?

834
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,740
About three years now.

835
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,130
That was before
the Wan Hai case even existed.

836
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,050
Of course.

837
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,460
Three years ago, I was on assignment
at Heyuan County Procuratorate.

838
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,170
Cheng Zijian was a prosecutor there.

839
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,780
But then he left.

840
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,460
I was kind of his superior.

841
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,530
I knew a thing or two about him.

842
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,570
Hardworking,

843
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,300
responsible, a pretty nice guy.

844
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,860
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

845
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,300
introduced him to my own sister.

846
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,090
You set them up?

847
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,260
Problem?

848
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,380
A huge problem.

849
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,170
What is it?

850
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,490
Your office is handling
the Wan Hai case now,

851
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,090
so you gave him

852
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,690
the job as Wan Hai's defense lawyer?

853
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,980
Hong Liang, are you delusional?

854
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,010
When did I ever say

855
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,530
I gave him that job?

856
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,940
What does that have to do with me?

857
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,050
Cheng Zijian is

858
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,340
one of the top lawyers in Dongping now.

859
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,780
The Wan Hai case is huge.

860
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,380
He wanted the best lawyer.

861
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,820
Was that wrong?

862
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,650
Was there a problem?

863
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,380
Wasn't that totally reasonable?

864
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,530
Hong Liang, is this your
professional reflex

865
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,260
acting up again?

866
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,380
Weren't you in a hurry
to leave for a meeting?

867
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,010
Congratulations.

868
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,340
You passed your loyalty test
from the organization.

869
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,650
That was a bad joke.

870
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,090
It was not funny at all.

871
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,520
[Qin Feng: I got the location records.
Can you come with me tomorrow?]

872
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:10,860
Bro,

873
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,820
I got the location records!

874
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,740
Can you come with me tomorrow?

875
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,080
[Chen Shenglong
CEO of Tianlong Group]

876
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,050
Long,

877
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,420
you can come in now.

878
00:39:59,440 --> 00:39:59,980
Li Yanxin.

879
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,260
Come here, I've got something
to ask you.

880
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,130
Wait a minute, let me finish
the fruit plate.

881
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,650
Just drop it, come on.

882
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,050
I'm coming.

883
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,090
What's so urgent?

884
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,170
A big one for you.

885
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,860
I've been meaning to ask you

886
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,690
but couldn't find the right moment.

887
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:23,900
Go ahead.

888
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,340
I mean,

889
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,900
this place is huge.

890
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,460
With your and Zijian's salaries,

891
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,010
the mortgage must last a lifetime, huh?

892
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,900
Yeah, well...

893
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,340
These days girls have wedding demands.

894
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,420
But shouldn't we keep it reasonable?

895
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,980
This house is too expensive.

896
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,570
When I married your sister-in-law,

897
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,860
she didn't ask for anything.

898
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,980
And we've been doing fine

899
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,740
for the past ten years.

900
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,210
Wait a second.

901
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,090
What do you mean?

902
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,940
Do you think

903
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,650
I asked for this house?

904
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,210
Didn't you?

905
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,300
So this is what you think of
your sister, Li Renjun?

906
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,690
This is who I am in your eyes?

907
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,530
I'm just trying to
understand the situation.

908
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,420
I just wanted to know what's going on.

909
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,740
Keep your voice down.

910
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,780
The kid just fell asleep.

911
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,210
What's wrong with you two?

912
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,170
What's wrong?

913
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,530
Just trying to understand the situation.

914
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,940
Your husband is criticizing me.

915
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,900
No, that's not what I meant.

916
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,300
Do you know what today is?

917
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,650
Why can't you say something nice?

918
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,860
I didn't say anything.

919
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:20,900
Didn't you?

920
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,420
Didn't you say I was materialistic?

921
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,050
When did I say that?

922
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,460
That's what you meant.

923
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,260
Tell me, I'll have your back.

924
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,650
I know you mean well to me.

925
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,530
Zijian and I

926
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,900
talked

927
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,740
about the house.

928
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,860
We knew it's too big and nice.

929
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,300
Like you said,

930
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,570
I can't afford it at all with my salary.

931
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,460
But Zijian is good to me.

932
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,530
He wants to give me a better life.

933
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,940
Besides, we didn't actually
buy this house.

934
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,490
It was a gift from Long
as an employee benefit.

935
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,940
A gift?

936
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,740
You didn't pay?

937
00:41:59,400 --> 00:41:59,780
No.

938
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,260
Long.

939
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,210
Zijian has done a lot for Long

940
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,130
over the years at Tianlong Group,

941
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,570
recovering a bunch of debts.

942
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,420
Now he's a golden boy in Tianlong Group.

943
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,460
Besides, this whole complex
is owned by Tianlong Group.

944
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,170
So, of course we get first dibs.

945
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,050
It kinda makes sense.

946
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,900
And I heard that this property

947
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,130
is the hottest in Dongping right now.

948
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,340
People are scrambling to buy in.

949
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,530
As her brother, you should be
happy for her.

950
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,980
Besides, with such a big place,

951
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,380
you and Zijian can have a bunch of kids

952
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,260
to fill the rooms.

953
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,170
Oh, right,

954
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,940
Qiqi's starting middle school soon, right?

955
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,860
The best school in the city
is right outside the gate.

956
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,460
Then,

957
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,460
you can move Qiqi's
household registration here.

958
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,900
Don't worry, Zijian won't say no.

959
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:04,690
Am I right?

960
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,380
Yanxin.

961
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,420
Long.

962
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:11,010
Long, welcome.

963
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,210
Happy for you guys.

964
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:12,740
Thank you.

965
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,130
Sorry, I'm late.

966
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,900
We rushed over here.

967
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,170
Chen Shenglong, CEO of Tianlong Group.

968
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,820
This is my brother-in-law, Li Renjun.

969
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:19,900
Mr. Li.

970
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,260
I heard a lot about you.

971
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,260
Nice to meet you.

972
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,740
This is my sister-in-law, Liu Yun.

973
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,380
Director Liu.

974
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,050
We finally met.

975
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:26,940
Hello.

976
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,130
You,

977
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,170
beautiful bride.

978
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:31,210
Take this red envelope.

979
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,740
-Thank you, Long.
- Li Yanxin.

980
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,860
He already gave you

981
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,260
this big house as a wedding gift,

982
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,130
Isn't that enough?

983
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,210
Separate matters.

984
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:37,940
Take a seat, Long.

985
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,300
Take a seat.

986
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:45,900
Mr. Chen,

987
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,530
we truly appreciate your kindness,

988
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,610
but isn't this house

989
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,650
too extravagant a gift?

990
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,530
Not at all.

991
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,130
Here's the thing.

992
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,530
Zijian is a real talent.

993
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:56,860
Since he joined,

994
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,820
Tianlong Group has been thriving

995
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,650
year after year.

996
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,980
Talented people are rare these days.

997
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,780
To keep someone like him,

998
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:04,860
I have to say,

999
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:06,570
