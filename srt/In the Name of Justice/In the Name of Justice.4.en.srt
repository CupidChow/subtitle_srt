and the spot where he fell into the water.

It's the best way

8
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,740
to prove he drowned

9
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,490

even Liu Yun

58
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,250
guessed as much.

59
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,340
You think the rest of us haven't?

60
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,250
Level with me:

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,850
does the province have evidence

62
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,220
of duty crimes on someone

63
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,930
in our city procuratorate

64
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,340
or Dongping's justice system?

65
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,170
Got any leads?

66
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,660
Hand them to me.

67
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,810
Once I'm back at the provincial office,

68
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,050
I'll brief the higher-ups.

69
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,410
After that,
the follow-up isn't my concern,

70
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,460
but filing that report
still earns me credit.

71
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,460
That way, when I hang up this uniform,
it'll be with honor.

72
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,730
It'll pave the way for my next job.

00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,050
If I had leads

74
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,490
I wouldn't be asking.

75
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,730
You province people

76
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,580
must have something.

77
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,460
I know nothing.

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,980

No.

80
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:12,730
Look,

81
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,290
as a leader,

82
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,900
and you've never been one, of course,

83
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,370
you don't see it from this angle,

84
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,700
so let me break it down:

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,580
let's say

86
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,610
one of the county procuratorates

87
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:26,930
under Dongping

88
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,460
is suspected of a duty-related crime.

89
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,730
If that comes to our attention

90
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,290
and there are other issues, too,

91
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,410
then when we send in a guidance team,

92
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,980
we'll be sure

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,540
to include investigators
who specialize in duty crimes.

94
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,020
Your team is no different.

95
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,170
Five people,

96
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,610
two from the Eleventh Division,

97
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,370
right?

98
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,100
Pretty obvious what Prosecutor Zhang

99
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,370
is thinking.

100
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,900
Li Renjun,

101
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,930
that's enlightening.

102
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,250
Could it be

103
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,220
that while

104
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,220
we're investigating Zhang Wenjing,

105
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,410
the real target

106
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,340
is someone inside the guidance group?

107
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,780
Suppose

108
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,020
our leader

109
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,410
Zheng Yaping.

110
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:22,780
What if

111
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,930
they've sent me

112
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,850
to dig up dirt on her?

113
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,580
Could it be possible?

114
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,290
Doesn't add up.

115
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,540
If that were the case,

116
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,340
it should be the other way around.

117
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,370
You'd be the leader
and she'd be the deputy.

118
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,700
Wrong way round.

119
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,100
With her as leader

120
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,170
she does the talking,

121
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,660
takes the action,

122
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,460
shows her hand;

123
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,220
I'm just the deputy,

124
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,170
standing by,

125
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,410
observing,

126
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,660
taking notes, and reporting.

127
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,140
Hong Liang,

128
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,810
stop with that

129
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,540
spooky nonsense.

130
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,410
Are you seriously feeding me this crap?

131
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,490
Now, eat your food.

132
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,780
First a toast,

133
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,700
to Qiao.

134
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,290
Well,

135
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,340
I'm on duty

136
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,250
so I can't drink,

137
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,410
and Qiao never drank either.

138
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,340
He'd be having water.

139
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,930
To Qiao.

140
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,730
Hey…

141
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,410
Are you crazy, pouring it on the floor?

142
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,250
Aren't we toasting Qiao?

143
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,900
And that means dumping it out?

144
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,250
Well, I…

145
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,580
Do you do this at home?

146
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,850
Doesn't your wife smack you?

147
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,890
Now I'll be facing
domestic violence again.

148
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,850
She'll think I wasted it.

149
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,650
Look,

150
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,980
that acting title of yours,

151
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,650
when did it start,

152
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,370
and how long's it been?

153
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,340
Since the Wan Hai case.

154
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,060
Over two years.

155
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:49,730
Really?

156
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,770
Two years of acting
and still not confirmed? Rough.

157
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,250
Can you keep it upbeat
at the dinner table?

158
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,460
Speaking of which,

159
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,010
when you get home, ask your father-in-law

160
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,220
to sound things out for me.

161
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,130
Find out

162
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,820
when they'll finally
drop the word "acting".

163
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,300
But don't say the question came from me.

164
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,100
You just

165
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,980
tell him

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,300
you were curious, that's all.

167
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,580
I'm not curious.

168
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,650
Be curious for once.

169
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,940
When did you get so power-hungry?

170
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,180
Hungry or not,

171
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,300
the job needs doing.

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,530
Do you know

173
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,460
what "acting" means?

174
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,730
"Acting" makes everyone jittery.

175
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,850
No one knows

176
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,060
if HQ will

177
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,580
parachute someone in.

178
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,820
That complicates everything,

179
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:42,650
got it?

180
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,010
If you want simple,

181
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,820
even simpler,

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,300
don't just drop "acting",

183
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,730
drop the "chief prosecutor" title
while you're at it.

184
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,010
Problem solved.

185
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,130
Great.

186
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,100
Then you and I

187
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,820
can take the kid to school in Beijing,
hand in hand.

188
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,130
Is that it?

189
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,820
In two years of Acting Li,

190
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,250
Zhang Wenjing shouted injustice in court

191
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,820
and Qiao died.

192
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,770
Neither is trivial.

193
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,220
You still think you'll be confirmed?

194
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,700
Where's that confidence come from?

195
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,250
Deputy Leader Hong,

196
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,850
your team

197
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,580
will nail down

198
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,530
Zhang Wenjing's disruption in days.

199
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,490
And Qiao.

200
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,100
What's that got to do with me?

201
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,420
Did I kill him?

202
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,700
What matters is that

203
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,610
in two-plus years
I turned the Wan Hai case

204
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,890
into an ironclad conviction.

205
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,770
That's my confidence.

206
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,580
You understand?

207
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,730
Hong,

208
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,940
quit hiding.

209
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,730
I'm no longer curious

210
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,530
why you're here,

211
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,250
but you have my words:

212
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,180
whoever you're investigating,

213
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,530
however you do it,

214
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,220
I'll back you fully.

215
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,340
Provided

216
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,770
you keep me in the loop.

217
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,440
[March 2
Day 4 Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

218
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,280
[March 2
Day 5 Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

219
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,890
Everyone done eating?

220
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,850
Listen to me,

221
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,340
everyone,

222
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,220
my dad's always treated you well.

223
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,850
Help me this time

224
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,100
and get him out,

225
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,100
and I guarantee

226
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,700
he'll give

227
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,130
everyone a raise.

228
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,940
When we reach the hotel entrance,

229
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,010
shout at the top of your lungs

230
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,460
and drag those provincial officials out.

231
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,420
That might be our only shot.

232
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,220
We'll rehearse here.

233
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,730
Just two lines.

234
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:13,980
First:

235
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,010
Wan Hai isn't a gangster!

236
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,820
Wan Hai isn't a gangster!

237
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,490
Second:

238
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,460
The Wan family's been framed!

239
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,130
The Wan family's been framed!

240
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,610
Wan Hai isn't a gangster!

241
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,060
Wan Hai isn't a gangster!

242
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,370
The Wan family's been framed!

243
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,850
The Wan family's been framed!

244
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,100
What are you looking at?

245
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,770
Let's go!

246
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,530
Drive.

247
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,580
Boss,

248
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,060
that kid from the Wan family
has rounded up a crowd

249
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,650
to complain to the guidance group.

250
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,300
Chang Sheng!

251
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,980
Chang Sheng!

252
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,460
Chang Sheng!

253
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,700
Chang Sheng!

254
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,300
Chang…

255
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,940
Anyone seen him?

256
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,010
Chang Sheng!

257
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,250
Mr. Wang.

258
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,100
Manager Chang went that way.

259
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,940
Over there.

260
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,890
- That way?
- Yes.

261
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,650
Chang Sheng!

262
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,940
One last time:
have you got the money or not?

263
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,460
What are you doing here?

264
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,650
Why aren't you answering your phone?

265
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,770
- Mr. Wang…
- Why?

266
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,370
Why aren't you answering your phone?

267
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,460
Sorry, Mr. Wang.

268
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,420
Please don't get mad.

269
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,940
I forgot it was in my pocket.

270
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,130
Wan Chao left the mine

271
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,370
with a bunch of men
and went to Dongping Hotel.

272
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,610
Take more guys,

273
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,850
intercept them on the way.

274
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,980
If not,

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,180
block the hotel entrance.

276
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,850
The rule is simple:

277
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,010
don't let him meet the guidance group.

278
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,820
Got it?

279
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,980
Move!

280
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,940
Get your coat.

281
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,220
Go!

282
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,580
Quick!

283
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,340
What is this,

284
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,130
a mafia hit? Murder and arson?

285
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,820
Lift him up.

286
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,250
What have you done?

287
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,300
Owes money.

288
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,650
Owes money.

289
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,370
What?

290
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,490
Then tie him down.

291
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,180
No!

292
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,100
Somebody help!

293
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,340
Wan Hai isn't a gangster!

294
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,340
Louder! Again!

295
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,580
Wan Hai isn't a gangster!

296
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,530
Wan Hai isn't a gangster!

297
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,940
Wan Hai isn't a gangster!

298
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,530
Wan Hai isn't a gangster!

299
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,180
Quiet!

300
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,980
Stop shouting!

301
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,420
Wan Hai isn't a gangster!

302
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,060
Shut up!

303
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,820
Chang Sheng,

304
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,060
what are you…?

305
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,770
What's going on?

306
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,580
Stay still.

307
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,130
Come on!

308
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,850
Stop! Please stop!

309
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,250
Wan Hai isn't a gangster!

310
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,180
Stop saying that!

311
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,820
Shut it!

312
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:42,890
Ms. Zheng,

313
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,610
do you hear that?

314
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,300
Sure is noisy.

315
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,890
Can't see anything from the window.

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,340
Let's go take a look.

317
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,850
Drag them away.

318
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,420
Move!

319
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,490
No funny moves!

320
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,850
Wan Hai's innocent!

321
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,700
Chang Sheng!

322
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,300
Wan Hai's innocent!

323
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,180
Haul all of them out.

324
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,490
Hands off!

325
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,890
Clean this up, now!

326
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,010
- Wan Hai's innocent!
- Move it!

327
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,180
Come on!

328
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,610
Hurry!

329
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,370
Let's go!

330
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,490
They're here.

331
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,580
Wan Hong,

332
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,250
keep your brat in line.

333
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,850
If he shows up again I'll break his legs,

334
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,770
got it?

335
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,850
Chang Sheng,

336
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,250
you scum.

337
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,460
Come down here

338
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,300
and fight me one-on-one
if you've got the guts!

339
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,250
Chang Sheng!

340
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,250
Go home. Quit making trouble.

341
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,340
One-on-one, coward!

342
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,700
Ms. Zheng,

343
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,460
Mr. Wang is already waiting downstairs.

344
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,180
Looks like we need to head down
five minutes earlier.

345
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:57,850
Morning.

346
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,370
Morning.

347
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,220
Hand that to me.

348
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:21,940
Ms. Zheng,

349
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,100
I'm sorry.

350
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,650
Last night,

351
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,250
I forgot to notify
Mr. Hong and the others.

352
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,650
The thing is,

353
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,180
the detention center's
interview room is tiny,

354
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,300
and people from the municipal office
will be there too.

355
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,580
If we all go,

356
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,700
it'll be packed and we might not get in.

357
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,220
Right.

358
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,730
So when I filed the notice yesterday,

359
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,420
I only registered
three of us from Division One.

360
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,340
Good call.

361
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:44,980
Sorry.

362
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,700
It's fine.

363
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,820
Mr. Hong, my apologies.

364
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,730
No worries, it's fine.

365
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,700
Good luck.

366
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,290
Yes, the file's already with Division Two.

367
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,090
It won't move that fast.

368
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,290
We're short-staffed.

369
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,660
They're here.

370
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,860
Okay, that's settled.

371
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,290
Ms. Zheng, thanks for the hard work.

372
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:17,860
Mr. Xie.

373
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,700
Thanks, Bai.

374
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,140
Mr. Li,

375
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,220
sorry to trouble you.

376
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,250
So busy and still making the trip.

377
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,380
No trouble.

378
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,290
Working with the guidance group

379
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,290
is a top priority.

380
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,220
If I really can't come,

381
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,940
Mr. Xie will handle everything.

382
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,530
Absolutely.

383
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,570
Ms. Zheng, just say the word.

384
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,010
All right, let's head in.

385
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,730
The paperwork's done.

386
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,250
By the way, Mr. Li,

387
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,420
since we're here

388
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,530
we'd like to see Wan Hai as well.

389
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,490
Is that possible?

390
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,530
The chief prosecutor's here.

391
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,940
Should be fine.

392
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,660
Go apply and see.

393
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,660
Okay, I'll try.

394
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,570
Come on, inside first.

395
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,010
Maybe

396
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,530
we should ask
the Dongping detention center too,

397
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,420
file a request,

398
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,420
or you could just have a word with Mr. Li

399
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,660
and we could tag along.

400
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,010
If we leave now

401
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,700
we might still catch up with Ms. Zheng.

402
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,380
"Huh" what?

403
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,730
Mr. Hong, are you cold or something…?

404
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:48,980
Sorry, I didn't mean to lose my temper.

405
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,420
I'm saying

406
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,420
we really ought to go take a look today.

407
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,220
They don't

408
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,050
want us there.

409
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,570
Haven't you figured that out?

410
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,660
Fine.

411
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,660
Then why are we even here?

412
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,090
Leadership told us

413
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,810
to come

414
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,290
and observe.

415
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,980
Observe?

416
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,730
You're glued to your phone.

417
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,490
Sure, it's got GPS

418
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,570
and navigation.

419
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,330
It can show you
where the detention center is.

420
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,460
It can also show me

421
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,940
the nearest ATM.

422
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,420
Come on,

423
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,770
why hunt for an ATM

424
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,050
instead of checking the detention center?

425
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,940
You're right,

426
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,250
you're right.

427
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:32,770
You,

428
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,180
do me a favor.

429
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,900
From here,

430
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,330
should I turn left or right?

431
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,730
Which way?

432
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:41,810
Left.

433
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,490
Left it is.

434
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,490
I…

435
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,380
I'll grab some cash.

436
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,180
Coming?

437
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,220
If not, I'll go first.

438
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,220
Come in, please.

439
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,090
Come in.

440
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,250
Ms. Zheng, Mr. Wang,

441
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,620
take a seat.

442
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,380
No,

443
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,050
Mr. Xie is the lead prosecutor.

444
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,700
We're just here to learn the situation,

445
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,940
so he should take the chair.

446
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,860
Please, you're the

447
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,380
senior leaders

448
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,530
and far more experienced.

449
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,530
We can

450
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,730
question Zhang Wenjing at any time.

451
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,860
Why don't you take a seat?

452
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,490
Mr. Xie,

453
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,490
really.

454
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,220
Joint investigation. Have a seat.

455
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,980
All right.

456
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,490
Let's start.

457
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,050
Right.

458
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,530
Zhang Wenjing,

459
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,980
I'm Zheng Yaping
from the Haidong Provincial

460
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,220
Procuratorate's First Division.

461
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,250
With me

462
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,180
are Wang Chunxiang and Bai Ziyan.

463
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,570
Your conduct in court

464
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,700
and the issues you raised

465
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,380
have drawn close attention.

466
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,460
A guidance team

467
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,770
is now working with Dongping prosecutors

468
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,010
to verify the facts.

469
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,250
Use this chance

470
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,490
to speak truthfully.

471
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,290
Zhang Wenjing!

472
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,570
Tell them to leave.

473
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,660
I'll only talk to the guidance group.

474
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,140
What's that supposed to mean?

475
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,290
I request the Dongping personnel
recuse themselves.

476
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,010
I'll only answer to the guidance team.

477
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,250
We're a guidance team,
not a prosecution unit.

478
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,490
As a lawyer,

479
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,420
you should know that.

480
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,810
We're here to advise.

481
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,570
The city office still runs the case.

482
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,980
This is joint work,

483
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,010
not a takeover.

484
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,570
So,

485
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,330
let's talk.

486
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,330
Talk about what?

487
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,330
How do you reason

488
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,460
with people who ignore the law?

489
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,420
Zhang Wenjing,

490
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,380
your arrogance is astounding.

491
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,140
Yelling in court

492
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,220
won't let you

493
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,660
dodge justice.

494
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,900
As to your crimes,

495
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,010
we've already nailed down every detail.

496
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,090
Even without your plea agreement,

497
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,770
the evidence we've got is enough

498
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,570
to convict

499
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,620
and sentence you…

500
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,620
My single condition

501
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,460
is that they leave.

502
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,570
Otherwise, there's nothing to discuss.

503
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,420
Zhang Wenjing,

504
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,770
you're just stalling on purpose.

505
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,860
You're a lawyer,

506
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,380
an intellectual.

507
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,900
How is this childish obstruction

508
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,490
meaningful?

509
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,770
I'm telling you,

510
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,380
testimony and exhibits are solid.

511
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,180
Every charge sticks.

512
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,010
Listen up:

513
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,860
as a core gang member,

514
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,180
you colluded with Wan Hai,

515
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,530
using organized violence, threats,

516
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,810
and market bullying to force sales.

517
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,010
Can Chen Youcai's statement
even be relied on?

518
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,460
Did you vet it?

519
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,660
A witness with direct interests
is hardly credible.

520
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,380
Do I need to teach you Evidence 101?

521
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,050
Shouting won't help.

522
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,770
By your logic,

523
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,250
the dozen witnesses from the freight hub,

524
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,570
people who gave sworn statements,

525
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,570
are they disqualified, too?

526
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,140
And the traders
who do business with the Wans,

527
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,180
are they disqualified as well?

528
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,290
- Don't assume that because you know…
- Zhang Wenjing.

529
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,050
If you question evidence,

530
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,730
file to suppress it

531
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,050
before trial.

532
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,180
Why sign

533
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,730
a plea deal,

534
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,810
then risk contempt

535
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,900
by recanting in court?

536
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,180
When was I given any platform?

537
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,900
I never had any chance to speak out.

538
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,980
All I want is to lay out the facts.

539
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,940
Without a hearing,

540
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,180
my side would never be heard.

541
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,050
The longer they drag this out,

542
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,570
the more time they have

543
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,770
to forge evidence

544
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,330
and fabricate documents.

545
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,250
Shut up.

546
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,980
Who fabricated documents?

547
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,090
Who forged evidence?

548
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,860
Spell it out.

549
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,810
Dare you to let an independent lab
examine the files?

550
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,010
That is blatant slander!

551
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,980
Pure defamation.

552
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,460
Mr. Xie.

553
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,860
Mr. Li.

554
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,250
Mr. Xie.

555
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,290
I can't swallow this.

556
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,330
I've got to set her straight.

557
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,490
You'd better spell it out for me.

558
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,420
Do you have any evidence?

559
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,180
If so, show it right now.

560
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,460
Mr. Xie!

561
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,770
She recanted in open court.

562
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,490
Why?

563
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,180
Only to milk sympathy.

564
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,770
She's not fit to be a lawyer.

565
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,090
This is driving me mad!

566
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,180
How could she pull a stunt like that?

567
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,290
She doesn't even have basic ethics.

568
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,050
Apologies, Ms. Zheng.

569
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,180
Zhang Wenjing,

570
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,010
do you realize
how much effort we've poured in,

571
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,460
how many hours we've spent,

572
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,460
trying to talk you around?

573
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,010
I think you know that better than anyone.

574
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,460
Haven't we looked at this from your side,

575
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,460
considered how the sentence
might be lighter,

576
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,180
and made every allowance?

577
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,460
You know we did, right?

578
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,620
You signed the plea,

579
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,940
then disowned it in court.

580
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,770
Am I not entitled to wonder

581
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,220
if it was all an act?

582
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,460
Would you leave as well,

583
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:09,980
please?

584
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,940
I repeat:

585
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,010
we're the guidance team

586
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,490
overseeing the city's work.

587
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,420
Speak.

588
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,380
Justice allows debate.

589
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,460
As defense counsel,

590
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,530
I admit

591
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,770
Wan Hai broke certain laws,

592
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,050
but whether that

593
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,380
constitutes organizing
and leading a mafia-type group

594
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,490
is still unproven.

595
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,530
I've studied the police file.

596
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,940
It collapses under scrutiny.

597
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,490
I rejected their conclusion

598
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,770
and presented contrary evidence

599
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,010
to Prosecutor Qiao Zhenxing,

600
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,770
fighting for two years.

601
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,220
What about Qiao Zhenxing?

602
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,660
I argued with him round after round.

603
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,810
He finally saw the gaps

604
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,250
and returned the case for more evidence.

605
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,050
You can read the grounds yourself.

606
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,940
Exactly on the flaws I flagged.

607
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,530
Then

608
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,420
they replaced him

609
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,770
and branded me mafia.

610
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,730
The replacement,

611
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,700
that Mr. Xie,

612
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,620
came in saying

613
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,900
without asking,

614
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,660
"Plead guilty and get leniency.

615
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,220
Refuse and

616
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,460
rot in jail."

617
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,050
Ms. Zheng,

618
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,050
is that how a prosecutor

619
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,620
should think?

620
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,010
Who's the real gangster?

621
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,980
Who's framing whom?

622
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,900
Who's setting up whom?

623
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,700
A responsible prosecutor is removed

624
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,090
and replaced by someone
who ignores the law.

625
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,380
A lawful defense lawyer
is painted as mafia.

626
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,940
The evidence can't hold water.

627
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,180
Witnesses keep changing their stories.

628
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,810
The chain of proof won't close.

629
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,010
Why rush such a shaky case to trial?

630
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,900
Why?

631
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,900
Political points?

632
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,330
Or payoffs?

633
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,620
While I was still

634
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,460
defending Wan Hai,

635
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,140
he cooperated fully,

636
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,570
until last June,

637
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,900
when he suddenly did a 180,

638
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,050
pled guilty,

639
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,940
and asked for a new lawyer.

640
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,050
You remember what you told me
before I took this case?

641
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,460
How long has it been?

642
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,290
You've run it halfway into the ground.

643
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,250
But fine, I'm not blaming you.

644
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,180
I know moving the case forward

645
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,220
hasn't gone as smoothly as we hoped,

646
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,810
but I've given it my all.

647
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,010
You can't just…

648
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,810
Wait,

649
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,860
what happened to your lip?

650
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,730
Get Wan Hong

651
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,330
Who hit you?

652
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,050
to settle your fee

653
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,010
and get as far away as you can.

654
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,250
So someone's threatened you, right?

655
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,770
I bit it.

656
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,620
After a year-and-a-half in custody,

657
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,010
I figured he'd crack,

658
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,940
so I planned to talk again later.

659
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,530
Instead,

660
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,250
they suddenly named me

661
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,700
a core gang member.

662
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,010
Police hauled me out of my own office.

663
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,010
My advice is to pull out now.

664
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,620
If Wan Hai himself

665
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,250
has waved the white flag,

666
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,490
don't dig your heels in.

667
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,380
Are you listening?

668
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,420
The fallout could be worse

669
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,090
than we think.

670
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,940
I know it's risky,

671
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,090
but if I walk away

672
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,050
Wan Hai is finished.

673
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,530
And you still care about that

674
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,570
at a time like this?

675
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,460
Captain Jiang,

676
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,660
what is it?

677
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:22,980
Zhang Wenjing,

678
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,290
Public Security Bureau.

679
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,730
You're under arrest

680
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,180
for involvement

681
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,490
[Arrest Warrant]
in the Wan Hai criminal syndicate.

682
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,420
Please cooperate.

683
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,290
Here's the warrant.

684
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:33,980
What?

685
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,180
Captain Jiang, this is a mistake.

686
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,730
No evidence, no investigation,

687
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,700
how can you arrest her?

688
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,290
Fu Bing,

689
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,900
you're a lawyer too.

690
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,530
Without evidence,

691
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,570
the procuratorate
wouldn't have approved the warrant.

692
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,900
Think about it.

693
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,380
Cuff her.

694
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,250
- Yes, sir.
- What are you doing?

695
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,140
Why are you cuffing our boss?

696
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,090
What are you people up to?

697
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,860
What do you think you're doing,
Jiang Hongjun?

698
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,420
Zhang Wenjing,

699
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,860
you'll have plenty of time to speak
after we're back.

700
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,010
And the rest of you,

701
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,180
you know the law.

702
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,660
Interfere again

703
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,250
and we'll summon you on the spot.

704
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,010
Understood?

705
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:07,620
Cuff her.

706
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,250
They're framing me,

707
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,050
fabricating evidence,

708
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,900
just because

709
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,010
I stood in their way

710
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,900
of railroading Wan Hai.

711
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,420
They?

712
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,730
Who exactly?

713
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,700
Dongping Public Security,

714
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,290
Dongping People's Procuratorate,

715
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,420
plus the real crime ring

716
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,010
that wants Wan Hai dead,

717
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,090
wants me dead.

718
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,220
Be more specific.

719
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,770
Who's the real ring?

720
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,810
I don't know.

721
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,460
I keep thinking.

722
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,530
I keep asking myself:

723
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,330
if a lawyer

724
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,900
gets bitten by the very people

725
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,250
who control justice

726
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,050
just for doing her job,

727
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,290
is there any justice left here?

728
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,180
So far

729
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,700
you're only making declarations.

730
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,050
Zhang Wenjing,

731
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,570
you know very well that

732
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,010
the law deals in facts

733
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,660
and proof.

734
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,380
If you have evidence that Dongping police

735
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,940
or prosecutors broke the law,

736
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,490
present it.

737
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,090
If not,

738
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,420
don't make reckless claims.

739
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,220
They took me

740
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,490
before I could gather anything.

741
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,810
If you

742
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,940
re-examine every detail

743
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,420
you'll find the proof yourself.

744
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,380
If the case against Wan Hai collapses,

745
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,620
mine collapses with it.

746
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,460
Of course,

747
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,380
if you've already decided

748
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,980
his case

749
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,010
is airtight

750
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,530
mafia crime,

751
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,900
then there's no point

752
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,290
talking further.

753
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,570
You actually let someone like that
get under your skin?

754
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,770
You shouldn't have.

755
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:05,810
Ms. Zheng,

756
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,090
sorry.

757
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,460
I lost my temper.

758
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,660
She's just a courtroom shyster.

759
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,380
Mr. Xie,

760
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,570
we still have to hear every opinion.

761
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,140
Whether it helps us or hurts us,

762
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,730
we still have to listen.

763
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,620
Right,

764
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,490
you're absolutely right.

765
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,380
We'll go back, do our homework,

766
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,220
make sure…

767
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,090
Can we see Wan Hai now?

768
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,220
Everything's arranged.

769
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,090
Shall we go?

770
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:26,660
Let's go.

771
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,700
Where are we?

772
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,010
A residential neighborhood.

773
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,660
Which part of the neighborhood
are you heading to?

774
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,180
Why do you need to know?

775
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,860
Since I came with you,

776
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,220
I should at least know where you're going.

777
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,050
Did I ask you to tag along?

778
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,490
No, but discipline says,

779
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,980
I have to stick with you.

780
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,180
I'm

781
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,010
quite sensitive,

782
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,420
a bit fragile.

783
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,660
If anything happens,

784
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,700
steady me.

785
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,250
Don't tell me this is…

786
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,090
Hello?

787
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,090
Hong just showed up
at Qiao Zhenxing's place.

788
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,700
Feng.

789
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,330
Liang.

790
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,700
Hong!

791
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,140
What brings you here?

792
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,980
Min's in Beijing.

793
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,330
She said the moment she's back

794
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,530
she'll come straight here.

795
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,700
She worries about you.

796
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,140
Seeing you

797
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,940
cheers him up.

798
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,330
You're the first

799
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,380
from the procuratorate to visit.

800
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,530
Friendship well-kept.

801
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,810
Thanks,

802
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,010
Hong Liang.

803
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,620
Well,

804
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,620
what about

805
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,290
her grandma?

806
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,860
We daren't tell her.

807
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,650
The old lady's been bedridden
for six-seven years.

808
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,530
If she

809
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,690
follows him,

810
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,300
no one could bear that.

811
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,690
Have you decided on a burial site?

812
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,050
A burial site?

813
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,010
He's still in the forensic center.

814
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,900
Cause of death unknown.

815
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,860
I haven't thought that far.

816
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,420
Well,

817
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,740
tell me

818
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,780
what I can line up.

819
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,130
Whatever

820
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,460
you need.

821
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,340
Photos.

822
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,980
In uniform,

823
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,210
wearing the badge.

824
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,260
Smiling if possible.

825
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,530
Do you have any?

826
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,780
Wan Hai,

827
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,010
you're looking rather good today.

828
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,780
Relax, I'm not dying yet.

829
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,980
Listen:

830
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,130
because of the courtroom incident,

831
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,460
the provincial procuratorate
set up a guidance team.

832
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,380
This is team leader

833
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,210
Zheng Yaping,

834
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,090
prosecutor

835
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,010
Wang Chunxiang,

836
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,860
and assistant prosecutor Bai Ziyan.

837
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,420
Answer their questions

838
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,420
about Zhang Wenjing truthfully.

839
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,980
Tell them everything.

840
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,300
No games.

841
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,460
Please,

842
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,780
she caused the stir,

843
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,690
not me.

844
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,900
If you want answers,

845
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,980
go ask her.

846
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,340
Besides, men and women
are in separate blocks.

847
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,860
I can't even talk to her.

848
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,050
Don't pin it on me.

849
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:23,650
Wan Hai,

850
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,210
how do you view
Zhang Wenjing's disruption?

851
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,820
She played it dirty.

852
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,980
You see, once you sign,

853
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,460
it's legally binding.

854
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,900
Why make a scene in court?

855
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,210
Me, I just sit tight.

856
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,570
Even the bailiffs can vouch for me.

857
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,490
I figure:

858
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,780
the sooner the sentence,
the sooner I serve,

859
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,780
the sooner I'm out.

860
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,300
But,

861
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,460
on the flip side,

862
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,780
she's young and pretty.

863
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,260
Having ideas is normal, right?

864
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,340
Wan Hai,

865
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,090
your statement

866
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,420
calls Zhang Wenjing
the strategist of your gang.

867
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,980
Give specifics.

868
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,490
She's smart,

869
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,570
knows the law,

870
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,820
that I can prove.

871
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,490
And she sings great.

872
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,780
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau

873
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,650
a whole octave higher than the original.

874
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,010
Enough chatter.

875
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,260
Answer the questions.

876
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,460
Don't waste the team's time.

877
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,170
I am telling the truth.

878
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,210
Fine, since
the provincial leaders are here,

879
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,820
I'll repeat it:

880
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,130
Zhang Wenjing told me

881
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,740
to have my guys

882
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,610
hold Wang Yu for a week,

883
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,380
then grab the freight hub
at a low price.

884
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,090
I did as she said.

885
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,260
I hired some guys
to beat Wang Yu into submission,

886
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,010
and then forced him to sign the contract.

887
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,300
She drafted the contract.

888
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,780
And

889
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,460
when my club's head of security

890
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,210
crippled that man,

891
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,530
she arranged the false testimony

892
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,650
to cover me.

893
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,610
Wan Hai,

894
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,090
all that's

895
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,570
in the file.

896
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,170
During the week Wang Yu was held,

897
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,860
did Zhang Wenjing see him?

898
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,900
Let me think.

899
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:12,460
No.

900
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,940
You claim she drafted the contract

901
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,170
and forced Wang Yu to sign.

902
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,050
Describe the scene for me.

903
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,300
Exactly how did she coerce him?

904
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,170
What did she say?

905
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,210
What did she do?

906
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,420
What's the process?

907
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,130
How long from refusal

908
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,980
to agreement?

909
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,340
How many times did she meet him?

910
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,130
Look,

911
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,530
leader,

912
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,650
that's a lot of questions.

913
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,690
What was the first one again?

914
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,490
How did she coerce Wang Yu?

915
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,650
How else?

916
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,530
Like I said,

917
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,610
had him beaten till he gave in.

918
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,490
It's been years.

919
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,420
You went to all that trouble,

920
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,380
kidnapping, beating,

921
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,610
for the hub,

922
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,820
yet you can't recall

923
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,210
the signing details?

924
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,210
Leader,

925
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,210
honestly,

926
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,050
I've been locked up for over two years.

927
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,170
They never turn the lights off.

928
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,090
My head buzzes all day.

929
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,490
Give it a few more days

930
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,940
and I might not remember any of this.

931
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,050
Did you already

932
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,740
get leave from the school?

933
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,050
I did.

934
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,980
The school's been very understanding.

935
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,210
Just look at her.

936
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,570
Mei, how's your health?

937
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,460
Have you eaten these days?

938
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:49,860
Two whole days,

939
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,170
not a single bite.

940
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,490
That won't do.

941
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,130
Have you eaten?

942
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,530
You haven't either?

943
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,490
Your little faces
are all sallow from hunger.

944
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,740
I'll make you some noodles.

945
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,690
Nobody needs to move,

946
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,010
it's all right.

947
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,260
Has your office

948
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,340
reached a conclusion?

949
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:23,940
How did he actually die?

950
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,690
Are you free tomorrow?

951
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,050
I can be. What for?

952
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,210
Come out with me.

953
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,090
To your office?

954
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,050
No,

955
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,610
to the place where my brother died.

956
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,340
Which river was it?

957
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,130
The Yongqing River.

958
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,050
Going to burn joss paper?

959
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:42,940
No.

960
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,090
I keep feeling

961
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,340
there's something amiss
with my brother's case.

962
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,010
What's wrong?

963
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,740
They found him frozen in a waterfall.

964
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,050
The search team

965
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,460
traced the ice hole where he went in,

966
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,170
several kilometers upstream,

967
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,530
and it was pitch-dark that night.

968
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,820
I keep thinking…

969
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,010
I can't lay it out here.

970
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,610
You've got to see the scene with me.

971
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,380
So what's the deal?

972
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,530
You just don't want to go?

973
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,610
Let's talk about

974
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,610
the assault at the entertainment club.

975
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,210
Who? Liu Gui?

976
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,460
Right.

977
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,380
Please be specific.

978
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,380
Liu Gui was using drugs,

979
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,530
a bad character.

980
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,170
He even dared to use in my club,

981
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,090
so I had Wu Xiaotian "educate" him.

982
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,260
Wu went overboard

983
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,380
and beat Liu into a vegetative state.

984
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,820
By your account,

985
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,130
Zhang turned Wu's intentional assault

986
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,210
into an accidental injury.

987
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,210
Something that serious
and she never ran it by you?

988
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,340
That kind of trivial matter
never reaches my level.

989
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,170
Not even once?

990
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,650
She handles the legal stuff.

991
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,170
Tidying these things up doesn't need me.

992
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,340
Do you know

993
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,210
Zhang got the waitress Shao Xiaoyan

994
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,300
to give false testimony?

995
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,170
Like I said,

996
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,210
people like that don't reach my level.

997
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,210
That's not what your statement says.

998
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,170
No, look,

999
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,260
don't try to trap me.

1000
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,130
It means I didn't know back then.

1001
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,460
Now I certainly do.

1002
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,460
Do you know

1003
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,010
what Zhang Wenjing gave her in return?

1004
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,300
Had to make it worth her while, of course.

1005
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,050
And what did you give Zhang Wenjing?

1006
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:46,860
Money.

1007
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,690
How much money?

1008
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,690
How many times? On what occasions?

1009
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,820
And how much each time?
