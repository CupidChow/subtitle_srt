You really wanna play?

Call.

As long as you win,

you can have this a million yuan.

Help!

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,300
If you had won that one,

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,260
would you dare to take this money?

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,010
We're in the same boat, aren't we?

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,180
The boat hasn't docked yet.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,770
The waves are rough.

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,260
Rocking the boat at a time like this,

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,940
are you trying to test
your swimming skills

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,010
or mine?

00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,980
Anybody home?

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,850
Coming.

20
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,130
Hello, ma'am.

21
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,170
Who are you?

22
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,340
We are colleagues of Mr. Xie.

23
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,660
He's at work.

24
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,450
Why are you here?

25
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,820
We are...

26
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,170
What's going on?

27
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,540
What's the meaning of this?

28
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,500
Where did you come from?

29
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,170
I should be asking you!

30
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,340
Where did you come from?

31
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,100
Why came to my place?

32
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,540
Don't shout.

33
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,260
You just won't quit, will you?

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,010
So annoying!

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,010
Get out!

36
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,780
Don't show up here again.

37
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,540
Come in.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,260
Xie.

39
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,730
I'm telling you, Hong Liang,

40
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,820
we'll talk about this
at the office tomorrow.

41
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,850
If you don't come to me,
I would come to you.

42
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,570
Hongfei.

43
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,570
What's going on?

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,100
It's the middle of the night.

45
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,540
Why did they come here?

46
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,850
Mom, calm down.

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,940
It's nothing, really.

48
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,610
Mom, is your leg still hurting?

49
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,170
It's just an old issue.

50
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,500
I can handle the pain.

51
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,290
Evening, ma'am.

52
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,290
Since we're already here,

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,540
can we talk now?

54
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,340
What's there to talk about between us?

55
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,540
Keep it down.

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,890
Talk nicely.

57
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,850
It's alright, ma'am.

58
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,610
Everything's fine.

59
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:53,940
Mr. Xie.

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,660
Don't call me that, you come with me.

61
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,820
Don't grab me.

62
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,220
Come on, Zhang, listen.

63
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,540
Go ahead.

64
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,010
You wanna talk about it?

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,260
Today,

66
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,340
you've been grilling me all day, right?

67
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,890
Who gave you the right?

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,820
Hong Liang.

69
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,260
You b*stard,

70
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,380
you think you're tough now, huh?

71
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,130
Trying to play hardball with me?

72
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,410
First you showed up at my house today,

73
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,460
and now you even came to my mom's place?

74
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,490
What do you really want?

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,610
Well,

76
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,140
I've also got a lot of questions.

77
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,780
Think about it,

78
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,610
after work today,

79
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,580
instead of going back
to your place in the city,

80
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,610
you came here.

81
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,250
Who wouldn't find that suspicious?

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,290
And tomorrow's not even a day off.

83
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,700
But you'll talk to me tomorrow.

84
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,610
That is to say,

85
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,850
later tonight,

86
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,730
you'll have to ride back to the city
another hour and a half?

87
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,490
When you get home,
are you even gonna sleep?

88
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,930
Why do you care?

89
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,930
Hong Liang, Zhang,

90
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,610
let me be clear now,

91
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,290
I refuse to answer
any more of your questions!

92
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,100
Now I'd like to ask you both,

93
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,490
how did you find me in Datu Village?

94
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,730
You had me tailed, didn't you?

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,700
Definitely.

96
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,250
See?

97
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,490
You just admitted it!

98
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,170
Okay, now you tell me,

99
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,290
who was tailing me?

100
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,490
What tactics are you using on me?

101
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,220
If you don't give me
a satisfactory answer today,

102
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,900
tomorrow,

103
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,700
I'm going to the provincial office
to report you!

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,700
And you!

105
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,700
Xie,

106
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,540
you're a veteran.

107
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,580
We're both seasoned prosecutors.

108
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,700
Can we just use tactics

109
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,220
on people however we want?

110
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,660
If we do,

111
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,460
there must be a legitimate reason.

112
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,140
But is that reason

113
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,410
something you can share
with the person involved?

114
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,050
And now you want me to name

115
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,370
the person tailing you,
Zhang San, Li Si,

116
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,020
or whoever?

117
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,580
You're asking me to go to jail.

118
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,460
Quit giving me that bullsh*t!

119
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,700
You think I'm some gullible ghost?

120
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,220
Ghost, really?

121
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,610
Sounds so creepy at night.

122
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,170
I know what you're doing.

123
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:35,980
First,

124
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,140
you've got no evidence.

125
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,250
Second, show me the paperwork.

126
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,290
I'm done arguing with you!

127
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,250
I'm calling Mr. Li now.

128
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,610
And the Commission
for Discipline Inspection too.

129
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,810
I'll report you!

130
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,290
Alright, fine! Don't report!

131
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,140
I'm going.

132
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,050
Go away!

133
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,020
Try to do the right thing,
and this is what I get.

134
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,660
Oh, let me just ask one last thing.

135
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,540
Your security camera,

136
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,170
why was it pointed at me?

137
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,900
Shouldn't it be
facing your mother's direction?

138
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,100
It was blustery two days ago,

139
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,900
it got tilted, so what?

140
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,220
OK.

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,410
Zhang.

142
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,540
You've got good legs.

143
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,980
Go up and fix that camera for Xie.

144
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,580
Fix what?

145
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,930
It's clearly pointed right at this door.

146
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,250
What are you doing, Zhang?

147
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,050
I'm telling you,

148
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,540
this is my...

149
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,580
my chicken coop!

150
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,850
What do you want?

151
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,540
Why so interested in a chicken coop?

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,700
My dad's been saying
he wants a coop in the yard.

153
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,050
He's been pushing me to build one.

154
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,020
But I don't know how.

155
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,810
Can I take a look at yours
and learn a bit?

156
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,410
No! You listen to me!

157
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:54,780
Mr. Xie.

158
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,610
I won't allow you into my chicken coop!

159
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,220
Hong Liang, I'm warning you!

160
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,370
If anything happens to my chickens,

161
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,900
I won't let you off the hook!

162
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,850
Mr. Xie, listen to me.

163
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,220
Hong Liang, come out!

164
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,490
Hong Liang, don't go in there!

165
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,810
Mr. Xie, calm down.

166
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,020
Hong Liang.

167

Hong Liang.

168
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,810
What is there to see in a chicken coop?

169
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,170
- Mr. Xie, did you just bite me?
- Hong Liang!

170
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,140
Hong Liang.

171
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,660
Are you crazy?

172
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,170
Mr. Xie.

173
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,410
Hong Liang, get out!

174
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,540
Get the hell out!

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,170
What is there to see in a chicken coop?

176
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,660
What's so interesting
about a chicken coop?

177
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,220
Xie Hongfei.

178

On behalf of Eleventh Division of
the Provincial People's Procuratorate,

179
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,290
we're gonna investigate leads suggesting

180
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,050
your self-seeking misconduct.

181
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:13,810
Please cooperate.

182
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,490
That's how it happened.

183
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,700
After we got there,

184
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,580
we brought both the suspect
and the gold bars back.

185
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,700
Where's Mr. Xie?

186
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:30,920
In the conference room.

188
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:31,930

00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,100
Hong Liang and Zhang Huai'en
from the provincial office

190
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,850
are here too.

191
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,770
They asked to join the interrogation.

192
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,460
Question him tonight.

193
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,580
Make sure the investigation is thorough.

194
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,220
Don't go too far.

195
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,650
But also,

196
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,700
don't go soft.

197
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,180
Follow the procedure.

198
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,010
Okay.

199
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,060
What about those two
from the provincial office?

200
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,220
If they want to ask questions, let them.

201
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,180
We've got nothing to hide.

202
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,530
Understood, Mr. Li.

203
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,980
Is it here, Ziyan?

204
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,610
According to the address,
it should be around here.

205
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,650
Hello, excuse me,

206
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,700
where is this?

207
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,700
Third floor, the one on the left.

208
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,370
Thank you.

209
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,490
Thank you.

210
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,770
Move.

211
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,460
Let me go!

212
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,460
Who are you people?

213
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,530
- Move!
- No!

214
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,100
Hurry up!

215
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,420
- I won't go!
- Hurry!

216
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,490
What are you doing?

217
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,300
Help!

218
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,850
Help me!

219
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,700
Help me!

220
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,770
What are you doing?

221
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,580
Prosecutor, help me!

222
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,250
Let me go.

223
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,300
- Help...
- Let her go.

224
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,130
Mind your own business!

225
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,130
Let her go!

226
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,100
We're from the Procuratorate!

227
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,130
I don't care!

228
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,100
Ziyan, call the police.

229
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:53,890
Get out of the way!

230
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:56,940
Ziyan!

231
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,300
Go away!

232
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,300
Help!

233
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,130
Help me!

234
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,100
What are you doing?

235
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,060
Call the police!

236
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,890
Ziyan!

237
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,300
Help me!

238
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,700
Help!

239
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,010
You'll all pay for this!

240
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,300
Kill him!

241
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,130
The police are here.

242
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:54,770
Go!

243
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,180
Run!

244
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,700
Mr. Wang, are you okay?

245
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,700
I'm fine.

246
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm fine.

247
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,850
Shao Xiaoyan.

248
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,340
- Are you okay?
- Who are they?

249
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,220
Name.

250
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,250
Age.

251
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,180
Place of birth.

252
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,060
Job title.

253
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,650
Have you made a case?

254
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,460
We're still
in the preliminary investigation stage.

255
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,460
Mr. Xie.

256
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,490
We need to follow
proper procedure.

257
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,530
Then why are those two here?

258
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,650
We are...

259
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,460
You shut up!
I don't want to hear from you!

260
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,370
I didn't ask you!

261
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,220
They found the gold bars.

262
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,010
And they are from the Eleventh Division
of the provincial office.

263
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,250
I've already checked with Mr. Li.

264
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,490
He approved it.

265
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,300
Xie Hongfei,

266
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,010
56 years old,

267
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,980
from Haidong Province,

268
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,100
current Deputy Director of

269
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,980
the First Procuratorial Division,
Dongping People's Procuratorate.

270
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,340
Let's start with your
and your wife's income.

271
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,460
I make just over 10,000 yuan a month.

272
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,530
My wife is retired.

273
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,060
She gets around 2,000,
maybe not quite 3,000.

274
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,820
How much did the renovations cost

275
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,220
for your house in Datu Village?

276
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,890
The house where my mother lives,

277
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,980
the total was under 100,000 yuan.

278
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,530
It's cheap to renovate in the village.

279
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,730
The contractor's an old acquaintance.

280
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,890
Gave me a discount.

281
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,980
Any other

282
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,850
big expenses lately?

283
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,890
Last year, my mother got sick.

284
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,420
Surgery, hospitalization and all that

285
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,730
cost over 30,000 in total.

286
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,610
My daughter's tuition,

287
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,250
that's another expense.

288
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,730
I also bought
a secondhand electric scooter.

289
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,250
Around 900 yuan.

290
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,340
I don't have many hobbies.

291
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,340
Don't smoke, drink or play cards.

292
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,490
Barely attend

293
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,940
work gatherings.

294
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,250
I drink a bit of tea,

295
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,580
but even that's cheap flower tea.

296
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,850
This is basically all my expenses.

297
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,130
In addition to salary,

298
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,940
I have no extra income either.

299
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,010
Your and your wife's combined income

300
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,100
is less than 13,000 yuan a month.

301
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,890
You used all your savings

302
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,730
to buy the home you live in now.

303
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,340
Where did you get the money

304
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,010
for these gold bars worth 800,000?

305
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,580
Zhang,

306
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,460
your math doesn't add up.

307
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,060
I didn't buy that gold recently.

308
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,940
It's my life savings.

309
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,890
I saved up little by little

310
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,980
over the years.

311
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,580
I bought it

312
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,820
more than a decade ago,

313
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,610
when gold prices were low.

314
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,460
Every bar has a serial number.

315
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,180
You can check when I bought it,

316
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,100
and who's the buyer.

317
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,700
It's all traceable.
You can check it out.

318
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,530
I bought them all myself.

319
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,300
Not given to me by someone else.

320
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,220
Do you have any receipts or invoices?

321
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,770
I have receipts for the ones
I bought in recent years.

322
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,850
The ones from over a decade ago...

323
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,010
where am I supposed to
find those receipts?

324
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,250
If it's all legal income,

325
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,580
then why hide it in a chicken coop?

326
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,700
Can I choose not to answer that?

327
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,580
You need to answer.

328
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,770
I don't want my wife to know.

329
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,130
My wife treats my mother badly.

330
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,700
Sorry, can I...

331
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,650
Shut your mouth!

332
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,650
I don't want to hear your voice!

333
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,730
So,

334
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,610
the Guidance Group is onto
you and Xie Hongfei?

335
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,340
Yes.

336
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,770
I've got a bad feeling about this.

337
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,130
Zheng Yaping described my call

338
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,130
with Mr. Xie that morning

339
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,340
down to the exact minute and second.

340
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,580
They used surveillance.

341
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,580
They'll definitely come after me next.

342
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,940
This is not over.

343
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,700
Where's Xie Hongfei?

344
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,100
We haven't talked.

345
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,250
There's an unspoken agreement now.

346
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,730
If we reach out,
it'll just make things worse.

347
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,250
Just wait and see.

348
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,060
The conclusion that
the body was mistakenly cremated,

349
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,610
the Guidance Group seems to accept it,

350
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,610
but they must be investigating it
in secret.

351
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,060
Right.

352
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,890
We need to clean up
everything related to Lei Guangfa.

353
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,980
Are you confident about Xie Hongfei?

354
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,010
70%.

355
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,770
You have to send someone

356
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,130
to feel him out quietly.

357
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,460
So we can plan our next move.

358
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:18,890
I got it.

359
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,490
And now Wang Yu's stirring up trouble.

360
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,770
He's not content.

361
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,460
The Freight Hub isn't enough for him.

362
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:37,890
Right.

363
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,700
He's ignoring our signals
and pushing even harder.

364
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,820
Doesn't matter.

365
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,610
We'll spend a little

366
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,250
to keep him in line.

367
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,980
We're all married men,

368
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,180
you know exactly what I mean.

369
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,100
I've said everything I had to say.

370
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,580
If you don't believe me, go investigate.

371
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,250
If I lied,

372
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,820
do whatever you have to do.

373
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,810
I won't argue.

374
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,140
He found...

375
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,180
I refuse to answer his questions!

376
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,460
It's our question now.

377
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:22,810
Mr. Xie.

378
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,140
Listen up.

379
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,180
When he found the gold bars,

380
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,980
why were you so nervous
and kneeling to him?

381
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,140
What were you afraid of?

382
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,380
Please answer me.

383
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,660
Do you really have to push me?

384
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,490
You must answer.

385
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,860
Okay, I'll answer you.

386
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,220
I grew up in poverty and suffering.

387
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,220
I remember when I was little,

388
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,530
I could only eat an egg on my birthday.

389
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,380
Poverty traumatized me!

390
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,770
I just love looking at these gold bars.

391
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,330
I never wanted to spend them.

392
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,940
I couldn't bear to.

393
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,290
Just seeing them gave me peace of mind.

394
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,810
When I hold them in my hands,

395
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,090
I feel secure.

396
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,180
I've worked hard
at the Municipal Procuratorate

397
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,250
for more than thirty years.

398
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,940
I bought this gold

399
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,980
with my legal income.

400
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,900
What's wrong with that?

401
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,460
Is there any law

402
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,330
saying I can't buy gold bars?

403
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,620
Late at night,

404
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,290
he found a pile of gold bars

405
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,460
in my chicken coop,

406
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,250
how am I supposed to explain that?

407
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,490
You tell me, how should I explain?

408
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,530
Should I get a loudspeaker

409
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,380
and shout at everyone I see,

410
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,980
"These gold bars were bought legally,

411
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,660
and I hid them in a chicken coop

412
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,220
so my wife wouldn't find out?"

413
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,250
Who'd believe it?

414
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,490
How could I even say that out loud?

415
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,530
I have dignity!

416
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,940
During questioning,

417
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,570
we'll need to record audio.

418
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,050
Can we start now?

419
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,050
Around March, three years ago,

420
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,620
after Wu Xiaotian wounded Liu Gui,

421
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,980
Zhang Wenjing came to me

422
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,380
to ask about it.

423
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,380
I told her the truth.

424
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,980
She told me to
tell the same thing to the police.

425
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,530
What is the truth?

426
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,660
The day it happened,

427
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,290
Wu Xiaotian

428
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,010
and Liu Gui

429
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,900
got into a fight

430
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,380
in another room.

431
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,940
I'm telling you!

432
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,620
If you bring this stuff
into my place again,

433
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,620
I'll kill you!

434
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,490
- Just go!
- You hear me?

435
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,330
Come back!

436
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,010
- Stop it!
- Give it to me.

437
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,530
Come on!

438
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,220
Give it back to me.

439
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,090
Later,

440
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,090
Liu Gui got pushed,

441
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,620
hit his head.

442
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,090
So you're saying,

443
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,050
Wan Hai didn't order
Wu Xiaotian to beat up Liu Gui?

444
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,460
He didn't.

445
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,620
It had nothing to do with Wan Hai.

446
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,010
Wan Hai didn't even know about it.

447
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,570
Why did you change your testimony?

448
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,330
It was Qian Bo.

449
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,700
About six months later,

450
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,810
he cornered me in the break room.

451
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,900
Who is Zhang Wenjing?

452
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,980
Zhang Wenjing is Wan Hai's lawyer.

453
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,330
She threatened me to lie.

454
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,810
When did she contact you?

455
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,700
24 March.

456
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,460
What did she make you lie about?

457
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,810
That in the Wanjia Denghuo suite,

458
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:45,770
Mr. Wan...

459
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,380
Wan Hai asked Wu Xiaotian
to beat up Liu Gui.

460
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,810
Zhang Wenjing told me
to lie to the police,

461
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,380
tell them Wan Hai had no idea at all.

462
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,980
How were you supposed
to make that believable?

463
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,770
What exactly did she tell you to say?

464
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,220
She told me to say

465
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,290
Liu Gui owed Wu Xiaotian money.

466
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,860
It was their personal vendetta.

467
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,050
Wan Hai was not present.

468
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,530
So what's the actual situation?

469
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,730
Actual situation was...

470
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,220
I heard Wan Hai say it.

471
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,980
I heard him

472
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,770
tell Wu Xiaotian to hit Liu Gui.

473
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,620
How exactly did
Zhang Wenjing threaten you?

474
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,290
She said if I didn't do what she said,

475
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,250
she'd fire me,

476
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,770
make sure I couldn't survive
in Dongping.

477
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,530
Then why did you

478
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,700
come forward to report her?

479
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,980
I realized that
I was committing a crime.

480
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,730
I volunteered to go to the police

481
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,010
to report her

482
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,010
and turn myself in.

483
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,220
My previous testimony

484
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,860
was given under threat.

485
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,700
It's all fake.

486
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,620
Why did they ask you
to frame Zhang Wenjing?

487
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,330
I don't know...

488
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,330
All I know is

489
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,770
if I didn't do what they said,

490
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,940
I would die.

491
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,420
Please let me go.

492
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,140
Let me go.

493
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,900
I don't want to do this.

494
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,770
They'll kill me.

495
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,940
It was Qian Bo.

496
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,490
Qian Bo.

497
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,530
Will this do?

498
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,420
It hurts.

499
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,380
It doesn't hurt.

500
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,530
- Come on.
- No.

501
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,140
Xing.

502
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,940
What's this?

503
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,660
Brother.

504
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,730
Mr. Wang.

505
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,220
Mr. Wang.

506
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,090
Mr. Chen.

507
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,050
Why are you here?

508
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,700
Didn't you ask me to come?

509
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,420
So here I am.

510
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,330
This is...

511
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,900
Chang Sheng, right?

512
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,250
Xingzi.

513
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,660
Don't let it stop.

514
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,250
I heard that Mr. Wang
likes to play cards.

515
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,810
Sit down, let's have some fun.

516
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,250
Ugh, Mr. Chen, you're a busy man.

517
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,860
Why do you wanna play cards with me?

518
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,980
Come on, just one round.

519
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,290
No, you don't need to do this,

520
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,730
just tell me what you came here for.

521
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,460
Mr. Wang,

522
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,620
how big do you usually play?

523
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,420
Small games, one or two hundred a hand.

524
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,250
Big ones, a thousand or two.

525
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,090
Zijian, how much did he
ask you for last time?

526
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,090
A million yuan.

527
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,420
Mr. Wang.

528
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,140
A million, is it?

529
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,010
Let's play for one million.

530
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,980
Come on, Mr. Wang.

531
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,810
Whoever loses, game's over.

532
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,460
I was joking with him.

533
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,330
I mean...

534
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,140
Come on now.

535
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,380
Don't take it seriously,
I didn't mean it.

536
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,380
I just wanted the transfer done.

537
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,460
It's been three years after all.

538
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,330
Mr. Wang.

539
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,810
I remember you had a life motto,

540
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,330
"No risk, no glory"?

541
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,250
If you win this one,

542
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,730
you get that one million.

543
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,860
If I win,

544
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,940
I don't want your money.

545
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,700
You know exactly what I want.

546
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,330
Do we have to do this?

547
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,570
Are you sure?

548
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,250
You really wanna play?

549
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,090
All in.

550
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:10,860
Call.

551
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,700
I...

552
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,700
I've got...

553
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,940
Two Aces.

554
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:24,770
Mr. Wang.

555
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,140
I'll give you a chance.

556
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:28,810
Deal me in.

557
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,700
Where do you keep Wan Chao?

558
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,330
Key.

559
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,330
Mr. Wang.

560
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,490
If you had won that one,

561
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,770
would you dare to take this money?

562
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,700
Mr. Wang.

563
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,770
We're in the same boat, aren't we?

564
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,660
The boat hasn't docked yet.

565
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,660
The waves are rough.

566
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,290
Rocking the boat at a time like this,

567
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,770
are you trying to test
your swimming skills

568
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,860
or mine?

569
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,010
What do we need now?

570
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,900
Calm seas.

571
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,180
By the way, Mr. Wang,

572
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,860
you know Wanjia Denghuo KTV, right?

573
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,050
Yes, that's

574
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,530
Qian Bo's place.

575
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,220
It's yours now.

576
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,330
Zijian.

577
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,330
Transfer the ownership to him.

578
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,380
Brother.

579
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,620
Bro...

580
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,010
Mr. Li.

581
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:51,980
How was it?

582
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,900
We need more investigation.

583
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,380
How long do you need?

584
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,050
One day?

585
00:27:59,030 --> 00:27:59,700
Two days?

586
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,620
One week?

587
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,980
It depends on
what the investigation turns up...

588
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:10,900
Okay, I see.

589
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,090
Go home and get some rest.

590
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,620
Go on.

591
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,700
Okay, I'll head off then.

592
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,620
Mr. Li.

593
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,220
When did you start watching him?

594
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,660
Anything else besides gold bars?

595
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,010
Was it because he made
some phone call to someone?

596
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,660
And Qiao was...?

597
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,770
I'm borrowing your boss for a moment.

598
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,490
Come with me.

599
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,770
Get in the car.

600
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,250
Where to?

601
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,770
Mutton soup restaurant.

602
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,530
It's almost dawn.

603
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,460
Let's grab something to eat.

604
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,250
It's not open yet.

605
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,090
It is.

606
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,290
It opens two hours from now.

607
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,810
It's open. I said it's open.

608
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,180
There's no way it's open.

609
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,530
If I say it's open, it's open.

610
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,860
I'm the one who's been living here!

611
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,330
You don't even trust me
about a restaurant?

612
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,490
Hong Liang, do I really seem that
untrustworthy to you?

613
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,220
When you first came to Dongping
and had dinner at my place,

614
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,620
I asked you why you came.

615
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,810
What did you tell me?

616
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,860
You said you were here
about Zheng Yaping.

617
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,980
Man, you've got nerve!

618
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,530
Lied right to my face!

619
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,530
You're from Eleventh Division.

620
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,290
Anyone with a brain

621
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,010
knows you're really here

622
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,420
for Zhang Wenjing.

623
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,700
Fine. You've got protocol.

624
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,140
I respect that, so I didn't ask.

625
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,530
But do you remember

626
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,140
what I told you?

627
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,090
I said no matter what,

628
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,900
whatever you need to investigate,

629
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,380
I'll support you unconditionally.

630
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,660
But you need to let me know!

631
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,730
And what did you do?

632
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,900
You've been digging and digging,

633
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,770
and now you're even digging into
my prosecutor-in-charge.

634
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,770
What am I supposed to do?

635
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,250
What about the Wan Hai case?

636
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,290
Should I get someone new,
or take it on myself?

637
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,330
What about the time we lost?

638
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,010
The Wan Hai case has a deadline!

639
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,290
Hong Liang, I'm begging you!

640
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,900
I support your work.

641
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,220
Please, support mine too!

642
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:14,940
Okay?

643
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,980
Am I not supporting you?

644
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,730
I could help you get rid of

645
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,530
a rat in your team.

646
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,770
Isn't that 'supporting you'?

647
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,460
Gold bars were found in his house.

648
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,700
Am I not supposed to investigate?

649
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,050
Qiao Zhenxing is dead,

650
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,420
and no one knows how or why.

651
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,940
I called for a second autopsy,

652
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,050
and they went and cremated him.

653
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,250
Have you ever heard of such a thing?

654
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,220
About the second autopsy,

655
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,010
you were the only person

656
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,250
in your Procuratorate that I called.

657
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,010
You called Xie Hongfei, and then he...!

658
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,180
Shouldn't I investigate?

659
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,290
So,

660
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,140
is Qiao Zhenxing more important

661
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,860
or Xie Hongfei?

662
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,730
Or is it your precious Wan Hai case?

663
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,250
Hong Liang, let me tell you,

664
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,770
now,

665
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,250
the most important thing to me
is the Wan Hai case.

666
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,570
My position makes it clear,

667
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,810
the Wan Hai case takes top priority.

668
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,810
Then what's the point of all this talk?

669
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,010
Anyway,

670
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,090
out of the three of us,

671
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,940
only you still get to wear
that uniform.

672
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,660
I'm about to take mine off and walk out.

673
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,530
Right?

674
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,090
And him?

675
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,660
He's been reduced to ashes.

676
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,420
He'll never wear one again.

677
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,490
He just wanted to wear
his uniform for the farewell,

678
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,290
couldn't even get that.

679
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,660
Wasn't that unjust?

680
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,900
You,

681
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,660
wear it well.

682
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,620
Speak for both of us.

683
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,180
And

684
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,860
make sure you're worthy of
that uniform.

685
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,140
You've got a scale in your heart,

686
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,860
weigh it carefully.

687
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,220
What do I have to weigh?

688
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,460
Weigh how to be a decent person.

689
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,700
Weigh how to do your job.

690
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,460
You already know the answer.

691
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,330
It doesn't matter
what happens to Xie Hongfei.

692
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,090
It doesn't matter
what happens to Qiao Zhenxing.

693
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,730
What matters most to you
is the Wan Hai case.

694
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,140
Because once that case is wrapped up,

695
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,620
that 'acting' title gets removed.

696
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,330
You'll be Prosecutor-General
Li Renjun.

697
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,250
You b*stard!

698
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,290
Hong Liang, you think I don't know?

699
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,700
That you're investigating Xie Hongfei

700
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,980
and Qiao Zhenxing

701
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,420
just to get to me?

702
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:13,980
Go on!

703
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,140
Investigate me!

704
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,050
I'll be right here waiting!

705
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,900
Is he released this morning?

706
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,330
I've been here for over an hour.

707
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,490
I came before work.

708
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,330
I didn't see Lei Guangfa come out.

709
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,010
Yes, I asked around,

710
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,770
Lei Guangfa was released early,

711
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,900
around 6 AM.

712
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,650
Mr. Sun is here.

713
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:46,530
Long.

714
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,460
Do you have to do this there?

715
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:48,820
Mr. Sun.

716
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,650
Mr. Sun.

717
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,820
It can't be done somewhere else, can it?

718
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,260
What?

719
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,980
You got someone shielding you?

720
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,740
You think you're a big man now?

721
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,090
All day long,

722
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,780
I'm just cleaning up your messes!

723
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,980
You just wrapped up
the Qiao Zhenxing mess,

724
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,690
and now you've made another
with Lei Guangfa.

725
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,900
What? You think I've got
too much free time?

726
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,900
You just had to create
more work for me?

727
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,380
I'm telling you,
if I hadn't sent someone

728
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,530
to scare him before pretrial,

729
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,010
he'd rat you out the minute he went in!

730
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,460
Let's see

731
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,170
if you'd still be sipping juice
so casually then.

732
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,900
You'd be begging for a quick death!

733
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,260
Yes.

734
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,460
You're right.

735
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,860
Please don't be mad.

736
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,820
Lei Guangfa, he's been released.

737
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,170
Your people already picked him up.

738
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,650
I don't care how you do it,

739
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,740
just keep his mouth shut.

740
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,340
If he slips up and talks,

741
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,210
I'll get dragged in. Got it?

742
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,490
I promise you.

743
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,420
I'll do my best.

744
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,940
No more trouble for you.

745
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,610
