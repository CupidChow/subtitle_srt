no problems.

25

The point is

47
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,820
the hub transfer contract is legit—

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,380
the provincial forensics

49
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,260
already confirmed that.

50
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,690
And we have witnesses

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,610
saying Zhang coached someone to lie

Fine,

let's investigate
Zhang's case separately,

63
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,340

the evidence chain is solid.

67
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,450
We can still prosecute.

68
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,730
But how do we explain Zhang's case?

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,060
What do we tell the higher-ups,

70
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,170
or the public?

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,700
were likely just Wan Hai's people

00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,930
trying to mislead us—

74
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,290

00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,050
as a scapegoat.

77
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,460
And maybe Zhang flipped

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,290
because of internal drama,

on their own,

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,660
Everything's fine.

94

Let's not escalate things.

95
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,930
Calm down.

96
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,900
Let me explain, okay?

97
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,730

98
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,290

listen to us.

101
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,850
Second,

102
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,780
your son stormed into his office,

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,580
tried to steal his stamp,

104
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,610
and threatened him in broad daylight.

105
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,410
That's all?

106
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,930
Go help my son, now!

107
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,780
Wan Hong asked me

108
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,340
to talk to Wang Yu on his behalf.

109
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,930
So should I go or not?

110
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:44,730
You'd better go.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,660
We go way back.

112
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,370
I know you,

113
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,900
and you know me, right?

114
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,460
I get it.

117
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,050
I'll go now.

118
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,580
If the higher-ups show up...

119
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,460
Still a gangster, nothing's changed.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,660

the Wans' lawyer

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,900
or their babysitter?

125
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,170
You handle every shit for them now?

126
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,140
Mr. Wang,

127
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,460
you've made your point,

128
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,930
now let the kid go.

129
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,250
Don't make this any messier.

130
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,930
Why hold a grudge

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,780
against that boy?

132
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,490
I'm locking him up

133
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,850
so the Wans

134
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,140
will finally shut up, right?

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,490
I get it.

136
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,020
Totally understand.

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,700
But

138
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,580
you're taking this

139
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,220
too far.

140
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,410
You need to know when to stop.

141
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,660
Mr. Wang,

142
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,220
look,

143
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,290
didn't you write it right here?

144
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,490
Win-win cooperation.

145
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,460
We need to work together, right?

146
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,170
Especially now,

147
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,460

00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,490
Still, I think

151
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,100
you're all way too soft

152

If it were up to me,

155
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,410
I'd put him away

156
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,100
for good.

157
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,730
Just a reminder, Mr. Wang,

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,930
as of now,

159
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,250
legally, that hub

160
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,810
isn't in your name.

161
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,700
That's why

162
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,140
the boy tried to take the stamp!

163
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,140
By force!

164
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,290
Would he dare do so

165
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,370
if the place was already mine?

166
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,700
If he called the cops,

167
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,660
they'd side

168
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,780
with him;

169
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,340
he's still on the paperwork!

170
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,730
If I let him walk,

171
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,530
can you promise
he won't stir up trouble again?

172
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,700
The hub's evidence
in an active investigation.

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,980
The transfer can't happen

174
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,130
until Wan Hai is sentenced.

175
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,250
It's yours for now,

176
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,580
all profits go to you.

177
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,650
You know how much trouble
Mr. Chen went through for this?

178
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,820
Then see this through to the end!

179
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,820
You know how long I've waited for this?

180
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,010
Three years.

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,610
Haven't I done everything

182
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,820
you asked?

183
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,850
Mr. Chen can pull strings anywhere.

184
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,250
He knows everyone.

185
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,100
He just has to

186
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,700
say the word.

187
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,300
That's it.

188
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:01,940
True.

189
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,340
But honestly, Mr. Chen doesn't have time

190
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,180
for your petty issues.

191
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,610
Petty, huh?

192
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:16,890
Come here,

193
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,820
take a look yourself.

194
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,940
I got eight rail lines out there.

195
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,460
Still think my work's petty?

196
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,850
Who do you think you are?

197
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,850
Don't belittle my business!

198
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,180
What do you really want?

199
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,770
Wang Yu, just say it.

200
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,820
You want me to let the boy go?

201
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,130
Fine.

202
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,820
Have Wan Hong apologize to me

203
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,770
and pay for what he broke.

204
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,100
It's not even much,

205
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,850
just a million.

206
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,650
A million?

207
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,650
Are you crazy?

208
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,010
You...

209
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,420
You mess with this stuff all day,

210
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,650
maybe it's gone to your head!

211
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,700
You know their situation.

212
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,010
They can't even come up with ten grand,

213
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,340
let alone a million.

214
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,580
What are you really after?

215
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,130
Why don't you

216
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,650
ask Mr. Chen to work something out.

217
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,300
I'll release Wan Hai's boy

218
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,420
once I got his hub.

219
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,130
Pulled my plug, huh?

220
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,520
[18 March
Day 21 Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

221
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,610
Officers,

222
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,820
what can I do for you?

223
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,610
Have you seen Wan Hai recently?

224
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,890
I was supposed to,

225
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,530
but I've been slammed with cases

226
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,700
and just haven't had the chance.

227
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,010
I've been

228
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,460
meaning to ask this:

229
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,980
How did you end up
as Wan Hai's defense attorney?

230
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,250
Honestly,

231
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,010
he came to me.

232
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,060
But you know how it is,

233
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,770
Dongping is a small city

234
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,010
with few

235
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,580
experienced criminal lawyers.

236
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,420
Mr. Cheng,

237
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,940
I heard

238
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,420
you were at the county procuratorate

239
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,490
for over six years,

240
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,460
handling public prosecutions,

241
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,850
right?

242
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:35,850
Yeah.

243
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,770
So why

244
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,940
become a lawyer?

245
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,340
Honestly, back then,

246
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,820
I was always intrigued

247
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,820
by the defense attorneys in court.

248
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,890
I wanted to know

249
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,370
if they identified

250
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,610
our weak spots in our cases,

251
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,530
how they'd argue,

252
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,220
how they'd challenge me.

253
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,250
Curiosity is something

254
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,530
that will take you far.

255
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,890
So,

256
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,060
I left the system

257
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,100
to follow that curiosity,

258
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,340
pushed myself

259
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,220
to try something new.

260
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,180
Of course,

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,340
maybe you all think

262
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,370
I chose a bigger paycheck

263
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,250
over my ideals.

264
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,610
But there are still ideals

265
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,250
in that paycheck.

266
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,250
It's all legal work,

267
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,490
and as long as I enjoy it,

268
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,700
it's just a new role, that's all.

269
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,850
How's your relationship with Xie Hongfei

270
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,700
at the Municipal Procuratorate?

271
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,010
Did you know him
before the Wan Hai case?

272
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,940
Mr. Xie Hongfei?

273
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,010
We know each other,

274
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,850
but not well.

275
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,580
He's been around for a long time,

276
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,730
everyone knows him.

277
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,890
We've just worked together

278
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,770
here and there.

279
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,010
Hong Liang.

280
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,820
Zhang.

281
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,180
Good to see you both.

282
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,100
You should've

283
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,300
been back sooner.

284
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,490
Why didn't you let me know?

285
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,300
I could've sent a car
to pick up your files.

286
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,060
By the way,

287
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,820
why isn't Ms. Zheng here?

288
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,370
Still tied up with Zhang Wenjing's case?

289
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,220
You all work so hard.

290
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:14,610
Well...

291
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,980
Regarding

292
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,490
the mistake in the handwriting analysis

293
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,850
on Zhang Wenjing's signatures,

294
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,700
we've double-checked with the police,

295
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,180
and Mr. Wang

296
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,340
at the Judicial Expertise Center

297
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,340
admitted he overlooked it.

298
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,420
He was swamped with cases

299
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,890
and didn't give it enough attention,

300
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,460
which led to

301
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,340
this technical error.

302
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:53,940
Also,

303
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,340
we've officially asked

304
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,940
the municipal bureau to correct it.

305
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,850
Technical error, huh?

306
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,180
Zhang Wenjing's life

307
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,180
is ruined

308
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,940
because that man wasn't up to the job.

309
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,220
How is that fair?

310
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,610
I know.

311
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,220
Well,

312
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,010
I take responsibility

313
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,580
for this too.

314
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,340
Mr. Li already gave me an earful.

315
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,980
Shall we turn it off?

316
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,850
No, no need.

317
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,130
Let's be honest,

318
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,610
I messed up, and I'll own that.

319
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,460
Such a role model.

320
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,850
I put too much faith

321
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,130
in the Judicial Expertise Center.

322
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,610
If I'd paid closer attention

323
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,340
to the evidence,

324
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,060
none of this would have happened.

325
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,250
Well, here's my question,

326
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,770
we know those signatures

327
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,420
are fake,

328
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,770
so who did it,

329
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,940
and why go through all that trouble?

330
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,770
Shouldn't we keep digging?

331
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,610
Absolutely.

332
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,980
We have to.

333
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,610
My team

334
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,460
held a meeting

335
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,700
right away.

336
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,700
Here's the summary.

337
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,010
You team

338
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,980
moved fast.

339
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,060
It's our job.

340
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,010
We believe

341
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,420
Wan Hai's people

342
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,820
forged the signatures

343
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,340
to pin it all on Zhang Wenjing.

344
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,130
They thought it would help

345
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,940
lighten Wan Hai's sentence.

346
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,820
We've urged the police

347
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,220
to continue their investigation,

348
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,300
and you'll be the first to know

349
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,940
when there are any updates.

350
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,420
Thanks for your hard work, Xie.

351
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,250
No trouble at all.

352
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,980
If there's nothing else,

353
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,300
I've got another meeting to get to.

354
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,010
Zhang?

355
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,940
See you then.

356
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,700
That morning,

357
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,460
what time

358
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,420
did you get there?

359
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,220
Which morning?

360
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,220
You know,

361
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,770
Qiao Zhenxing's

362
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,460
memorial meeting.

363
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,130
What time did you arrive?

364
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,980
Maybe seven or eight minutes before you.

365
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,340
So who was there first, you or Mr. Li?

366
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,490
We walked in one after the other.

367
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,220
- Which route did you take...
- Hong Liang.

368
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,650
Seriously?

369
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,580
You're still stuck

370
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,490
on that call, huh?

371
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,220
On the 12th of this month,

372
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,460
Xie Hongfei called you.

373
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,530
What did you discuss?

374
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,340
He called me?

375
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,130
Did he?

376
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,730
He did.

377
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,890
Morning of the 12th.

378
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,580
Hello?

379
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,420
The Provincial Procuratorate
wants a second autopsy.

380
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,660
What autopsy?

381
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,530
Their Guidance Group

382
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,220
wants another autopsy on Qiao Zhenxing!

383
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,770
When?

384
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,660
After the memorial this morning.

385
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,330
Take care of it!

386
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,050
Got it.

387
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:18,980
Will do.

388
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,660
The call lasted 56 seconds.

389
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,660
That was

390
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,380
your last call with him.

391
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,490
Try to remember.

392
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,420
The 12th...

393
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,460
Hong Liang,

394
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,980
we've known each other

395
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,050
for over ten years now, right?

396
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,050
I'm a bit older than you,

397
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,620
so maybe I shouldn't say this, but...

398
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:58,980
Alright.

399
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,900
That day,
you went through Mr. Li's phone

400
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,940
in front of him

401
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,900
and really grilled me.

402
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,420
I have to say,

403
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,220
it felt a bit over the line,

404
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,330
almost like you didn't trust us,
or respect us.

405
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,250
No...

406
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,010
Look...

407
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,460
You're like

408
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,660
an older brother to me.

409
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,180
I've felt awful about it for days.

410
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,250
I was hoping

411
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,380
we could get a moment

412
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,290
alone

413
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,050
so I could apologize in person.

414
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,180
No need for that.

415
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,900
Please, let me finish.

416
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,620
You trained

417
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,860
the three of us

418
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,420
from our very first days

419
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,770
at the Dongping People's Procuratorate.

420
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,180
You saw us all grow up, basically.

421
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,380
Well, to be fair,

422
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,620
I just watched you

423
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,810
improve.

424
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,570
So,

425
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,460
you know just how close

426
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,330
I was to Zhenxing.

427
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,570
He was my best friend, my partner.

428
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,490
Now he's gone,

429
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,090
cremated

430
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,420
before I had a chance

431
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,180
to say goodbye.

432
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,290
By mistake, for god's sake.

433
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,180
It broke me.

434
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,570
I lashed out at everyone.

435
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,050
I just needed to let it out somewhere,

436
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,380
anywhere.

437
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,940
- I lost control...
- Hey, it's alright.

438
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,900
I lost it...

439
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,530
No need to explain.

440
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,530
Hong Liang,

441
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,250
that's enough for me. We're good.

442
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,380
Just one last thing.

443
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,220
Go ahead.

444
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,940
It's not you I doubt,

445
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,490
or that I don't respect you.

446
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,700
I just don't trust Cheng Zijian.

447
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,730
On the 12th,

448
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,810
yeah, Mr. Xie called me that day.

449
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,730
He called

450
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,420
to congratulate me

451
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,730
on my engagement.

452
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,090
But you just said

453
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,250
you two weren't that close.

454
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,860
Exactly.

455
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,940
That's why I didn't invite him.

456
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,250
And anyway,

457
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,570
prosecutors and defense lawyers

458
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,730
shouldn't really be hanging out

459
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,940
outside of cases.

460
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,380
I get that.

461
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,220
He was just

462
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,090
being polite, nothing more.

463
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,660
Oh,

464
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,860
and he mentioned

465
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,700
I should stay in Dongping,

466
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,180
and cooperate with the Guidance Group.

467
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,700
That's all?

468
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,490
There were tons of

469
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,250
congratulatory calls that week.

470
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,810
As far as I remember,

471
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,770
that's all.

472
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,460
The call

473
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,050
only lasted 59 seconds, right?

474
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,460
Well, 56 seconds.

475
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,570
Right.

476
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,660
See,

477
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,900
I called Renjun,

478
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,250
then he called you right away,

479
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,220
and you called Cheng Zijian.

480
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,660
That's when things started snowballing.

481
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:02,770
Hello?

482
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,900
The Provincial Procuratorate
wants a second autopsy.

483
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,860
What autopsy?

484
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,010
Their Guidance Group

485
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,460
wants another autopsy

486
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,700
on Qiao Zhenxing!

487
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,530
When?

488
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,460
After the memorial this morning.

489
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,010
Got it.

490
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,860
Will take care of it.

491
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,570
You better!

492
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,090
So naturally,

493
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,290
I got curious!

494
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,860
Earlier you said

495
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,900
you arrived just seven
or eight minutes before I did.

496
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,900
That's really not much time,

497
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,180
especially since you were on a scooter,

498
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,180
plus making a call.

499
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,010
How did you manage...

500
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,810
Now I remember.

501
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,090
I left home

502
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,010
ten minutes early that day,

503
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,290
grabbed

504
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,900
some tofu soup

505
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,620
and two buns

506
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,140
from a food stall,

507
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,980
enjoyed breakfast,

508
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,490
then made my call, no rush at all.

509
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,420
Hong Liang,

510
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,940
does that make sense?

511
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,660
Then why mention

512
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,420
the second autopsy to Cheng?

513
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,700
I never actually mentioned the autopsy.

514
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,380
I just told him

515
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,900
to talk to Wan Hai

516
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,660
and get him to cooperate with you.

517
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,290
We were planning
another autopsy on Qiao Zhenxing.

518
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,860
You asked Cheng Zijian

519
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,940
to get Wan Hai

520
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:26,980
to cooperate?

521
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,290
Wan Hai's in custody.

522
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,420
What, you think

523
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,420
he's a forensic expert?

524
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,250
The autopsy itself didn't matter to me,

525
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,700
what mattered was that
Wan Hai wasn't cooperating.

526
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,770
Ms. Lan kept telling me

527
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,570
to assist your investigation.

528
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,860
Just recently,

529
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,140
Ms. Zheng and I

530
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,140
went to question Wan Hai
at the detention center.

531
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,570
He wouldn't cooperate at all.

532
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,050
That's when I decided

533
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,420
to call Cheng, to ask him

534
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,220
to get the guy on board

535
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,620
with your investigation.

536
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,460
The call lasted less than a minute.

537
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:03,730
Hong Liang,

538
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,180
does that make sense to you?

539
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,660
If you say so.

540
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,330
You know,

541
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,250
I'm retiring in a few years.

542
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,180
But

543
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,490
after 30 years as a prosecutor,

544
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,180
I know exactly

545
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,220
what's right

546
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,380
and

547
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,220
what isn't.

548
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,530
I'd never leak

549
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,140
sensitive information.

550
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,420
Anything else?

551
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,700
No?

552
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,050
Just let me know

553
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,250
if you need anything.

554
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,490
Mr. Xie.

555
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,250
Well then,

556
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,330
let's wrap up for today.

557
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,810
I'll walk you out.

558
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,250
If we ever

559
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,860
need your help again,

560
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,570
can we reach out to you?

561
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,490
Of course.

562
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,090
Anything for you.

563
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,220
No need to see us out.

564
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:38,730
Alright,

565
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,810
I'll stay then.

566
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:40,620
Take care.

567
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,010

Zhou,

571
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,700
can you file this case for me?

572
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,420
Sure.

573
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,330
Shut the door on your way out.

Can you talk now?

578
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,420
Sure.

579
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,180
The Guidance Group just talked to me.

580
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,460
What happened?

581
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,220
They asked what we discussed

582
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,570
the morning of Qiao Zhenxing's memorial.

583
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,180
Zheng and the others were just here,

584
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,460
asking the same question.

585
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,530
What did you say?

586
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,660
Mr. Xie, what did you say?

587
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,860
I told them I asked you
to talk to Wan Hai,

588
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,010
and get him to cooperate
with the investigation.

589
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,420
You didn't.

590
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,700
What did you say?

591
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,330
At first, I said you called
to congratulate me on my engagement.

592
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,530
That doesn't add up!

593
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,010
You screwed up, you know that?

594
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,660
Relax.

595
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,050
I fixed it afterward.

596
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,620
I told them

597
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,570
you asked me to stay in Dongping

598
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,180
to help with the investigation.

599
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,090
Now our stories match.

600
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,010
Honestly, I didn't see

601
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,420
that coming today.

602
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,980
They told me outright

603
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,570
the call was 56 seconds.

604
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,810
So they've clearly checked everything.

605
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,530
Is this a big deal now?

606
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,010
If

607
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,420
they ask you again,

608
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,980
just say you got mixed up.

609
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,490
Tell them the engagement stuff

610
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,940
was another call.

611
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,220
Mr. Xie,

612
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,490
maybe you should just tell Hong Liang

613
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,090
you remembered something,

614
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,050
share with him my version of the story.

615
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,530
Wouldn't that sound more natural?

616
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,330
No,

617
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,460
they'll see right through that!

618
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,490
Listen,

619
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,860
if they don't bring it up again,

620
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,010
drop it.

621
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,050
If they do,

622
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,570
say you were mistaken.

623
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,770
Remember what I said:

624
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,700
I told you

625
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,250
to talk to Wan Hai,

626
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,730
and get him to cooperate
with the investigation.

627
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,860
Got it?

628
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,660
Alright.

629
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,460
Haidong Provincial
People's Procuratorate's

630
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,730
Technical reports:

631
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,660
on Zhang Wenjing's
five handwriting samples,

632
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,330
samples 3, 4, and 5 have

633
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,570
irregular pen movement, awkward strokes,

634
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,490
and shaky lines.

635
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,010
Conclusion:

636
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,860
samples 3, 4, and 5

637
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,860
were not written by the same person
as the reference sample.

638
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,420
Why are you still here?

639
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,490
I've already confessed.

640
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,140
You know exactly

641
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,700
what this means.

642
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,490
There's a problem with the evidence.

643
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,220
Your case isn't finished yet.

644
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,330
Ms. Zheng,

645
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,420
sorry for the trouble.

646
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,770
I made myself clear last time:

647
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,730
I'm pleading guilty,

648
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,530
asking for leniency.

649
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,490
Zhang Wenjing,

650
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,730
we've questioned you twice.

651
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,140
The first time, you accused
the Dongping public security

652
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,420
of framing you and Wan Hai as gangsters.

653
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,900
But the second time,

654
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,620
you completely changed your story.

655
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,860
Mind telling us why?

656
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,420
Zhang Wenjing,

657
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,090
if something's happened to you

658
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,330
in detention,

659
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,220
please tell me.

660
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,810
I'll do everything I can to help.

661
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,140
I thought

662
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,220
I could stay true to my moral compass

663
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,290
and ideals as a lawyer,

664
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,810
but after these months,

665
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,250
I realized I messed up.

666
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,940
I made plenty of mistakes.

667
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,250
I gave Wan Hai advice,

668
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,050
used my legal knowledge

669
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,660
to cover up his crimes

670
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,090
and help him avoid punishment.

671
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,980
I'm guilty.

672
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,490
There's no going back.

673
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,770
I'm a gangster.

674
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,770
That's what I am!

675
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,180
All those illegal contracts?

676
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,570
I signed every single one!

677
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,090
Every document

678
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,250
has my name on it,

679
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,010
all signed by me, Zhang Wenjing.

680
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,900
Zhang Wenjing,

681
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,570
don't throw away this chance.

682
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,290
Qiao Zhenxing is dead.

683
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,660
But I want to survive.

684
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,860
How do you know he's dead?

685
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,010
Ms. Zheng,

686
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,900
nothing stays secret in Dongping.

687
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,810
I already confessed.

688
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,860
I really did!

689
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,380
Just stop bothering me.

690
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,140
You can leave Dongping now!

691
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,660
Please, just leave me alone.

692
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,940
Get out of Dongping.

693
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,460
Get out and don't come back!

694
00:30:59,270 --> 00:30:59,940
I

695
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,220
am a gangster.

696
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,530
Don't come back.

697
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,530
Worry, worry,

698
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:18,290
worry turns your hair gray.

699
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,420
Since the day we parted,

700
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,660
I've been stuck
behind these prison walls.

701
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,940
They're clearly being threatened.

702
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,250
Ziyan,

703
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,810
get Shao Xiaoyan's address
from the Municipal Procuratorate.

704
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,940
We need to find her.

705
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,530
If she's been scared off,

706
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,980
we'll lose all our leads.

707
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,180
She might be our last hope.

708
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,160
Got it, Ms. Zheng.

709
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,920

00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,010
Coming.

00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:13,570
You...

714
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,010
You guys...

715
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,860
Don't you remember me?

716
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,700
I'm Hong.

717
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,380
Hong Liang?

718
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,330
Hi, ma'am.

719
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,530
Nice to meet you.

720
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,420
This is Zhang, my colleague.

721
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,250
Hello.

722
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,460
You're looking for Xie, right?

723
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,490
He's at work right now.

724
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,330
I know, I already talked to him

725
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,380
at the office.

726
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,250
Now I'd like to chat with you.

727
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,290
You want to talk to me?

728
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,900
Is that okay?

729
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,330
Of course!

730
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,700
Please,

731
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,490
come on in.

732
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,330
No need to change shoes?

733
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,140
No, that's okay.

734
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,730
- Alright.
- Come in.

735
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,660
Just make yourself at home.

736
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:52,940
Have a seat.

737
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,460
Hong Liang,

738
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,980
it's been what,

739
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,420
over ten years since we last met?

740
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:00,940
Yeah.

741
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,700
You weren't always living here, right?

742
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,530
No, we used to live in the old city.

743
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,460
Xie mentioned

744
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,220
you'd be coming here

745
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,570
with the guidance group.

746
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,700
I even told him

747
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,660
to invite you for dinner,

748
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,050
but he said

749
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,330
you were all too busy.

750
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,420
Have a seat, young man.

751
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,570
Have some tea.

752
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,090
Thanks.

753
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,700
Young man, take a seat.

754
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:23,940
Sit down.

755
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,250
You too.

756
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:32,730
Have some tea.

757
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:36,810
Mind if I

758
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:38,770
record our conversation?

759
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,010
Standard procedure.

760
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:44,940
Go ahead, then.

761
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,250
Hong Liang,

762
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,900
is there something specific

763
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,460
you need to ask?

764
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,220
Just chat.

765
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,420
Okay.

766
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,810
Ma'am, are you still working?

767
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,460
Me?

768
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,660
I got really sick two years ago.

769
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,780
So I had to take early retirement.

770
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,900
How are you feeling now?

771
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,530
I'm doing okay,

772
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,420
just resting at home these days.

773
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,340
So your family

774
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,690
lives off Xie's salary?

775
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,820
Well,

776
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,820
I got my pension.

777
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,260
Not much, huh?

778
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,860
It's alright.

779
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,940
If I remember correctly,

780
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,170
Xie had a younger sister, Xie Hong...

781
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:48,820
Hongyu.

782
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,340
Yeah, my sister-in-law

783
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,210
was sickly since childhood

784
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,460
and in the end, got lung cancer.

785
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,420
All our money

786
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,820
went to her treatment.

787
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,980
I never even got to see Xie's paycheck.

788
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,650
It all went right to the hospital

789
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,690
every month.

790
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,940
How is she now?

791
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,010
She's gone.

792
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,130
How long ago?

793
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,490
About

794
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,980
eight or nine years.

795
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,570
You have

796
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,170
a brother, right?

797
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,050
Yeah,

798
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,780
an older brother.

799
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,300
So,

800
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,780
how's his family?

801
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,260
They're alright.

802
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,570
He's retired.

803
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,900
My nephew

804
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,380
is in his thirties and still unemployed,

805
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,420
just sponging off his parents.

806
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,900
Happens a lot these days.

807
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,780
So you don't have to support them?

808
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,530
No, they get by on their own.

809
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:44,980
That's good.

810
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:45,980
Glad to hear it.

811
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,130
Your place is really nice,

812
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,380
isn't it?

813
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,570
We just bought it a couple of years ago.

814
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,260
Xie got onto the list

815
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,820
for the last batch of welfare housing.

816
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,460
That's right.

817
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,340
You've seen that old apartment.

818
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,170
We sold it,

819
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,900
added some money to buy this one.

820
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,170
It's not very big,

821
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,170
about 80 or 90 square meters.

822
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,380
It's enough for you.

823
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,460
Yeah, that's right.

824
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,780
Did you buy it outright,
or do you have a mortgage?

825
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:24,940
Hong Liang,

826
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,570
these questions...

827
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,690
Do they have anything to do

828
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,900
with your visit?

829
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,300
Well,

830
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,380
I just need a few details

831
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,460
about Xie's

832
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,740
financials.

833
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,420
Standard procedure.

834
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,260
Standard, huh?

835
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,740
Does he know you're here?

836
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,530
Let me give him a call.

837
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,420
Ma'am,

838
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,130
you can call him,

839
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,940
but he might not answer.

840
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,130
Is something wrong

841
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,300
with Xie?

842
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,010
Are you investigating him?

843
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,090
Are you?

844
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,170
What for?

845
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,740
What's he done?

846
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,530
The man's worked hard

847
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,170
his whole career.

848
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,130
You remember

849
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,740
how many trophies

850
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,740
he had ten years ago?

851
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,090
Look how many now!

852
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,340
What does that tell you?

853
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,740
His leaders appreciate him,

854
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,860
and his colleagues trust him!

855
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,260
You know what kind of man he is!

856
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,300
Remember when
you first joined the office?

857
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,820
He brought you three here

858
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,570
for New Year's,

859
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,010
had me make dumplings,

860
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,860
made sure you each

861
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,650
got one with a coin inside.

862
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,570
Do you know why?

863
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,460
He didn't want you feeling homesick!

864
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,340
Have you forgotten all that?

865
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,460
What's with
all the questions about our money?

866
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,690
Are you accusing him of corruption?

867
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,380
You know what?

868
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,820
We're broke!

869
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,010
All our money

870
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,260
went to his sister's medical bills

871
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,690
and this apartment.

872
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,940
When my mom got sick,

873
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,940
we couldn't even

874
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,940
afford a caretaker!

875
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,460
You want to talk about corruption?

876
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,690
That's not us!

877
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,980
Not like Qiao Zhenxing,

878
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,900
you won't find three million here!

879
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,490
I've never even seen that much!

880
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,210
Young man,

881
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,740
you said this is

882
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,610
'standard procedure', right?

883
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:48,940
It is.

884
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,260
Fine,

885
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,490
let's see the paperwork.

886
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:52,940
Show me.

887
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,260
Any official notice?

888
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,740
Got anything?

889
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:58,740
Not at the moment.

890
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:00,980
In that case,

891
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,610
please leave.

892
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,650
You're not welcome here.

893
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,690
Out!

894
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,780
Take your device and leave!

895
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,380
Get out!

896
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,340
Doubting Xie like this...

897
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,340
Ridiculous!

898
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:31,800
[Prosecutor]

899
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,650
Yes?

900
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,860
Hong Liang came by

901
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,420
with another guy!

902
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,260
They were grilling me with questions!

903
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,130
What's going on?

904
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,300
Are you keeping something from me?

905
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,530
You better get home, quick.

906
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,860
We got nothing out of her.

907
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,650
Mr. Hong,

908
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,860
if she calls,

909
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,010
what should I do?

910
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,530
If she calls,

911
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,940
pick up.

912
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,050
Me?

913
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,860
What am I even supposed to say?

914
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,010
You're young,
you need this kind of experience.

915
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,130
In our line of work,

916
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,490
you can't be afraid to upset people.

917
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,300
Well, Mr. Hong,

918
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,340
let me ask you,

919
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,090
if she called and you picked up,

920
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,980
what would you say?

921
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,090
I wouldn't pick up.

922
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,900
I can't afford to cross that woman.

923
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,780
Hello, Mr. Hong.

924
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,860
Looks like Xie Hongfei's
on his way back to his hometown.

925
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,900
Stay on him. We're on our way.

926
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,340
Check if he's inside.

927
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,570
Xie...

928
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,490
Probably not this place.

929
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,980
That's his scooter, Mr. Hong.

930
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,460
Is that his?

931
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,490
Should be.

932
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,570
Go ahead.

933
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,490
Anyone home?

934
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,380
Coming.

935
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,610
Hello, ma'am.

936
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,650
Who are you?

937
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,820
Is this Mr. Xie Hongfei's house?

938
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,570
We're his colleagues,

939
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,130
just need to ask a couple questions.

940
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,860
He's at work.

941
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,610
