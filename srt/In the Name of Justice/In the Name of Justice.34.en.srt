00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,130
new evidence on the Wan Hai case,

198
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,530
and asked him

199
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,770
to meet us alone at Jinhai KTV
on Zhongxing Road.

200
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,940
Hong,

201
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,980
are you free right now?

202
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,010
Hello?

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,420
Hong,

204
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,530
can you talk?

205
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,060
Hong?

206
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,820
When we saw him on the phone,

207
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,130
we thought he was onto us,

208
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,370
so we acted.

209
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,370
Mr. Qiao,

210
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,820
come with us.

211
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,460
Remember me,

212
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,890
Mr. Qiao?

213
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,220
I'm Wang Dayou.

214
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,610
Mr. Qiao,

215
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,770
we

216
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,490
asked you here

217
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,820
to help us

218
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,700
record a little video.

219
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:56,940
What video?

220
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,460
See this?

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,530
Your wife.

222
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,610
Your daughter.

223
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,100
Should I give him a video call?

224
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,770
Looks like they're shopping.

225
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,340
What are you doing?

226
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,100
What a coincidence.

227
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,770
Your daughter's calling you now.

228
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,180
Make the video,

229
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,420
and your wife and kid

230
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,580
go home.

231
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,650
Otherwise,

232
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,130
they will never go back home again.

233
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,580
My name is Qiao Zhenxing,

234
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,730
a prosecutor at
Dongping People's Procuratorate.

235
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,420
Today

236
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,820
is the first day of court
for the Wan Hai case.

237
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,820
I can't live with the guilt anymore.

238
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,460
Because I'm…

239
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,100
I am

240
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,300
the umbrella
shielding Wan Hai's criminal outfit.

241
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,100
What are you doing?

242
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,850
Mr. Qiao,

243
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,420
who thought we would
run into each other again,

244
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,180
and you would recognized me?

245
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,730
It's just bad luck.

246
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,730
That's all.

247
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,980
We received a tip-off

248
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,580
accusing Qiao Zhenxing

249
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,890
of taking a substantial bribe

250
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,460
around mid-last year.

251
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,370
Officers from the Development Zone

252
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,610
searched his place
and found piles of cash.

253
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,370
He did it to protect you.

254
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,180
Mei,

255
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,460
you need to accept it.

256
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,130
Qiao Zhenxing

257
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,770
drove alone to the
Forestry Bureau Reservoir

258
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,770
and drank an entire bottle of baijiu.

259
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,700
High concentrations of diatoms

260
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,700
were found in his lungs.

261
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,300
He was likely drowned.

262
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,380
Ms. Zheng.

263
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,490
Mr. Wang, sorry to trouble you again.

264
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,530
Hello.

265
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,050
This is Hong Liang.

266
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,490
Hello.

267
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,220
Hello, Mr. Hong.

268
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,050
Hello, Mr. Wang.

269
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,140
Everything's ready. Please come in.

270
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,140
Her phone's already registered.

271
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,660
This one.

272
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,420
Please sign here.

273
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,380
Here you go.

274
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,770
Mr. Hong,

275
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,730
we go way back, in a way.

276
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,730
Vice Chairman Jiang Xudong
used to be my superior.

277
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,010
He's the one

278
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,490
who transferred me here.

279
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,570
Pleased to meet you.

280
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:08,810
You, too.

281
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,660
My name's Hong Liang,

282
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,380
and I'm her colleague.

283
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,290
I'll be asking you today.

284
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,570
Cooperate with me.

285
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,140
On what?

286
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,660
Thirteen years ago,

287
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,980
your Wanchuan Mining

288
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,010
was in this shooting case.

289
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:26,980
Right?

290
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,220
Two people died.

291
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,570
In the finance office.

292
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,660
It was ruled a robbery-homicide

293
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,730
at the time.

294
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,330
But

295
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,490
recently, I reviewed
and pieced this case back together.

296
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,700
I discovered that the motive

297
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,810
wasn't robbery.

298
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,940
It was murder all along.

299
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,860
Who was the target?

300
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,050
You.

301
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,530
And the men behind it

302
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,460
were Yu Tiancheng

303
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,250
and Chen Shenglong from Dacheng Mining,

304
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,810
which was next door

305
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,180
to Wanchuan Mining.

306
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,570
They sent Wang Dayou

307
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,140
to do the dirty work.

308
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,940
Wang Dayou
should've been the prime culprit,

309
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,220
but he got off as an accomplice.

310
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,810
Then he got out on medical parole
and was declared dead.

311
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,250
But the truth is that

312
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,420
he's still alive.

313
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,050
Then you got Dacheng Mining for free,

314
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,570
and in the following thirteen years,

315
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,420
you pretended it never happened.

316
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,730
Am I right?

317
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,900
What does a shooting
from thirteen years ago

318
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,620
have to do with my current sentence?

319
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,940
Seriously, who are you?

320
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,050
Like I said, I'm her colleague.

321
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,290
I'm from the Eleventh Division,

322
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,220
handling duty-related crimes.

323
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,420
I see.

324
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,010
You want to find
who was shielding that incident, right?

325
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,730
A piece of advice for you.

326
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,050
Know your place.

327
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,290
Wan Hai,

328
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,090
the prison gave you special permission.

329
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,490
You can video call

330
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,700
your son now.

331
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,660
You found him?

332
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,620
Ziyan.

333
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,090
You look even older.

334
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,900
What's with that frown?

335
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,460
Look at me.

336
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,570
You were right.

337
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,010
I'm a lucky guy,

338
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,380
and I'm not blind.

339
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,730
Do you know
where I've been hiding lately?

340
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,010
In our old mine tunnel.

341
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,770
It felt good.

342
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,010
Do you know why?

343
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,940
When I was a kid,

344
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,810
every time you got mad at me,

345
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,010
I'd run to the mine.

346
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,700
It was pitch black in there,

347
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,570
and I couldn't see a thing,

348
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,180
but I was never scared.

349
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,090
Because I knew

350
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,570
no matter where I hid, you'd find me

351
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,860
and give me a whooping.

352
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,420
You've always

353
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,050
been my backbone.

354
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,940
I miss you.

355
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,420
I'm waiting for you out here.

356
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,900
We'll be together again.

357
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,330
So just this time, listen to me.

358
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,290
Let's fight them

359
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,530
to the very end.

360
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,570
Eh…

361
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,700
Since the police

362
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,090
have found you,

363
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,250
do as they say.

364
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,660
I should go. I need to do something.

365
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,250
So, are you ready to cooperate now?

366
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,010
What do you want me to do?

367
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,250
Fine.

368
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,140
Since you've gotten this far,

369
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,010
I may as well tell you

370
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,700
what really happened back then.

371
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,490
I was the target

372
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,860
of that shooting.

373
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,250
Yu Tiancheng

374
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,570
wanted to kill me
in order to get my mine,

375
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,620
but I jumped out the window
and got away.

376
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,250
But I never could've foreseen

377
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,010
everything that followed.

378
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,860
A chief of Criminal Investigation Unit

379
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,730
and a prosecutor.

380
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,180
Mr. Yu,

381
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,010
you have some strong connections.

382
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,420
What, are they here to cover for you?

383
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,900
I'll sue both of them, too!

384
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,010
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

385
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,220
Don't push your luck.

386
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,250
Mr. Sun.

387
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,090
Mr. Sun.

388
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,250
Well,

389
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,420
Mr. Wan,

390
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,250
you need to think it through

391
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,900
if you want money or revenge?

392
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,940
This is my reply:

393
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,180
it isn't over.

394
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,330
At this point,

395
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,940
we should stop.

396
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,770
Jiang Yuan,

397
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,420
go overseas.

398
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,140
So should you.

399
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,090
My entire business is here.

400
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,940
How can I leave?

401
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,700
You want me to go abroad?

402
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,220
What am I gonna do there?

403
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,490
Your precious son

404
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,490
burned through

405
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,050
300 million of mine in three years.

406
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,420
I gave him whatever he wanted,

407
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,220
every piece of land he's ever asked for.

408
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,420
And now?

409
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,090
Things go south,

410
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,660
and you wanna run away?

411
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,660
Fine.

412
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,050
Give me back the 300 million.

413
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,940
Yu, who do you think you're talking to?

414
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,770
I'm talking to you, you little brat.

415
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,460
Do you think my money grows on trees?

416
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,700
Give me the money.

417
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,180
Give it to me, and I'm gone.

418
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,330
If not,

419
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,660
no one's leaving.

420
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,860
Yu Tiancheng,

421
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,700
do you think it's still the old days,

422
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,490
where a few phone calls

423
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,860
could settle everything?

424
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,180
If you don't leave,

425
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,460
you'll be done for.

426
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,180
Then we'll all go down together.

427
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,900
I'm not bluffing.

428
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,420
No one wants to die, right?

429
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,220
Run? Where to?

430
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,700
You only have your precious son
to blame.

431
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,420
He started all this.

432
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,420
He was the one who wanted that mine
no matter the cost.

433
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,380
Because

434
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,620
you said the mine was yours!

435
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,180
Ask your dad

436
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,940
whose mine it really was!

437
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,420
Mr. Jiang,

438
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,050
you told us to give Wan Hai that mine.

439
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,330
The copper and nickel
were found in that mine.

440
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,770
Remember that,

441
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,220
Mr. Jiang?

442
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,420
It was you

443
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,460
who ordered me

444
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,660
to give the mine away.

445
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,460
Jiang Yuan, I should really

446
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,140
thank you

447
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,900
for getting that mine back to me.

448
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,490
You old bastard, you screwed me over!

449
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,980
Jiang Yuan,

00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,050
sit down.

451
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,570
Fine.

452
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,420
Yu Tiancheng,

453
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,140
if you

454
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,980
really appreciate

455
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,980
what Jiang Yuan's done for you,

456
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,220
just let him go.

457
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,420
Mr. Jiang,

458
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,980
we're all in the same boat now.

459
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,980
If it sinks,

460
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,140
we all go down.

461
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,570
And then what?

462
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,490
Right now,

463
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,180
only you

464
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,460
can pull us all out of this.

465
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,900
Listen, if I want to leave,
you can't stop me.

466
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,290
I'd like to see you try!

467
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,220
Go ahead. I dare you!

468
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,050
- Go on!
- Yu Tiancheng.

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,490
Mark my words,

470
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,140
I'll never be on the same boat with you.

471
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,420
Jiang Xudong, what did you say?

472
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,050
Jiang Xudong, what did you say?

473
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,530
Sir,

474
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,900
please sit down.

475
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,810
Calm down, sir.

476
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,330
Mr. Jiang,

477
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,010
you want to know

478
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,420
whether we're in this together or not?

Listen to this.

481
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,010
I understand there's some bad blood
between you two.

482
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,140
Disputes between mines are common,

483
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,570
but you two took it to the extreme.

484
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,860
This is

485
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,860
a grave matter

486
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,530
and must be dealt with

487
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,810
by law.

488
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,660
Considering that both your companies

489
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,090
are pillars of our city's economy,

490
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,810
with the government aiming
to protect your businesses,

491
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,050
we encourage you to settle your disputes
before they escalate.

492
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,050
The reason I came here

493
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:46,980
is to help

494
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,290
settle this issue.

495
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:53,860
So, Mr. Yu,

496
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,530
you need to give the Dacheng Mining

497
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,220
to Mr. Wan without compensation,

498
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,700
and

499
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,860
leave Dongping

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,090

And Mr. Wan,

503
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,380
you need to

504
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,900
consider the matter settled

505
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,330
and let it go.

506
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,330
I'm busy,

507
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,460
so tell me what you think.

508
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,770
Mr. Jiang,

509
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,530
you're really ruthless.

510
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,770
You're kicking me out of Dongping?

511
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,490
You can refuse it.

512
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,010
But remember.

513
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,290
I'm the only one who can help you.

514
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,860
Otherwise, you're a convicted murderer.

515
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,330
Prison or leaving Dongping.

516
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,330
Your choice.

517
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,570
I can accept it,

518
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,250
but you must

519
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,620
do me another favor.

520
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,660

do this for you.

00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,530
honestly, this has nothing to do
with Mr. Yu.

00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,140
I recorded this by accident.

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,490

Since it was Mr. Jiang,

577
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,860
I called him back on my phone.

578
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,980
He said your daughter

579
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,980
needs to get a vaccine,

580
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,180
but he couldn't find
the vaccination certificate.

581
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,490
He's in a hurry.

582
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,290
Okay.

583
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,250
It was in the…

584
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,290
Ms. Zheng,

585
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,140
so you found my son?

586
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,810
You saw him.

587
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,980
You promised me you'd keep him safe.

588
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,530
I will.

589
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:10,940
Go on.

590
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,980
Mr. Hong,

591
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,900
I do appreciate your presence.

592
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,490
It's been over ten years,

593
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,980
and you still care.

594
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,460
That means you genuinely want
to clear my name.

595
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,730
Wan Hai,

596
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,050
let's skip the pleasantries.

597
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,250
Just walk me through
what really happened back then,

598
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,770
alright?

599
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,700
Here's what I think.

600
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,730
It's been

601
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,420
over a decade,

602
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,530
and there were too many people

603
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,980
and things involved.

604
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,460
I can't just talk off the cuff.

605
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,420
I need time to sort it all out.

606
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,570
Can I put it down in writing

607
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,330
and give it to you?

608
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,010
Is that okay?

609
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,700
How long do you think

610
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,660
you'll need?

611
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,050
At the very least, a day or two.

612
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,660
I'm not a literate guy,

613
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,140
but I'll try, I promise.

614
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,490
Alright then, Wan Hai.

615
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,490
I hope

616
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,050
you'll use just a day or two

617
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,330
to carefully recall

618
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,220
what happened thirteen years ago

619
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,860
and write it all down in your statement.

620
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,810
Once you're done,

621
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,900
please notify

622
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,010
the prison's prosecutor at once,

623
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,530
and we'll come as soon as we can,

624
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,250
okay?

625
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,330
I'll start as soon as I get back.

626
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:19,900
Good.

627
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:25,770
Mr. Wang,

628
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:26,570
take care.

629
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,140
Thank you.

630
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,140
- Thank you.
- Of course.

631
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,570
Alright.

632
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:30,860
Thank you.

633
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,730
We need to

634
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,250
go back to Haizhou.

635
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,180
- Why?
- To brief the higher-ups.

636
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,490
About what?

637
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,290
About merging the shooting case
with Wan Hai's.

638
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,010
But we don't have
his written statement yet.

639
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,490
So you've been secretly
recording everything?

640
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,820
Don't worry.

641
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,340
No one's getting away.

642
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,210
Keep going down.

643
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,380
Did you go the other way?

644
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,940
If I keep going down,

645
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,090
I'll walk into the lake.

646
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,900
Look to your right.

647
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,210
I said right.

648
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,570
That's your left. Look right.

649
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,300
Don't you know your left from right?

650
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:35,880
[Here Rests Qiao Zhenxing]

651
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,690
You seem to have a lot of free time.

652
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,460
Yeah,

653
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,740
not much going on.

654
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,780
My son's at his grandma's,

655
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,260
your team's got my wife,

656
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,900
and I don't need to worry about work.

657
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,300
What about you?

658
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,780
Just waiting around.

659
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,820
Why'd you want to meet here?

660
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,090
I was too busy

661
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,530
to come here before.

662
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,650
You haven't been here either, right?

663
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,460
I wanted to come and see him,

664
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,650
but I was afraid he'd come out
and smack me,

665
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,980
so I dragged you along to stop him.

666
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,780
Would've served you right if he had.

667
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,460
I've been home with nothing to do,

668
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,650
just going over everything in my head.

669
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,340
And I started counting

670
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,900
how many cases I've handled

671
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,260
in over twenty years
of being a prosecutor.

672
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,690
But I couldn't figure it out.

673
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,380
But I'll

674
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,010
never forget

675
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,090
the Wan Hai case.

676
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,690
That case's the reason Qiao is here

677
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,740
and my wife's at your department.

678
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,980
I used to believe

679
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,380
that the prosecutor's uniform

680
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,740
stood for something greater.

681
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,340
It wasn't just a set of clothes.

682
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,130
It was a symbol

683
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,780
of pride and honor.

684
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,650
I don't feel like that anymore.

685
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,860
It's a heavy thing

686
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,650
to wear that uniform.

687
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,460
Wearing it

688
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,170
means responsibility.
It means you can't make mistakes.

689
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,130
Because if you do,

690
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,610
someone

691
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,210
would die.

692
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,300
But who never

693
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,780
makes mistakes?

694
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,650
So, honestly,

695
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,010
now I feel

696
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,340
this weight off my shoulders.

697
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,940
I feel

698
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,490
relieved.

699
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,460
Just say it.

700
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,460
What are you getting at? Spit it out.

701
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,300
I mean it literally.

702
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,530
What's your real point?

703
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,530
I'm just saying,

704
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,210
no one's perfect.

705
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,490
Everyone makes mistakes.

706
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:56,980
Of course,

707
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,860
some do it on purpose,
but some don't mean it.

708
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,380
Hong Liang,
even you might make mistakes.

709
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,170
My biggest mistake is meeting you.

710
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,740
You know Jiang Yuan, too.

711
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,170
What do you mean?

712
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,780
Jiang Yuan is working with Yu Tiancheng,

713
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,570
and Yu Tiancheng
is Chen Shenglou's boss.

714
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,820
I assume you already know that.

715
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,170
Who told you that?

716
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:39,980
Wang Yu

717
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,740
told me before he died.

718
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,530
You really

719
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,340
are something else.

720
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,940
Using a dead guy to cover yourself?

721
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,940
I swear, he said it to me
right before he died.

722
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,300
That's why I didn't report it.

723
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,210
There was no way to prove it.

724
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,690
I've given you the lead.

725
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,010
You decide what to do with it.

726
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,010
Fine.

727
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,170

728
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,570
if that's true,

729
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,420
I'll report it,

730
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,380
and we will investigate it thoroughly.

731
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,530
I'm not trying to stir the pot.

732
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,460
I've just been cooped up at home,

733
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,610
with all this stuff bottled up.

734
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,460
Who knows when I'll see you again,

735
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,420
so I had to get it off my chest.

736
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,780

I bet they've got a lot to say.

739
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,530
I keep thinking about

740
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,460
whether he felt wronged,

741
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,940
not just by how he died,

742
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,570
but because he must've

743
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,010
felt very hurt at the time.

744
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,380

were working on that case.

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,980
And now?

765
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,490
Now,

766
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,170
the one who was right is buried here.

767
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,010
So you're saying

768
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,780
I'm the reason Qiao's here?

769
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,610
If blame's due,

770
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,300
then it's on the both of us.

771
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,090
Are you sure

772
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,780
Wang Yu really told you that?

773
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,300
Otherwise I would've reported it already.

774
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,210
This is a serious case.

775
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,260
I've already reported it to Mr. Yan

776
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,820
and merged the shooting case

777
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,050
with the Wan Hai case.

778
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,740
We must

779
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,340
thoroughly investigate

780
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,820
all the connections

781
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:03,900
between these two cases.

782
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,090
Think about

783
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,090
how many wrongdoings

784
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,300
Yu Tiancheng

785
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,740
and Chen Shenglou

786
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,490
have committed?

787
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,570
And how did they pull that off?

788
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,820
You know as well as I do

789
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,170
there had to be a protector

790
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,010
covering for them,

791
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,650
twisting facts,

792
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,940
even releasing prisoners.

793
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,050
It's simply audacious.

794
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,130
Hong Liang,

795
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,210
as a backbone of the Eleventh Division,

796
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,380
whatever we uncover,

797
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,570
no matter who or how far we have to go,

798
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,010
we must get to the bottom of this.

799
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,210
I understand.

800
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,780
These are special circumstances.

801
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,570
We can take risks

802
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,900
but must always
respect the bounds of the law.

803
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,650
I understand.

804
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,570
By the way, Hong Liang,

805
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,490
isn't there a personal matter

806
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,650
you need to report?

807
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,260
Go ahead.

808
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,010
Yeah.

809
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,650
Don't be so nervous. Sit down.

810
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,980
No, thanks.
I'm more comfortable standing.

811
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,980
Alright, go ahead.

812
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,050
It's about

813
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,090
the shooting case.

814
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,300
It was over a decade ago,

815
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:06,650
and I was young

816
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,460
and inexperienced,

817
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,650
so I… I… I didn't…

818
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,050
Hong Liang,

819
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:11,940
are you sure

820
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,980
you're ready to talk?

821
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,820
I… I… not only thought it through,

822
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,780
I… I actually

823
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,740
already drafted

824
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,380
a full written statement

825
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,090
explaining everything.

826
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,010
The other day,

827
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,090
in this very office,

828
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,610
I was about to turn it in

829
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,010
when Ms. Zheng barged in

830
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,210
and completely threw me off.

831
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,420
I wasn't honest,

832
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,170
and it was because…

833
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,010
So you're saying

834
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,420
it's Ms. Zheng's fault?

835
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,380
No, I wouldn't dare.

836
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,650
I… I… just wasn't ready.

837
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,340
And I couldn't organize my thoughts.

838
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,780
Sure, you couldn't

839
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,690
organize your thoughts,

840
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,740
but your written words remain solid.

841
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,650
This

842
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,530
should be your report,

843
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,940
correct?
