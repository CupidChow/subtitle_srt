Man, what's this place called?

00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,900
Why are you here
if you don't know where it is?

I sincerely ask

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,580

and handle this.

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,130
Ran,

21
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,060
you are older now,

22
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,260
you've got to learn

23
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,610
to face things bravely.

24
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,730
Let me see.

25
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,570
What happened to your hand?

26
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,100
Tell me.

27
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,610
What happened?

28
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,890
My classmates saw that video.

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,290
They said bad things about my dad.

30
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,730
My father is a good man.

31
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,980
He's not corrupt.

32
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,340
He's not.

34
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,170
tell me,

35
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,130
did my dad really do it?

36
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,890
Of course not.

37
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:49,980
Ran,

38
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,690
the older you are,
the more you will find

39
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,570
a lot of things in this world

40
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,940
are not like what you think.

41
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,540
So you must always believe

42
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,260
your father is the best man
in the world.

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,630
Zhou Mei, the case has
already been decided.

44
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,580
The best thing for Qiao now

45
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,630
is to let him rest in peace.

46
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,460
You and Ran still
have a life to live,

47
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,140
don't you?

48
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,340
I'll accept everything else.

49
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,140
But,

50
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,110
if you don't do
this memorial meeting for him,

51
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,750
I'm not signing it.

52
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,870
If you do,

53
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,870
I'll sign this.

54
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,430
Zhou Mei, I know it's hard for you.

55
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,230
Zhou Mei, we need to

56
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,230
think about this rationally.

57
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,670
Leave.

58
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,110
I hope you can really calm down.

Mr. Li,

62
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,460
since it has come to this,

63
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,190
I think you should go back first.

64
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,940
Leave it to us.

65
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,550
When there's a conclusion,

66
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,230
I'll report to you right away.

Zhou Mei,

71
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,870
if you

72
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,430
refuse to sign this,

73
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,700
by law,

74
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,510
we, the Police, will have to

75
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,260
handle the remains ourselves.

76
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,670
Let me explain this to you.

77
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,900
If the cause of death
has been determined,

78
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,940
and there's no need to keep the body,

79
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,340
we notify the family to claim it.

80
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,630
If we can't reach the family,

81
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,110
or the family refuses to claim the body,

82
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,930
approved by the person in charge
of the public security organs

83
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,750

84
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,780

you go back first.

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:18,990
Speak.

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,430
Mr. Li,

92
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,580
Zhou Mei signed it.

93
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,990
Okay, I see.

94
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,260
Hello?

95
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,140
I

96
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,380
just came out of Qiao's place.

97
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,070
That's it.

98
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,510
This case

99
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,630
is closed.

100
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,070
Define 'closed'.

101
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,940
How else could it be?

102
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,990
Suicide to escape punishment.

103
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,820
I think,

104
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,550
Zhou Mei still

105
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,430
wants to do a memorial meeting for him.

106
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,940
When the date is set,

107
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,550
I think we can go together.

108
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:24,820
Is it okay?

109
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,460
Let's...

110
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,990
talk about it later.

111
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,310
What do you mean 'later'?

112
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,780
We go together.

113
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,700
Together.

114
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,630
See him off one last time.

115
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,950
Then this is over.

116
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:42,870
Okay?

117
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,630
Okay.

118
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,110
Let's leave it at that.

120
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,540
Did it go well?

121
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,230
Well, not well, whatever.

122
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,510
Let's not talk about it.

123
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,020
Mr. Li,

124
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,300
I want to reflect on myself too.

125
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,020
I worked with Qiao for so long,

126
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,780
why didn't I notice anything?

127
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,060
When it comes to party discipline,

128
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,630
I let things slide.

129
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,420
I'm responsible too.

130
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,870
It has nothing to do with you.

131
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,830
I just can't figure it out

132
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,380
how Qiao

133
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,510
became like this.

134
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,540
Actually I am with you,

135
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,950
I couldn't figure it out either.

136
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,420
Then my wife said something,

137
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:32,990
and it dawned on me.

138
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,380
She said people

139
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,300
change.

140
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,350
But what happened to Qiao

141
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,260
was a wake-up call for me.

142
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,260
We're law enforcement,

143
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,420

144
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,420
We must always be vigilant,

145
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,110
always guard against
corruption creeping in.

146
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,300

Of course not.

all I want is
to ease into my retirement.

Right?

171

Smoke.

173
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,420
Does your halo come with threads?

174
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,950
Incense? Could it be incense?

Who burns mosquito coils in this season?

176
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,710
Or did Qiao burn incense to pray

177
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,660
before he committed suicide?

178
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,020
It's obviously smoke,
it can only be smoke.

179

no butts, no lighters,
no packs of cigarettes.

Not a trace of cigarettes.

194
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,950
a smoker.

195
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,300
Mr. Hong, don't scare us.

196
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,350
Why would I scare you?

197
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,300
When I came up with this,

198
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,870
I broke out in goosebumps.

199
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,540
What does that mean?

200
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,060
It only means one thing

201
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,060
that Qiao

202
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,020
was killed by someone.

203
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,870
Hold on, Hong Liang.

204
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,900
Why are you here?

205
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,110
Shouldn't you be giving
an interim report

206
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,060
to the leadership?

207
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,380
Don't get me started. It was so close.

208
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,300
Zhang was driving,

209
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,260
we were seven minutes from
exiting the highway into Haizhou.

210
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,510
Take care of yourselves.

211
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,420
Stay well.

212
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,300
Huai'en,

213
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,510
pull over for a bit.

214
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,470
Okay.

215
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,510
I noticed the clue in time,

216
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,140
responded, made a quick judgment,

217
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,780
and acted immediately.

218
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,510
Then I said "Zhang,

219
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,110
take the nearest exit.

220
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,060
Exit, turn around,

221
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,260
head straight back here!"

222
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,420
Don't turn around.

223
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,300
Drive straight forward.

224
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,950
Go report to the leadership.

225
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,380
I can't...

226
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,180
That's supposed to be an interim report.

227
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,020
What if the leaders see that

228
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,060
the investigation is incomplete,

229
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,140
I've got doubts and twists?

230
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,900
They'll think you're sloppy

231
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,750
in your work.

232
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,300
Right?

233
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,260
And then they might...

234
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,140
You noticed this clue on the road,

235
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,230
right?

236
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,420
So the leadership won't blame you.

237
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,420
You should've reported it right away.

238
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,060
Then, take off your uniform,
head straight to Beijing,

239
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,420
get a tripled salary,

240
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,870
start a new life.

241
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,020
Ms. Zheng,

242
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,830
looks like you still don't know me.

243
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,660
You know,

244
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,750
broadly speaking,

245
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,470
I'm a collectivist.

246
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,510
Why did I turn around willingly

247
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,750
when I found this clue?

248
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,020
You think it was just for myself?

249
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,230
I am willing to share these experiences

250
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,140
with the whole Guidance Group,

251
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,540
with all my comrades.

252
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,750
Someday,

253
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,710
when the leadership sees this,

254
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,420
what would they say?

255
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,590
They'll say "Under Yaping's leadership,
the Guidance Group

256
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,950
overcame this difficulty,

257
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,020
discovered this clue,

258
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,260
and finally solved the case."

259
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,830
That's my intention.

260
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,870
Okay.

261
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,420
I hear you.

262
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,470
On behalf of the Guidance Group,
I would like to thank you.

263
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,950
We will try our best to
overcome this difficulty.

264
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,540
You can go now.

265
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:03,260
Right.

266
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,870
Sometimes you just have to let go.

267
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,060
Give our fellow comrades a chance

268
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,670
to grow up, practice, and learn.

269
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,540
Good work.

270
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:20,780
Ms. Zheng,

271
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,860
good luck.

272
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:22,860
Mr. Hong,

273
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,390
your room's ready.

274
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,540
Still the same one.

275
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,430
You guys aren't leaving?

276
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,230
Yeah.

277
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:29,950
Here is your room key.

278
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,020
Hong Liang,

279
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,950
when you get serious,
you do look like a prosecutor.

280
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,190
Not too bad.

281
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,780
Mr. Hong, you've had a long day.

282
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,710
Get some rest.

283
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,060
Looks like me staying longer

284
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,540
is quite worth it.

285
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,330
[Want to know the truth
about Qiao Zhenxing's death?]

286
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,990
Want to know the truth
about Qiao Zhenxing's death?

287
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,510
I don't even know this guy.

288
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,910
How should I reply?

289
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,380
[Want to know the truth
about Qiao Zhenxing's death?]

290
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,270
[Meet me tomorrow at 10 AM,
under Dayinggou Bridge.]

291
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:32,330
[Come alone.]

292
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,820
Meet me tomorrow at 10 AM,
under Dayinggou Bridge.

293
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,260
Come alone.

294
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,150
That's creepy.

295
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,580
Qiao died on that very water.

296
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,100
Me going alone?

297
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,710
Hong Liang,

298
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,060
man up.

299
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,610
[8 March]

300
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:03,130
[Day 11
Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

301
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,860
Dayinggou Bridge.

302
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:16,910
This one.

303
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,260
That one over there.

304
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,540
There's one there.

305
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,020
Where?

306
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,670
There.

307
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,020
Let's go.

308
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,470
What's wrong? You're not coming?

309
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,820
It told you to go alone.

310
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:06,580
I don't know them.

311
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,510
What if I die here?

312
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,340
Mr. Hong,

313
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,620
I can go with you, no problem.

314
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,060
But if they see
there are two of us,

315
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,060
and they keep their mouth shut?
This whole trip would be a waste.

316
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,340
Then stay close to Mr. Hong.

317
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,580
I'll stay close.

318
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,150
This close.

319
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,540
Not now, stay close later.

320
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,950
If things go down, rush to help me.

321
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,390
Got it. I will.

322
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:26,910
Where's the car key?

323
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,750
I mean, it's just two steps away.

324
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,390
You want to drive there?

325
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:32,670
Kid,

326
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,190
you don't know
half the things that I know.

327
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,580
I'm just worried
you'll get too comfortable

328
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,620
in the car,

329
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,780
and fail to save me.

330
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,780
My down jacket is still in it.

331
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,100
Got your phone?

332
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,100
Yeah.

333
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,820
Then you're fine.

334
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,780
It's cold, man.

335
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,300
Shallow water.

336
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,390
Any fish there?

337
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,470
Man, what's this place called?

338
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,230
Why are you here
if you don't know where it is?

339
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,100
Invited by a friend.

340
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,470
Came all the way from Dongping?

341
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,300
It takes one and a half hours
to drive here.

342
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,300
Did you walk?

343
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,390
I parked my car over there.

344
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:53,860
Thinking that I'd check out the view.

345
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,710
Hong Liang,

346
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,620
Prosecutor from 11th Division of Haidong
Provincial People's Procuratorate,

347
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,620
deputy leader of the Guidance Group
stationed in Dongping.

348
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,620
Is it you?

349
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,750
Who are you?

350
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,430
What do you mean? Acting all mysterious?

351
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,750
I told you to come alone.

352
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,820
What do you mean?

353
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,820
Well, can we talk this out?

354
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:28,780
I mean,

355
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,100
I'm a government official.

356
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,060
I have to be cautious

357
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,950
and play it safe.

358
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,470
I didn't call the Police.

359
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,230
I just had a driver driving me here.

360
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,150
It's not...

361
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,470
Ma Chongyang.

362
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,010
[Ma Chongyang
Warden of Dongping No.2 Prison]

363
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,670
Warden of Dongping No.2 Prison.

364
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,430
You're with the prison?

365
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,430
You didn't read the text?

366
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,100
I did.

367
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,150
I told you,

368
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,340
I just wanted to

369
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,100
talk to you about Qiao Zhenxing.

370
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,260
OK, then.

371
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,750
Qiao and I were good friends.

372
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,750
We

373
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:40,950
used to fish here all the time.

374
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:42,910
Why are you so late?

375
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,820
I went to meet Wan Hai's new lawyer.

376
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,820
I saw someone there.

377
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,390
Still working on that case?

378
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,190
They have removed you.

379
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,540

the transfer
of Dongping Freight Station

It's possible that
both sides agreed to it.

460

Wan Hai definitely
didn't force that deal.

461

00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,150
Maybe that's what got him killed.

564
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,030
Zhang Wenjing shouted

565
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,980
the same thing in court.

566
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:37,980
Zhang Wenjing

567
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,980
cried out for justice.

568
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,350
Wan Hai case.

569
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,190
The death of Qiao.

570
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,590
Can I link all three together?

571
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:50,980
Because

572
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,220
Ma Chongyang

573
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,350
mentioned all three

574
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,310
in that same letter.

575
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,470
When Qiao was on this case,

576
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,860
he must've thought

577
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,540
Zhang Wenjing
didn't belong in it.

578
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,510
So he dug deeper and found,

579
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,620
not just Zhang Wenjing,

580
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,100
even Wan Hai isn't a criminal.

581
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,150
He kept digging.

582
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,300
When he was very close to the truth,

583
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,030
he got...

584
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,740
I agree

585
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,390
with you connecting all three cases.

586
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,420
Then tell me,

587
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:31,510
who killed him?

588
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:34,420
Who?

589
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:41,470
Whose

590
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:42,830
profits

591
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:45,910
did

592
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,660
Qiao

593
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:48,980
threaten?

594
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:51,470
But, Ms. Zheng,

595
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,390
I don't really know
the details of the case.

596
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:55,950
Maybe you should...

597
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:20,470
Wan Hai.

598
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,830
Qiao Zhenxing took Wan Hai's money,

599
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,740
but didn't really help him.

600
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,030
So Wan Hai sent someone to take revenge.

601
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,100
Alright, boss, allow me to

602
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,180
challenge that logic for a second.

603
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,270
You're saying that Wan Hai

604
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:36,950
gave him the money,

605
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,300
asked him to get things done,

606
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,180
he didn't deliver.

607
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:41,620
Then,

608
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,420
why didn't Wan Hai just send someone

609
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,910
to get the money back?

610
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,590
Why go as far as killing him?

611
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,590
Killing one more person

612
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,620
would only prove

613
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,150
he is truly a gangster.

614
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:52,980
And if he wanted revenge,

615
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,350
he wouldn't target Qiao,

616
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,350
because Qiao kept saying
Wan Hai is not a gangster.

617
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,660
Then who should he go after?

618
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,030
How about Xie?

619
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,150
So, boss, I think Wan...

620
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,420
Right.

621
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,710
Wang Yu.

622
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,590
Wanchuan Freight Hub originally
belonged to Wang Yu.

623
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,270
He's also the one
who first accused Wan Hai

624
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,420
of violently

625
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,150
taking the place from him.

626
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,780
If Wan Hai's conviction went through,

627
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:31,980
that hub

628
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,300
would go back to Wang Yu.

629
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,740
But,

630
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,470
Qiao requested
supplemental investigation twice,

631
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,540
which almost stopped the case
from being prosecuted.

632
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,620
So, to Wang Yu,

633
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,420
Qiao Zhenxing

634
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,220
was standing in the way of his fortune.

635
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,540
The latter part makes perfect sense.

636
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,300
But the front part,

637
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,070
there could be a logical problem.

638
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,910
Now that Xie's taken over,

639
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,620
and Qiao's been removed,

640
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,780
why would Wang Yu

641
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,350
still go after him?

642
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,510
Why not just wait for Xie

643
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:02,780
to label Wan Hai

644
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,150
a hardcore gangster?

645
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:05,980
Then he'd get

646
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,350
his Freight Hub back.

647
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,910
So, maybe Wang didn't do it...

648
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:11,910
Start over from the beginning.

649
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,620
A responsible prosecutor gets removed

650
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,070
and replaced by one
with a disregard of the law!

651
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,540
A legal defense lawyer
gets labeled a gangster!

652
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,150
The so-called evidence doesn't hold up!

653
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,350
Witness statements keep changing!

654
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,980
The chain of evidence doesn't add up!

655
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,180
Why rush a case like this

656
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,030
to trial?

657
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,070
For political achievement?

658
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,780
Or was someone paid off?

659
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:50,180
Hong Liang,

660
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,710
you're from Eleventh Division,

661
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,660
but you're not thinking big enough.

662
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,710
What's the nature of Wan Hai case?

663
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:08,740
A major case

664
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,860
for Dongping, Haidong, even nationwide.

665
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,980
If they succeed?

666
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,950
It becomes a shining example

667
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,470
for Dongping, Haidong,
and the whole country.

668
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,140
What if they fail?

669
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,380
Then it'll be

670
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,020
a national disgrace.

671
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,500
Qiao Zhenxing got removed,

672
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,790
but still didn't give up.

673
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:31,070
He kept pushing to overturn the case.

674
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,430
If Qiao failed,

675
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,430
they get their shining example.

676
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,710
If Qiao succeeded,

677
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,100
they get their national disgrace.

678
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,790
So, Hong Liang,

679
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:47,590
tell me,

680
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,950
whose profits

681
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,020
did Qiao Zhenxing really threaten?

682
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,350
If,

683
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,620
just if,

684
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,740
certain people in Dongping,

685
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,100
there's someone

686
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,980
protecting Wang Yu.

687
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,350
They worked together

688
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,550
to turn Wan Hai into a criminal.

689
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,070
That way, Wang Yu could get back

690
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,740
the Freight Hub he used to run.

691
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,370
If all of that is true,

692
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,090
then Wang Yu

693
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,610
is the one who killed Qiao Zhenxing.

694
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,570
And the person backing Wang Yu

695
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,090
is the one who got
Qiao Zhenxing removed.

696
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,450
Your old classmate.

697
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,260
If

698
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,370
Qiao was clean,

699
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,730
and Li Renjun was the problem,

700
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,940
Qiao's death had something
to do with Li Renjun,

701
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,540
What would you think?

702
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,370
If.

703
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,820
All of this is just 'if'.

704
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,730
Although your theory was quite bold.

705
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,210
Boss.

706
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,090
Don't overthink it.
Definitely impossible.

707
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,940
Definitely. That's not realistic.

708
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,730
Seriously. I mean...

709
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,400
[9 March]

710
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,440
[Day 12
Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

711
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,170
You really know how to pick a place.

712
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,610
Why are you sleeping in my office?

713
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,860
It's not a hotel.

714
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,460
Couldn't sleep upstairs.

715
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,170
Actually, now that you're here,

716
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,820
saves me the trouble of calling.

717
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,210
The memorial meeting is this Saturday.

718
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,650
You're not leaving before then, are you?

719
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,490
We're thinking that

720
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,130
since you're heading back soon,

721
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,490
we should have a little farewell party

722
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,490
for your team.

723
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,860
Just at the canteen here.

724
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,490
Talk to your leader.

725
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,010
Have you decided
when you're heading back?

726
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,010
I'm just filling a seat here.

727
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,650
This event is too big,

728
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,780
I can't make the call.

729
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,050
You gotta ask the big boss.

730
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,460
You didn't just come here
to sleep, did you?

731
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,090
What do you want? Spit it out.

732
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,490
I...

733
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,050
Mr. Li.

734
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,340
Mr. Hong.

735
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:36,980
Guan.

736
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,530
Everyone for the party meeting
is almost here.

737
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,420
You...

738
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,460
Mind if I borrow Mr. Li

739
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,010
for a bit?

740
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,420
Give me two minutes.

741
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,130
I'll be right there.

742
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,940
Okay.

743
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,050
- Tell them.
- You two go on.

744
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:50,820
OK.

745
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,690
Come on now, the clock is ticking.

746
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,090
What's this about?

747
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,940
You know Zhang Wenjing
withdrew her confession the other day,

748
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,340
putting us in a tough spot.

749
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,650
Everything stalled.

750
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,170
Then I had this thought,

751
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,980
and just kept thinking about all this.

752
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,490
What's Wang Yu's

753
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,210
real motive

754
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,340
for reporting Wan Hai?

755
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,300
His motive?

756
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,420
We thought about that before.

757
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,610
But think about it another way,

758
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:29,690
well,

759
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,050
there's no law

760
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,300
that says a report has to be

761
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,820
purely for justice.

762
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,260
Right?

763
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,420
People might report
for personal interests.

764
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,210
As long as it doesn't
affect fairness and justice,

765
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,740
there's nothing wrong with that.

766
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,050
Nothing wrong?

767
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,820
Why did Wang Yu report Wan Hai?

768
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,010
Fundamentally it's because

769
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,980
Wan Hai took his Freight Hub.

770
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,300
Then why didn't he report it back then?

771
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,900
Why wait all these years?

772
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,170
He's timid.

773
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,050
Afraid.

774
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,780
Wan Hai's a gangster, right?

775
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,260
Come on, timid...

776
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,860
Logically speaking,

777
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,380
you'd either report it or run.

778
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,740
But not only did he stay,

779
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,860
he even went to

780
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:10,940
work for Wan Hai.

781
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,300
Does he just love to
submit to a bully?

782
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,780
It's not about submission.

783
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,090
It's about weakness.

784
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,820
Besides,

785
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,090
Wan Hai paid him well.

786
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,050
The wages were good.

787
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,260
From Wan Hai's perspective,

788
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,210
he's a miner.

789
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,050
What does he know
about running a business?

790
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,610
No, I don't care about
Wan Hai's perspective.

791
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:24,940
I care about Wang Yu's.

792
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,170
What was he waiting for?

793
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,610
A chance for revenge.

794
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,940
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

795
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,170
He stayed close to Wan Hai,
waiting for his moment.

796
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,090
Then he had it.

797
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,380
What? What is it?

798
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:38,860
It's that...em...

799
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,530
the assault case at Wanjia Denghuo KTV.

800
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,570
See? Back to that again.

801
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:43,570
The assault happened,

802
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,940
the guys were arrested, sentenced.
Six months later,

803
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,340
Wang Yu suddenly
brings it up to report Wan Hai.

804
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,530
Don't you think that's strange?

805
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,980
Think about it.

806
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,380
If Wang Yu's problematic,

807
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:57,690
this whole Wan Hai case falls apart.

808
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,860
You should be clear on that by now.

809
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:00,780
