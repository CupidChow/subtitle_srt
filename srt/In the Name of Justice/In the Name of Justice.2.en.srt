00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,810
And who called you earlier?

574
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,980
You've been off since that call.

575
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,940
All distracted.

576
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,290
Zhenxing

577
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,770
is gone.

578
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,050
Gone?

579
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,620
Zhenxing?

580
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,050
He's dead.

581
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,700
Here?

582
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,770
Yes, right here.

583
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,140
Okay.

584
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,770
You go ahead. I need to make a call.

585
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,220
Please come in.

586
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,660
Alright, let's check it out first.

587
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:18,810
Okay.

588
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,700
Please.

589
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,700
Any updates?

590
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,660
The police called me.

591
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,730
They found an ice hole

592
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,140
upstream at Yongqing River.

593
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,570
Zhenxing's car,

594
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:36,810
bag,

595
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,770
and clothes were nearby.

596
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,380
So he fell in

597
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,620
and was washed downstream.

598
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,810
It's uncertain yet.

599
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,730
We'll have to...

600
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,810
We'll have to wait for
further police investigation.

601
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,940
How's Mei doing?

602
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,140
I can't even imagine how she's feeling.

603
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,090
It's just so sudden.

604
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,220
You should go visit them today

605
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,180
when you have time.

606
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,220
Keep an eye on Zhou Mei,

607
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,140
and Ran.

608
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,810
Talk to you later.

609
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,180
Alright.

610
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,330
You should go back to Dongping tomorrow.

611
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,330
I need to have lunch
with Mr. Zhang tomorrow.

612
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,860
I made a deal.

613
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,980
He will be my boss from now on.

614
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,620
Yuan went through great effort
to arrange this.

615
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,940
It wouldn't look good

616
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,660
if I reschedule it at the last minute.

617
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,140
He owes Yuan a favor.

618
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,810
I'll ask Yuan to tell him.

619
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,700
It's not a big deal.

620
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,980
He's already gone.

621
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,290
There's no need to go back.

622
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,900
I should just stay here
and finish what I came for.

623
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,250
It wouldn't feel right to leave.

624
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,730
The more I consider it,

625
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,140
the wiser you
and your father's advice seems.

626
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,420
So when I go back to Haizhou,

627
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,250
I'll ask Sun Xiangqun

628
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,980
to finalize my paperwork first thing.

629
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,730
Once it's done,

630
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,290
I'll bring Dou here
so she can start school.

631
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,700
And we'll bring your father here
as soon as he retires.

632
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,420
Our family will settle in Beijing.

633
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,010

635
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:10,860
That's right.

636
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,490
Cherish those before you.

637
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,620
You put it perfectly.

638
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,860
Is there something else?

639
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,250
I'll ask you again,

640
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,730
are you sure

641
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,250
you won't go back?

642
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,420
I did grant you leave.

643
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,140
I am sure.

644
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,050
I'll just save my days off.

645
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,900
What? How can you save your leave?

646
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,420
This is your only chance.

647
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,860

first,

652
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,010
I need to reflect on my mistakes.

The trial of Wan Hai-led

654
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,090

on the very first day of trial.

660

Our preparations

661
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,460
were inadequate

668
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,490
isn't a mafia member?

Zhang Wenjing's statements in court

671
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,490
were wild accusations

with no factual basis.

00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,010
Zhang Wenjing had repeatedly

00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,460
assisted the company

At first,

681
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,460
she refused to admit her crimes

682
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,770
and claimed

683
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,770
she was merely

684
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,250
a legal personnel at Wan Group,

685
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,330
and she only provided
legally neutral services

686
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,620
to the Wan Group.

687
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,660
She even stated that

688
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,220
she didn't know whether the company

00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,570
had committed crimes.

But in reality,

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,090

In truth,

00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,090
she was using her legal expertise

to help those criminals

not only disrupted the trial

707

but also deliberately
obscured the truth,

undermining the court's authority.

00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,380
This is a tactic of hers

with her legal expertise,

00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,860

with judicial process.

garner sympathy,

What's your take
on this accusation letter?

750
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,860
There's too much information,

751
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,730
and it's all disorganized.

752
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,700
What do you mean by "disorganized"?

753
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,050
The letter claims
Qiao Zhenxing was murdered

754
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,980
but doesn't specify by whom.

755
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,730
It accuses Li Renjun

756
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,010
of being the true protector
of Dongping's mafia,

757
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,380
and claims the Wan Group
isn't the real criminal organization,

758
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,570
which means

759
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,220
Dongping might have

760
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,900

Given China's continuously

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:39,570
By the way,

950
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,090
you're from Dongping, right?

951
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,300
Yes. I'm from Hongjia Village,
Dongping Development Zone.

952
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,380
My parents still live there,

953
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,490
so I go back often.

954
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,460
Dongping hasn't been
very peaceful recently, has it?

955
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,460
The Wan Hai case, right?

956
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,820
There's been another incident-

957
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,210
the death of Qiao Zhenxing.

958
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:04,650
Hong Liang,

959
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,570
have you heard about it?

960
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:07,780
What happened?

961
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,300
I... I don't know the details.

962
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,340
They called me

963
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,340
but they weren't very clear,
just that he drowned.

964
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,980
But I heard he was
very into fishing recently.

965
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,530
Perhaps that's what he was doing.

966
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,780
I think for ice fishing,
you need to chop a hole in the ice

967
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,780
at least this... this big.

968
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,170
Wasn't Qiao Zhenxing your college mate?

969
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,900
You must know him well.

970
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,860
Tell me about him.

971
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,050
He was the purest person I knew,

972
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,530
an idealist.

973
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,490
How so?

974
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,490
He was very clear

975
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,780
about his vision and goals.

976
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,740
He was set

977
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,650
on becoming a prosecutor,

978
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,420
and he really made it.

979
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,690
Back in freshman year,

980
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,610
the very first semester,

981
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,420
I remember asking him

982
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,260
while we were

983
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,490
fetching hot water,

984
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,210
I said, "Why are you
so set on being a prosecutor, man?"

985
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,690
And he answered,

986
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,260
"Because prosecutors are guardians

987
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,460
of justice and equity."

988
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,900
His hand was shaking

989
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,940
when he said this to me.

990
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,380
I looked down

991
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,980
and wanted to remind him

992
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,300
that he was burning himself
with hot water.

993
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,740
But then I noticed

994
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,650
the bold red characters
on his green thermos:

995
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,380
"Be impartial and selfless,

996
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,860
act with honor and integrity".

997
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,740
He had written that
on his thermos himself.

998
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,010
The hot water spilled over the thermos,

999
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,050
sending up

1000
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,650
curls of steam.

1001
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,610
In that moment,

1002
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,380
I felt that

1003
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,690
perhaps I too
should become a prosecutor.

1004
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,860
Who told you about Qiao Zhenxing?

1005
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,650
Li... Li Renjun,

1006
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,090
