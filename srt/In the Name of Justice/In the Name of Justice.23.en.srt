1
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,650
Because I

2
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,850
watched it happen—

3
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,900
those dozen miners

4
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,420
went down the shaft...

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,370
I don't know how far

6
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,820
that lift fell.

7
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,940
Dad!

8
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,900
Dad!

9
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:44,940
Dad!

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:45,900
Dad!

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,010
You know how deep that mine is?

12
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,690
How bad was this accident?

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,650
How many people
won't make it out this time?

[In the Name of Justice]

15
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,080
[Episode 23]

16
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,540
We're working to confirm
the exact number of casualties.

17
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,730
Right after the accident,

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,610
emergency crews, police, EMTs,

19
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,340
and firefighters were on the scene.

20
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,940
Rescue efforts are ongoing.

21
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,340
As you can see in this footage...

22
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,690
Hello?

23
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,500
Mr. Chen?

24
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,980
There was an accident at the mine.

25
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,340
Did you know?

26
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,260
What's it got to do with you?

27
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,820
Mind your own business.

28
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,980
The mine was

29
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,100
supposed to be shut down,

30
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,980
but management ignored the order

31
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,540
and forced everyone to keep working.

32
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,290
The cause is still under investigation.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,570
Sheng,

34
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,060
is there

35
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,380
any way

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,100
I can distance myself from Mr. Chen?

37
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,730
Mr. Chen...

38
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:26,730
Seriously,

39
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,130
man,

40
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,410
is there any way

41
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,500
I can distance myself from you?

42
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,130
Is it him or not?

43
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,260
Just tell me, is it him?

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,500
Can you honestly say it's not?

45
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,940
Has he gone insane?

46
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,570
That's murder!

47
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,540
Major crime!

48
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,570
Sooner or later, we'll be implicated!

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,220
Yu,

50
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm telling you,

51
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,170
starting now,

52
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,060
he can't be part
of anything we're doing!

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,980
We're running things from now on.

54
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,220
Say something!

55
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,730
Can you keep him in check or not?!

56
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,010
You...

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,170
Hello, sir.

58
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,850
License and registration, please.

59
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,850
Stop the car!

60
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:14,850
Pull over!

61
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,340
Stop looking.

62
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,410
I went to their winch workshop.

63
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,340
The winch hooks right up to the lift.

64
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,220
So,

65
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,900
after I loosened

66
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,490
the bolts on the brake pads,

67
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,540
the fluid started spraying everywhere—

68
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,900
soaked me head to toe.

69
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,780
And it wouldn't stop.

70
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:57,980
It just kept coming.

71
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,050
I didn't dare stick around.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,100
I got out of there as fast as I could.

73
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,780
I knew as soon

74
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,780
as that brake fluid was gone,

75
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,490
the lift would break loose!

76
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,810
Straight freefall.
The whole thing would crash.

77
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,730
Right now,

78
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,810
I don't know how far

79
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,340
that lift fell.

80
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:10,980
Long,

81
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,290
You know how deep that mine is?

82
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,930
How bad was this accident?

83
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,170
How many people
won't make it out this time?

84
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,580
I'm asking you!

85
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,460
How many people will die?

86
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,200
Here.

87
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,980
Take a sip.

88
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:36,930
Listen,

89
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,780
everyone's got their own fate.

90
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,850
Don't let this eat you up.

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,290
I told you before,

92
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,020
don't go about things

93
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,370
like this!

94
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,340
But you had to push it!

95
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,580
Now there's no turning back!

96
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,370
Back to where?

97
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,050
To Mr. Yu!

98
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,700
Well,

99
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,290
I never intended to go back anyway.

100
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,370
That's why I did what I did.

101
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,610
Think about it,

102
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,610
they've halted the auction.

103
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,290
Jiang Yuan can't get the mine,

104
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,930
so it's ours.

105
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,290
Mr. Yu

106
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,540
must know we're behind this.

107
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,250
So what do we say if he asks?

108
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,250
Why bother?

109
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,930
He already knows.

110
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,300
Let's just come clean,

111
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,460
see if he still backs Jiang Yuan now.

112
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,420

113
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,820

114

Dad!

115
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,100
Dad!

116
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,580
Sir.

117
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,650
Come in.

118
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,890
Hello, sir.

119
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,100
Take a seat.

120
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,850
I'd rather not, thanks.

121
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,460
Your blood pressure's already high,

122
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,460
don't get so worked up.

123
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,300
It doesn't help, does it?

124
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,180
It's not like I want to,

125
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,650
problems just keep piling up.

126
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,370
I've made some calls.

127
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,300
Don't worry,

128
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,250
the government's already
launching an investigation.

129
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,370
Can I just ask one thing?

130
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,940
Given everything that's happened,

131
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,420
what kind of legal trouble

132
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,130
is my son facing?

133
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,300
Too early to say.

134
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,700
The police are still looking into it.

135
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,220
Wan Hai,

136
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,180
let's just chat.

137
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,460
How long have you owned that mine?

138
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,010
Why do you ask?

139
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,250
Just curious.

140
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,130
Maybe 20 years or so.

141
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,420
That mine's always been busy, huh?

142
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,060
There was a shooting there
over a decade ago.

143
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,530
Two people died.

144
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,980
I'm sure you haven't forgotten.

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,890
Turns out, that case was mishandled.

146
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,100
The shooter back then

147
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,340
wasn't Sun Yihu, was it?

148
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,250
I couldn't say.

149
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,610
But I do know

150
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,370
there were two guys involved.

151
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,370
One got convicted, named Dahu.

152
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,060
Jiang Hongjun was the one in charge.

153
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,490
If you want answers, ask him.

154
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,940
Did you know Qiao's dead?

155
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,010
Why bring this up?

156
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,530
What are you getting at?

157
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,850
Before Qiao died,

158
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,100
he was digging into
the Wanchuan Mining Shooting.

[Thirteen Years Ago]

160
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,340
Hey,

161
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,610
I'm right next door.

162
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,420
Let me know

163
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:26,940
if you need anything.

164
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:27,980
Alright.

165
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,700
Okay, I'll let you guys work.

166
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,650
What are you up to?

167
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,370
Get them some water.

168
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,340
Yang,

169
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,650
since I'm already here,

170
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,300
can I get paid now?

171
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:48,820
No problem.

172
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,250
Pay him first.

173
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,610
Wan Hai!

174
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,820
What is it?

175
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,340
What's with the firecrackers in here?

176
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,460
Wan Hai's here!

[Finance Office]

178
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,420
Wan Hai!

179
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,940
What else do you know

180
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,650
about that shooting?

181
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,010
Nothing, I swear.

182
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,530
I'm feeling a bit dizzy...

183
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,180
After they closed our mine,

184
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,850
Chao

185
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,610
was desperate to reopen,

186
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,180
but the Mining Bureau

187
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,770
wouldn't even talk to us.

188
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,100
Has

189
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,370
that lift of yours

190
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,980
ever had problems before?

191
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,650
Never.

192
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,890
It was always kept in perfect condition.

193
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,650
You sure?

194
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,580
Definitely.

195
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,770
We do regular maintenance checks.

196
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,100
Regular maintenance checks?

197
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,890
When was the last one?

198
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,820
What date,

199
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,730
what time?

200
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,650
What did you check?

201
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,420
I know how things work over there.

202
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,010
"Regular checks"? Yeah right!

203
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,220
Have you seen Wan Chao
since the accident?

204
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,420
No.

205
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,940
Honestly, I'm more worried than you are.

206
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,980
Where could he be,

207
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,820
with everything that's happened?

208
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,340
It all happened so fast.

209
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,420
When's the last time you saw him?

210
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,300
Where were you?

211
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,220
I guess...

212
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,060
Yesterday.

213
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,730
We spoke on the phone yesterday.

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,180
It's my fault. We argued

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,850
a couple days back,

216
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,770
tried to meet up but he wouldn't see me.

217
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,010
Now this disaster hits,

218
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,220
and I have no clue where he is.

219
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,490
If anything's

220
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,300
happened to him,

221
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,770
how could I ever live with myself?

222
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,700
Are you saying

223
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,610
Wan Chao hasn't been at the mine lately?

224
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,820
I don't know.

225
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,530
I don't know

226
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,300
anything for sure right now.

227
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,420
I just hope

228
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,730
no more people die at that mine.

229
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,340
If they do, the Wan family

230
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,010
is finished for good.

231
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,730
You're not allowed
to leave Dongping while we investigate,

232
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,610
understood?

233
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,980
Sure,

234
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,420
I'm not going anywhere.

235
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,850
And if Wan Chao contacts you,

236
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,250
you tell us immediately.

237
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,300
Sure,

238
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,100
I will.

239
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,060
Everyone, the municipal party committee

240
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,530
held an emergency meeting
right after the accident.

241
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,340
We've gathered you here

242
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,580
to go over

243
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,100
their decisions

244
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,340
and outline

245
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,580
our next steps.

246
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,010
Liu Yun,

247
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,490
can you give us

248
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,060
an update on the casualties?

249
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,980
Seven miners are injured,

250
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,700
but out of danger.

251
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,180
Six are still in critical condition,

252
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,130
fighting for their lives.

253
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,300
Two were found with

254
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,180
no signs of life when rescued.

255
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,180
For the time being,

256
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,650
our top priority is helping the victims.

257
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,610
Make sure they get urgent care.

258
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,460
Liu Yun, I'm counting on you.

259
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,490
Understood.

260
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,300
Yanwu,

261
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,490
any word on the cause?

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,770
Preliminary investigation suggests

263
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,650
the hoist system of the lifting cage

264
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,340
was worn out,

265
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,850
creating major safety risks.

266
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,730
That's what caused the lift to fail

267
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,180
while it was in use.

268
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,250
Duo's so little.

269
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,700
Yeah, she's basically still a baby.

270
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,820
Hello?

271
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,820
Ms. Zhang Wenjing?

272
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,010
It's Wan Chao.

273
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,220
I need your help.

274
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,180
Chao?

275
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,580
I saw the news.

276
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,820
What happened this time?

277
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,370
Ms. Zhang,

278
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,220
can you help me?

279
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,250
How?

280
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,530
Go ask

281
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,700
the local authorities.

282
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,300
You know better than anyone

283
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,180
my dad was framed by those people.

284
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,530
Local cops now have me
on the wanted list!

285
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,060
How am I supposed to trust them?

286
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,370
I know you're a good lawyer.

287
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,370
It wasn't easy getting through to you,

288
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,050
you've got to...

289
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:36,900
Ma'am,

290
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,530
can I ask you about someone?

291
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,220
Have you seen this guy?

292
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:40,980
No.

293
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,380
Pick up!

294
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:05,860
Come on!

295
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,940
- Wan Chao, there's nothing I can do.
- I have proof!

296
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,140
I have proof!

297
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,420
The mine accident

298
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,460
was sabotage.

299
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,660
There's a cop

300
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,860
who tampered with the crime scene

301
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,090
and covered things up.

302
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,940
I have it on video.

303
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,490
And

304
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,250
it's been three years now.

305
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,460
Ms. Zhang,

306
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,050
they set my dad up as a gangster

307
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,010
just to take the mine from us.

308
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,570
You tried to help him

309
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,420
and they called you a gangster too.

310
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,180
Now I try,

311
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,940
and they want me dead.

312
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,860
Tell me, does justice
even exist anymore?

313
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,220
I just want to save my dad.

314
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,730
Ms. Zhang,

315
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,290
please help me.

316
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,050
Wan Chao,

317
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,570
where are you right now? Are you safe?

318
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,290
I'm stuck in Dongping.

319
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,420
The local police put out
a warrant on me.

320
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,700
I can't leave.

321
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,090
Listen,

322
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,860
I'll give you a number.

323
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,380
Contact her.

324
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,490
Sir,

325
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,700
can I ask you about someone?

326
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,900
Have you seen this person?

327
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,770
No.

328
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,570
Ma'am, is there a back door?

329
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,440
[As one of the lead prosecutors,
I was too eager for results…]

330
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,250
Mishandling a case

331
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,530
entails lifelong accountability.

332
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,770
Remember, Hong Liang,

333
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,180
compared to the long-term social

334
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,140
and legal impact of a wrongful case,

335
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,090
the consequences of personal mistakes

336
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,660
are insignificant.

337
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,760
[As one of the lead prosecutors,
I was too focused on redefining the case…]

338
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,380
Hong Liang.

339
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,330
Ms. Zheng.

340
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,700
Han,

341
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,050
would you give us a minute?

342
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,010
I need to speak with Mr. Hong privately.

343
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,090
Thanks.

344
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,620
Hong Liang.

345
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,700
It's been days since we talked.

346
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,180
The time's come.

347
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,900
We need to put together a report

348
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,570
and get Mr. Zhang's go-ahead

349
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,140
to set up an investigation group.

350
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,900
It is

351
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,090
an investigation group,
not a Guidance Group.

352
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,770
Why an investigation group?

353
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,660
Don't play dumb.
Haven't you seen the news?

354
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,460
Just write what I say.

355
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,730
Dear

356
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:34,900
Mr. Zhang,

357
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,330
in view of

358
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,090
the serious accident at Wanchuan Mining

359
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,980
and its major impact...

360
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,530
Accident

361
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,810
at Wanchuan Mining?

362
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,220
Hong Liang, you really don't know?

363
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,220
You haven't seen any news?

364
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,570
What have you even
been doing this whole time?

365
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,730
How are you completely
out of the loop on something this big?

366
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,380
How many casualties?

367
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,010
Two dead, thirteen injured.

368
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,530
Six are in critical condition.

369
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,290
I don't think

370
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,940
this was just some safety mishap.

371
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,460
They'll call it that

372
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,570
at the press conference,

373
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,290
but I don't buy it.

374
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,900
That's why we need Mr. Zhang

375
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,290
to set up an investigation group.

376
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,490
I can't let it go
until the truth comes out,

377
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,770
or I wouldn't be doing my job.

378
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,090
Come on,

379
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,050
keep writing.

380
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,860
Regarding the mine disaster...

381
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,380
Regarding

382
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,620
the mine disaster...

383
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,620
Shouldn't we wait for
Dongping's officials

384
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,180
to announce something

385
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,290
before stepping in?

386
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,380
Hong Liang,

387
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,980
remember how we used to

388
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,810
take bold guesses

389
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,090
during case work?

390
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,530
Can we really trust them?

391
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,140
We wait for their findings, seriously?

392
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,810
Come on.

393
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,620
Regarding the mine disaster...

394
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,810
Regarding the mine disaster...

395
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,620
I mean, I'm not even sure

396
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,530
I'm the right person for this.

397
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,530
The only reason

398
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,140
I joined the Guidance Group

399
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,010
is someone tipped us off

400
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,570
about duty-related crimes in Dongping,

401
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,460
some protectors shielding criminals.

402
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,620
It'd be awkward if I showed up now.

403
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,140
Hong Liang,

404
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,860
we both know

405
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,420
what's really going on in Dongping.

406
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,010
They broke up the old Guidance Group,

407
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,380
and now there's a mine disaster.

408
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,420
Are you telling me

409
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,330
there's no duty-related crime

410
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,620
or protection here in Dongping?

411
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,940
Keep writing.

412
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,090
Regarding the mine disaster...

413
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,090
Regarding my kid...

414
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,490
Look at me!

415
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,570
I mean,

416
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,180
my wife

417
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,940
kept me up last night,

418
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,250
stressing about

419
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,420
our kid's education—

420
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,940
telling me, "Liang,
as a father, aren't you concerned?"

421
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,420
Hong Liang,

422
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,660
you haven't done with your job, right?

423
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,010
No.

424
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,460
Then act like it.

425
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,330
My health is shot.

426
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,660
Lately, I don't know why,

427
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,090
I can't sleep at all.

428
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,330
What are you getting at?

429
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,140
Remember what you promised
before we left Dongping?

430
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,620
If things ever turned around here,

431
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,860
you'd come back to help, uniform or not,

432
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,090
wherever, whenever, no questions asked.

433
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,980
Am I wrong?

434
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,380
Changed your mind now?

435
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,900
You don't want to step up,

436
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,290
or is it just fear?

437
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,810
Hong Liang,

438
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,380
people died.

439
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,010
People died in Dongping.

440
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,860
Wanchuan Mining...

441
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,770
I can't go there!

442
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,620
Why not?

443
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,180
Who do you think

444
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,010
actually runs Wanchuan Mining?

445
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,940
Wan Hai, right?

446
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,810
Prisoner or not,

447
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,090
that guy's still the owner.

448
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,660
So whatever happens at the mine now

449
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,810
could tie right back
to the Wan Hai case.

450
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,980
That case is ironclad!

451
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,730
Hang on.

452
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:26,860
Ironclad?

453
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,570
Hong Liang,

454
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,380
now you're seeing

455
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,010
the Wan Hai case as ironclad?

456
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,180
Well,

457
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,330
I guess I read you right from day one.

458
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,330
I've never misjudged anyone.

459
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,730
You're a coward.

460
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,620
You really are.

461
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,980
Honestly, I'm disappointed.

462
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,770
But thank you, anyway,

463
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,380
for your work on the case analysis

464
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,380
back in Dongping.

465
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,770
Thanks.

466
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:38,700
ID, please.

467
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,530
Do me a favor, please.

468
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,090
Need to borrow your phone.

469
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,420
Hello?

470
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,010
Ms. Zheng Yaping?

471
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:01,810
Yes.

472
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,860
This is Wan Chao.

473
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,810
I'm Wan Hai's son.

474
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,700
Can I have your email address?

475
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,900
I want to send you something.

476
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,660
Please write it down.

477
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,200
[Self-review on Major Mistakes Made while
Handling the Wanchuan Mining Shooting]

478
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,420
Hong Liang,

479
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,010
we appreciate your hard work.

480
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,770
Let's hear what you've got.

481
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,770
As soon as I got to Dongping,

482
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,570
I went straight to Yongqing River

483
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,730
where Qiao Zhenxing's body was found.

484
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,860
I thought about getting
another water sample,

485
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,700
but my wife, a lab tech,

486
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,090
told me

487
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,180
the season's changed,

488
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,420
the ice's melted,

489
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,460
and the riverbank ecosystem
is different now.

490
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,380
So even if I took a new sample,

491
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,090
it wouldn't mean much.

492
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,660
So, sirs,

493
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,090
if you would like

494
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,330
this case to progress,

495
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,620
you might need to

496
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,460
provide the test report

497
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,490
of the Zhongxing Road water sample

498
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,940
to whoever

499
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,620
takes over in the future.

500
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,940
That's all I've got.

501
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,010
Hong Liang,

502
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,250
you pushed for a formal investigation

503
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,420
into Qiao Zhenxing's case, right?

504
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,090
We gave you green light

505
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,730
because the higher-ups

506
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,090
also had suspicions about what happened.

507
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,460
Before you left,

508
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,900
I handed you Qiao's bank details,

509
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,980
statements,

510
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,730
and call logs.

511
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,460
And now, after all this,

512
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,810
is the water sample

513
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,980
all you've got?

514
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,460
You called me

515
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,700
late at night about a thesis.

516
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,980
Were you actually working the case,

517
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,330
or writing someone's thesis?

518
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:30,660
Come in.

519
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,530
Commissioner Sun is here too?

520
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:37,980
Mr. Zhang.

521
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,140
This is urgent.

522
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,330
Go ahead.

523
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,900
I'll step out.

524
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,490
Hold on.

525
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,050
You should see this too.

526
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,140
This man

527
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,050
is Jiang Hongjun,

528
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,570
chief at
Dongping Development Zone sub-bureau.

529
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,090
Who sent you this video?

530
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,700
Wan Hai's son,

531
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:04,860
Wan Chao.

532
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,490
Ms. Zheng,

533
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,980
why did he choose to give this to you?

534
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,090
He said

535
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,050
Zhang Wenjing gave him my number

536
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,730
and told him

537
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,140
to report it to the provincial office.

538
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,050
Mr. Zhang,

539
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,220
Commissioner Sun,

540
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,530
based on the evidence

541
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,380
and report materials

542
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,570
we've got so far,

543
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,660
I recommend

544
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,180
we send a special task force

545
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,620
to Dongping immediately.

546
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,490
Xiangqun,

547
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,530
seems Yaping was right on the money.

548
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,770
I'll report it

549
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,050
to Mr. Yan

550
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,570
right away.

551
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,460
Commissioner Sun,

552
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,570
should the Eleventh Division

553
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,090
take the lead

554
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,810
on this task force?

555
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,330
Absolutely.

556
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,700
Mr. Zhang.

557
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,770
I'll call a meeting right away

558
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,900
and pick our best team for the job.

559
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,420
Perfect.

560
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,090
Mr. Zhang.

561
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,050
Did you sign off on Hong's resignation?

562
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:23,860
Yes.

563
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,770
It's already processing.

564
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,730
Yaping,

565
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,620
let us know if you have any suggestions.

566
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,460
We're on a tight deadline,

567
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,250
can we keep

568
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,420
the old Guidance Group in place?

569
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,730
That's a good plan.

570
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,810
I agree.

571
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:44,810
Hong Liang,

572
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,220
while we're at it,

573
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,810
let's also reexamine

574
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,940
the Qiao Zhenxing case

575
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,530
from square one.

576
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,420
I have a feeling

577
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,860
the two cases are linked.

578
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,530
I'll get started, then.

579
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:57,980
Good.

580
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,250
Hong Liang!

581
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,570
What were you fumbling with?

582
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,050
The commissioner's tough talk

583
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,690
got to me.

584
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,210
Plus,

585
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,980
it's pretty warm in here,

586
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,210
I started sweating.

587
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:32,940
Well,

588
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,740
guess I'll have to redeem myself.

589
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,780
Who told you to do this?!

590
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,260
Look around,

591
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,050
the mine disaster is all over the news!

592
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:56,820
You...

593
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,530
Are you trying to make sure

594
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,570
everyone knows?

595
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,260
Mr. Yu,

596
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,780
don't worry.

597
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,210
I've got everything
under control from here.

598
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,780
No way I'm giving up this mine.

599
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:08,610
Believe it or not,

600
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,940
one phone call
and I could have you locked up!

601
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,490
Go ahead.

602
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,260
But if I go down,

603
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,490
let's see who I take with me.

604
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,050
Don't act like you're in the clear.

605
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,170
Idiot, you should've

606
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,900
stuck to raising pigs and digging coal!

607
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,460
Do you even know what new energy is?

608
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,820
Think just owning a mine
and a plot of land

609
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,300
means you can sit back and count money?

610
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,050
Jiang,

611
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,690
I've risked everything

612
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,420
for this mine!

613
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,090
You know what...

614
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,210
Risked everything?

615
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,130
Who do you think you are?

616
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,900
Enough!

617
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,340
Mr. Yu!

618
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,380
Was I wrong?

619
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,490
Have you forgotten who chased you
out of Dongping back then?

620
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,130
Mr. Yu,

621
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,900
I wore

622
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,010
mourning clothes at your wife's funeral.

623
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,690
You never once

624
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,820
hit me my whole life,

625
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,490
but now you slap me in front of him?

626
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,210
You're only
embarrassing yourself, you know?

627
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,130
Listen,

628
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,300
you're out

629
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,940
from now on.

630
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,820
No more mine,

631
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,740
no more land.

632
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,900
I'm in charge.

633
00:36:59,400 --> 00:36:59,860
Got it?

634
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,820
Mr. Yu, answer me.

635
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,900
If I hadn't done this,

636
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,610
would you have just tossed me aside

637
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,170
once all the dirty work was finished?

638
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,260
You...

639
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,050
You're out of your mind!

640
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,090
So you all get to walk away clean,

641
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,380
and we're left,

642
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,820
doing all your dirty work?

643
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,210
Mr. Yu,

644
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,010
is that all I've ever been to you?

645
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,380
A coal washer?

646
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,780
Long,

647
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,460
what are you saying?

648
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,380
What is this supposed to mean?

649
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,010
I'm telling you right now,

650
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,130
Mr. Yu,

651
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,780
I'm taking the mine and the land.

652
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,860
No one's stopping me.

653
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,170
Come on.

654
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,340
Step over.

655
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,170
Over the brazier, here is the good luck.

656
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,130
Mr. Yu wanted me to set this up for me.

657
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,340
A little welcome home ritual
to chase the bad luck away.

658
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,570
What's wrong?

659
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,010
A year inside
and you forget how to talk?

660
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,650
Listen,

661
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,380
it's been a big year for us.

662
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,900
Look at these trucks.

663
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,260
See?

664
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,650
And our shiny new equipment.

665
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,130
Not just the coal preparation plant,

666
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,170
we actually own a mine.

667
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,210
A mine!

668
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,090
Step over,

669
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:42,690
leave all the old stuff behind.

670
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,090
Long,

671
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,900
welcome home.

672
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:01,940
Mr. Yu.

673
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,610
Look at you,

674
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,380
you've lost weight.

675
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,210
I'm alright.

676
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,460
You're our hero.

677
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:11,570
What's wrong?

678
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,980
Getting emotional now?

679
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,980
That's okay.

680
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,940
Let it out if you need to.

681
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,130
Things will get better from here,

682
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,010
and soon

683
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,570
you won't have anything to cry about.

684
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,170
Long,

685
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,820
look around.

686
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,900
From now on,

687
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,570
the whole

688
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,490
prep plant

689
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,740
is yours to run.

690
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:35,460
Sounds good?

691
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,570
Can you handle it?

692
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,210
You're back.

693
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,980
Haven't eaten yet, right?

694
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,530
Go wash up,

695
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,820
I'll make some noodles.

696
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,300
There, there.

697
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,530
Wait on the couch,
dinner'll be ready soon.

698
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,940
Why does nothing ever go my way?

699
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,460
After three years,

700
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,940
the Wan Hai case finally wraps up,

701
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,260
I thought the mess with Wanchuan Mining

702
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,170
would finally be over—

703
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,380
and then this disaster hits.

704
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,900
Who's going to

705
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,900
take it on now?

706
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,530
Give it time.

707
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,940
I'm sure you can find someone.

708
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:15,860
I wouldn't count on it.

709
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,530
Well,

710
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,130
any company that even considers this

711
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,090
has to have real resources.

712
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,210
So,

713
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,860
who's interested right now?

714
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,210
Tianlong Company.

715
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,090
Tianlong?

716
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,980
Run by Zijian's boss.

717
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,380
You've met him before.

718
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:43,940
What a shame.

719
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,980
When did you guys start

720
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,530
talking with Tianlong Company?

721
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,570
Sure,

722
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,980
I'm very interested.

723
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,050
As long as we have you

724
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,210
and the Development Zone
Managing Committee

725
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:01,940
behind us,

726
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,010
we're ready to make our contribution.

727
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,260
I met up with the guy

728
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,900
after the Wan Hai trial started
and mentioned it to him.

729
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,740
He was interested,

730
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,610
looked eager to take it over.

731
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,460
Work together?

732
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,170
No.

733
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,740
I buy either the whole mine or nothing.

734
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,050
That's my one condition.

735
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,340
It has to be a 100% buyout,

736
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,940
that's the only way
I'll put in everything I've got.

737
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,010
What's wrong?

738
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,690
The noodles are good,

739
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,260
I just don't have an appetite right now.
