you've been looking out for me

If there's any work
that makes good money,

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,740
you gotta bring me along.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,620
You're up for anything?

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,820
Anything!

Yang… Yang Jing?

00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,300
Yeah.

15
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,180
Why are you blushing?

16
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,620
I'm blushing?

17
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,540
I'm just flushed from the sun.
It's scorching.

Your brother

before he died.

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,660
He knew about me and Yang…

21
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,300
Wait,

22
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,820
my brother?
Why would my brother go to her?

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,220
I don't know,

24
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,300
that's why I want to ask her

face to face.

Can you arrange that?

Rest assured.

I won't say a word
as long as you're here.

Hong Liang,

35
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,020
right?

36
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,860
Yes.

37

38
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,780
Yes.

39
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,140
Were you with the Guidance Group?

40
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,660
Yes,

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,780
but it's disbanded now.

42
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,620
How did you find out

43
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,020
I talked to Zhenxing on the phone?

44
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,460
It was quite a while ago.

45
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,620
Was I under surveillance?

46
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,860
So Zhenxing was under surveillance then.

47
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,580
Well, I got access

48
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,300
to Zhenxing's call records

49
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,340
dating back quite a while before he died

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,820
through my superior,

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,060
so it was all legal.

52
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,660
The Guidance Group has been disbanded,

53
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,780
so why are you still digging into this?

54
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,740
I'm not doing it
as a member of the Guidance Group.

55
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,340
Then why are you
investigating this on your own?

56
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,260
I'm just curious.

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,780
I'm a bit of a gossip, okay?

58
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,260
Get out!

59
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,180
I'm not here for gossip.

60
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,460
Zhenxing was a great friend of mine.

61
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,940
I can't accept that

62
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,220
he just died like that.

63
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,780
I just want to know

64
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,100
if there's anything
he hasn't accomplished,

65
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,340
and see if I can finish them for him.

66
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,940
I just want to see

67
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,020
if I can help him

68
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,820

Mr. Qiao has been here too.

70

We didn't just talk on the phone,
we met in person

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,940
right here.

72
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,460
That's my dad

73
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,340
and my mom.

74

75
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,380
was always sick

76

I'm really sorry.

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,820
May I ask what was his occupation?

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,540
He was an accountant.

83

How did it happen?

84
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,500
There was a robbery
at the finance office.

85
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,460
And, did they catch the robbers?

86
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,980
They caught them within days.

87
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,700
The shooter was sentenced to death

88
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,780
and executed immediately.

89
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,700
I was just a kid when my dad died.

91
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,980
only 12.

92
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,100
So it's been over a decade?

93

working for

98
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,300

So, did Qiao come to pay his respects
to your dad,

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,140
or… or was he here
to ask about that case?

109
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,340
But, that was an ironclad case.

110
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,220
Did Qiao Zhenxing

111
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,780
say anything else to you?

113
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,220

I got it wrong.

123
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,460

not to tell anyone about this,

00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,380
What are you doing here?

381
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,500
Why did you bring him? What do you want?

382
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,300
Why are you here?

383
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,300
Get out of here!

384
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:05,700
Wang Li!

385
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,300
I'm here to ask you one thing,

386
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,700
was Sun Yihu a murderer?

387
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,100
What are you trying to do?

388
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,260
Are you a prosecutor too?

389
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,380
Will you just let me live my life?

390
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,380
I'm asking you one last time:

391
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,220
is he the shooter or not?

392
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,700
I'm so sorry.

393
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,420
It's all my fault.

394
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,820
At the time,

395
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,900
the factory wasn't doing well,

396
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,300
so Sun Yihu left there.

397
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,420
Things are hard now, huh?

398
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,100
He was doing some freelance work,

399
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,060
barely getting by.

400
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,220
I haven't had any work for two days now.

401
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,740
Yihu!

402
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,700
Dayou, what brings you here?

403
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,700
C'mon, let's go grab some food.

404
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,260
Come on!

405
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,540
What about my stuff?

406
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,380
Just leave it.

407
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,420
Sun Yihu's childhood buddy, Wang Dayou,

408
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,980
used to come around a lot,

409
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,700
and they'd just hang out doing nothing.

410
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,020
One last drink,

411
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:24,940
I promise.

412
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,380
Hurry up.

413
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:28,820
Dayou,

414
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,820
you've been looking out for me
since we were kids.

415
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,500
If there's any work
that makes good money,

416
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,660
you gotta bring me along.

417
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,420
You're up for anything?

418
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,580
Anything!

419
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,260
What about killing a man?

420
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,420
What's up, Dayou?

421
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:01,900
Let's go.

422
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,740
Now?

423
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,700
Of course.

424
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,980
What do you say?

425
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,100
Alright.

426
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,340
Honey, I'm heading out for a bit.

427
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,980
Where are you going at this hour?

428
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,900
Sun Yihu

429
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,580
didn't come back until a few days later.

430
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,860
Do you still care about me and our son?

431
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,060
I've called you many times.

432
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,860
Why didn't you answer?

433
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,500
Do you know how worried I was?

434
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,780
I have liver cancer,

435
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,200
late-stage.

436
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
[People's Hospital Pathology
Diagnosis Report]

437
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,940
Here's 200,000.

438
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,060
I killed someone.

439
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,300
Remember,

440
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,940
no matter who asks you,
say you don't know anything

441
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,860
and don't mention this money to anyone.

442
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,300
I don't have long to live.

443
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,660
Unless I take the fall for Wang Dayou,

444
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,740
they'll go after our whole family.

445
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,380
I'm going to die anyway,

446
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,180
I might as well
take the fall for Wang Dayou

447
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,140
and trade it for this 200,000.

448
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,340
At least I won't die in vain.

449
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,780
Take

450
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,940
this money

451
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,580
and take care of our son.

452
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,260
If you decide to remarry,

453
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,700
I'm okay with that,

454
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,500
just make sure to pick someone
who's good for our son.

455
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,540
You and our son must keep going.

456
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,660
I can only help you this far.

457
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,460
And that

458
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,060
was the end for your dad.

459
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,140
He was a timid person.

460
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,460
He wouldn't even kill a chicken.

461
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,900
Wang Dayou has to be the one

462
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,780
who pulled the trigger.

463
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,180
Your father

464
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,780
was forced to take the fall.

465
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,620
What are you doing?

466
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,180
After

467
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,100
your dad died,

468
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,140
I took that money and went to the south
to start a business,

469
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,700
but I lost it all to a scam.

470
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,100
I was too ashamed to face you again.

471
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,380
It wasn't

472
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,420
for me.

473
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,980
I just wanted to make more money,

474
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,540
so you and I could have a better life.

475
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,820
A few years ago,

476
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,100
I opened this small shop
and things are going better.

477
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,380
But when I went to see you,
you refused to accept me.

478
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,580
It really broke my heart.

479
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,100
Zhi,

480
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,500
it's fine if you'll never

481
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,180
talk to me again.

482
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,340
But please,

483
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,020
just stay for dinner

484
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,700
today.

485
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,820
Two officers came to the hospital
to talk to my dad.

486
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,940
I think my dad told them something.

487
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,220
Coincidentally, I've seen them
after I joined the force.

488
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,740
You've seen them?

489
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,300
Who?

490
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,660
The older guy's was called Ma.

491
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,460
He's the warden of the Second Prison now.

492
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,740
Ma Chongyang?

493
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,580
Yeah.

494
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:27,940
And the other one?

495
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,500
The guy I just threw out.

496
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,960
[Hong Liang]

497
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,120
[Hong Liang]

498
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,300
Have you made any progress on the USB?

499
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,860
Sorry, Mr. Ma, not yet.

500
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,580
Then how about the complaint letter?

501
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,020
Sorry, Mr. Ma,
no progress on that either.

502
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,740
Keep investigating then.

503
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,500
Mr. Ma, I'm sorry,

504
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,660
please… please don't get upset.

505
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,140
I… I didn't call to talk to you

506
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,420
about the USB or the complaint letter.

507
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,180
I called to talk about Qiao again.

508
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,100
Go ahead.

509
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,340
I want to ask you about an old case.

510
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,380
Do you remember

511
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,500
the Wanchuan Mining

512
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,420
Shooting case

513
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,740
from 13 years ago?

514
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,100
What did you find?

515
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,980
The man

516
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,820
who was executed immediately
was called Sun Yihu.

517
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,860
I found his family

518
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,020
and met them today.

519
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,740
His wife Wang Li said

520
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,380
they don't believe

521
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,220
it was Sun Yihu

522
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,660
who fired the gun.

523
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,180
Mr. Ma.

524
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,900
Qiao…

525
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,500
Qiao came to me.

526
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,660
If you've gotten this far,

527
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,860
you probably know

528
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,540
I wasn't the only one at the scene.

529
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,340
There was another officer.

530
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,140
Qin Feng?

531
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:15,900
Yeah.

532
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,620
He knows more than I do.

533
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,940
You should go ask him.

534
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,180
Mr. Ma,

535
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,940
when you say he knows more,
what do you…

536
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,260
What I'm saying is,

537
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,540
thirteen years ago, I left the force

538
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,460
because of that case

539
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,660
and haven't seen Qin Feng since.

540
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,940
You should go ask him.

541
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,060
Qin Feng!

542
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,820
Qin Feng, what do you mean?

543
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,780
I can't sign this.

544
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,780
What do you mean you can't sign it?

545
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,060
I told you, I can't sign it!

546
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,540
Weren't you the one who said

547
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,020
this was a homicide case

548
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,860
and we shouldn't rush to close it?

549
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,380
If we turn in these files,

550
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,780
the higher-ups can reopen the case.

551
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,500
Just sign it!

552
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,620
Sign it!

553
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,420
I've been reassigned.

554
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,020
If you want it signed,

555
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,860
go report it yourself.

556
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,500
Don't drag me into this.

557
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,860
If I can report it alone,

558
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,340
I wouldn't be begging you now.

559
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,620
We were both at the scene.

560
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,020
You have to sign this!

561
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,300
Qin Feng!

562
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,820
You coward!

563
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,900
How can you live with yourself?

564
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,220
How will you face the victims' families?

565
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,060
Have you forgotten your oath?

566
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,460
You don't deserve the uniform
you're wearing!

567
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,380
You don't deserve to be a cop!

568
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,180
We're just chatting.

569
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,340
You didn't have to pick
such a romantic spot.

570
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,100
I want to gossip with you

571
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,540
about something romantic.

572
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,500
What is it?

573
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,500
How are things

574
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,620
with your

575
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,580
girlfriend?

576
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,660
Liang, don't talk like that.

577
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,660
What girlfriend?

578
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,980
We haven't gotten that far yet.

579
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,300
You're already 38.

580
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,580
What are you waiting for,
your 88th birthday?

581
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,020
I wish I was 28.

582
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,540
But I'm not, am I?

583
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,900
Every time

584
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,420
I try to say something to her,

585
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,740
it feels like there's a wall between us.

586
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,460
Have you met

587
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,900
Yang Jing's

588
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,380
parents?

589
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,700
Not yet.

590
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,900
Every time

591
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,740
I tried to

592
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,580
bring it up,

593
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,060
she would just change the subject.

594
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,340
What can I do?

595
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,740
Then do you know Yang Zheng?

596
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,580
Who?

597
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:58,740
Yang Zheng.

598
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,660
"Zheng"

599
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,100
with a Z.

600
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,220
Yang Zheng,

601
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,780
have you met him?

602
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,340
The name sounds familiar,

603
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,020
but I don't think I've met him.

604
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,540
Think again.

605
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,220
Have you met

606
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,300
Yang Zheng or not?

607
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,860
Have I met him?

608
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,140
Haven't you?

609
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,180
Thirteen years ago,

610
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,740
at Wanchuan Mining's

611
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,460
finance office,

612
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,380
did you see

613
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,460
Yang Zheng or not?

614
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,140
Who fired the gun?

615
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,940
Did you see his face?

616
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,740
Hang in there. Help is on the way.

617
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,660
Yang Zheng?

618
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:44,940
Yang Zheng?

619
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,820
He was her father.

620
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,180
Whose dad was he?

621
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,580
Who was her dad?

622
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,740
Wait, but…

623
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:33,660
What…

624
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,060
Come.

625
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,260
What's going on, Liang?

626
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,740
There's no security camera here, see?

627
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,540
And the soundproofing is excellent.

628
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,540
Let us two

629
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,260
have some serious talk.

630
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,140
What was the name

631
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,900
of that case where Yang Zheng died?

632
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,500
Wanchuan Mining Shooting.

633
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,580
Yeah.

634
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:58,980
Right?

635
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,300
Yeah.

636
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,260
They caught two suspects back then,

637
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,380
one tall and one short,

638
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,620
right?

639
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,660
Yeah.

640
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,980
The short one was called Sun Yihu.

641
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,300
Since he was the shooter,

642
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,780
he was executed

643
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,420
right after.

644
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,580
That's right, Liang.

645
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,220
Wait, wasn't this case

646
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,580
handled by you, my brother,

647
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,500
and Li Renjun?

648
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,220
It's been 13 years.

649
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,060
It's all in the past,

650
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,380
but not everyone has let it go.

651
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,940
Thirteen years later,

652
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,420
your brother

653
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,020
reopened this case.

654
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,300
I had no idea.

655
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,740
Why was my brother
looking into this case again?

656
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,900
You don't know?

657
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,380
Of course I don't.

658
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,420
So, Qiao investigated three people:

659
00:35:59,400 --> 00:35:59,860
Yang Jing;

660
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,420
Sun Yihu's son,
Sun's the shorter guy

661
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:04,980
who fired the gun;

662
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,220
and Sun Yihu's wife,

663
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,060
Wang Li.

664
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,060
So why do you think Qiao looked into them?

665
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,660
Is there something wrong

666
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,540
with that case?

667
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,460
Liang, I didn't know about any of these.

668
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,820
You have to ask Sun Fei about this.

669
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,380
He was head

670
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,980
of the Criminal Investigation Unit,

671
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,260
and the current deputy chief
of this precinct.

672
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,340
Sun Fei?

673
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,540
Sun Fei.

674
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,740
But Qiao was acting very strange.

675
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,540
He didn't run it through with Sun Fei

676
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,780
and was investigating on his own.

677
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,780
Therefore,

678
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,220
I followed Qiao's trail

679
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,380
and did my own investigation.

680
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,340
I looked into

681
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,180
Sun Yihu's son.

682
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,500
Then I looked into Sun Yihu's wife,
Wang Li.

683
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,980
I also looked into Yang Jing.

684
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,780
And guess

685
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,420
what did those three tell me?

686
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,620
What did they say?

687
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,700
They all think

688
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,260
there may have been a mistake
with this case.

689
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,180
Sun Yihu, the shorter guy,

690
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,100
was likely not the shooter.

691
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,820
The shooter was probably
the taller suspect,

692
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,860
Wang Dayou.

693
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,220
What do you think?

694
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,140
How should I know?

695
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:20,580
Alright.

696
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,100
You were among the first officers
on the scene,

697
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:33,860
right?

698
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:34,900
Yeah.

699
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,540
I got there with our Deputy Chief,

700
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,700
Mr. Ma Chongyang.

701
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,380
I heard shots coming from there.

702
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,340
The police are here.

703
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,340
Where?

704
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,820
Upstairs.

705
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,540
- Upstairs?
- In there.

706
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,980
In there.

707
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,260
The police are here! The police are here!

708
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:09,940
Call 120.

709
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,300
Don't just stand there, call 120!

710
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,540
Hello?

711
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,100
Three people have been shot

712
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,620
at Wanchuan Mining.

713
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,540
Are you okay?

714
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,340
Give me a towel!

715
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,140
Press it down.

716
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,420
I had just joined the precinct.

717
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,060
Hold on. Help is on the way.

718
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,660
I saw blood everywhere,

719
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,980
and the only survivor was…

720
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,740
was Yang Zheng.

721
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,940
So you saw Yang Zheng

722
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,420
at the scene?

723
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,420
Yeah.

724
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,460
How many times

725
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,460
have you met him?

726
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,140
Twice.

727
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,700
Which two times?

728
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,100
Once at the crime scene.

729
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,700
The crime scene?

730
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,020
And the second time?

731
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,380
The second time I…

732
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,780
I went to the ICU

733
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,740
to get his statement.

734
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,100
What did he say during the interview?

735
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,460
Nothing. He was in the ICU.

736
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,420
He… he could barely talk.

737
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,620
So how many times did you meet

738
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,060
Yang Zheng?

739
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,420
Twice.

740
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,700
Twice?

741
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,100
Liang, I'm certain I only met him twice.

742
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,060
Good.

743
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,700
I came here today

744
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,020
to get some honest answers from you.

745
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,900
Your brother was looking into
the Wanchuan Mining Shooting case

746
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,100
before he died.

747
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,300
So if you have

748
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,460
any doubts about that case,

749
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,780
you can tell me.

750
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,740
Wait, Liang, what are you trying to say?

751
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,620
Nothing.

752
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,460
This is a safe place to talk.

753
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,300
So you think I don't trust you, huh?

754
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,460
If you left out anything,

755
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,140
you can tell me now.

756
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,020
I didn't leave out anything.

757
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,900
I only saw him twice!

758
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,820
I don't have
any recording devices on me!

759
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,660
I know!

760
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,420
Why won't you just be straight with me?

761
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,740
Let's cut the nonsense, alright?

762
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,660
What are you trying…

763
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,180
What are you…

764
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,860
We've been told

765
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,700
you

766
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,580
went back to the hospital

767
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,700
to see Yang Zheng again.

768
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,500
Was that true?

769
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,580
I did.

770
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,180
But he was already dead, Liang.

771
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,220
He was already dead?

772
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,580
It didn't count!

773
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,260
I… It's just that one time, and…

774
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,580
"Just that one time"?

775
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,460
You bastard!

776
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,380
You were a coward 13 years ago,

777
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,820
and you still are!

778
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,180
How long are you gonna stay this way?

779
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,260
Mr. Ma.

780
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,340
Don't call me Mr. Ma!

781
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,580
You're not worthy!

782
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,140
Speak!

783
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,500
What else did you leave out?

784
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,260
I didn't leave out anything.

785
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,340
I'll spell it out for you.

786
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,020
When we got to the scene,

787
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,580
we asked Yang Zheng
how many robbers there were.

788
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:54,980
What did he say?

789
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,300
Huh?

790
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,100
Who was the shooter?

791
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,900
Did you see his face?

792
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,100
No,

793
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,260
he was wearing a mask.

794
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,980
How many were there?

795
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,220
Two.

796
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,180
What did they look like?

797
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,100
One was very tall,

798
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,180
the other short.

799
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,500
One tall and one short?

800
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,660
Who was the shooter?

801
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,500
The tall one.

802
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,540
The tall one pulled the trigger.

803
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,540
Tall one was the shooter!

804
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,220
What about the short one?

805
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,100
The short one…

806
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,540
the short one was the lookout.

807
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,140
Take a close look

808
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:32,740
here.

809
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:33,780
Qin Feng.

810
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,220
Yeah.

811
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,380
Pay special attention to here.

812
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,060
Mr. Ma, you asked for me?

813
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,580
Come here.

814
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,180
Verify it first,

815
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,540
then let me know.

816
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,160
[Investigation Report
on the Wanchuan Mining Shooting]

817
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,820
The sub-bureau

818
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,180
is truly productive, huh?

819
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,780
Don't celebrate just yet.

820
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,860
Right now, their main suspects
are Sun Yihu, the shooter,

821
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,780
and Wang Dayou, the lookout.

822
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,700
What's the problem?

823
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,820
Sun Yihu is only about 1.7 tall,

824
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,020
but Wang Dayou is tall,

825
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,780
about 1.8m.

826
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,300
But,

827
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,940
didn't Yang Zheng say

828
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,700
the tall one was the shooter,

829
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,140
and the short one was the accomplice?

830
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,940
Isn't this the opposite?

831
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,820
Mr. Xu, you need to report this
to the higher-ups.

832
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,780
The sub-bureau might've made a mistake.

833
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,300
This was the sub-bureau's case.

834
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,780
Why are you sticking your nose in?

835
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,220
I'm not trying to meddle,

836
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,500
but they may have made a mistake.

837
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,900
We asked Yang Zheng twice.

838
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,220
He insisted that
the tall one was the shooter.

839
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,740
I know I'm right.

840
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,380
Besides, Mr. Ma was there.

841
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,500
He can confirm it.

842
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,380
Hello,

843
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,620
Mr. Sun.

844
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,380
Mr. Xu.

845
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,060
Here's the situation:

846
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,860
we've received some complaints

847
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,100
of inconsistencies concerning

848
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,540
the shooter's appearance

849
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,060
in the Wanchuan Mining Shooting.

850
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,260
Mr. Xu, can you

851
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,300
be more specific

852
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,620
about these discrepancies?

853
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,260
So I can look into it.

854
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,700
The victim said

855
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,860
the shooter

856
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,980
was the taller one.

857
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,220
But Sun Yihu, our suspect,

858
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,500
is a small guy, right?

859
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,020
Was it Yang Zheng, the victim,

860
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,540
who gave this info?

861
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,380
Mr. Xu, you need to know,

862
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,580
that's not what he said

863
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,100
when we questioned him.

864
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,100
I'll look into

865
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,980
why he changed his statement

866
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,660
and then report back to you.

867
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,860
Alright, thank you.

868
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,580
You'll just have to wait.

869
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,340
You're the one who said
the report was wrong,

870
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,780
and took me to the hospital
to question Yang Zheng again.

871
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,380
You're also the one who said
we should report it to Mr. Xu.

872
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,620
So, why didn't you sign the report

873
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,460
I wrote?

874
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,380
Why didn't you sign it?

875
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,580
