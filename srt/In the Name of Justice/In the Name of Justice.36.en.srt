00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,980
Dad, when are you
coming back from Beijing?

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,410
I'll be home in a few days.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,490
When's Mom coming home?

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,730
Hong Liang,

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,490
can't you just give up
this prosecutor job?

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,490
Let's just leave this place,

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,140
the three of us.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,740
But think about Min.

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,330
Think about Dou.

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,170
This is your home too.

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,900
If you'd listened to me back then

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,650
and just gone to Beijing,

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,180
maybe you wouldn't be

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,580
stuck in this mess now.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,620
I've been in law for over twenty years.

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,770
If I know something and keep quiet, I...

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,050
I can't live with that.

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,370
If you walk out that door today,

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,330
there's no coming back.

[Hong Liang's here. Knows about us.
About to report. Handle it!]

23
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,890
Dayou!

24
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,890
One more thing I need to know.

25
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,940
Were you involved

26
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,780
in the Wanchuan Mining Shooting?

27
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,450
I was the secretary of
political and legal affairs back then.

28
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,980
Everything I did was for
the safety and stability

29
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,380
of this city—

30
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,100
it was simply my duty.

31
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,850
Do you know they charged

32
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,660
the accomplice, not the prime culprit?

33
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,130
The prime culprit got out

34
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,890
and went on to kill more people.

35
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,500
Enough!

36
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,220
That was all Yu Tiancheng
and Chen Shenglong.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,660
Dad had nothing to do with it!

38
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,570
Okay, then.

39
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,340
If you know it all,

40
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,260
then come with me,

41
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,610
tell us about what happened.

42
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,500
If I could,

43
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,690
would we still be arguing here?

44
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,610
If you don't tell the truth now,

45
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,540
by the time you regret it,

46
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,410
it'll be too late.

47
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,540
I'm telling you, just drop it.

48
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,940
Yu Tiancheng is about to
disappear for good.

49
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,100
And no one even knows

50
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,020
where Chen Shenglong is!

52
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,020
just let it go.

53
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,610
Take off that uniform,

54
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,980
and we're still family.

55
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,140
Hong Liang,

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,930
he's right.

57
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,850
This should stay in the family.

58
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,220
It's about whether

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,700
he's going to throw away
his last chance.

60
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,780
I can't go with you!

61
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,700
If I do, Dad goes down too!

62
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,810
You'd bring us all down!

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,100
You have any idea

64
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,900
what Yu Tiancheng's done?

65
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,170
That's enough!

just how far

69
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,050

73
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,930

What do I do?

75
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,660
You idiot!

76
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,850
Where'd you get a car?

77
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,660
Who let you drive?

78
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,580

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,290
This is Yu Tiancheng.

81

drunk,

82
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,700
no license.

83

Mr. Jiang,

84
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,100
he's looking at a minimum
of seven years.

85
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,780
We're on Pingnan Avenue.

86
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,290
You'd better come get him.

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,410
never thought you'd sink this low—

89
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,730
using Jiang Yuan as leverage?

90
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,490
Have you thought through
the consequences?

91
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:12,850
Mr. Jiang,

92
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,220
think about the consequences
for your son.

93
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,340
You'll understand when you get here.

94
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:22,900
Min.

95
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,220
Are you hurt anywhere else?

96
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,810
No.

97
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,700
Hong Liang,

98
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,780
please, I'm begging you.

99
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,220
Just give up your job, okay?

100
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,490
Think about Dou.

101
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,780
She's just a kid.

102
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,460
Let's just leave this place,

103
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,050

104
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,660
okay?

105

106
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,290
as long as you keep quiet,

107
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,730
the Task Force can blame everything

108
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,580
on Chen Shenglong.

109
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,730
He's the one who did all this anyway.

111
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,250
Think carefully.

112
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,780
If you walk out that door today,

113
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,730
there's no coming back.

114
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,730
Dad, when are you
coming back from Beijing?

115
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,370
I'll be home in a few days.

116
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,420
When's Mom coming home?

117
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,100
When she can get a break from work.

118
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,010
I miss you both already.

119
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,130

120
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,060
just come to Beijing.

121
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,530
It'll just be us,

122
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,700

a new chapter in life.

Just tell me,

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,220
Jiang Yuan is tied
to organized crime.

194
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,490
Jiang Xudong is protecting him.

195
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,300
He's involved in a major
duty-related crime.

196
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,850

197

199
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,250

200

209
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,810
He said he's going to get evidence.

210
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,140
There's no time.

211
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,620

212
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,980

213
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,940

215
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,620

216
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,010

217
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,050
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Song is here.

218
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,090
Mr. Song, this is Zhang Fang.

219
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,180
Yes, Mr. Zhang.

220
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,980

221
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,420

222
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,700

223
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,010
On it.

224
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,620

225
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,940

226
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,090

housing complex,

227
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,810
and keep an eye on
Jiang Yuan and Jiang Xudong.

228
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,140
Got it.

229
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,380

230

What's happening, Liang?

231
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,810
We gotta go, now!

232
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,380
Go!

233
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,330
Be careful, Liang.

234
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,380
Hide the car,

235
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,810
and keep yourself out of sight.

236
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,620

237
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,620
Chen Shenglong?

238
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,620
Mr. Yu,

239
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,220

240
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,980
to Mr. Wan without compensation,

241
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,420
and

242
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,380
leave Dongping

243
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,530
to pursue

244
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,900

245
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:58,900

246
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,330
Hong Liang.

247
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,220

248
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,380

and the Wan Hai case!

251

Can you get me out of here?

252
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,530

253
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,010

254
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,660
Get me to the airport safely.

255
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,980
Once I'm through security,

256
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,620

Turn it up.

261

266
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,180
I'll keep this brief.

267
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,330
Get a team out here,

268
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,810

274
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,530
