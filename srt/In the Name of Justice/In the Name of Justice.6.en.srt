What's wrong with you?

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,220
Mr. Fu,

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,300
I heard you often
visit the detention center.

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,580
That place is bad luck.

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,740
This time it's a fake knife,

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,660

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,380
Mr. Xu.

13
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,940
Yes?

14
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,460
I need to talk to you.

15
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,220
I just went to Yongqing River,

16
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,300
my brother's crime scene.

17
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,940
I noticed a lot of key evidence

18
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,460
doesn't add up…

19
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,060
Who sent you?

20
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,780
You went alone

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,820
or with someone else?

22
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,620

So what have you found?

27
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,220
We're nowhere near that yet.

28
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,420
The evidence just doesn't make sense.

29
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,460
Let me break it down for you.

30
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,860
First, the pickaxe…

31
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,540
Qiao Zhenxing's case has been closed.

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,420
It's suicide.

Mr. Xu.

How would my brother commit suicide?

It's not for you to consider.

37
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,260

No, commander.

42
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,180
I have a request.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,820
I'd like access

Honestly,

63
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,340
Xie Hongfei is more qualified to be

64
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,980

the First Division than me.

65

74

He's dedicated.

76
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,380
So,

So,

do you wanna

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,740
is a little shaky.

92
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,020
Watch your mouth.

93
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,260
Why are you here?

94
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,740
Something's up.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,460

It feels off.

97

What is it?

98
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,500
I just came back from Yongqing River.

99
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,300
First,

100
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,980
next to the hole in the ice,

101
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,380
they said there was no fishing gear.

102
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,260
That means he did not

103
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,780
slip into it.

104
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,620
Second,

105
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,100
the mobile phone.

106
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,180
They found everything

107
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,020
except the phone.

108
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,500
Weird, huh?

109
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,620
Third,

110
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,380
the empty wine bottle in the car.

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,020
They said he drank it.

112
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,460
If he drinks,

113
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,820
one sip and he's in the hospital.

114
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,500
He'll never do that.

115
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,660
Sounds off, right?

116
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,140
That's why I came to you.

117
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:29,940
You

118
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,620
give the Dongping Police

119
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,740
a heads-up,

120
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,540
tell them to dig deeper.

121
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,460
What I just told…

122
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,860
Xu Yanwu called.

123
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,620
He told me.

124
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,540
What?

125
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,420
Dongping Police

126
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,260
have already

127
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,220
ruled out homicide.

128
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,020
They will give me

129
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,460
the final report soon.

130
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,180
Not a homicide,

131
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,340
definitely not an accident either.

132
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,340
Suicide.

133
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,940
Impossible!

134
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,100
Happy family,

135
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,260
and nothing's wrong with him,

136
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,420
he's healthy.

137
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,580
Then it must be the workplace.

138
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,580
Who did something to him,

139
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,020
and he couldn't get over this?

140
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,380
But I thought he has
a lot of friends at work.

141
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,660
You're his best friend,

142
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,580
you've had his back.

143
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,500
Director of First Division,

144
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,140
didn't you put him forward for the role

145
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,060
at the party meeting?

146
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,620
What could happen to him?

147
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,220
Hong Liang…

148
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,180
- Hong Liang.
- Impossible.

149
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,820
Tell me,

150
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,740
you've been away
from Dongping for over ten years,

151
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,700
do you think you know
Qiao Zhenxing well?

152
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,180
Of course, I know him well.

153
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,700
We were college classmates,

154
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,140
living in the same dorm for four years.

155
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,700
Then we worked together here.

156
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,980
Of course, I know him well.

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,620
I also went to college
with him for four years.

158
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,940
I've been his colleague
longer than you,

159
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,460
even I wouldn't say
I truly know him.

160
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,340
Have you ever reflected on yourself?

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,060
Because now you're

162
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,500
looking for a promotion,

163
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,620
and you're
the acting prosecutor-general.

164
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,220
Your future is bright.

165
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,100
Maybe you're starting to

166
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,180
look down on us grassroots folks.

167
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,060
Speak plainly.

168
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,980
Why are you so annoying?

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,700
What did I do to you?

170
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,980
What did I do to you?

171
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,580
I visited Qiao's place
to offer condolences,

172
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,580
and then,

173
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,340
you just had to make that call
right in front of

174
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,180
my team leader.

175
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,220
What's your deal?

176
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,860
I was protecting you.

177
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,180
Protect, you know that?

178
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,060
Oh my goodness.

179
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,180
You really opened my eyes.

180
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,380
Hong Liang, do you know

181
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,420
your role here?

182
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,260
You're a member of the Guidance Group.

183
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,220
We still haven't figured out
how Qiao Zhenxing died.

184
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,660
Do you think
it's appropriate to go there?

185
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,780
Listen to yourself,

186
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,580
you look exactly

187
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,820
like my team leader Zheng Yaping,

188
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,020
really.

189
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,300
Are you two incompatible?

190
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,140
Tell me the truth.

191
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,700
I went to Qiao's place
to express my condolences,

192
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,500
in terms of humanity,

193
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,100
that's not wrong.

194
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,500
But disciplinarily speaking,

195
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,340
I should've informed her.

196
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,340
She didn't give me the chance.

197
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,300
So, that night,

198
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,460
at the summary meeting,
I was properly chewed out.

199
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,100
Great.

200
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,180
You had it coming.

201
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,140
How about I chew you out?

202
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,260
Let me 'protect' you too.

203
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,820
Some people

204
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,540
should really try doing
something decent for once.

205
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,660
Don't disgrace their own name.

206
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,780
Li Renjun.

207
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,300
Be a decent man.

208
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,780
Qiao is gone,

209
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,220
we've been buddies for years,

210
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,380
and you don't wanna
pay your condolences?

211
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,540
I will do it.

212
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,140
But not now.

213
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,460
Then on the anniversary?

214
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,740
Isn't it a little late?

215
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,380
A kind reminder,

216
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,980
at least show up.

217
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,180
You keep hiding yourself,

218
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,860
Zhou Mei hates you now, you know that?

219
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,500
She said you took Qiao out.

220
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,020
Why did you do that?

221
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,980
I mean, why did you do that?

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,740
He was doing a good job.

223
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,220
Hong Liang, you're an insider,

224
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,580
don't talk like a layman.

225
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,580
You really think I,
as acting prosecutor-general,

226
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,540
can remove Qiao Zhenxing

227
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,100
from the lead position

228
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,820
on the Wan Hai case?

229
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,780
It's the result of the party meeting.

230
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,260
What does it have to do with me?

231
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,620
Do you know how Qiao Zhenxing scolded me

232
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,700
after that decision was made?

233
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,420
Everyone here heard it.

234
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,420
Li Renjun! Why pull me off the case?

235
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,740
Did I make a mistake or abuse my power?

236
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,460
Don't get so worked up.

237
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,060
It's fine, go back to work.

238
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,740
Come, sit down and talk.

239
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,940
You've been on the Wan Hai case
for over two years,

240
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,860
I bet you barely had time
for your family,

241
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,980
didn't pay much attention
to your kid's studies either.

242
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,540
You've lost so much weight,

243
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,980
take good care of yourself.

244
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,060
My health is none of your concern.

245
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,500
Do you believe what you just said?

246
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,260
Wan Hai not being prosecuted,

247
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,220
it's holding back your promotion,

248
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,700
blocking your achievements,

249
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,980
keeping you from
becoming the prosecutor-general!

250
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,780
Am I

251
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,500
blocking the entire
Dongping People's Procuratorate?

252
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,180
The Wan Hai case is huge,

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,460
you've been holding it up,

254
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,300
who do you think is
carrying this pressure for you?

255
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,060
It's me!

256
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,140
I've been taking the blame
from above and the public!

257
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,340
Yet, you're upset!

258
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,180
I don't need you.

259
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,540
I have the law to carry it for me.

260
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,740
Li Renjun, let me tell you,

261
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,820
no matter who handles this case,

262
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,940
as long as the facts are not clear

263
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,740
and the evidence is not conclusive,

264
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,860
it cannot be prosecuted.

265
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,540
If you have a problem,
take it to the provincial office.

266
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,780
Go talk to the higher-ups.

267
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,700
Your removal

268
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,060
was a decision made by the committee!

269
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,660
Don't act like a martyr here.

270
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,500
Fine,

271
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,220
I will report it.

272
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,140
I will definitely report it.

273
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,260
I will tell them
you remove a prosecutor at will,

274
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,180
and I'll accuse you
of dereliction of duty!

275
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,260
What would you do if it were you?

276
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,500
Two requests of
supplemental investigation,

277
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,700
both filed on the very last day.

278
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,660
It's not that I didn't
give him a chance.

279
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,860
But I can't do it forever.

280
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,740
Keep returning the case,
it'll never be prosecuted.

281
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,340
Wan Hai case took

282
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,980
two years in total,

283
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,540
we can't just abandon it.

284
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,380
Pressure from the society
and the higher-ups

285
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,740
is all on my shoulders.

286
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,660
Did I say anything?

287
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,740
No, not a word.

288
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,260
The case is retreated at his will.

289
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,940
Sometimes,

290
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,420
I can't even tell

291
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,620
if he's targeting me

292
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,780
or the case.

293
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,940
Everyone in the procuratorate
can criticize him,

294
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,500
only I can't.

295
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,900
I say one thing, he fires back with ten.

296
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,540
Caution is good,

297
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,860
but when you take it to the extreme,

298
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,540
caution turns into paranoia.

299
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,740
I don't know how to talk to him.

300
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,420
Forget it.

301
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,420
He's gone now.

302
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,540
But

303
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,780
if he really killed himself

304
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,940
because of depression,

305
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,500
part of that's on me.

306
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,400
[4 March
Day 6 Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

307
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,760
[Day 7 Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

308
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,380
Here, look at this.

309
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,260
Even if these devices are depreciated,

310
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,780
they should at least go for this price.

311
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,100
If it's lower than this,

312
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,340
we can't sell.

313
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,740
Problem is,
the price is not up to us.

314
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,140
Okay, I got it.

315
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,860
I'll try to find
a few more mining companies,

316
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,820
see if anyone's willing to pay more.

317
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,300
Brother,

318
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,060
does that sound like something
a brother would say?

319
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,220
You call this lending money?

320
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,540
Who charges interest that high?

321
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,140
Why don't you just go rob a bank?

322
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,060
At least that's faster.

323
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,220
What collateral?

324
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,060
What do I

325
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,740
even have left to put up as collateral?

326
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,820
Take me then.

327
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:15,860
Bro,

328
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,340
this mine,

329
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,940
do you dare to take it
if I give it to you?

330
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,300
You can have it.

331
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,900
Besides, this mine
belongs to the bank now.

332
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,260
What the…?

333
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,380
That path won't work.

334
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,300
Don't go down the loan shark route.

335
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,740
For our family, that's just

336
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,020
pouring gasoline on the fire.

337
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,540
What are they doing?

338
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,140
Take your feet off!

339
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,380
I'm eating.

340
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,540
Counting something?

341
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,940
I'm adding up

342
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,940
the devices in our mine.

343
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,140
They're useless to us now,

344
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,740
might as well sell them for some money.

345
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,340
Uncle,

346
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,020
are you crazy?

347
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,460
How many times have I told you

348
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,180
you can't sell them?

349
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,140
How are we supposed
to survive without them?

350
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,420
You think I want to?

351
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,820
The bank's been calling every other day.

352
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,940
We've got to show them something.

353
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,500
Come on, is that our problem?

354
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,740
That's the bank's problem.

355
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,540
The bank lent us the money

356
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,860
to buy equipment and start mining.

357
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,060
We bought the equipment,

358
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,580
now the Mining Bureau won't let us work.

359
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,740
Can you ask the bank

360
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,060
to talk to the Mining Bureau?

361
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,220
Can you make this right?

362
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,820
My prince,

363
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,900
owe money, pay it back.
That's how it works.

364
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,820
You think the bank
cares about your problems?

365
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,500
I've got the equipment,
now I need to mine!

366
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,580
So that I can pay them back, right?

367
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,100
Why did the Mining Bureau shut us down?

368
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,980
Because you were mining illegally.

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,140
Well, that's to make money
to pay the bank!

370
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,140
But the bureau won't let me do it.

371
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,500
Isn't it a giant paradox?

372
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,220
So I wanted to sell equipment
for some money.

373
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,300
How much money
can you make from that then?

374
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,140
Can you cover the interest?

375
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,820
- The equipment…
- It's better than nothing.

376
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,140
Better than nothing?

377
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,940
How much can you pay
with that little money?

378
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,620
And what about after that?

379
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,460
Stop arguing.

380
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,500
Just talk it through.

381
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,300
Hello?

382
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,460
Hello, Fu Bing?

383
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,020
This is the Guidance Group
of the provincial procuratorate.

384
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,380
If it's about Zhang Wenjing,

385
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,860
don't call me.

386
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,100
Your law firm…

387
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,340
Jing,

388
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,740
is this a good time?

389
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,180
Yeah.

390
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,820
Good, then.

391
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,100
I didn't get Qiao's location records
before his death.

392
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,940
Captain Jiang's guarding that
too tightly.

393
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,180
It's okay.

394
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:01,980
Oh, Jing,

395
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,740
I cooked you something.

396
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,020
I know you're very busy,

397
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,060
barely have time to eat dinner.

398
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,380
So I made you some hot food.

399
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,460
Thank you.

400
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:12,980
It's nothing.

401
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,700
Oh, and…

402
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,140
I…

403
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,340
I got you

404
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,500
a thermos cup.

405
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,220
Figured you can drink
more hot water with it.

406
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,980
I don't usually drink much water.

407
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,420
That's not good.

408
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,380
You've got to drink more,

409
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,060
especially with your job,
always out on cases,

410
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,100
you should definitely drink more water.

[Beijing]

412
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:42,940
Have you been there?

413
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:43,980
Yes.

414
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,420
How was it?

415
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,020
How else could it be? Terrible.

416
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,740
Zhou Mei is so pitiful.

417
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,780
Did you give them the money?

418
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,460
I did.

419
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,900
Listen,

420
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,220
Dou's school stuff
is pretty much sorted.

421
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,300
[Dongping Hotel]
Start next semester,

422
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,580
they even agreed to put her
in an advanced class.

423
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,580
And the house thing.

424
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,860
I was going to rent one,

425
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,660
but I checked out three more places,

426
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,100
my legs nearly gave out.

427
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,580
And guess what,

428
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,580
Jiang Yuan helped us.

429
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,980
One of his friends

430
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,780
owns an apartment near the school.

431
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,060
He's abroad, so the place is empty.

432
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,780
Said we could use it for now,

433
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,580
just temporarily.

434
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,460
Once you're here,

435
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,540
we really need to thank him properly.

436
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,620
OK.

437
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,900
Something's off with you.

438
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,780
What's wrong? Tell me.

439
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,700
Nothing.

440
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,700
Just that…

441
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,900
I talked to Renjun

442
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,980
about Qiao today.

443
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,940
Then out of nowhere,

444
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,940
he asked me

445
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,100
"Hong Liang,

446
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,100
do you really know Qiao?"

447
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,820
It hit me hard.

448
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,260
I realized I didn't really know Qiao.

449
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,620
I don't seem to know Renjun either.

450
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,780
Pretty frustrating.

451
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,460
Now that you mention it,

452
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,500
I remember something

453
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,260
you told me before.

454
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,260
What?

455
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,260
Back in college,

456
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,660
they were both running
for student council president.

457
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,420
They were neck and neck,

458
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,340
either one of them could've won.

459
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,180
And in the end?

460
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,620
In the end,

461
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,100
they were tied,

462
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,380
then Qiao voted for Renjun.

463
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,660
And Li Renjun voted for himself.

464
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,380
So Li Renjun won.

465
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,180
So sneaky.

466
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,660
Right.

467
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,940
You three

468
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,660
lived together for four years,

469
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,340
you didn't even know

470
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,700
he was gonna vote for himself.

471
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,780
Totally.

472
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,940
So,

473
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,900
no one really knows anyone.

474
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,020
Just like now,

475
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,100
I don't even know
what's going on in your head.

476
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,620
I'm an open book in front of you.

477
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,300
You know exactly what I'm thinking.

478
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,940
People who claim they're an open book

479
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,060
usually aren't.

480
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,140
I'm serious,

481
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,020
wrap things up

482
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,220
and get back to Beijing.

483
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,180
You've got a pile of work
waiting for you.

484
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,420
Got it.

485
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,780
Don't get too tired.

486
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,180
Get some rest, don't stay up too late.

487
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:22,700
Bye now.

488
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,580
Good night.

489
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,220
Good night.

490
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,780
Wan Hai not being prosecuted,

491
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,940
it's holding back your promotion,

492
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,540
keeping you from
becoming the prosecutor-general!

493
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,340
Am I

494
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,020
holding back the entire
Dongping People's Procuratorate?

495
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,060
The initial assumption is

496
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,020
something could be wrong
in his personal life

497
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,660
or maybe at work.

498
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,940
If we're saying his depression
led to the suicide,

499
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,060
then it must've been triggered
by his removal

500
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,900
from the Wan Hai case.

501
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,740
Why?

502
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,620
Happy family,

503
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,060
nothing's wrong with him,

504
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,180
he's healthy.

505
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,140
Then it must be the workplace.

506
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,420
I will tell them
you remove a prosecutor at will,

507
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,460
and I'll accuse you
of dereliction of duty!

508
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,780
What's wrong?

509
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,620
The Police have

510
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,740
ruled it.

511
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,260
Suicide.

512
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,580
Are you sure?

513
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,860
Pretty much.

514
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,020
What's the cause of suicide?

515
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,060
Why?

516
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,060
Did something happen to him?

517
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,660
Because…

518
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,820
Because of me.

519
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,860
What are you talking about?

520
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,940
What do you mean because of you?

521
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,860
Renjun,

522
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,580
you must not think like that.

523
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,900
Think about your office,

524
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,740
how many cases does
each prosecutor handle every year?

525
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,900
If everyone who got pulled off a case

526
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,820
couldn't handle it,

527
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,740
how many people would've died?

528
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,060
You just

529
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,420
take too much on yourself sometimes.

530
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,420
Most people would run from
this kind of responsibility.

531
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,620
But you…

532
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,180
what are you doing to yourself?

533
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,260
It's not like that.

534
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,580
Looking back now,

535
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,580
during the six months
after I pulled him off,

536
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,540
something changed in him.

537
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,620
He's already different.

538
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,700
If he committed suicide,

539
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,900
it's because of me.

540
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,020
If someone killed him,

541
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,180
it's still because of me.

542
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,420
No matter how he died,

543
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,260
it's all because of me.

544
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,420
- I killed him.
- Renjun.

545
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,180
Renjun…

546
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,140
Don't think like that.

547
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,180
That was a decision
made by the committee.

548
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,140
It wasn't on you.

549
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,100
Stop overthinking, OK?

550
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,540
I'm begging you.

551
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,500
Can you leave me alone for a while?

552
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,660
I want to be alone.

553
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,500
Then promise me,

554
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,380
don't overthink this.

00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,020
Hello.

Zhang Wenjing, visitor.

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,260
What happened?

Someone hit you?

561
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,020
I've been threatened here, too.

562
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,180
They threatened me with my daughter.

563
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,780
I can't believe this, Fu.

00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,900
Do you know why Zhang Wenjing

566
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,660
is considered a gangster?

567
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,180
Because you want her to be!

568
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,820
Then do you believe

569
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,180
we could make you one too?

570
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,860
Forget it.

571
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,220
We can't beat them.

572
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,500
Our firm got trashed.

573
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,300
I'm being sued.

574
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,260
And my license is suspended.

575
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,060
Sorry.

576
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,500
I can't defend you anymore.

577

You're quitting?

Are you afraid?

Qiao Zhenxing is dead.

581
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,180

582
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,260
Qiao Zhenxing is dead.

583

Don't blame me.

How would I know about that?

594
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,300
I wanna know too.

595
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,060

Let's drink this…

599
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,180
Here.

600

Take this

601
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,060
to my sister-in-law and Ran.

602
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,340
They haven't eaten all day.

603

Don't go, sit down.

605
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,980
What now?

606
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,100
I haven't finished yet.

607

Sit, just sit.

Listen to me, sit down.

609
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,420
Listen,

610
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,500
the day before your brother died,

611
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,020
he came to see me.

612
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,420
Look.

613
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,420
When was this photo taken?

614
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,220
Any idea?

615
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,180
Two days ago,
I took my sisters out to dinner.

616
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,620
Where did you get this?

617
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,620
Think about it.

618
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,220
Anyone suspicious

619
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,500
near you that night?

620
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,980
Oh my god.

621
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,900
Was this taken secretly?

622
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,500

623

By the way, Zhou Biao,

626
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,580

627
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,540
I won't.

If anything happens, call me.

629

The next day,

630
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,940
he's dead.

631
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,020
Have you told Jiang Hongjun about this?

632
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,260
I didn't.

633

Your information is very important.

You have to let the Police know.

636
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,620

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,500
asked if we dared to let
a third-party agency verify it.

757
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,220
She didn't say it impulsively,

758
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,180
she said it to us.

759
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,020
We can't get in touch with Fu Bing now.

760
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,580
If we don't figure out
why Zhang Wenjing pleaded guilty,

761
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,020
our job as the Guidance Group

762
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,500
can't be done.

763
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,500
Come in.

764
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,700
Ms. Zheng.

765
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,340
Mr. Li, Mr. Wang.

766
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,860
I'm really sorry.

767
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,740
When you went to see Zhang Wenjing,

768
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,940
I had a meeting in the city,

769
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,940
so I didn't make it.

770
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,300
But I heard from Mr. Xie

771
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,180
it went well.

772
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,700
Zhang Wenjing pleaded guilty.

773
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,940
That's right.

774
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,820
Mr. Li, to be honest,

776
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,060
really are impressive.

777
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,540
We've been working on Zhang Wenjing

778
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,500
for so many years.

779
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,540
No matter how we talked to her,
nothing worked.

780
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,020
But once Ms. Zheng
and her team showed up,

781
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,220
Zhang Wenjing confessed right away.

782
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,500
That really helped us out, big time.

783
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,620
We actually think
it's a bit out of the blue.

784
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,700
Why?

785
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,620

00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,820
Thank you very much.

790

in the Wan Hai case.

from one of Wan Hai's guys, telling me
to go to the Dream Paris suite

906
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,740
I think…

907
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,540

It was 8 or 9 AM anyway.

915

916

Didn't think much of it at the time.

playing cards last night,

918
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,300
