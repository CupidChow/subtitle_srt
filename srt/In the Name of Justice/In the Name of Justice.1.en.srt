And has Mr. Wang committed one?

Ms. Zheng, a mistake is a mistake.

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,100
We have to admit it.

247
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,420
Mr. Wang let Lin Xi
visit his father's grave

248
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,100
not because he's soft

249
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,500
but to win his trust,

250
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,940
hoping Lin Xi

251
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,580
would confess everything once in custody.

he did, right?

to Commissioner Sun:

281
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,860
since Chunxiang belongs to

00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,100

283
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,220

00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,980
What are you still doing here?

570
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,300
Work?

571
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,020
I've handed everything over.

572
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,540
Nothing left.

573
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,620
Trying to hurry me
into signing your exit papers, huh?

574
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,500
You've been my boss for years.

575
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,580
You know

576
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,060
I'm no climber.

577
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,380
Even if you

578
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,180
never sign that resignation,

579
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,060
you'll still be my good leader,

580
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,140
my good friend.

581
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,260
I've put your paperwork in.

582
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,780
Prosecutor Zhang just started

583
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,220
and he's buried.

584
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,020
Give it a little time.

585
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,780
That what a friend says?

586
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,180
What,

587
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,740
you want me to chase Zhang for you?

588
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,820
Come on, don't mess with me.

589
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,460
You know I'm eager to leave.

590
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,500
Stop throwing roadblocks.

591
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,020
Hong Liang,

592
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,220
there are only two reasons

593
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,580
someone can't wait to shed the uniform.

594
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,700
One: they've gone slack,

595
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,700
lost their ideals

596
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,860
and passion for the work.

597
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,820
Is that you?

598
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,900
Definitely not.

599
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,220
Two: they've got dirt

600
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,380
that won't wash off.

601
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,620
I'm squeaky clean.

602
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,100
Would a shady guy even make it
into the Eleventh Division?

603
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,620
Check eight generations.

604
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,620
I'm as red-blooded as they come.

605
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,220
Cleanest in the whole office.

606
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,140
Exactly. Everyone in Eleventh is solid.

607
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,380
And we see the bigger picture, right?

608
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,260
Give me a bit of leave

609
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,620
so I can calm my wife first.

610
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,100
How many days?

611
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,860
Come on, at least a month.

612
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,300
Okay, 20 days.

613
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,380
Fifteen is rock bottom.

614
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,660
I can't spare a day less.

615
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,620
You see,

616
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,580
I've got to rent a place,

617
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,300
find a school for the kid,

618
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,740
schedule dinner

619
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,940
with the new boss.

620
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,780
Big shots aren't easy to book.

621
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,580
I even had to go there myself each time,

622
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,220
and the schedule was never fixed.

623
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,340
I need some buffer.

624
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,300
Seven days, public holidays included.

625
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,940
You're a lawyer,

626
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,500
cutting into statutory holidays?

627
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,980
One day to find housing,

628
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,380
one to hunt schools,

629
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,220
one

630
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,540
to wine-and-dine the new colleagues,

631
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,340
the rest for the wife.

632
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,340
Your minimum's three days

633
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,980
but you ask for one month.

634
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,100
How does that compute?

635
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,220
Friends see through but don't call it out.

636
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,980
Seven days will do.

637
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,060
Deal.

638
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,620
I'm off.

639
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,580
Mr. Wang,

640
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,860
listen to me.

641
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,620
I'll brief the higher-ups

642
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,540
and ask for a reinvestigation.

643
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,500
Don't shoulder everything yourself.

644
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,540
Those two bailiffs
bear some responsibility too.

645
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,060
One person taking the fall versus three

646
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,660
makes a big difference in discipline.

647
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,780
No need.

648
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,460
So you'd drag

649
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,940
two brand-new bailiffs down with me?

650
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,740
Those kids finally landed stable jobs.

651
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,020
Do you have any idea

652
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,060
how hard the civil-service exam is?

653
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,180
And you have it easy?

654
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,020
You're months from retirement.

655
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,260
Once Hong Liang files today,

656
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,780
your demotion

657
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,260
is a done deal.

658
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,740
Have you and Auntie calculated

659
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,500
how much your pension will drop?

660
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:11,940
Mr. Wang.

661
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,340
How'd you even find this place?

662
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,540
Asked around.

663
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,860
Brought a few bottles of liquor for you.

664
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,340
Then come in.

665
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,780
Let me take it.

666
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,260
Honey,

667
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,620
we've got company!

668
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,980
Oh, Auntie's home?

669
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,340
Hello, Auntie.

670
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,940
Here's some fruit.

671
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,420
So you know he's been wronged?

672
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,740
I'm really touched

673
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,500
you all came to see him.

674
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,260
- You are...
- You all?

675
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,500
Just remembered

676
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,460
a meeting at home.

677
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,500
Gotta run.

678
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:51,980
Don't go!

679
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,860
No, the office...

680
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,620
Since you're here, stay.

681
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,420
Come on.

682
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,780
Come inside.

683
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,300
Hurry in.

684
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,020
Dinner's ready.

685
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,580
Really, I...

686
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,260
Come on, come on.

687
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,380
- Ms. Zheng, you're here too.
- Get inside.

688
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,620
Right place, right time.

689
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,660
- Yes.
- This way, quickly.

690
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,300
- Come.
- I...

691
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,260
No...

692
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,140
Sit right here.

693
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,140
Next to Yaping.

694
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,460
I'll grab bowls and chopsticks.

695
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,180
What luck.

696
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,340
Nice liquor. Sauce-aroma baijiu.

697
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,460
Let's drink this tonight.

698
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,220
Great.

699
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,300
I've brought the cups.

700
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,540
Did you get this from your father-in-law

701
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,900
or buy it yourself?

702
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,220
Bought it myself, of course.

703
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,900
Your father-in-law sells liquor?

704
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,260
He used to be our boss.

705
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,780
A leader?

706
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,420
Retiring soon.

707
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,820
Serves on the provincial CPPCC now.

708
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,660
Still a leader.

709
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:32,980
Aren't you hot?

710
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:33,940
Take off your coat.

711
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,780
Right, right.

712
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,100
Just in time for dinner.

713
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,980
I've been skipping supper,

714
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:42,820
trying to slim down.

715
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,500
Lost track of time.

716
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,580
Sorry to barge in.

717
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,180
Skipping dinner's no good.

718
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:48,980
Bad for the stomach.

719
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,460
These dumplings just came out.

720
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,700
Try them while they're hot.

721
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,300
All right.

722
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,180
Here you are.

723
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:54,940
None for me.

724
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,140
Mr. Wang.

725
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:57,860
Thank you, thank you.

726
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,580
Look at this kid.

727
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,260
Sorry, sorry, my fault.

728
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,500
Here, give it to me.

729
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,620
Auntie,

730
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,500
let me introduce:

731
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,420
this is Hong Liang,

732
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,060
the Eleventh Division prosecutor

733
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,380
handling Mr. Wang's case.

734
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,260
Hong Liang.

735
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,740
Auntie.

736
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,700
She'll stir-fry two more dishes.

737
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,660
Fry what?

738
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,500
There's no food left.

739
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,260
Hong,

740
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,300
you're the prosecutor
of Eleventh Division,

741
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,060
and the lead prosecutor on my case,

742
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,180
yet

743
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,020
you came to my house in person.

744
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,380
I understand

745
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,660
and appreciate it.

746
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,900
I was the one at fault.

747
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,100
You did nothing wrong.

748
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,420
Working with

749
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,100
Ms. Zheng lately,

750
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,900
I've learned a lot.

751
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,140
She's an outstanding prosecutor.

752
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,580
Exactly.

753
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,260
I hope you two

754
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,460
become good friends.

755
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,420
Sure.

756
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,260
Preferably not just work contacts.

757
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,660
Can't.

758
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,660
He's leaving soon.

759
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,780
I heard

760
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,020
you're quitting because you didn't
get promoted to deputy director.

761
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,660
Makes me sound power-hungry.

762
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,540
Well, I am.

763
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,420
No,

764
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,700
you deserve that title.

765
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,020
You're my role model.

766
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,580
What year did you join?

767
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,820
Twenty-ten...

768
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,740
Older than me, right?

769
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,500
Yeah.

770
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,900
At your age, still no deputy director...

771
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,780
Hong Liang,

772
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,740
that liquor you brought

773
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:49,940
is nice.

774
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,860
Come on, let's drink.

775
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,580
Sure.

776
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,100
Cheers.

777
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,100
Here's to you.

778
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:55,660
Thanks.

779
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,020
You said you're leaving. Where to?

780
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,060
Beijing.

781
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,140
The Supreme Procuratorate.

782
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,740
Think they'll hand you

783
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,420
a deputy-director post up there?

784
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,460
I'm going to be general counsel,

785
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,260
for a state-owned enterprise.

786
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,660
A SOE, huh?

787
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,540
Coat off.

788
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,380
Hong,

789
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,340
you're already a level-three senior.

790
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,060
Can you really walk away
from the uniform?

791
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,140
If he can be ruthless to his own,

792
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,780
what's there to cling to?

793
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,540
Mr. Wang,

794
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,620
not everyone

795
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,180
cherishes the uniform

796
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,020
and honor the way you do.

797
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,260
True.

798
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,060
He values

799
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,300
his honor most.

800
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,980
He's been an
outstanding prosecutor every year.

801
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,500
Slap a disciplinary mark on him,

802
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,540
how can he

803
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,420
- face his colleagues?
- Enough.

804
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,580
Stop it.

805
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,300
You...

806
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,540
Ms. Zheng,

807
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,860
shall we...

808
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,020
Eat.

809
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,620
How?

810
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,380
While it's hot.

811
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,940
Mr. Wang,

812
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,140
do you know why

813
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,100
I seconded you

814
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,260
to help with this case?

815
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,140
The first time I met you

816
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,420
was at the Outstanding Prosecutors'
Commendation Ceremony.

817
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,460
Over the years

818
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,380
you've handled 2,183 cases,

819
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,420
large and small,

820
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,980
without a single slip-up.

821
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,020
Even nationwide,

822
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,260
that figure

823
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,460
is astounding.

824
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,420
A fair society

825
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,060
depends on

826
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,580
prosecutors like you.

827
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,660
Ms. Zheng, since you said that,

828
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,420
I have something to add,

829
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,300
if I may.

830
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,900
When I heard 2,183,

831
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,900
- Prosecutor Hong,
- my mind just...

832
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,780
may I ask you something?

833
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,100
I'm all ears.

834
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,580
What counts

835
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,580
as outstanding

836
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,260
in your Eleventh Division?

837
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,820
Our Commissioner Sun defines it as...

838
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,300
How many of your own people

839
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,140
do you have to take down
to hit your annual KPIs?

840
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,980
Maybe I'm thinking too small.

841
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,700
Put it this way:

842
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,700
what sort of case

843
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,340
earns you a citation?

844
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,100
If we're talking citations,

845
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,540
my husband just got the biggest one.

846
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,860
Is this how you treat someone
who's done the system a favor?

847
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,700
Do you even have a conscience?

848
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,300
That's enough!

849
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,060
You realize

850
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,260
if Lin Xi really dies,

851
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,900
I won't even be able to go home,

852
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,700
let alone sit here eating dumplings.
