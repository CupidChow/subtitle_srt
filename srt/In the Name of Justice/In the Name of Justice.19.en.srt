1
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,620
Gong Xiaozhi, the guy
Qiao Zhenxing used to send money to,

2
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,210
is doing food delivery now.

3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,100
What?

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,010
You wanna mess with me?

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,330
All right...

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,460
Stop...

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,900
Last name Gong?
[*Gong means 'male'.]

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,130
Why doesn't he use "Mu"?
[*Mu means 'female'.]

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,010
Doesn't even acknowledge
his own parents.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,730
And that Yang Jing,

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,370
she's a criminal police
of the Development Zone sub-bureau.

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,580
Qiao Zhenxing used to call her
all the time before he died.

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,900
Was he still investigating
the Wan Hai case?

14
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,720
[In the Name of Justice]

15
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,720
[Episode 19]

16
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,100
According to our rules

17
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,500
and procedures,

18
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,100
before you officially leave,

19
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,820
we need to have a conversation.

20
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,410
Any last requests work-wise?

21
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,850
Anything left unfinished?

22
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,780
Any suggestions for the organization?

23
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,410
You can tell me now.

24
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,260
Also,

25
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,450
is there anything

26
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,780
you personally need help with?

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,690
As long as it doesn't violate policy

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,130
or principles,

29
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,170
the organization will do what it can.

30
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,570
Since I joined Eleventh Division,

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,130
I haven't made a single friend.

32
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,340
That's not something
the organization can fix.

33
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,100
It's more of a
character-related issue.

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,410
It's all good.

35
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,060
It's been a few years

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,820
since I transferred to
the provincial office.

37
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,660
He was the one
who mentored me when I started.

38
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,540
I went through several departments.

39
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,690
Only in the past few years
did I get to Eleventh Division.

40
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,450
Commissioner Xiangqun
has always looked out for me.

41
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,260
He's very nice.

42
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,890
Really appreciate it.

43
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,220
But because the nature of our work

44
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,780
is kind of like
'turning the blade inward',

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,730
our colleagues in other departments

46
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,130
tend to be a bit

47
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,980
guarded around us.

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,850
I get it.

49
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,170
So sometimes, you know,

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,890
even if I feel wronged at work,

51
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,410
well,

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,170
I'm not carrying it alone anyway.

53
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,290
He's got my back.

54
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,690
That's good.

55
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,980
Really good.

56
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,170
Turn the blade inward...

57
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,660
Blade...

58
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,980
A sharp blade cuts through a mess fast.

59
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,850
But speaking of "fast,"

60
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,580
lately I've noticed

61
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,930
there are certain,

62
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,290
well, a very few

63
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,370
of our leaders

64
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,220
who don't handle issues

65
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,290
'fast' enough.

66
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,220
Kind of dragging things out,

67
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,220
even holding up work.

68
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,020
Hong Liang,

69
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,250
who are you talking about?

70
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,370
I said a very few leaders.

71
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,290
Don't take it personally.

72
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,290
Take this for example,

73
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,290
that...

74
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,850
water sample

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,580
I collected on Zhongxing Road.

76
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,610
I submitted the report.

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,170
And then I've been waiting.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,850
But where's the result?

79
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,100
Another example is

80
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,140
that flash drive left by
Qiao Zhenxing before his death.

81
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,460
I also handed it in.

82
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,850
Been waiting just as long.

83
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,610
And where's that result?

84
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,020
One more example,

85
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,220
that crematorium worker,
Lei Guangfa, ran off.

86
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,490
He told me to trust the Dongping Police.

87
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,580
And they've been looking into it
for a while now.

88
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,580
Where is the result?

89
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,610
Zhou Mei, Qiao Zhenxing's wife,
came by the other day.

90
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,140
She asked,

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,730
"where's the result?"

92
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,810
"Be patient", that's what she got.

93
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,540
You told a grieving wife
to "be patient"?

94
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,170
What kind of answer is that?

95
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,050
Is that how a leader should behave?

96
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,250
Do take it personally now!

97
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,250
I'm talking about you!

98
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,370
Hong Liang.

99
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,220
Those questions you fired off
just now, were sharp,

100
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,730
but also very real.

101
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,730
You mentioned water sample, right?

102
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,020
Good.

103
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,930
The water sample is here.

104
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,700
You're a prosecutor about to leave,

105
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,900
I can show you.

[Examination Report,
Haidong Provincial People's Procuratorate]

107
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,480
[Examination Report,
Haidong Provincial People's Procuratorate]

108
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,900
Mr. Zhang,

109
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,580
what about the one from Dongping?

110
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,490
At the Dongping Police Bureau.

111
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,930
Without a comparison,
what's the point of looking at this one?

112
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,100
Good question.

113
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,810
Should we send this result to Dongping,

114
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,900
or bring theirs here?

115
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,900
If we take this there,

116
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,850
it's asking them to
investigate themselves.

117
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,170
Bring theirs here,

118
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,290
it shows the provincial office
completely distrusts

119
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,410
the municipal office.

120
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,050
You're an experienced prosecutor,

121
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,460
right?

122
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,730
What do you think we should do?

123
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,780
Have some water.

124
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,140
You see, when we deal with issues,

125
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,810
it's like

126
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,930
spotting an iceberg in the sea.

127
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,900
The visible part above the surface

128
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,050
is only one fifth or even one tenth

129
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,900
of the whole thing.

130
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,730
We can't just fixate on that tiny tip

131
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,930
sticking out of the water, right?

132
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,220
What matters more

133
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,700
is what's beneath the surface.

134
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,340
Yes,

135
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,250
you're right, sir.

136
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,250
I feel honored.

137
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,930
Right before I leave, I get to sit in on

138
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,220
such a vivid lecture from leadership.

139
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,220
Much appreciated.

140
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,540
Hong Liang.

141
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,700
Cut the sarcasm.

142
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,900
If you have something to say,
just say it. If not, get out!

143
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,930
Wait...

144
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,370
Xiangqun,

145
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,290
I actually think

146
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,610
what Hong Liang just said
was the most honest thing

147
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,100
I've heard.

148
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,370
I want you to finish
what you were saying.

149
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,370
Your word might be

150
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,020
the most valuable input we have

151
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,410
on how to proceed with this case.

152
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,540
Okay.

153
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,980
Mr. Zhang, about what I say next,

154
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,700
if you don't stop me,

155
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,490
I'll take it as

156
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,290
your silent agreement.

157
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,460
First of all, my resignation report.

158
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,100
I know it's been a hassle.

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,770
But could you do me a favor,

160
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,220
keep it for a few more days?

161
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,300
Second,

162
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,420
Commissioner Sun,

163
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,820
please prepare a full set of

164
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,980
Qiao Zhenxing's

165
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,650
bank statements and call logs

166
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,730
from the past six months.

167
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,180
Give it to me by tomorrow morning.

168
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,250
I inform you,

169
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,340
I'm taking a leave.

170
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,340
Seven days, not a day less,

171
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,420
and legal holidays don't count.

172
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,940
Where are you going?

173
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,370
Don't ask where I'm going.

174
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,250
And leave me alone.

175
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,250
Mind your own business.

176
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,100
And would you please

177
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,890
call Zhou Mei in person?

178
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,180
No matter how we end up

179
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,010
defining Qiao's case in the future,

180
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,770
we can't let his family
lose faith in us.

181
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,460
You can't tell them to "be patient"!

182
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,610
Just say "we haven't given up

183
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,610
on Qiao's case."

184
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,180
Will it kill you to say that?

185
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:42,820
Mr. Zhang,

186
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,650
I'll take my leave now.

187
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,940
I'm gonna show them

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,180
Eleventh Division

189
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,490
is not just here to collect a paycheck.

190
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,580
Even if a prosecutor
of Eleventh Division is leaving his job,

191
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,940
he can still fight evil,
be it gods or ghosts!

192
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,700
We have to prove,

193
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,300
we're not just prosecutors,

194
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,420
we're also people with dignity!

195
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,100
What a sharp blade.

196
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,800
[Dongping Municipal
People's Procuratorate]

197
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:25,940
Mr. Li.

198
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,130
Sorry to keep you waiting.

199
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,060
There was

200
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,490
a last-minute meeting just now.

201
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,770
Sit down.

202
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,420
Okay.

203
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,530
Mr. Li,

204
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,220
is there something
you wanted to talk about?

205
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:40,940
Just wanted to chat.

206
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,460
I didn't know you're
so close to Mr. Sun.

207
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,700
You two worked pretty well together
on the Wan Hai case.

208
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,100
Since you took over that case,

209
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,250
it took like, ten days,

210
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,820
for the police to open a case
against Zhang Wenjing,

211
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:01,770
right?

212
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,340
Mr. Li,

213
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,370
I know what you're thinking.

214
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,300
Yes, I worked well with Mr. Sun.

215
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,770
After all these years,

216
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,700
we trust each other deeply.

217
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,940
They actually removed Mr. Qiao

218
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,610
and labeled me a gang member.

219
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,940
Then they brought in that Xie guy.

220
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,890
Just told me

221
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,220
without any interrogation,

222
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,980
"plead guilty and we'll go easy.

223
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,530
And if you don't,

224
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,700
you'll rot in jail."

225
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,180
Is that how a prosecutor

226
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,770
is supposed to handle a case?

227
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,490
I believed Zhang Wenjing had issues,

228
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,820
so I asked Mr. Sun to look into her.

229
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,010
Turns out she really did.

230
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,530
So that's how

231
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,060
you've always worked together for years?

232
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,610
The Wan Hai case...

233
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,420
actually, the Zhang Wenjing case.

234
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,100
Did we fail

235
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,580
to carry out our review duties
on her case?

236
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,300
It's not uncommon

237
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,530
to find issues during reviews

238
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,940
and send a case back for
supplemental investigation.

239
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,220
But Zhang Wenjing's case

240
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,130
wasn't sent back for more investigation,

241
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,100
mainly because we were too busy

242
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,010
supporting the Guidance Group.

243
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,460
By the way, Mr. Li,

244
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,850
are you a bit worried
because everyone at dinner yesterday

245
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,650
seemed a little too close?

246
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,460
Frankly,

247
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,610
we do work smoothly together.

248
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,940
That kind of coordination comes from

249
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,130
years of working,

250
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,890
supervising, and grinding

251
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,820
through tough cases together.

252
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:36,700
Of course,

253
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,220
none of us

254
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,820
should be acting in self-interest.

255
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,890
Mutual trust

256
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,940
and efficient case handling,

257
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,420
that's a real benefit
to the people of Dongping,

258
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,420
don't you think?

259
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,940
We've been working together

260
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,530
for 18 years now, right?

261
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,490
You mentored us when we first joined

262
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,460
the Municipal Procuratorate.

263
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,060
You're basically a teacher to us.

264
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,220
Lately,

265
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,700
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

266
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,420
Don't you think...

267
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,060
we've been guilty of

268
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,770
jumping to conclusions?

269
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,850
Of assuming one's guilty
until proven innocent?

270
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:26,770
Mr. Li,

271
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,010
that kind of talk should be kept
behind closed doors.

272
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,180
If you ask me, the Zhang Wenjing case

273
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,180
did get dropped

274
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,250
due to some flaws in the evidence,

275
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,890
and the Guidance Group pushed hard.

276
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,850
But that doesn't mean every accusation
against her was false.

277
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,580
Do you remember
what Ms. Lan said yesterday?

278
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,610
Don't let Zhang Wenjing case derail
the investigation on Wan Hai case.

279
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,730
Think about the bigger picture.

280
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,850
The fake documents

281
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,340
were likely just Wan Hai's people

282
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,580
trying to mislead us—

283
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,980
pushing

284
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,980
Zhang Wenjing out

285
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,770
as a scapegoat.

286
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,650
And maybe Zhang flipped

287
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,370
because of internal drama,

288
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,770
some falling out over money.

289
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,820
Other evidence in the Wan Hai case
has all been solidified,

290
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,340
we can reopen Zhang Wenjing case

291
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,770
and re-investigate it separately.

292
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,130
Let's investigate
Zhang's case separately,

293
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,980
since there are problems

294
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,130
with her evidence.

295
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:24,890
But for Wan Hai,

296
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,770
the evidence chain is solid.

297
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,770
We can still prosecute.

298
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,460
Don't jump to conclusions so early.

299
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,770
Those forged signatures,

300
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,580
Wan Hai said he did it.

301
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,460
Have you verified that?

302
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,980
Qian Bo

303
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,890
told Shao Xiaoyan

304
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,650
to frame Wan Hai.

305
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,980
What is Qian Bo's motive?

306
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,010
Did you look into that?

307
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,180
The case was already at trial.

308
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,340
Once the flaws were fixed,
it'd be ready for sentencing.

309
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,420
You think I'd stir up trouble

310
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,420
for no reason at this stage, Mr. Li?

311
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,850
All these years,

312
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,420
we've worked together on more cases

313
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,940
than we can count.

314
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,100
It's only natural

315
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,580
that we get closer

316
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,130
and have a better relationship,
isn't it?

317
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,700
Ms. Lan values talents,

318
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,650
always thinking about
the bigger picture for Dongping.

319
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:16,650
Right,

320
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,890
it's because you handled
the Wan Hai case so well

321
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,700
that you were brought into the circle.

322
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,420
You know how cautious Ms. Lan is,

323
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,610
even though you're related,

324
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,580
she didn't just pull you in

325
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,250
right away.

326
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,700
But it's different now.

327
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,370
She thinks highly of you.

328
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,420
Renjun,

329
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,980
do your best.

330
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,490
I'll retire in a few years.

331
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,530
No luck left for me.

332
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,100
Otherwise, I'd still be
riding your coattails,

333
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,580
how nice,

334
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,650
right?

335
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,980
Yeah... You've grown up.

336
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,220
I shouldn't have hit you.

337
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,980
I was wrong.

338
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,730
I apologize to you.

339
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,820
All right,

340
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,370
don't take it to heart.

341
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,730
I won't hit you again.

342
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,060
I regret it.

343
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,580
Before your father went in,

344
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,580
he gave me one job,

345
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,130
to get you out of here.

346
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,100
I shouldn't have gone soft
and let you stay.

347
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,010
How can I go?

348
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,010
Out there all alone,

349
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,610
while my dad's locked up,

350
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,700
and let you take over this business?

351
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,140
What can you do here?

352
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,980
I've grown up.

353
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,290
I can handle things now.

354
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,860
Yeah, you've grown up.

355
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,290
And we've all gotten old.

356
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,420
Uncle,

357
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,050
these past couple of days,

358
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,250
I've had the same dream,

359
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,090
visiting Dad in prison.

360
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,420
Why was I wearing sunglasses that day?

361
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,380
Not because I didn't want him
to see my bruises,

362
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,700
but because I couldn't bear
to look him in the eye.

363
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,010
Not until he said,

364
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,980
"Come here,

365
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,090
look at me now.

366
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,530
You want to end up like this?"

367
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,660
only then did I finally look at him.

368
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,730
I just looked at him.

369
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,250
I saw...

370
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,380
his hair,

371
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,180
it was all white.

372
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,330
He's only been in for a few years,

373
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,570
but he looked twenty years older.

374
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,250
My father used to be
the most handsome man in Dongping.

375
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,770
How did he...

376
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,530
end up like this?

377
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,490
Uncle, I...

378
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,490
it just breaks my heart.

379
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,290
Chao,

380
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,900
your dad

381
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,530
lived his whole life

382
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,330
without ever begging

383
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,010
or bowing to anyone.

384
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,380
Yun,

385
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,490
Mr. Chen was asking
when you could arrange a visit.

386
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,940
We should head over to Wanchuan Mining

387
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,420
and meet their person in charge.

388
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,380
It depends on your schedule.

389
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,570
No...

390
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,010
we'll go with whatever you decide.

391
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,220
We're ready anytime.

392
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,490
Okay, I'll make an appointment.

393
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,570
Yun,

394
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,860
my brother's been pretty busy lately.

395
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,770
Is it because his appointment
as prosecutor-general

396
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,420
is about to be finalized?

397
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,420
Exactly.

398
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,380
And he's already busy now.

399
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,090
Once he becomes the prosecutor-general,

400
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,860
I'll probably never see him again.

401
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,490
Wan Hai is innocent!

402
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,980
We're not a criminal organization!

403
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,530
This is a frame-up!

404
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,700
I didn't have any chance to speak up.

405
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,220
And the longer
they put the trial on hold,

406
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,860
they'll have more time to fake evidence

407
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,290
and forge documents.

408
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,460
Shut up!

409
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,180
Who forged documents?

410
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,250
Who faked evidence?

411
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,220
Have you ever wondered

412
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,140
why they were so determined

413
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,250
to label me a member
of a criminal organization?

414
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,980
Who's framing me?

415
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,860
Why are they framing me?

416
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,980
Have you figured that out?

417
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,460
About the second autopsy,

418
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,380
you were the only person
in your Procuratorate that I called.

419
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,620
You called Xie Hongfei,

420
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,250
and then he...

421
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,090
We do work smoothly together.

422
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,460
That kind of coordination comes from

423
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,620
years of working,

424
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,330
supervising, and grinding

425
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,290
through tough cases together.

426
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,010
Uncle, I want to ask you something.

427
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,380
I've always been curious,

428
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,770
how did you and my dad build everything?

429
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,810
Tell me,

430
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,490
back in the day, was he really

431
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,010
that much of a legend

432
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,900
in Dongping?

433
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,420
Chao,

434
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,180
by the time you were born,

435
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,330
our family was already

436
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,810
doing well.

437
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,770
You never really had to suffer.

438
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,940
But your dad and I,

439
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,460
we came up the hard way.

440
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,290
Your grandparents died young,

441
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,490
and your dad raised me himself.

442
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,660
We chased moving trains

443
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,490
just to scrape up bits of coal
they dropped.

444
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,980
Those trains were fast,

445
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,290
how were we supposed to
keep up with that?

446
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,420
Every day felt like
it might be our last.

447
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,090
Bit by bit,

448
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,730
we saved some money.

449
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,010
Then your dad said

450
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,420
we should partner up
with others to work the mines.

451
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,620
A few years into that,

452
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,140
he thought

453
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,010
we needed to go solo.

454
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,860
That's how we built

455
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,900
Wanchuan Mining.

456
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,700
I've never respected anyone in my life,

457
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,220
but I respect your dad.

458
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,900
I'm not bragging,

459
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,980
but back in our prime,

460
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,140
when I

461
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:02,900
walked out

462
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,180
with my briefcase,

463
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,770
I was so proud,

464
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,010
I didn't look anyone in the eye.

465
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,290
Even that hillbilly

466
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,220
Wang Yu,

467
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,770
he'd see me from fifty meters away,

468
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,980
run up, stand at attention,

469
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,620
and grin,

470
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,180
"Hello, Mr. Wan!"

471
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,460
For real?

472
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,380
You don't believe me?

473
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,900
Come on,

474
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,250
would I lie to you?

475
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,980
And now?

476
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,730
Gone.

477
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,730
All gone.

478
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,010
Your father's in prison,

479
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:52,660
we are all on the line now.

480
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,090
Uncle, hearing your story,

481
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,900
I realized something,

482
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,250
the Wan family

483
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,730
has its own spirit.

484
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,620
My dad built Wanchuan Mining
with nothing but coal dust.

485
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,490
I, Wan Chao, will hold it down!

486
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,420
I'm not leaving Dongping!

487
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,220
I've made up my mind.

488
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,330
We're gonna resume mining.

489
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,900
I don't believe that Mining Bureau

490
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,010
can watch me every day.

491
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,530
I'll do it tomorrow.

492
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,460
Come in.

493
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,140
Renjun,

494
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,980
they asked me to see what you're doing.

495
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,570
Just made a call.

496
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,010
Wait a minute.

497
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,810
I wanna ask you something,
sit down.

498
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,980
Close the door.

499
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:58,700
Sit.

500
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,980
What's wrong, Renjun?

501
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,010
So...

502
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,460
that day,

503
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,700
at Qiao Zhenxing's

504
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,530
farewell,

505
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,460
what did Xie Hongfei call you for?

506
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,490
Hello?

507
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,530
The provincial procuratorate
wants a second autopsy.

508
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,250
What autopsy?

509
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,010
Their guidance group

510
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,730
wants another autopsy on Qiao Zhenxing!

511
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,860
I remember it was

512
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,660
about the Wan Hai case.

513
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,250
What else would we be talking about?

514
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,420
Then...

515
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,420
what you told Zheng Yaping is different

516
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,330
from what you told
Xie Hongfei and Hong Liang,

517
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,980
why is that?

518
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,570
Is it?

519
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,140
Yeah.

520
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,570
Renjun,

521
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,460
that period was seriously
chaotic for me.

522
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,570
My phone was blowing up every day.

523
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,380
Zheng Yaping suddenly
asked me that question,

524
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,420
and I just blurted out something.

525
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,860
Didn't think much of it.

526
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,290
Renjun,

527
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,290
Mr. Xie's being investigated

528
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,140
because of that phone call?

529
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,730
How'd you know he's under investigation?

530
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,460
Dongping's not that big.

531
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,940
And we're all in the legal circle.

532
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,250
When did you and Xie
first meet each other?

533
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,220
How long have you known him?

534
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,730
A few years now.

535
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,490
I worked with him a few times

536
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,330
when I was in the county procuratorate.

537
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,980
If you're asking exactly how we met,

538
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,530
it's been too long.

539
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,620
I can't remember.

540
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,420
Renjun,

541
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,570
why are you asking all this?

542
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,530
Now that I'm up for prosecutor-general,

543
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,010
the organization's

544
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,570
going to do a background check.

545
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,940
Got it.

546
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,980
Time for dinner!

547
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,860
Sirs, please come to the table!

548
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,570
I'm heading over.

549
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,290
Mr. Li?

550
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,490
Director Guan,

551
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,090
help me schedule a visit to the prison.

552
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,460
I want to see Wan Hai.

553
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,770
Wan Hai?

554
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,010
When?

555
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,530
The sooner, the better.

556
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,290
Okay, I'll do it right away.

557
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,490
Mr. Li,

558
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,490
what made you suddenly
decide to see Wan Hai?

559
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,140
Is his case...

560
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,730
Don't think about it.

561
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,090
Tomorrow would be best.

562
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,460
Understood, I'll take care of it
immediately.

[Wechat
2 new messages from 1 contact]

564
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,420
Who is it?

565
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,180
Who?

566
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,700
Not bad.

567
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,810
I asked who it was.

568
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,090
Qun.

569
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,420
What's going on?

570
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,460
That's Sun.

571
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,570
Xiangqun.

572
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:36,900
Hong Liang.

573
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,570
What you asked for is ready.

574
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,140
For someone who's about to leave,

575
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,900
you're working way too hard.

576
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,010
It's not like I'm leaving the world.

577
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,730
If life goes on, work goes on.

578
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,090
Besides, with skills like mine,

579
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,140
the leadership just doesn't
want me to go.

580
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,460
Just have to wring one last bit of use
out of me before I leave.

581
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,570
Understandable.

582
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,490
So, did they just hand you
another mission?

583
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,420
Mei was here.

584
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,220
She's miserable.

585
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,010
Hasn't the case

586
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,570
already been classified?

587
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,770
So Sun wants you to

588
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,220
comfort her?

589
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,220
Haizhou or Dongping?

590
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,090
Dongping.

591
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,290
Okay, I won't ask more.

592
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,530
Just go.

593
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,700
You agreed so easily.

594
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,980
What's the catch?

595
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,490
Mei is our friend.

596
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,860
Whether for work or personal reasons,
you should go.

597
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,250
But I need to warn you,

598
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,730
when you get there,

599
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,530
think more, talk less.

600
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,570
Tomorrow morning,

601
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,050
send a message to Yuan.

602
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,570
Get moving.

603
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,660
If you delay the Beijing job any longer,
it'll fall through.

604
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,860
Got it.

605
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,460
Already sprayed.

606
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,050
Then I'll spray myself.

607
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,730
Spray yourself.

608
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,290
Enough.

609
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,620
It's expensive.

610
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,940
I gotta go to work.

611
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,420
Huai'en.

612
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,620
Yes, Mr. Hong.

613
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,620
Gong Xiaozhi, the guy
Qiao Zhenxing used to send money to,

614
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,810
I've investigated him,

615
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,770
22 years old, unmarried.

616
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,460
He's doing food delivery now.

617
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,090
I'll send you his number and address

618
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,660
in a bit.

619
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,330
Good.

620
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,460
By the way,

621
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,090
that Yang Jing,

622
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,330
she's a criminal police
of the Development Zone sub-bureau.

623
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,730
Qiao Zhenxing used to call her
all the time before he died.

624
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,290
Was he still investigating
the Wan Hai case?

625
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,090
Got it.

626
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,140
Before we start,

627
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,290
I want to say a few things.

628
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,620
It's cold recently,

629
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,140
if you're late with delivery,

630
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,090
the food will be cold.

631
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,530
You want to eat cold food? No, right?

632
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,090
Customers will definitely complain

633
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,220
or leave a bad review.

634
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:21,980
All right?

635
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,140
One more thing,

636
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,940
the roads are slippery, stay safe.

637
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,250
If you fall,

638
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,220
the meal will spill.

639
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,530
If it spills,
that's another bad review.

640
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,250
I...

641
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,770
What are you doing?

642
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,380
This whole time,
I've been talking about you, man!

643
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,010
How many deliveries
did you do yesterday?

644
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,180
Got eight complaints!

645
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,620
If you're late,
apologize to the customers!

646
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,420
Don't show up
with that sour face all day!

647
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,140
Did your father die and mother remarry?

648
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,220
Unmannerly bastard!

649
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,700
What?

650
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,620
You wanna mess with me?

651
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,330
All right...

652
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,220
Stop...

653
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,290
Am I wrong?

654
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,420
I'll screw you up!

655
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,770
Calm down...

656
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,250
Get to work!

657
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,380
Get to work!

658
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,530
If you wanna prove yourself,

659
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,940
boy, go run a few more deliveries.

660
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,090
Don't mess with me here.

661
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,090
Who are you!

662
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,420
Are you...

663
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,620
Mr. Gong Xiaozhi?

664
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,140
Speak!

665
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,730
It was me.

666
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,380
Can I ask you something?
Won't take long.

667
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,980
I don't have time right now!

668
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,940
Go away!

669
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,180
What are you looking at?

670
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,770
Can I ask you something

671
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,180
without wasting

672
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,980
your time?

673
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,380
Okay.

674
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,730
Do you know Qiao Zhenxing?

675
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,290
Who?

676
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,140
Qiao Zhenxing.

677
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,860
Don't know him.

678
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,900
Didn't he transfer money to you?

679
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,860
How can you not know him?

680
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,010
Who are you?

681
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,730
I'm his buddy.

682
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,140
Did he transfer money to you?

683
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,050
What's it to you?

684
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,010
I'm not asking you for money.

685
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,490
I wanted to know why he gave you money.

686
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,220
He...

687
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,770
Aren't you his buddy?

688
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,460
- I am.
- Why are you asking me?

689
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,380
Ask him yourself.

690
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,460
I've worked for years.

691
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,810
Trained several apprentices already.

692
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,570
I deserve a raise at least.

693
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,570
Sir,

694
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,620
why isn't the elevator moving?

695
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,530
Didn't you read the property notice?

696
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,460
The whole complex has a power outage.

697
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,330
What about the building over there?

698
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,460
Power outage in the whole complex.

699
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,250
You can't understand Chinese?

700
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,860
I mean...

701
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,770
I got two deliveries here.

702
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,900
One on the 16th floor,
one on the 20th.

703
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,530
No power...

704
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:09,900
What?

705
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,140
Want me to help you deliver?

706
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,330
I'll help you deliver.

707
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:26,940
Okay.

708
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,420
You want to ask me some questions,
right?

709
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,090
One on the 16th floor,
one on the 20th. Pick one.

710
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,810
Take the one on the 20th.

711
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,570
It's the next building.

712
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,700
Go, don't spill it.

713
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:37,810
This...

714
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,460
You're something else.

715
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,170
Great manners.

716
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,740
Nice demeanor.

717
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,300
Run fast.

718
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,010
Sweet attitude.

719
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,170
Look like a boss,

720
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,460
so here's a 5 yuan tip.

721
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,900
About that thing you asked,

722
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:44,820
don't ask me.

723
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,380
Go to this place.

724
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,300
Lady Beauty Nail Salon
on Zhanqian Street.

725
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,570
Look for a woman.

726
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,650
Who?

727
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:52,980
Wang Li.

728
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,690
Zhanqian Street.

729
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,340
What are you looking at?

730
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,050
I'm looking for someone.

731
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,490
Who?

732
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,260
Nail Salon, Wang Li.

733
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,570
You came to the right person.

734
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,380
I'm Wang Li.

735
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,780
- Hello.
- Come on.

736
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,130
You're early.

737
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,090
Want a bun?

738
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:01,900
No...

739
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,260
Alright, let's get started.

740
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:06,820
Hello.

741
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,130
Dead.

742
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,170
Who's dead?

743
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,740
Your skin is so dead.

744
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,490
I'll give you a free exfoliation.

745
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,380
No...

746
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,610
I can give you a discount.

747
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,900
But it depends on

748
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,940
who referred you.

749
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,900
Someone did refer me. Name's Xiaozhi.

750
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,780
I know a lot of Xiaozhi.

751
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,650
Which one?

752
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,740
Gong Xiaozhi.

753
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,570
Get out.

754
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,940
Get out!

755
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,690
I'm here to ask you something.

756
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,260
I don't know.

757
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,460
I haven't asked yet.

758
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,530
Whatever it is, I don't know.

759
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,050
Gong Xiaozhi...

760
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,490
Why aren't you listening to me?

761
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,610
I'd rather you not mention him.

762
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,860
You mentioned him,
then I don't know anything.

763
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,740
Go!

764
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,490
Useless little punk.

765
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,490
Last name Gong?
[*Gong means 'male'.]

766
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,740
Why doesn't he use "Mu"?
[*Mu means 'female'.]

767
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,170
Doesn't even acknowledge
his own parents.

768
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,610
Go and ask if his last name is Sun.

769
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,460
Come back after that.

770
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,090
What are you looking at?

771
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,680
[Haidong Provincial Second Prison]

772
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,090
Thank you.

773
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,010
Wan Hai.

774
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,650
I am Guan Wenbo, director of the office

775
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,380
at Dongping People's Procuratorate.

776
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,090
Nice to meet you.

777
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,820
And this one here

778
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,860
is from Dongping
People's Procuratorate...

779
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,900
Oh, I know him.

780
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,460
In court,

781
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,650
he's the one who read my indictment.

782
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,260
That stack of papers was so thick.

783
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,300
Thank you for your hard work.

784
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,090
Imagine, the prosecutor-general himself

785
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,490
is my prosecutor.

786
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,490
What have I done to

787
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,530
to deserve that?

788
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,260
What brings you two here today?

789
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,340
To check on how I'm doing?

790
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,820
Or is this a follow-up visit?

791
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,210
No wonder he made it to
prosecutor-general,

792
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,210
always so dedicated.

793
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,900
Wan Hai,

794
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,740
watch your tone.

795
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,940
Yes.

796
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,780
Reporting to you, sir.

797
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,900
I've been actively
cooperating, learning,

798
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,860
bettering myself in here.

799
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:23,090
Any update on reducing my sentence?

800
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,980
The Wan Hai case,

801
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,690
personally, I think,

802
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,260
wasn't handled thoroughly enough.

803
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,490
How much more thorough do you want?

804
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,050
I already got ten years and ten months.

805
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,530
Any more "thorough"
and it'd be a life sentence.

806
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,260
On the first day of your trial,
Zhang Wenjing shouted,

807
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,610
"Wan Hai is innocent!

808
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,980
We're not a criminal organization!

809
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,780
This is a frame-up!"

810
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,860
Does that mean that
the public security organs in Dongping

811
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,980
is shielding organized crime?

812
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,340
Two years.

813
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,130
You didn't plead guilty for two years.

814
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,740
But after Qiao Zhenxing was removed,

815
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,420
you suddenly confessed.

816
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,820
Why?

817
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,740
What do you think of
the two prosecutors,

818
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,490
Xie Hongfei and Qiao Zhenxing?

819
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,050
With all due respect,

820
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,380
if I remember correctly,

821
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,050
aren't they both part of your team?

822
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,340
You should know better than me

823
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,940
what kind of people they are.

824
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,010
Do you really need to ask me?

825
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,380
Qiao Zhenxing,

826
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,530
what kind of person he is,

827
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,340
I won't pass judgment.

828
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,340
But I think this guy is pretty dumb.

829
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,900
If he really was a protector
of organized crime,

830
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,300
and ended up dying in the process,

831
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,490
that's kind of irony.

832
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,780
Zhang Wenjing.

833
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,380
Honestly,

834
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,530
it was Prosecutor Qiao Zhenxing
and Zhang Wenjing

835
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,780
who fought for two years
to get me justice.

836
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,090
In the beginning, I did believe in

837
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,090
fairness and justice.

838
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,260
That's why I held out for two years.

839
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,090
But then,

840
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,740
Qiao Zhenxing was replaced

841
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,130
by the other one you just mentioned,

842
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,860
Prosecutor Xie Hongfei.

843
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,530
He said my case was
dragging on too long.

844
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,210
Asked me if I could change a lawyer.

845
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,300
I said my lawyer was very good.

846
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,210
Why should I change?

847
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,650
He ignored me.

848
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,820
Unexpectedly, a few days later,

849
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,050
Zhang Wenjing,

850
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,490
my lawyer,

851
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,690
suddenly became "a member
of criminal organization"!

852
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,900
Next thing I know,

853
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,570
Qiao Zhenxing was dead!

854
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,570
Shocking!

855
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,490
Mr. Li.

856
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,170
I've gotta admit it.

857
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,170
Back to Xie Hongfei,

858
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,380
he gave me the whole lecture.

859
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,260
Talked to me about the law,
about fairness, about justice.

860
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,900
I was like, "what's this really about?"

861
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,260
Then, it hit me,

862
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,900
it's a deal.

863
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,050
As long as I plead guilty,

864
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,090
he can help me get a lighter sentence.

865
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,530
Mutual benefit.

866
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,460
That's your so-called

867
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,740
"judicial fairness and justice".

868
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,050
Ma'am,

869
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,820
I have a question.

870
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,740
I'm helping someone
collect a water sample.

871
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,460
The previous sample for comparison

872
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,530
was taken in winter,

873
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,130
when the river was frozen over.

874
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,170
Now it's spring, the ice is melted.

875
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,130
Would the comparison

876
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,780
still be valid?

877
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,490
If it's running water,

878
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,780
once the ice melts,

879
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,610
the ecosystem on
both sides of the river changes.

880
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,460
Microorganisms and
bacterial populations shift,

881
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,570
type, amount, everything.

882
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:38,650
So,

883
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,300
not worth much scientifically.

884
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,050
OK.

885
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,690
Got it.

886
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,260
Can we still use this?

887
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:12,650
Are you okay?

888
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,090
Actually, there's something.

889
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,010
Is there a police officer
named Yang Jing

890
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,340
at the Development Zone

891
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:28,780
sub-bureau?

892
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,780
Yang Jing?

893
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:36,860
Hong Liang,

894
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:38,570
right?

895
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,340
Yes.

896
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,610
You came from Haizhou?

897
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,300
Yes.

898
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,650
You're with the Guidance Group?

899
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,170
Yes.

900
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,340
It's been disbanded.

901
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,210
How do you know

902
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,490
I spoke with Qiao Zhenxing on the phone?

903
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,940
