[Dongping No. 2 Detention Center]

5
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,820
Do you know

6
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,290
what benefits Zhang Wenjing gave her?

7
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,290
It had to be something with real value.

8
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,940
Then what did you give to Zhang Wenjing?

9
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,850
Money.

10
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,660
How much?

11
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,660
How many times? Which times?

12
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,730
How much each time?

13
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,570
I…

14
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,610
Quite a lot, anyway.

15
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,220
The money came fast

16
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,170
and went fast.

17
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,170
I'm just

18
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,500
a big spender.

19
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:09,850
Wan Hai,

20
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,980
we investigated Zhang Wenjing's
bank accounts.

21
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,730
There were

22
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,780
no large incoming payments.

23
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,570
Officers,

24
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,260
what I mean

25
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,690
is

26
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,290
I gave her cash.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,980
Can you get

28
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,780
what I'm saying?

29
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,170
Also,

30
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,220
officers,

31
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,220
may I ask you for a small favor?

32
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,410
Can you maybe speed things up a bit?

33
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,780
I've confessed everything

34
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,780
in the hope that I can start
serving my sentence earlier

35
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,850
and get out sooner.

36
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,130
The lamp

37
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,540
is giving me a headache.

38
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,220
- I'm…
- Alright. Sit down.

39
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,340
Let's call it a day.

40
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,570
Okay.

41
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,010
I…

42
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,130
came with the provincial Guidance Group

43
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,290
this time.

44
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,410
There's a small case

45
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,490
over here in Dongping.

46
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,340
Zhang Wenjing?

47
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,930
The one who shouted injustice in court?

48
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,660
Do you know

49
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,850
who the lead prosecutor was?

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,340
Your cousin.

51
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,900
He was replaced.

52
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,850
When?

53
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,020
Half a year ago.

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,730
Why?

55
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,490
I have no idea.

56
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,900
But think about it.

57
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,900
A man was found frozen on a waterfall,

58
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,050
and she shouted injustice in court
on the same day.

59
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,660
Don't you think it's weird?

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,460
Mr. Xu.

61
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,340
Where are you?

62
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,660
At my cousin-in-law's

63
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,460
to keep her company.

64
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,290
Is Hong Liang there too?

65
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,490
I've told you hundreds of times

66
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,020
not to do things unrelated to your post.

67
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,460
Are you ignoring me on purpose,

68
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,410
or just too stupid to understand?

69
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,700
He just got here.

70
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,810
Save your excuses.

71
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,810
You're really a handful.

72
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,100
Mr. Xu, he and my cousin
were classmates.

73
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,610
He came over to…

74
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,460
Cut the crap.

75
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,020
Go back to your work now.

76
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,020
Who is it?

77
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,220
Our chief.

78
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,140
How did he know I was here?

79
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,700
Weird, right?

80
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,540
You just got here,

81
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,140
and somehow he already knew.

82
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,100
Liang,

83
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,170
you need to come with me
to Yongqing River.

84
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,050
I came to your cousin-in-law's house,

85
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,140
and your chief already knew.

86
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,700
If I go to some river with you,

87
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,340
I…

88
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,460
That's as scary as hell.

89
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:48,930
Wait, Liang.

90
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,370
I'm not scared of trouble,

91
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,250
but

92
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,810
you work for the government,

93
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,370
and so do I.

94
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,850
Let's not cause trouble for each other.

95
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,660
Ms. Zheng,

96
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,170
Wan Hai

97
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,460
has a pretty good attitude

98
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,540
about admitting guilt.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,700
But he just can't keep his mouth shut.

100
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,290
Zhang Wenjing is different.

101
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,580
- She's still taking her chances.
- Mr. Li.

102
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,370
And trying to make a fuss.

103
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,370
Mr. Xu called you several times.

104
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,340
A typical legal hustler.

105
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,850
Hang on. I need to take this call.

106
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,020
Hello, Mr. Xu.

107
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,170
What's so urgent?

108
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,290
Mr. Li.

109
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,340
Do you have time now?

110
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,540
I'm with the Guidance Group.

111
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,250
Just tell me what's up.

112
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,170
Okay, I'll keep it short.

113
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,730
If you need a supplementary investigation

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,490
for Zhang Wenjing's case,

115
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,580
let me know early.

116
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,220
That way I'll have more time,

117
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,900
and we can avoid
any last-minute trouble.

118
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,220
Okay.

119
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,810
We stay in touch then.

120
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,540
Anything else?

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,340
One more thing.

122
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,220
Your former classmate,

123
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,250
Hong Liang from the Guidance Group.

124
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,220
I heard

125
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,370
he went to Qiao Zhenxing's home?

126
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,100
Hong Liang?

127
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,900
He went to Qiao Zhenxing's home?

128
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,140
He's from the Eleventh Division
of the Provincial People's Procuratorate.

129
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,930
The case hasn't been closed yet.

130
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,410
It's a bit inappropriate.

131
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,100
Alright, I'll handle it.

132
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,850
I need to make another call.

133
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,780
Just a moment.

134
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,850
Should we give you some space?

135
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,460
No.

136
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,660
Hong Liang,

137
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,050
where are you?

138
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,100
Outside.

139
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,250
Outside where?

140
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,140
Why didn't you tell me
you went to Qiao's home?

141
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,580
I'm here to express my condolences.

142
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,660
Condolences?

143
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,250
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

144
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,100
I can make it up.

145
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,490
When I'm calling you already?

146
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,290
Do you think it's just about condolences?

147
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,930
Others don't see it that way!

148
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,730
Remember.

149
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,020
You're a member of the Guidance Group

150
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,540
and the Eleventh Division.

151
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,170
Qiao's case hasn't been closed yet,

152
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,850
and you are in his home already.

153
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,340
How will others see this?

154
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,810
It's not…

155
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,540
Also, let me tell you.

156
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,700
You've disrupted our work.

157
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,290
How could I…?

158
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,700
Complaint calls are coming even to me!

159
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,340
Get it done quickly.

160
00:07:59,600 --> 00:07:59,930
Um…

161
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,410
Hong Liang…

162
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,050
Don't take it the wrong way, Mr. Li.

163
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,340
Hong Liang went as a private individual.

164
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,660
It doesn't break any rules,

165
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,140
nor does he represent the Guidance Group.

166
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,250
So how should we

167
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,370
go forward?

168
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,980
Continue reviewing the files.

169
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,340
Let's have a meal first.

170
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,050
The cars are ready,

171
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,730
waiting outside.

172
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,660
Is it Li Renjun?

173
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,900
What the hell!

174
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,580
You three were best friends.

175
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,290
On the day of my cousin's autopsy,

176
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,890
Li Renjun, as a key leader,

177
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,730
had to be present.

178
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,700
He met my cousin-in-law before.
He knew her.

179
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,650
He just did this,

180
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,420
and said, "My condolences."

181
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,610
Is this how a friend should've behaved?

182
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,370
Liang,

183
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,340
don't look at me like that.

184
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,010
Look at his family.

185
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:50,980
Look!

186
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,530
No one's helping.

187
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,420
Can you do something?

188
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,300
Just go to Yongqing River with me.

189
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,100
I just made it clear.

190
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,370
We both work for the government.

191
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,700
Enough.

192
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,220
Don't make this harder for me.

193
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,250
Sorry to trouble you.

194
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:06,770
Feng!

195
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,220
Hong.

196
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,340
Tell me.

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,890
If I had made

198
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,010
one more call to my dad that day,

199
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,530
do you think he would've picked it up?

200
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,850
Which day?

201
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,700
The day it happened.

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,490
What were you going to say to him?

203
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,580
Mom and I were at the mall
to buy him a birthday gift.

204
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,730
We saw a nice jacket

205
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,940
and wanted to ask his opinion.

206
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,340
Video call your dad

207
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,180
and ask him which one he likes.

208
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,220
It will ruin the surprise.

209
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,250
Then make a phone call

210
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,340
and ask him.

211
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,250
Call him.

212
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,420
How about this one?

213
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,490
Is it good?

214
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,130
Is it okay?

215
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,610
Yeah.

216
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,300
Let me check the price.

217
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,490
I called him four times,

218
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,530
and he hung up all of them.

219
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:42,980
Did you buy it?

220
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,820
Yeah.

221
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,370
Was it good?

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,300
I think so.

223
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,250
I even wrote him a card.

224
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,010
What did it say?

225
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,250
Dear Dad,

226

Happy birthday.

230
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,420
Will he receive it?

231
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,700
He will.

232
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,890

what exactly it is about?

Did the procuratorate just call you?

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,700
Just now. How did you know?

It must be about Wan Hai's case.

You know what to say, right?

267
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,180

268

Just a heads-up.

The people questioning you

270
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,300
won't be from the local procuratorate.

Since you're already here,

278
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,370
could I bring something up?

What is it?

280

You were completely right.

talk to the administration

delay it a bit?

Delay it? How?

292
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,220
Well.

293
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,580

294

299

is decided,

can I delay paying the rent?

Now I let you delay.

I'll give you a free year.

Delay what?

310
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,250
Delay what?

311
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,180
Still want to delay?

and I couldn't express my condolences?

384
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,140
You forgot about us

385
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,700
this morning.

386
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,460
We were not allowed

387
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,900
to join the interrogation.

388
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,700
We could only stay at the hotel!

389
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,980
How was I supposed to gather information?

390
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,460
You didn't see the way Mr. Li looked

391
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,090
when he made the call today.

392
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,180
Why should I care?

393
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,140
He didn't say it outright,
but that was a straight-up snitch move.

394
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,620
Hong Liang, your actions directly

395
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,900
affect the relationship between
provincial and municipal procuratorates.

396
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,620
You're affecting my work!

397
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,380
I'm affecting the work of the director
of the First Division!

398
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,140
Why didn't you remind me
of such a big thing?

399
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,900
Let's have a talk.

400
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,620
I think

401
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,140
you've been totally off recently.

402
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,770
What's wrong with you?

403
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,380
Are you trying

404
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,980
to pick a fight or something?

405
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,760
[3rd March
Day 5 Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

406
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,240
[3rd March
Day 6 Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

407
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,720
[Dongping People's Procuratorate]

408
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,180
Wang Yu.

409
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,940
Introduce yourself.

410
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,050
We're the Guidance Group sent
by the provincial procuratorate,

411
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,860
specifically here for
the Zhang Wenjing case.

412
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,420
Wang Yu,

413
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,090
make sure

414
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,570
you tell the Guidance Group

415
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,570
everything you know.

416
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,140
I will.

417
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,180
Especially to such a beautiful prosecutor.

418
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,700
Let's officially begin the questioning.

419
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,220
You're the general manager

420
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,810
of Wanchuan Freight Hub,

421
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,660
the biggest freight hub in Dongping,

422
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,810
and the first victim

423
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,700
to report Wan Hai's involvement
in organized crime.

424
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,380
Correct?

425
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,730
I was forced to do that.

426
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,330
Wan Hai…

427
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,530
Is the camera rolling?

428
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,730
Wan Hai is a mob boss.

429
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,730
He bullies others, monopolizes the market,

430
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,290
and does all kinds of evil.

431
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,420
Let's talk about Zhang Wenjing.

432
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,140
According to the file,

433
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,660
you said Zhang Wenjing instructed Wan Hai

434
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,570
to take over your freight hub.

435
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,050
Can you elaborate?

436
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,860
It was around nine years ago,

437
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,980
just after Chinese New Year.

438
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,810
Wan Hong sent Chen Youcai to find me,

439
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,420
saying Wan Hai wanted to buy the hub.

440
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,460
I didn't want to sell it,
so I ignored him.

441
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,980
Then in April,

442
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,620
I remember it was springtime.

443
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,140
I brought a few clients

444
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,330
to Wanjia Denghuo KTV.

445
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,900
Wan Hai insisted
I go to his office to talk.

446
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,220
Why should I?

447
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,490
I was just singing there,

448
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,770
and a few guys dragged me away.

449
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:01,980
Mr. Wang,

450
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,940
our boss just wanted to meet with you.

451
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,220
Why so unfriendly?

452
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,290
I won't sell it,

453
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,700
so we don't need to meet.

454
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,620
Are you sure?

455
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,380
Yes.

456
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,530
So what?

457
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,050
I'm…

458
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,490
What are you doing?

459
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,860
I was drinking then,

460
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,420
so I spoke a bit harshly.

461
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,180
I said I wasn't selling it,

462
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,900
and guess what?

463
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,420
Zhang Wenjing asked her people

464
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,420
to string me up!

465
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,770
Like this.

466
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,900
I was there for a week.

467
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,090
A whole week

468
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,180
without food or water.

469
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,660
Wang Yu.

470
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:28,980
It was…

471
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,570
Calm down and take a seat.

472
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,900
I just wanted you to understand

473
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,810
my situation back then.

474
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,250
Wang Yu.

475
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,900
During those days of illegal detention,

476
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,050
was Wan Hai always the one talking to you?

477
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,570
He showed up a few times.

478
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,090
But it was mainly Zhang Wenjing.

479
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,090
Back then, the freight hub

480
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,900
was worth at least 40 to 50 million,

481
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,180
and she wanted it for 25 million.

482
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,050
She said if I refused,

483
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,570
they'd just keep me strung up

484
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,050
until I died.

485
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,620
Where did you

486
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,770
sign the contract?

487
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,180
In the factory where they strung me up.

488
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,250
Who else was present?

489
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,050
How many people in total?

490
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,490
Fingerprint.

491
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,530
Wan Hai,

492
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,570
Zhang Wenjing,

493
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,290
and those who strung me up.

494
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,180
So you're saying

495
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,290
Zhang Wenjing did lead Wan Hai

496
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,570
to take over your hub?

497
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,530
Lead?

498
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,620
That's the perfect word!

499
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,810
She led the whole thing.

500
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,050
She called the shots.

501
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,900
Every idea Wan Hai had was from her.

502
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,490
Why didn't you report Zhang Wenjing?

503
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,140
Why did you report Wan Hai first?

504
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,140
Why only come forward

505
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,770
with additional testimony
about Zhang Wenjing's

506
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,180
involvement in organized crime

507
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,980
after she became Wan Hai's lawyer?

508
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,700
Back then, I just wanted to take down Wan…

509
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,050
I mean, Wan Hai was involved
in organized crime,

510
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,620
right?

511
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,770
Later, Zhang Wenjing

512
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,620
was arrested by the police,

513
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,700
so I added more testimony.

514
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,700
Wang Yu,

515
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,330
according to the case file,

516
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,010
you reported Zhang Wenjing

517
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,420
before the police placed it on file.

518
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,330
Wang Yu,

519
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,420
have some water.

520
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,530
Think carefully.

521
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,330
Did you report Zhang Wenjing first,

522
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,050
or did the police file the cast first?

523
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,050
The water is pretty hot.

524
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,770
This case has been going on for so long.

525
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,050
Who can remember

526
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,940
the exact order of everything?

527
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,380
Right?

528
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,180
Anyway,

529
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,420
neither Wan Hai nor Zhang Wenjing
is any good.

530
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,140
So I reported them.

531
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,250
I hope you can handle this quickly.

532
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,010
Do it however you see fit.

533
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,140
Zhang Wenjing told us

534
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,380
you signed the contract

535
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,660
of buying the freight hub voluntarily,

536
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,090
and she didn't force you.

537
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,530
She also said you forged the contract.

538
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,860
That's pure slander!

539
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,290
What am I, crazy?

540
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,290
I forged a contract

541
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,620
and sold my asset?

542
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,140
I'm not crazy!

543
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,530
Watch your mouth.

544
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,050
Mind your language.

545
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,090
I was too angry.

546
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,330
Officers, you have to look into this

547
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,620
thoroughly.

548
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,700
They are a cancer in Dongping.

549
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,860
Go ask around on the street.

550
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,900
Even a kid

551
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,900
will tell you they're a criminal gang.

552
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,730
Zhang Wenjing was their strategist.

553
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,420
The camera is rolling.

554
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,980
I wouldn't lie.

555
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,660
Wan Hai,

556
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,490
during the week you detained Wang Yu,

557
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,460
did Zhang Wenjing meet with him?

558
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:33,730
No.

559
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,900
Crooked lawyer!

560
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,250
Took the money and did nothing!

561
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,090
Scamming both sides!

562
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,660
Don't be impulsive!

563
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,770
Calm down!

564
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,420
It's okay.

565
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,900
Don't fight!

566
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,490
Crooked lawyer!

567
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,770
Took the money and did nothing!

568
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,860
The lawyer is hitting me!

569
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,290
I'll call the police!

570
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,940
Hello! I'm calling to report a crime.

571
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,860
- You got the wrong person!
- Move!

572
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,770
Why are you taking us?

573
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,290
Move!

574
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,050
You should arrest them!

575
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,460
This way.

576
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:03,770
This way.

577
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,250
We are the victims.

578
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,730
They scammed all our hard-earned money!

579
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,490
Officers! We've been wronged!

580
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,290
They took our money and did nothing!

581
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,900
Arrest them!

582
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,660
Hurry! Here!

583
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,860
The police are here.

584
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,570
Get in the car.

585
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:36,900
Chen Youcai,

586
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,090
what's your relationship
with the Wan family?

587
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,290
I grew up with Wan Hong.

588
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,140
We were childhood friends.

589
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,420
Did Wan Hong know about Wan Hai's
organized crime activities?

590
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,420
Was he involved?

591
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,460
He didn't know and wasn't involved.

592
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,330
I know him very well.

593
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,980
Your statement says
Wan Hong contacted you.

594
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,050
Yes, but he didn't come up

595
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,180
with the idea of forcing Wang Yu.

596
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:02,860
And he

597
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,730
kept trying to stop Wan Hai.

598
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,180
No one expected

599
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,810
someone as smart as Wan Hai

600
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,250
to fall

601
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,730
under Zhang Wenjing's spell like that.

602
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,250
Later, no matter what Wan Hong
said to Wan Hai,

603
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,730
Wan Hai wouldn't listen.

604
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,330
I hope you think clearly.

605
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,220
We've looked into your background.

606
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,290
You've been dealing

607
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,980
with the Wan family for over a decade.

608
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,620
You bought ore from them

609
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,730
and resold it down south.

610
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,860
Sounds like a long-standing relationship.

611
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,290
There must be some feelings.

612
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,250
Alright then.

613
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,330
In your view,

614
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,090
when did Wan Hai

615
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,460
start getting involved in organized crime?

616
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,050
And when

617
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,530
did Zhang Wenjing

618
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,250
get involved?

619
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,700
I really don't know.

620
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,900
I only know

621
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,900
what regular folks in Dongping know.

622
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,420
The Wan family

623
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,810
has been

624
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,660
on a fierce rise in recent years.

625
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,330
Industries

626
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,900
like transportation

627
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,050
and entertainment,

628
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,810
like KTVs,

629
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,660
are basically

630
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,380
monopolized by them.

631
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,770
They've got a stake
in a lot of industries.

632
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,530
At my level,

633
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,220
I never had a look

634
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,730
inside how they really operated.

635
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,940
Weren't you and Wan Hong
childhood friends?

636
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,620
We were.

637
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,460
But we're not as close

638
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,420
as you may think.

639
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:46,290
Honestly, I'm the one

640
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,900
who kept saying

641
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,900
that we grew up together,

642
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,180
Wan Hong never mentioned it.

643
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,620
When people asked him,

644
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,980
he didn't respond.

645
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,940
In fact, we were only

646
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,660
business partners.

647
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,180
Chen Youcai,

648
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,810
we spoke with people around you.

649
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,420
Outside,

650
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,860
you're known as a trustworthy friend.

651
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,050
At home, you're a good husband,

652
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,220
a good father,

653
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,860
and a good son of your parents.

654
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,180
So tell me.

655
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,380
Is the man sitting in front of me

656
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,980
as trustworthy as before?

657
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,700
Let me ask you again.

658
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,490
Is Zhang Wenjing

659
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,460
involved in organized crime?

660
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,250
Give me your honest answer.

661
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,420
Answer me.

662
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,290
Can I have some water?

663
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,810
Can Chen Youcai's testimony be used
to make a conclusive judgment?

664
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,220
Did you examine it carefully?

665
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,490
Do I really need to explain that a witness

666
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,660
with direct interests in a case
may not be credible?

667
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,180
Zhang Wenjing

668
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,010
is definitely part of the gang.

669
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,810
You'll be legally responsible

670
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,660
for every word you say.

671
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,250
Chen Youcai,

672
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,940
are all your statements
about Zhang Wenjing

673
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,420
accurate and truthful?

674
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,660
Accurate.

675
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,420
Truthful.

676
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,860
What do you want?

677
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,660
You better leave right now,

678
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,490
or I'll call the police!

679
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,330
Mr. Fu, our great lawyer.

680
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,530
Let's talk.

681
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,380
Do you know

682
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,180
why Zhang Wenjing is labeled a gangster?

683
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,900
Because you want her to be.

684
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,250
You're right.

685
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,700
Do you believe

686
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,050
you can be a gangster, too?

687
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,700
Who's the real gangster here?

688
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,250
You are so lawless!

689
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,530
Twisting the truth, calling black white!

690
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,770
Zhang Wenjing is innocent!

691
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,810
I'll defend her!

692
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,770
Sit down.

693
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,860
It's study time now.

694
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,770
Zhang Wenjing,

695
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,700
your daughter is adorable.

696
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:19,980
What did you say?

697
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,570
Your daughter is adorable.

698
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,810
Two braids bounce

699
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,250
when she runs. So adorable.

700
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,290
What are you going to do?

701
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,250
The kindergarten ends at 4:00 PM,

702
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,530
and her grandma picks her up.

703
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,570
She goes to dance class on weekends.

704
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,180
You've raised her well.

705
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,290
Who sent you here?

706
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,220
Tell me who sent you here.

707
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,730
If you lay a finger on my daughter,

708
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,730
I'll make you pay!

709
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,810
If you don't talk nonsense,

710
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,490
I won't do anything.

711
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,090
Gangsters!

712
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,180
You're all gangsters!

713
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,050
If anything happens to my daughter,

714
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,220
I'll kill you!

715
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,140
Just plead guilty,

716
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,140
and I'll make sure
your family stays safe.

717
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,420
Or you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

718
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,420
Ma'am! They are fighting!

719
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:13,940
Stop it!

720
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:14,730
The wardens are coming!

721
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,940
Why did you hit me?

722
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,570
Stop it.

723
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,860
What will you do?

724
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,180
I'm a lawyer.

725
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,490
Defending her is my…

726
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,140
Will you defend her?

727
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,010
I'm a lawyer…

728
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,050
- Why did you hit me?
- The warden is here!

729
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,010
- Why did you hit me?
- Stop it!

730
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,050
Stop!

731
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,730
- Why the fight?
- She's planning to kidnap my daughter!

732
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,010
- Stop!
- I didn't do anything!

733
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,050
She hit me!

734
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:37,490
Behave yourself.

735
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,980
Try passing that message out
and see what happens!

736
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,620
Leave!

737
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:49,730
Your wife

738
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,530
is a physician at Haidong No. 2 Hospital.

739
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,620
Your daughter is

740
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,900
in her first year at No. 31 Middle School.

741
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,730
Go somewhere else.

742
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,980
You can still practice law

743
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,900
and defend people there.

744
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,220
Don't let me see you in Dongping again.

745
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,940
Be careful, Liang. It's slippery.

746
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,010
Careful!

747
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,770
Careful!

748
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,180
Careful!

749
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,050
Right in front.

750
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,330
Right here.

751
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,380
Right here, Liang.

752
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,220
My cousin was lying face-down

753
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,050
under the waterfall.

754
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,010
The icicle

755
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,050
was right over his face.

756
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,570
His eyes were still open.

757
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:53,860
That day,

758
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,730
a few college students reported it.

759
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,380
When I got here,

760
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,810
the criminal police had already

761
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,420
pulled him out.

762
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,220
The on-site forensic examination
found no external injuries.

763
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,490
Then he was brought
to the bureau for autopsy.

764
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,690
Pink, frothy mucus
was found in the mouth and nose,

765
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,690
signs of wet drowning.

766
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,210
His lungs

767
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,650
and bone marrow

768
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,980
had diatoms, too.

769
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,380
All classic drowning signs.

770
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,460
They suspect

771
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,490
he drowned upstream

772
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,420
and was washed here by the currents.

773
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,340
It was cold those couple of days,

774
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,610
so he got frozen here.

775
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,690
Liang,

776
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,420
are you alright?

777
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,860
How did he get down here?

778
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,650
There's a reservoir,

779
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,900
two kilometers upstream.

780
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,130
I'll take you to check it out.

781
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,050
Mr. Xie.

782
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,820
I'm Shao Xiaoyan, a waitress…

783
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,380
Thanks for your cooperation.

784
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:17,940
At Wanjia Denghuo KTV.

785
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,690
Of course.

786
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,980
Three years ago, on March 24,

787
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,530
I went with Wu Xiaotian to toast Mr. Wan.

788
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,130
Wu told Wan…

789
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,260
Answer whatever they ask.

790
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,170
That Liu Gui came again.

791
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,260
Come in, please.

792
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,490
Liu owed Wan a lot of gambling debt.

793
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,210
Come on. Take a seat.

794
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,860
Wan told Wu to teach Liu a lesson.

795
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,300
I heard Wan told Wu

796
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,490
to beat him to death.

797
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,210
As a result,

798
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,650
Wu seriously injured Liu.

799
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,210
I was just saying.

800
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,260
But Wu Xiaotian

801
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,130
wanted to show off.

802
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,380
So Liu Gui turned into a vegetable.

803
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,680
[Shao Xiaoyan
Waitress at Wanjia Denghuo KTV]

804
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,260
You're Wan Hai's lapdog!

805
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,090
You don't deserve to talk to me!

806
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,570
Later,

807
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:01,650
Zhang…

808
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,260
Zhang Wenjing came to me.

809
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,650
Let me introduce myself.

810
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,740
I am Mr. Wan's lawyer.

811
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,940
Time's limited, so long story short.

812
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,740
Soon,

813
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,980
the police will question you.

814
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,210
Make it clear

815
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,980
that Liu Gui owed Wu Xiaotian money,

816
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,300
and that's why they fought.

817
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,690
It had nothing to do

818
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,260
with Wanjia Denghuo

819
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,380
or

820
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,010
Mr. Wan Hai.

821
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,780
Just a personal dispute between them.

822
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,010
If

823
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,090
you fail to say

824
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,300
what I told you to say,

825
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,570
you'll get fired

826
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,940
and driven out of Dongping.

827
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,460
Were there any other threats

828
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,610
beyond words?

829
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,210
No.

830
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,130
Just verbal.

831
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,860
What's the relationship
between Wan Hai and Wu Xiaotian?

832
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,490
Why did he go toast him?

833
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,570
Wu is the head of security.

834
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,490
Wan Hai is his boss.

835
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,380
Of course he went to toast him.

836
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,570
What did Wu say when toasting?

837
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,050
The music was so loud
that I didn't hear it.

838
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,940
The music was loud?

839
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,650
Then how did you hear

840
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,980
Wan Hai ask Wu Xiaotian

841
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,460
to teach Liu Gui a lesson?

842
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,740
Well…

843
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,610
That's because…

844
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:30,650
I…

845
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,380
Answer the question.

846
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,860
Shao Xiaoyan,

847
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,940
are you under pressure?

848
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,010
No.

849
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,260
I need to think.

850
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,420
You being here

851
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,740
means we've got some intel.

852
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,570
If you keep quiet,

853
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,210
and we later show you

854
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,570
Zhang Wenjing's evidence

855
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,900
that you framed her,

856
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,650
the consequences will be very different.

857
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,340
Lies

858
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,530
can't cover up the truth.

859
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,130
I hope you
take this opportunity seriously.

860
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,090
We are members of the Guidance Group

861
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,130
overseeing Zhang Wenjing's case.

862
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,210
If you've been wronged

863
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,210
or in any trouble,

864
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,420
you can tell us directly.

865
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,740
Is the testimony you gave

866
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,010
about Zhang Wenjing true?

867
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,690
I don't know!

868
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,690
I don't remember!

869
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,650
I don't know!

870
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,300
What are you doing?

871
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,090
What's wrong?

872
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,900
What are you doing?

873
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,210
- What are you doing?
- Mr. Qian?

874
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,130
I didn't touch her!

875
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,780
You hit her?

876
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,380
No!

877
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,610
That's a human rights violation!

878
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,460
I didn't do anything.

879
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,460
The camera recorded everything!

880
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,340
Cut it out!

881
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,170
- Calm down!
- They were…

882
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,010
Mr. Xie,

883
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,010
let's stop here for today.

884
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:07,650
At that time,

885
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,420
the car was parked right here.

886
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,380
The front was facing the ice.

887
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,420
The headlights were still on.

888
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,940
By the time they arrived,

889
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,340
the battery was dead.

890
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,860
Was the car locked?

891
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,860
No, it was open.

892
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,780
The car was intact,

893
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,010
with no signs of struggle inside.

894
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,690
The steering wheel and the doors

895
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,860
only had my cousin's fingerprints.

896
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,210
Were there

897
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,380
other things belonging to Qiao inside?

898
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:43,940
Yes.

899
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,820
His briefcase, glasses, ID,

900
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,260
and some other items.

901
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,940
And an empty bottle of baijiu,

902
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,260
with only my cousin's fingerprints on it.

903
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,090
It's your wedding day!

904
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,260
You can't just drink juice!

905
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,260
- I'm allergic to alcohol.
- You have to drink baijiu!

906
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,210
I really can't drink.

907
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,090
You know that.

908
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,820
He's allergic to alcohol.
How about I drink instead?

909
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,690
No, honey!

910
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,490
It's fine. I'll drink.

911
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,170
Woohoo!

912
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,530
There was a pickaxe

913
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,130
right next to the ice hole.

914
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,090
The officers

915
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,780
of the criminal police unit

916
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,340
traced the current upstream

917
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,420
and found the ice hole.

918
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,010
The pickaxe was right here.

919
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,460
Again, only my cousin's fingerprints.

920
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,340
It's weird though.

921
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,940
Everything was there,

922
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,210
except for the phone.

923
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,340
It was missing.

924
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,050
Hong,

925
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,490
are you free now?

926
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,420
Hello.

927
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,780
Hong!

928
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,340
Hong!

929
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,460
Hello!

930
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,050
Feng.

931
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,780
Liang.

932
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,300
Where's the nearest railway around here?

933
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,860
No railways nearby.

934
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,940
The nearest one's probably
around Zhoujiadian.

935
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,940
It'll take about an hour to get there.

936
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:31,690
Mr. Xu.

937
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:32,820
Mr. Li.

938
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,010
Here's the situation.

939
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,740
Qiao Zhenxing's case was closed.

940
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,380
We just wrapped up

941
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,210
the case meeting.

942
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,090
Based on all the info collected,

943
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,300
the conclusion is suicide.

944
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,380
No signs of homicide.

945
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,210
Wait, what was his motive?

946
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,570
Why would he take his own life?

947
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,690
You need to investigate that.

948
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,260
We did.

949
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,300
Our initial guess is

950
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,260
he might have

951
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,940
experienced difficulties

952
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,340
in his personal life

953
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,340
or had troubles at work.

954
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,050
Honestly, we can't be sure.

955
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,170
Anyway,

956
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,650
once the formal case report is done,
I'll let you know.

957
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,340
Just give you a heads-up

958
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,570
so you can be mentally prepared.

959
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:11,860
Alright.

960
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:13,860
Got it.

961
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,010
Mr. Li.

962
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,530
News!

963
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,980
Big news!

964
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,340
The police just ruled

965
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,740
Qiao's death was suicide.

966
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,050
They said it was depression,

967
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,300
that he snapped or something.

968
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,610
Xu Yanwu just called…

969
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,860
How did you know?

970
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:38,940
Mr. Li,

971
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,740
Dongping is a small city.

972
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,300
News travels fast.

973
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,090
Everyone's talking about it.

974
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,260
Mr. Li,

975
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,090
I've been thinking…

976
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,170
We all know Qiao was a bit stubborn,

977
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,610
didn't talk much,

978
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,940
and kept to himself.

979
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,010
But I don't think he was depressed.

980
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,210
Let's say the depression theory holds.

981
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,980
I quickly reviewed the timeline

982
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,740
just now

983
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:02,860
and realized

984
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,420
everything changed after he was removed

985
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,340
from the Wan Hai case.

986
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,210
We shared an office.

987
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,650
We just did a normal handover.

988
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,610
But after that,

989
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,210
he started acting totally out of it.

990
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,050
I asked him about the case,

991
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,460
and he didn't say a word,

992
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,340
just staring at me with those blank eyes.

993
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,820
Thinking back now, it's kind of creepy.

994
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,440
[Procuratorate]

995
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,380
Part of this is on me, too.

996
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,340
If we'd known he was depressed,

997
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,940
we should've paid more attention

998
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,340
and taken him to see a doctor.

999
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,340
Xie,

1000
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,650
if there's nothing else,

1001
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,090
maybe you should

1002
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:36,900
head back.

1003
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,090
Alright.

1004
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,130
Maybe I'm just overthinking.

1005
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,610
