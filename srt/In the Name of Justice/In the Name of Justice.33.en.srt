00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,420
I watched a living, breathing man

2
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,690
die right in front of me.

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,810
Ever thought what I felt then?

4
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,780
I was brought to the Bureau
to make a statement

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,010
and then taken by the Task Force
for questioning.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,500
You know what I was thinking?

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,260
On my birthday,

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,180
we're having a meal together.

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,540
Everyone present

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:46,980
was either taken away

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,770
or scheduled for an interview.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,980
Should I be

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,540
the only one introspecting?

14
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,800
[In the Name of Justice]

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,800
[Episode 33]

16
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,100
I mishandled the Wan Hai case.

17
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,690
I forced Wang Yu into it.

18
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,540
I forced him
to hand himself over to you.

19
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,570
I forced him to come

20
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,060
and confess to you

21
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,820
that he's Chen Shenglong's hitman.

22
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,690
He's helped Chen topple Wan Hai

23
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,100
to seize that mine.

24
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,850
Only when he came to you to confess

25
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,820
could he prove

26
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,220
that I was their pawn.

27
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,380
I didn't mishandle the case on purpose.

28
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,010
I can go with you

29
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,500
and explain things.

30
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,500
Say, why are you officers all like this?

31
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,260
You want all the credit

32
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,060
and run at any hint of trouble.

33
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,170
Are you even human?

34
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,340
Also,

35
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,580
I did buy

36
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,850
Dadu Xishan's house on the cheap.

37
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,460
But if Chen Shenglong

38
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,250
weren't a gangster,

39
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,580
there wouldn't be a problem.

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,490
Later on,

41
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,490
I found he was one.

42
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,700
So I went to him for a refund,

43
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,810
compensating him for the price gap.

44
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,660
But…

45
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,140
It was too late.

46
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,700
It couldn't be refunded.

47
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,580
Not only that,

48
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,250
Chen Shenglong even threatened Liu Yun.

49
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,780
What was I supposed
to do in that situation?

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,020
Did I dare speak up?

51
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,540
I didn't.

52
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,340
I was scared.

53
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,250
I was scared
she couldn't explain herself.

54
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,930
She's my wife.

55
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,980
She's my wife, Hong Liang!

56
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,290
What then?

57
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,340
So I went to Wang Yu again.

58
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,020
I intimidated him

59
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,290
and forced him to find you

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,900
to reveal

61
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,340
that Chen Shenglong's a gangster.

62
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,460
To reveal

63
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,460
that Liu Yun was completely unaware

64
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,580
that Chen had made use of her.

65
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,810
She was hunted.

66
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,170
In light of this,

67
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,930
could her sentence be reduced?

68
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,900
I was wrong.

69
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,410
I'd always…

70
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,250
always counted on my luck.

71
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,340
I'd kept thinking of ways

72
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,020
to cover up for my mistakes.

73
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,580
I'm willing to accept

74
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,140
any penalty.

75
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,100
Min.

76
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:26,610
Dad.

77
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,290
Are you going tomorrow?

78
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,020
What's your plan regarding Hong Liang?

79
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,930
Since he's bent on
continuing investigations,

80
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,730
there's nothing I can do.

81
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,170
Not going to Beijing then?

82
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,540
I'm definitely going to Beijing.

83
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,780
I'll return here after he's finished.

84
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:57,900
Dad.

85
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,930
After all these years,

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,900
you know what Hong Liang is like.

87
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,780
On the surface,

88
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,100
he seems to be fooling around.

89
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,900
But when it comes to investigations,

90
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,850
he's fixated.

91
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,980
So let's just allow him to finish

92
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,370
this case.

93
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,020
Can you manage on your own in Beijing?

94
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,250
I plan

95
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,170
to take Dou over there to adapt a bit.

96
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,900
If I really can't manage,

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,340
I'll hire a helper.

98
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,170
Min,

99
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,250
have a seat.

100
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,810
Dongping's case isn't a simple one.

101
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,850
Yuan's also involved in it.

102
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,930
Dad, you… You're kidding, right?

103
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,610
Dad.

104
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,900
What's really going on?

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,610
Are you alright?

106
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,010
What did the Task Force ask you?

107
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,610
Is Wang Yu's death

108
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,650
related to the Task Force?

109
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,650
So the Wan Hai case, Qiao Zhenxing,
and the mining accident

110
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,530
are all related to Wang Yu?

111
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,770
What did you say?

112
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,980
Are you hungry?

113
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,730
I've told them

114
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,820
everything I should.

115
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,610
What exactly is that?

116
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,980
What did you say?

117
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,370
Why did Wang Yu die in your arms?

118
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,850
If he sensed danger,

119
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,100
why didn't he contact the Police?

120
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,250
Why did he instead contact you,
the prosecutor-general?

121
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,820
How did he find you?

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,340
I heard you're the one
who called the police.

123
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,060
Auntie,

124
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,700
it's almost dawn.

125
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,490
You've waited for me all night, right?

126
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,460
Were you worried about me

127
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,130
or yourself?

128
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,180
I watched a living, breathing man

129
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,460
die right in front of me.

130
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,820
Ever thought what I felt then?

131
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,220
I was brought to the Bureau
to make a statement

132
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,490
and then taken by the Task Force
for questioning.

133
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,940
You know what I was thinking?

134
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,180
I was reflecting, too.

135
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,610
On my birthday,

136
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,700
we're having a meal together.

137
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,060
Everyone present

138
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,490
was either taken away

139
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,300
or scheduled for an interview.

140
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,130
I couldn't understand
the why behind it all.

141
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,650
How did Dongping's
political and legal system

142
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,250
become what it is today?

143
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,650
Should I be

144
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,940
the only one introspecting?

145
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,370
The technical restoration results
are ready.

146
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,580
We've conducted
a careful investigative comparison

147
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,490
and filtered out 30 people.

148
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,130
But most of them aren't in Haidong,

149
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,130
so direct visits will be challenging.

150
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,820
[Match Rate]
These are the selected people.

151
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:00,940
Comrades,

152
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,580
it's a key moment.

153
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,010
I hope we'll all grit our teeth
and hang in there.

154
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,460
Don't slack off one bit.

155
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,610
First, do a background check
on all of them,

156
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,770
especially on their social relations.

157
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,220
Let's all unite as one

158
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,730
to fight this battle.

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,850
Yes, sir!

160
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,580
The committee's higher-ups are placing

161
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,060
the utmost importance

162
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,300
on this vicious shooting incident

163
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,490
in Dongping.

164
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,820
Every sub-bureau must assign
elite investigators.

165
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,700
We must catch the culprit!

166
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,370
Yes, sir!

167
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,730
Also,

168
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,530
work in tandem with the Task Force

169
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,850
to do a deep investigation

170
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,370
into Dongping's gangdom.

171
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,060
As a public official

172
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,700
and a veteran prosecutor,

173
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,980
how can you not have this awareness?

174
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,610
As long as you're still in uniform,

175
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,220
you're representing the Procuratorate.

176
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,010
People were filming you on their phones,

177
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,180
and you were still yelling.

178
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,420
What's all that about?

179
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,530
Just our luck now.

180
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,820
Your image of pointing at the people

181
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,530
and yelling loudly

182
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,530
has gone viral overnight.

183
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,130
They did malicious edits,

184
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,420
and that's the only part you saw.

185
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,130
You didn't see

186
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,980
how they made
my dad's blood pressure shoot up.

187
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,300
Neither did you see them pushing my mom.

188
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,700
She nearly fell on the ground.

189
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,180
Did you record these things?

190
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,820
I won't stoop to their level.

191
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,700
Did you not have a phone?

192
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,940
If you had recorded those things,

193
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,700
the matter would have been solved.

194
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,980
Do you know how bad our situation is now?

195
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,100
Xiangqun.

196
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,820
Hong Liang.

197
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,700
Are your parents okay?

198
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,180
They are good.

199
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,010
Look at the video.

200
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,770
If your parents know

201
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,250
your critical situation,

202
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,850
they'll be worried about you, right?

203
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,850
You said just now

204
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,010
that the one who filmed you

205
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,650
was not a local.

206
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,650
Did you search where they were from?

207
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,700
Where do I even begin?

208
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,940
It is a tangled web in my village.

209
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,820
My dad

210
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,980
has been in the village
for his whole life.

211
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,820
He said that he had never seen them.

212
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,940
That's tough.

213
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,490
Xiangqun was right.

214
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,060
It's an era of self-media

215
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,530
and the internet.

216
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,300
Everyone has a phone.

217
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,610
Everyone can film you

218
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,180
and post it on the web.

219
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,580
How can you control them?

220
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,180
I have to repeat this to you.

221
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,700
You're a prosecutor.

222
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,580
Be it at work

223
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,770
or in private,

224
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,490
especially in such sudden outbreaks,

225
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,420
people will misunderstand you,

226
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,370
wrong you,

227
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,460
or criticize you.

228
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,980
It's part of your profession.

229
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,850
Look at this.

230
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,370
We just received instructions
from the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

231
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,820
We are ordered to
find the truth as soon as possible

232
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,850
and report it to their comms department.

233
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,850
We must quell the negative effects

234
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,850
and respond to the concerns of the public.

235
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,490
Listen.

236
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,100
Contact Song of the Publicity Department

237
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,340
and compile a summary

238
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,340
of your understanding

239
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,530
of the situation.

240
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,100
Then hand it to me. I'll report up.

241
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,220
But sir, my workload at the Task Force

242
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,460
is of most urgency right now.

243
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,100
Do as you're told.

244
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,340
Before resolving this publicity issue,

245
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,850
you can't go anywhere.

246
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,580
You're still here?

247
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,730
Where's Dou?

248
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,130
Went out with Auntie?

249
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,340
Come here.

250
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,370
What antiques!

251
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,180
When was this taken?

252
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,010
You were ten years old then.

253
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,180
Ten? In primary school then…

254
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,610
I was in my third year of high school.

255
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,700
I sent and fetched you all along.

256
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,340
I'm quite clear about that year.

257
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,770
I studied all mornings and evenings.

258
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,530
So I'd often forget

259
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,940
or be too busy to fetch you.

260
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,980
Don't think so.

261
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,220
I guess you were seeing someone.

262
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,890
Do you remember

263
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,460
that you often cried by the school gate?

264
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,650
No, I didn't!

265
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,650
Don't you smear me!

266
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,180
Frankly,

267
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,100
Mom left us early on,

268
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,460
while Dad spent all his time at work.

269
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,940
In my childhood,

270
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,460
it was you who had taken care

271
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,100
of my life and studies.

272
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,460
Without you,

273
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,010
I wouldn't have made it.

274
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,530
Min,

275
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,700
thank you.

276
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,770
Since you owe me so much,

277
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,060
how about doing me a favor?

278
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,130
Sure.

279
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,370
Hong Liang's busy with the Task Force.

280
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,650
And Dou needs to
get used to the new place.

281
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,890
I can't handle it by myself.

282
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,890
So can you

283
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,340
stay with us in Beijing for a while

284
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,300
and help me

285
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,610
look after Dou?

286
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,250
Sorry, Min.

287
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,090
My project

288
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,770
is at the most crucial moment.

289
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,460
You know that, right?

290
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,570
If anything crops up in Beijing,

291
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,570
I can help you with it.

292
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,810
I can even

293
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,570
hire a nanny if you cannot manage.

294
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,660
But if you need me to go there,

295
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,050
I…

296
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,570
My hands are really tied.

297
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,290
Is your project about new energy?

298
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,010
Yeah.

299
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,770
Can you put it off for now?

300
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,050
Why?

301
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,810
You know Hong Liang's in the Task Force.

302
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,810
I don't know its scope,

303
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,380
but after such a long investigation,

304
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,980
it's at least proven

305
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,090
that Dongping's situation is complex.

306
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,980
Keep yourself out of it.

307
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,530
Min,

308
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,700
did Dad tell you anything?

309
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,220
Can you not get involved in this, okay?

310
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,770
It's not as simple as you think.

311
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,330
Of course, it's not as complex, either.

312
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,180
It's just…

313
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,460
Anyway, I know what I'm doing.

314
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,940
If you really do, you wouldn't

315
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,380
still be contacting

316
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,460
Yu Tiancheng even now.

317
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:16,940
So…

318
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,980
So Dad got you to talk to me about this?

319
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,090
Why are you just like Dad?

320
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,660
You never cared about what I wanted!

321
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,180
All you care about is what you want!

322
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,250
Let me tell you frankly.

323
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,770
I've been working on this for three years.

324
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,940
I won't just put it down.

325
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,980
I'm warning you.

326
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,010
If you don't listen to Dad or me,

327
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,050
you'll destroy this family someday.

328
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,140
Do you even remember

329
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,620
how many times Dad has picked up
the pieces for you?

330
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,290
Was the car accident

331
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,140
not enough of a lesson for you?

332
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,290
That's why I don't need your help.

333
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,490
I can solve it on my own.

334
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,090
Really? How?

335
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,530
Listen up, Jiang Yuan.

336
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,530
If you keep

337
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,810
messing around with Yu Tiancheng,

338
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,660
you'll end up
among one of those gangsters.

339
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,860
Then turn me in!

340
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,180
Let Liang arrest me!

341
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,980
I've talked with Mom.

342
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,140
Qiqi will stay with her for a while.

343
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,620
While sending him over today,

344
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,180
he told me

345
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,570
the story you had told him.

346
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,900
He's grown up so fast.

347
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,570
Mature, too.

348
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,570
How time flies.

349
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,380
Right.

350
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,250
I've cleaned and ironed

351
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,140
your shirt and uniform.

352
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,220
They're in the closet.

353
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,900
The bank card

354
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,220
is tucked in our marriage certificate.

355
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,860
I've put it in the bedside drawer.

356
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,730
And

357
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,090
the fridge

358
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,940
is pretty much stocked up.

359
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,050
I've bought vegetables, fruits,

360
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,220
eggs, and milk.

361
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,490
All your favorites.

362
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,490
I've also bought some frozen food,

363
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,530
but you…

364
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:14,940
Darling,

365
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,380
I love you.

366
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,530
What's so funny?

367
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,900
Nothing.

368
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,900
I just remembered

369
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,380
that little donkey.

370
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,860
You mean our

371
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,050
motorbike?

372
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,220
Second-hand.

373
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,530
I miss

374
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,810
our past life.

375
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,620
You rode the bike,

376
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,250
taking me to the movies,

377
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,620
eating at street stalls,

378
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,090
and hitting the road.

379
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,460
How simple those days were.

380
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,010
And then we got married, had a child,

381
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,140
and bought a house.

382
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,620
You rose up in rank,

383
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,090
and our life became better.

384
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,380
But somehow,

385
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,980
something changed.

386
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,290
Renjun.

387
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,330
Can we return to the way we were?

388
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,220
Don't worry.

389
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,770
If you explain the issue,

390
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,490
it'll pass.

391
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,330
Everything will get better.

392
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,420
It definitely will.

393
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,570
You may head back, Mr. Li.

394
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,250
How's things

395
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,530
with Dad?

396
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,570
He's fine.

397
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,770
Should we arrange for a check-up
at the hospital?

398
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:03,860
No need.

399
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,530
It's okay, don't worry.

400
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,380
Don't keep saying that.

401
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,570
How long has it been
since Dad and Mom had a check-up?

402
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,420
Less than a year.

403
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,490
It's OK.

404
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,180
Well, Liang.

405
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,290
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

406
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,290
My apologies.

407
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,530
I'll drink one as a penalty.

408
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,090
How's the damage control going on?

409
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,090
Can you return?

410
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,380
Liu Yun.

411
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,570
Regarding your matter,

412
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,330
is there anything you missed?

413
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,940
Nothing else.

414
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,940
Will my issue

415
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,290
affect Renjun?

416
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,010
I can guarantee that

417
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,900
he's completely

418
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,460
in the dark over all these.

419
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,090
If he had known,

420
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,770
he surely wouldn't
have agreed to what I did.

421
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,620
I don't want my deeds

422
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,420
to burden him.

423
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,090
That was some quick damage control.

424
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,330
Shouldn't it take at least 48 hours?

425
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,420
You're back so fast.

426
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,530
You're not here to pack things up,
are you?

427
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,940
During this period,

428
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,530
I was asked to redeem myself
through good service.

429
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:09,980
- Wang.
- Okay, now.

430
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,380
Start the meeting.

431
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,250
Ready to start.

432
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:11,980
Alrighty.

433
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,860
This is a screenshot
of the surveillance video,

434
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,330
given the hi-res treatment.

435
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,700
We've also selected suspects

436
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,330
appearing near the mining area that day

437
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,140
with appearances

438
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,620
of a high match rate.

439
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,010
One of them

440
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,420
was often going to and fro

441
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,900
between New World waste treatment plant

442
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,140
and Tianlong Company.

443
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,460
According to our investigations,

444
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,380
this waste treatment plant

445
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,660
is in fact wholly owned
by Tianlong Company.

446
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,250
We highly suspect this person

447
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,620
to be the criminal
behind the mining incident.

448
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,730
There's also new information about

449
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,570
the Wang Yu shooting case.

450
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,490
Currently, we can deduce that

451
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,420
the car the shooter drove

452
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,490
also belongs to the
New World waste treatment plant.

453
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,940
Take a look at this man.

454
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,730
His name is Xiong Lei.

455
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,860
We're very baffled

456
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,620
that we couldn't find

457
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,570
his bank account, address, transportation,

458
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,140
and other relevant social information.

459
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,380
It has caused a great challenge

460
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,490
to our investigation.

461
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,320
He has advanced
counter-surveillance skills.

462
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,160
[Prime Suspect
Name: Xiong Lei, Sex: Male]

463
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,570
That case was mishandled.

464
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,860
Sun Yihu

465
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,900
might not be the prime culprit.

466
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,810
Sun Yihu is hereby imposed
with the death penalty

467
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,290
and stripped of
all political rights for life.

468
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,330
Your dad

469
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,380
didn't even dare to kill chickens.

470
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,900
The shooter

471
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,330
must be Wang Dayou.

472
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,290
Accomplice Wang Dayou

473
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,460
[Suspect Information Record: Wang Dayou]
is sentenced to 17 years in prison.

474
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,620
He contracted liver cancer
while serving his sentence

475
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,680
and died one year after
being released on medical parole.

476
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,440
[Prime Suspect:
Name: Xiong Lei, Sex: Male]

477
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:17,980
Hey.

478
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,530
Identify someone for me.

479
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,980
Do you know him?

480
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,730
No.

481
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,380
I don't know him.

482
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,700
You covered up
the mining accident for him.

483
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,980
You helped him so much,
yet you don't know him?

484
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,050
I told you.

485
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,010
Sun Fei asked me to do it.

486
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,530
I didn't know who I was actually helping.

487
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:46,810
How about

488
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,980
we do it in another way?

489
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,180
Let's drop the mining accident

490
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,140
and go back a dozen years.

491
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,180
Also the Wanchuan Mine.

492
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,090
This man.

493
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,220
Think again.

494
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,380
Do you know him?

495
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,420
Who's he?

496
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,570
Wanchuan Mining Shooting.

497
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,660
Wang Dayou, the accomplice.

498
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,290
Who?

499
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,050
Wang Dayou, the accomplice.

500
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,380
I didn't hear that. Once again.

501
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,460
Wang Dayou, the accomplice.

502
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,090
Again.

503
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,770
Wang Dayou, the…

504
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,770
Was he the accomplice?

505
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,620
Was he?

506
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,570
Wang Dayou, the prime culprit.

507
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,490
In the Wanchuan Mining Shooting case,

508
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,420
he was the one who pulled the trigger.

509
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,290
So,

510
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,380
he's the prime culprit.

511
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,290
So this prime culprit, Wang Dayou,

512
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,330
according to records,

513
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,940
died on medical parole.

514
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,770
Then how come he is still alive?

515
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,220
Come on, tell me.

516
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,620
Who healed him?

517
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,810
Hard to say.

518
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,010
Why?

519
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,330
It's hard to say.

520
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,980
Look. What's this?

521
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,010
An ID card, see?

522
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,810
A dead man

523
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:12,900
made an ID card.

524
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,380
In your sub-bureau.

525
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,490
It wasn't me.

526
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,330
Then who did?

527
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,180
Who was it?

528
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,900
I didn't do it.

529
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,770
Then you must know who did, right?

530
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,140
Dear prosecutors.

531
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,380
I have the right not to reply

532
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,770
to things I didn't commit, no?

533
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,460
Withholding information
and concealing criminal acts.

534
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,250
What say you?

535
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,810
So if I report
another man's criminal act

536
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,660
that you didn't know,

537
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,770
do I get credit?

538
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,420
Sun Fei did it himself.

539
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,460
He used his authority
to have the info filled out

540
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,010
and everything done
by the household registration section.

541
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,980
Later on, the man doing it

542
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,330
was transferred.

543
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,980
Then how did this person go

544
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,140
from the prime culprit to an accomplice?

545
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,090
The Wanchuan Mining Shooting case

546
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,090
wasn't a robbery at all.

547
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:27,250
Wan Hai and his neighbor, Dacheng Mining,

548
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,250
had a conflict of interest.

549
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,180
Wang Dayou was dispatched
by Dacheng Mining

550
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,940
to specifically target Wan Hai's life.

551
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,700
After the incident,

552
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,090
Sun Fei tampered

553
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,420
with the witness statements

554
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,290
and switched the identities
of the culprits.

555
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,980
Several times,

556
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,490
I was present.

557
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,380
When Sun Yihu signed

558
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,090
his confession statements,

559
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,900
I couldn't see

560
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,620
any light in his eyes.

561
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,220
He whispered to me

562
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,050
that death was what he wanted.

563
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,010
And Yang Zheng.

564
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,730
It was quite weird.

565
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,010
His daughter joined the police, too.

566
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,730
Assigned to my team.

567
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,900
So I never dared
to look at Yang Jing in the eye.

568
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,700
Because when I saw her,

569
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,530
I thought of her father.

570
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,700
Sun Fei, you're amazing, aren't you?

571
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,290
Someone like you

572
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,050
should've tossed off
your uniform early on.

573
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,900
Take it off and be done with it.

574
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,490
You could've done bad things
with no qualms.

575
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,250
Did you not feel ashamed
in that police uniform?

576
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,810
We know this man's identity now.

577
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,250
Xiong Lei.

578
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,650
Wang Dayou, right?

579
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,740
She's asking you.

580
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,340
Did you turn this man

581
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,860
from the prime culprit into an accomplice,

582
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,570
arrange medical parole for him,

583
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,050
and finally say he was dead?

584
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,940
You did it. How did you do it?

585
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,260
The Wanchuan Mining Shooting. Remember?

586
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,090
You made his ID card.

587
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,940
There's no way you've forgotten him.

588
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,420
You let him off like that.

589
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,210
He's just a wolf who hurts anyone.

590
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,260
How many evil deeds has he done now?

591
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,170
In just one mining accident,

592
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,340
two were dead, six gravely injured.

593
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,050
Wang Yu was killed, too.

594
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,610
You let him go,

595
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,380
and he killed people.

596
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,530
Then you're no better than him.

597
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,900
Your hands are just as bloody!

598
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,210
Mr. Jiang.

599
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,900
So you're kicking me out of Dongping?

600
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,690
You can refuse it.

601
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,170
But remember.

602
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,490
I'm the only one who can help you.

603
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,010
Otherwise, you're a convicted murderer.

604
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,490
Prison or leaving Dongping.

605
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,530
Your choice.

606
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,340
I can accept it,

607
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,090
but you must

608
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,210
do me another favor.

609
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,260
Don't push your luck.

610
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,420
The shooter's called Wang Dayou.

611
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,300
I see him as a son.

612
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,210
You've got to get him out.

613
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,050
After that,

614
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,740
I'll leave Dongping immediately.

615
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,090
Yu Tiancheng.

616
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,210
I won't

617
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,690
do this for you.

618
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,490
You want to make me a criminal?

619
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,740
Here, Mr. Jiang.

620
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,610
Well, Xie. Keep Mr. Jiang company.

621
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,530
What's his name?

622
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,380
Wang Dayou, right?

623
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,050
I'll help you.

624
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,740
Faking someone's death

625
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,340
and getting him to live
with another identity.

626
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,460
You couldn't have done
such a huge maneuver alone.

627
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:06,980
Sun Fei.

628
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,460
Is there anything you want to say?

629
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,820
Sun Fei, let's not do this.

630
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,690
At this point,

631
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,380
you know your situation well.

632
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,570
Damned if you do and damned if you don't.

633
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,210
Sun Fei, be a man.

634
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,530
Let's get it over quick, shall we?

635
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,570
Come on, tell me.

636
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,740
Who's with you?

637
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,490
Say something.

638
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,380
Who's the organizer?

639
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,340
Speak up!

640
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,780
When did it begin?

641
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,610
Speak!

642
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,050
Thirteen years ago, or earlier?

643
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,260
Can you just say something?

644
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,860
Sun Fei, you're playing
zero confession, huh?

645
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,340
Okay.

646
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,130
Then let me show you

647
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,210
whether I can convict you
without a confession.

648
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,260
You

649
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,170
can't escape capital punishment.

650
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,940
My colleagues and I will work hard.

651
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,090
We won't let you down.

652
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,260
We'll definitely treat your case

653
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,260
with utmost diligence

654
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,170
and get you a concrete conviction

655
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,490
with clear-cut testimonies.

656
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,530
You'll die without complaint.

657
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,260
I remember your police ID numbers.

658
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,980
When I get out,

659
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,690
I'm going to sue you.

660
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,740
Cheng Zijian,

661
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,570
do you think you're getting out?

662
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,690
Spit what you know

663
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,860
- and appeal for leniency!
- Where's the evidence?

664
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:48,900
Where's the evidence?

665
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,380
Show me.

666
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,130
Why are you here?

667
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,340
Why did you bring her here?

668
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,050
She has nothing to do with this.

669
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,170
Why did you call her here?

670
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,300
Zheng Yaping.

671
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,170
Why did you bring her here?

672
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,300
Tell me, Zheng Yaping!

673
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,780
This has nothing to do with her!

674
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,650
Whatever it is,
let's talk about it later.

675
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,380
Go back first.

676
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,210
Later?

677
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,090
Zijian.

678
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,980
Have you ever loved me?

679
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,610
Why did you lie to me?

680
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,650
I'd lie to everyone in the world

681
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,610
but you.

682
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,300
Then why?

683
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,090
I was afraid…

684
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,610
that your family would look down on me.

685
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,980
If I were still
a minor public officer in the county,

686
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,740
would your brother
have introduced you to me?

687
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,860
Would you have picked me?

688
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,050
So that's how you see me and my brother.

689
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,380
That's right.

690
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,460
I won't lie to you.

691
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,900
In my understanding,

692
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,010
that's how it is.

693
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,860
From the moment they're born,

694
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,010
everyone must fight it out on their own.

695
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,210
I really don't want

696
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,090
to spend my whole life
as an ordinary man.

697
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,420
What I want is to stand out

698
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,380
and live a good life.

699
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,130
Anything wrong with it?

700
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,740
So you had to commit crimes?

701
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,130
I chose you

702
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,210
because I thought…

703
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,650
I thought I found someone

704
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,380
who loved me wholeheartedly.

705
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,690
Your parents couldn't reach you,

706
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,610
so they called me.

707
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,210
I told them you're on a business trip.

708
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,260
But I can't hide it for much longer.

709
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,010
You've always been their pride.

710
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,940
Mine too, once.

711
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,610
Confess and plead for leniency.

712
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,380
Take care.

713
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,740
Yanxin.

714
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,980
Thanks for giving me a home.

715
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,050
Please

716
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,690
keep guiding me for the rest of my life.

717
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,210
I'll lay it out.

718
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:12,980
I'll make a statement.

719
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,760
[Haidong Provincial Second Prison]

720
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,420
My name's Hong Liang.

721
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,010
I'll be asking you today.

722
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,570
Cooperate with me.

723
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,090
On what?

724
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,130
Thirteen years ago,

725
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,460
your Wanchuan Mining

726
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,490
was in this shooting case.

727
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:37,690
Two people died.

728
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,650
Recently, I reviewed
and pieced this case back together.

729
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,860
I discovered that the motive

730
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,980
wasn't robbery.

731
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,090
It was murder all along.
