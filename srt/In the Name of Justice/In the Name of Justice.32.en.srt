1
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,620
As a...

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,380
law enforcement officer,
I know very well.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,850
The first thing

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,740
I should do is be honest and open.

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,460
A chance to turn yourself in.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,260
I can go with you.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,690
Clear things up.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,100
I told them your wife

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,780
was forced by Chen Shenglong.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,420
I went to make false accusations.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,050
There's nothing wrong
with your case-handling?

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,860
If I can't even do that,

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,090
how can I talk about
fairness and justice under the law?

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,900
To truly fulfill our role

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,180
as legal supervisors,

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,410
we also need the courage
to turn the scrutiny inward.

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,330
But

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,010
it's too hard.

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,690
How many people can

20
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,050
really be honest and open?

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,690
I could ask any random kid
on the street right now,

22
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,220
and even they'd say you did it.

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,580
When things started falling apart,

24
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,260
you silenced him!

You're making my blood pressure rise.

31
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,660
They keep asking me all sorts of things,

32
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,260
and I keep dodging and deflecting.

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,690
Feels like I'm being dishonest
with the organization.

34
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,500
You really think that's a good idea?

35
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,410
What did they ask you?

36

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,170
He asked...

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,410
Fine, don't tell me.

39
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,100
If you tell me,

it'll look like I'm sniffing around.

00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,010

That's the first case

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,050
the greater your responsibility.

62
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,580
It's right to be careful.

63
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,660
Folks, listen to me!

64
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,290
Yuanli Group is grabbing our land

65
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,250

Today, we're here to
demand an explanation!

67
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,810
But they won't talk to us!

68
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,730
What does that mean?

69
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,730
They're guilty!

00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,140
there's nothing you can do.

79
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,020

80
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,370
Slow down.

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,100
Got it.

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,540
It's not a riot.

Mr. Hong, you're finally here.

Please explain it to everyone.

99
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,850
Didn't we have an agreement before?

100
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,170
Agreement?

101
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,700
You all heard that?

102
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,700
I heard it!

103
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,660
- Okay.
- They colluded.

104
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,290
What you don't know is

105
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,580
Tianlong Company

106
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,220
offered us more compensation
than Yuanli Group.

107
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,900
Then why did our village land

108
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,730
still end up with Yuanli?

109
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,340
Because Yuanli's boss is Jiang Yuan,

110
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,490
who happens to be Mr. Hong's relative,

111
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,460
Hong Liang's brother-in-law!

112
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,850
So our land was granted to Yuanli Group.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,290
Do you see it now?

114
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,170
Yes!

115
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,340
Listen to me.

116
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,290
You...

117
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,610
You're making things up.

118
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,370
I can sue you

119
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,730
for this slander.

120
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,660
Oh, I'm so scared, Mr. Hong.

121
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,410
Why can Mr. Hong sue me?

122
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,290
Why can he sue me?

123
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,660
Because Hong Liang is a public official!

124
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,460
Hong Liang

125
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,780
is abusing his power,
colluding with his brother-in-law

126
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,020
to steal our land!

127
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,170
Can we let that happen?

128
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,170
No!

129
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,700
No!

130
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,780
We demand an explanation!

131
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,100
Yes!

132
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,900
- No.
- Smash it!

133
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,900
Let's go!

134
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:38,900
Let's go!

135
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,050
Wait...

136
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,780
Wait...

137
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,900
Listen to me!

138
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,580
You're twisting the truth!

139
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,540
Wait!

140
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,580
Don't...

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,460
Mr. Hong.

142
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,610
Mr. Hong.

143
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,410
Mr. Hong.

144
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,290
Mr. Hong.

145
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,370
Mr. Hong.

146
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,340

I told you everything I know.

You can't blame me

154
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,700

156
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,580
it's no use keeping him.

157
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,660
Let's toss him in the generator.

158
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,100

163
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:08,850
don't know.

164
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,370
Behave.

165
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,460
Hello?

166
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,490
Sheng,

167
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,540
I'm your brother.

168
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,220
This is my new number.

169
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,340
Is there anyone next to you?

170
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,020
No.

171
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,170
Where are you?

172
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,250
Are you safe?

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,540
Yes.

174
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,130
Well, after you ran, I ran too.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,610
They didn't look for you?

176
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,130
I was hiding in that...

177
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,940
that old house of mine.

178
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,850
Bro,

179
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,730
what's your plan now?

180
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,530
I remember

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,490
there is a freight car
leaving the province tonight.

182
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,940
9 p.m., right?

183
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,580
Yes.

184
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,650
Can you

185
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,820
do me a favor?

186
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,820
Once the goods are loaded,

187
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,580
don't lock the door of car No. 8.

188
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,250
Leave it open for me, got it?

189
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,300
Huh? I said, do you understand?

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,220
Yes, got it.

191
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,370
Now the cops have set up checkpoints

192
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,100
on all the roads out of the city.

193
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,060
And in the city,

194
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,180
Chen Shenglong's guys are searching
everywhere for me.

195
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,730
I'm stuck now.

196
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,060
This is the only way I can get out.

197
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,300
Okay.

198
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,770
Don't worry, brother.

199
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,700
Be thorough.

200
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,460
Okay.

201
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,770
I'll hang up now, bro.

202
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,220
Hong Ying.

203
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,300
Step aside, I need to go in.

204
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,250
Can't do that, bro.

205
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,980
No outside vehicles
are allowed in right now.

206
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,370
I have something urgent.
I need to go home.

207
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,180
It's me.

208
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,460
Not even you, bro.

209
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,060
Hong Yi gave me the order.

210
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,100
Watch the car for me.

211
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,580
Okay.

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,890
Liang, you're back.

213
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,180
You're back.

214
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,490
My son.

215
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,010
Hurry.

216
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,180
You're finally back.

217
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,130
Look at your father.

218
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,420
Take a look, hurry.

219
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,130
- Look what they did to him.
- Why are you back?

220
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,100
Just lie down...

221
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,220
Why did you come back?

222
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,610
Lie down...

223
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:29,890
Wait.

224
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,940
Lie down, don't move.

225
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,130
- Did you get hurt?
- Don't worry about it.

226
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,100
These people...

227
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,180
they're

228
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,700
really scum.

229
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,300
You're not making any sense.

230
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,530
Director, tell him.

231
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,490
What's going on?

232
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,100
This land of Hongjia Village

233
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,820
was zoned by the Development Zone
Managing Committee

234
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,770
as industrial land.

235
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,130
Yuanli Group,

236
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,530
your brother-in-law
Jiang Yuan's company,

237
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,370
plans to build

238
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,940
a new energy battery plant there.

239
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,730
And Hong Yi

240
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,180
thinks that the compensation is too low,

241
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,220
so he disagreed.

242
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,700
A few days ago, your brother-in-law
visited your parents,

243
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,060
and he assumed that

244
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,250
your brother-in-law

245
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,130
and your father
were colluding over the land,

246
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,490
so he's been

247
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,530
making trouble.

248
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,420
Our ancestors of the Hong family

249
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,060
moved to this village,

250
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,580
worked tirelessly,

251
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,180
and built up a foundation.

252
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,490
Hong Liang, calm down.

253
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,340
Don't give him what he wants.

254
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,420
We lived in peace and tranquility,

255
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,010
helped one another.

256
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,940
But six hundred years later,

257
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,340
this family

258
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,340
is going to destroy our village

259
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,890
and force all the villagers out.

260
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,460
Don't get up.

261
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,530
Lie down, don't move.

262
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,610
Slow down.

263
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,370
- Hong Yi...
- Today,

264
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,530
you need to give us an explanation,
am I right?

265
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,460
- Yes!
- Hong Yi.

266
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,460
Give me that loudspeaker.

267
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,220
Director.

268
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:37,940
Give me that!

269
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,130
It's the government's decision.

270
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,370
It has nothing to do

271
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,220
with Mr. Hong.

272
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,250
Leave.

273
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,220
Leave now!

274
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,010
I'm not going anywhere.

275
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,300
We're going to make this clear today!

276
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,610
Make what clear?

277
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,700
I only just heard

278
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,100
a rough summary
from the director a minute ago,

279
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,250
I didn't even understand it.

280
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,130
I don't know the whole situation.

281
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,700
What do you want me to explain?

282
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,940
Don't play dumb with us.

283
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,820
What government decision?

284
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,300
Isn't it your family's decision?

285
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,890
Your family always
likes to take advantage.

286
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,220
Back when land was divided,

287
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,820
your family got more than others.

288
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,940
Always been that way.

289
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,530
Hong Yi, be fair when you speak.

290
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,460
Stop saying
our family's always been like this.

291
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,610
What kind of people are we?

292
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,100
Don't you know who my mother is?

293
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,890
My dad was our teacher.

294
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,490
You know what kind of man he is.

295
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,220
Oh, I almost forgot,

296
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,370
back then the village
pooled money to build the school,

297
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,890
and now that old school building

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,010
has turned into your family's storage.

299
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,940
It's filled with your stuff!

300
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,820
The only thing in there
that belongs to us

301
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,370
is the rice thresher!

302
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,580
The rest are teaching aids
Mr. Hong used.

303
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,610
He said they were historical items,

304
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,770
should be kept as educational displays
for future students.

305
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,980
How can you say they're ours?

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,890
Alright, Auntie.

307
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,850
Let's talk about now.

308
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,060
Your brother-in-law
brought a truck full of gifts

309
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,300
to your family,

310
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,420
wasn't it to get the land deal done?

311
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,820
How much of a kickback did you take?

312
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,700
Don't you know it?

313
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,700
My brother-in-law came to our village

314
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,580
on business,

315
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,460
and stopped by to visit my parents.

316
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,220
Who visits the elderly empty-handed?

317
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,420
Was he really here
to visit your parents?

318
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,180
Would he have come
if it's not for the land?

319
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,700
Hong Liang.

320
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,300
How many years have you been married?

321
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,820
Never mind your brother-in-law,

322
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,610
how many times has your wife
even come back?

323
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,650
You know it yourself!

324
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,890
You *punk!

325
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,130
That's our family business.

326
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,250
No need for you to mouth off here!

327
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:05,650
Auntie.

328
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,980
- Auntie.
- Go away.

329
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,770
Auntie, don't!

330
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,980
The prosecutor just hit someone!

331
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,770
The prosecutor just hit someone!

332
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,220
The prosecutor just hit someone!

333
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,340
He even tried to grab my phone!
Bullying civilians!

334
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,890
He's not from our village!

335
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,460
Put your phone down!

336
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,490
He hit someone!

337
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,850
Put your phone down!

338
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,180
Snatching phones, bullying civilians!

339
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,370
Prosecutor!

340
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,340
What kind of prosecutor are you?

341
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,370
You disgrace your title!

342
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,300
What fairness and justice?

343
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,300
What pride of the village?

344
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,250
You're the village's disgrace!

345
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,300
I thought you'd stay clean
in a dirty world.

346
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,180
Turns out you're the dirtiest!

347
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,220
Go, let's check over there.

348
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,250
Watch it.

349
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,010
This is one full truckload,

350
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,580
and there's another one over there.

351
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,180
Load them both into car No. 3.

352
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,140
Xiong.

353
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,380
Call him.

354
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,180
Sorry,

355
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,620
the number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

356
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,900
Please try again later.

357
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,250
Find him.

358
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,050
Find him!

359
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,980
Tou,

360
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,700
keep an eye on him.

361
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,290
Wait, Xiong, I...

362
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,250
Stop!

363
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,960
[Unknown Number]

364
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:09,620
Hello?

365
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,660
Mr. Li,

366
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,050
this is Wang Yu.

367
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,420
Is it too late to turn myself in?

368
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,530
Not too late.

369
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,860
Came to your senses now?

370
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,860
I've fallen out with Chen Shenglong.

371
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,730
He's trying to kill me now.

372
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,330
He brought a lot of people

373
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,860
to my freight yard.

374
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,700
Can you come get me?

375
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,700
I'll be right there.

376
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,140
Twenty minutes at most. Hang in there.

377
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,810
Wait for me.

378
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:30,980
One more thing,

379
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,290
Chen Shenglong isn't the biggest boss,

380
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,620
you need to look into

381
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,810
who's behind him, someone named...

382
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,090
Yu Tiancheng.

383
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,770
He and that...

384
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,460
Jiang Yuan

385
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,940
is working together.

386
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,250
Hurry up.

387
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,380
If you're late,

388
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,010
they'll kill me!

389
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,250
Hello?

390
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,010
Wang Yu?

391
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,980
Call Xu Yanwu.

392
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,400
[Xu Yanwu
Calling...]

393
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,090
Hello, Xu.

394
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,530
Mr. Li.

395
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,330
Wang Yu is now in the Freight Hub.

396
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,050
He's in danger.

397
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,420
Send a team over right away.

398
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,250
I'm on my way too.

399
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:04,900
Okay!

400
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,330
That's it.

401
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,010
Hurry up.

402
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,620
Zhang,

403
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,490
come and sign this.

404
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,250
Take a look over there.

405
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,290
Look carefully!

406
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,140
Don't miss a corner.

407
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,900
You guys,

408
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,250
go check by the rail tracks.

409
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,050
Over there.

410
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,420
Brother-in-law,
it's really not my fault.

411
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,860
Our company went through
the proper channels

412
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,770
to get the land in your village.

413
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,770
It was all approved by the district.

414
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,860
District approval isn't enough,

415
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,290
did you manage
to convince the villagers?

416
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,900
I did.

417
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,330
But now it's obvious
someone's sabotaging it.

418
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,900
You know that Tianlong Company?

419
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,090
Their real boss is called
Chen Shenglong.

420
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,570
You know Chen Shenglong?

421
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,090
I don't know him,

422
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,660
but he also wanted the village land,

423
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,900
so he made a play for it.

424
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,940
But he didn't have enough clout,

425
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,700
so the district approved it
for me instead.

426
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,980
Now he's targeting me.

427
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,050
Brother,

428
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,380
I think,

429
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,730
that Chen Shenglong is a true gangster.

430
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,810
Aren't you in the Task Force?

431
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,050

441

Look.

442

It's everywhere.

443
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,010
The prosecutor hit someone!

444
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,090
Snatching phones,

445
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,140
bullying civilians!

Son.

447
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,090
Will your leaders see this?

448
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,980
If they see it,

449
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,090
would they believe it?

450
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,940
I know this is called...

451
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,730
public opinion.

452
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:42,730
Can your leaders

453
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,730
delete them all?

454
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,770

456
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,140
does it mean you're gonna lose your job?

457
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,420
Prosecutor!

458
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,570
The prosecutor just hit someone!

459
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,620
It's all your fault.

460
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,620
I couldn't even stop you.

461
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,860

462
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,250
Look what a mess you've made!

463
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,900
How is this my fault?

464
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,730
I went there...

465
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,570
just wanted to distance Yuan

466
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,490
from all this.

467
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,090
I didn't know they'd pull
this kind of stunt!

468
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,860
Did you succeed then?

469
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,940
You did not!

470
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,700
You walked right into their trap,
do you understand?

471
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,860
Who told you to call him back?

472
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,140
And if you hadn't pushed him,

473
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,250
would Hong Yi have started
filming that video?

474
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,730
You even slapped him across the face!

475
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,490
Fine...

476
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,810
It's all my fault...

477
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,420
Leave.

478
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,770

Get out of here.

481

Leave Hongjia Village.

in the middle of the night?

483
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,330
Go wherever you came from.

484
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,420
What if Hong Yi comes here
again tomorrow?

485
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,770
If they do come,

486
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,570

00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,420
I saw you.

565
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,530
Come on, that way. Hurry!

566
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,220
Stop!

567
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,530
Gun.

568
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,140
Fall back!

569
00:30:59,270 --> 00:30:59,860
- Wang Yu!
- Someone got shot!

570
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,530
Someone got shot.

571
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,940
- Wang Yu.
- Call 911!

572
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,770
Hang in there.

573
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,090
Wang Yu.

574
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,090
Wang Yu.

575
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,180
Wang Yu.

576
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,330
Wang...

577
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,620
Hong Liang.

578
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,730
Where are you?

579
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,090
I'm at

580
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,810
Hongjia Village.

581
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:06,940
Get back here now.

582
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,810
Wang Yu is dead.

583
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,660
Yes...

584
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,810
Mr. Li is on his way over now.

585
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,730
As for Wang Yu,

586
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,660
the injuries were too severe.

587
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,900
He died on the way

588
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,730
to the hospital.

589
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,940
Wang Yu was the key
to reopening the Wan Hai case!

590
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,530
And he got shot and silenced

591
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,620
right here in Dongping's jurisdiction.

592
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,660
What kind of police chief are you?

593
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,420
Ms. Lan,

594
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,700
sorry.

595
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,940
This was my fault.

596
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,140
I failed in my duties.

597
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,090
'Failed'?

598
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,860
It's not that simple.

599
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,050
Listen to me,

600
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,660
this isn't just a simple case

601
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,010
of street violence.

602
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,900
It's targeting the Task Force.
A major case!

603
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,250
If you still treat it

604
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,730
as an ordinary criminal case,

605
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,050
you might as well step down
from your position right now.

606
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,050
I'm telling you,

607
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,250
deploy every available officer.

608
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,810
Track down the killer,
no matter what it takes!

609
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,940
I'll see to it immediately.

610
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,770
Make it fast!

611
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,180
Mr. Song, after a thorough review,

612
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,570
we identified a suspicious man

613
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,220
appearing in the mining area
on the night of the incident.

614
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,810
With the shift supervisor,
Chen Hui's help,

615
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,700
we can basically confirm

616
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,010
he is the suspect behind the sabotage,

617
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,050
Xiong Erqiang.

618
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,180
Send this footage
to the provincial tech center

619
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,090
for digital restoration.

620
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,250
Yes.

621
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,420
Have you gone through
the footage carefully?

622
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,460
We have. The video is a little blurry,

623
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,530
and the suspect matches many people,

624
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,900
so the vetting process is very complex.

625
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,940
Screen all suspicious individuals

626
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,770
who were within a 10-kilometer radius

627
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,140
of the mine that night.

628
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:38,940
Yes, sir.

629
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,460
Working hard half a lifetime,

630
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,810
and you've only got two bags
to show for it.

631
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,610
Here.

632
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,740
Let's go abroad first.

633
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,380
When we're out there,

634
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,130
we'll figure things out.

635
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,010
I won't leave.

636
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,690
I don't know any foreign languages.

637
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,460
I can't communicate.

638
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,260
What am I gonna do out there?

639
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,260
How will I survive?

640
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,780
Settle troubles for foreigners?

641
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,650
I can't even express myself clearly.

642
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,420
Brother,

643
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,300
if we stay here, we're dead.

644
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,300
Don't you understand?

645
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,090
Brother,

646
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:04,900
listen to me.

647
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,780
Let's go find Mr. Yu.

648
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,690
He must have a way.

649
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,740
Why would we go to him?

650
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,010
Brother,

651
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,530
after all these years,

652
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,300
do you really think
he still sees us as family?

653
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,820
That's long gone.

654
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,860
Jiang Yuan is his family now.

655
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,460
He's just doing business
with Jiang Yuan.

656
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,980
Now the business is gone,

657
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,530
he'll definitely settle this.

658
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,340
He's still got backing.

659
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,210
What backing?

660
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,570
His backing is Jiang Yuan's father.

661
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,650
Brother,

662
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,050
the way they're solving this problem

663
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,170
is by throwing you and me under the bus.

664
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,380
No, no way.

665
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,420
Mr. Yu would never do something

666
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,260
like using you and dumping you.

667
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,420
He's not that kind of guy.

668
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,900
He's exactly that kind of guy!

669
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,940
Long,

670
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,690
then I'll beg him.

671
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,170
I'll kneel down to him

672
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,130
and beg him, okay?

673
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:18,860
Don't you even!

674
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,210
We're not a family anymore,

675
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,460
why kneel?

676
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,820
His family is Jiang Yuan.

677
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,650
Long,

678
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,610
you leave.

679
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,010
Brother,

680
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,090
come with me.

681
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,860
Come with me, brother.

682
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,170
After all these years,

683
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,980
after everything,

684
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,820
I'm really tired.

685
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,260
You go.

686
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,610
I'm gonna talk to Mr. Yu.

687
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,010
You go.

688
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,210
Brother.

689
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,460
Mr. Song,

690
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,050
what's the current situation?

691
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,300
Mr. Li is taking the statement.

692
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,420
Mr. Song.

693
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:36,570
Mr. Xu.

694
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,300
Let me introduce,

695
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,860
this is Cao Ye,
prosecutor of Eleventh Division

696
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,340
of Haidong Provincial Procuratorate.

697
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:42,420
Hello.

698
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,300
Hello, Mr. Xu.

699
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,740
No one ever thought
something like this could happen.

700
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,980
This is huge.

701
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,490
We'd like to ask Mr. Li

702
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,860
to go to our base

703
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,170
and help us understand the situation.

704
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:51,900
No problem.

705
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,010
The statement's almost done.

706
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,690
I'll have them make a copy later.

707
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,490
Mr. Song, take it with you too.

708
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,780
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

709
00:38:59,360 --> 00:38:59,860
You're welcome.

710
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,050
I came here to give you a chance,

711
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,010
a chance to turn yourself in.

712
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,130
Just admit it that
you were working for Chen Shenglong.

713
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,010
Tianlong Company has been scheming

714
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,900
to get Wan Hai's mine.

715
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,690
You think you can run from this?

716
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,210
Can your wife run?

717
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,170
She helped them take that mine.

718
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,010
And you handled that case.

719
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,610
Were you just with the Task Force?

720
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,900
Did you tell them about this?

721
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,420
Do you want me to show you
an arrest warrant

722
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,490
the day I hand you evidence?

723
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,210
What stage do you want to be in?

724
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,900
What are you hiding?

725
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,610
What are you afraid of?

726
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,090
You must not tell them.

727
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,460
What about this family?

728
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,820
What about our child?

729
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,300
Qiqi is still young.

730
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,460
You can't let our family fall apart.

731
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,170
But if I don't say anything,

732
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,300
and the teacher finds out later,

733
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,460
won't it look even worse for me?

734
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,130
The higher your rank,

735
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,860
the greater the responsibility.

736
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,860
Can I have a drink?

737
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,490
Because you're
a law enforcement officer,

738
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,900
we're extending you
a basic level of trust.

739
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,420
That's why you're sitting here,
being questioned,

740
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,940
instead of handcuffed

741
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,340
in an interrogation room

742
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,530
as a criminal suspect.

743
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,010
Can I have a sip of alcohol?

744
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,300
I'll say it again.

745
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,420
This is not a routine conversation.

746
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,690
This is a critical window
for solving the case.

747
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,780
Li Renjun, you know this very well.

748
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,420
You just said you were
going to pick up Wang Yu,

749
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,570
to bring him here to confess.

750
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,940
How do you prove it?

751
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,210
Now Wang Yu was killed

752
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,860
before he even left the Freight Hub.

753
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,940
How do you clear yourself of suspicion?

754
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,210
Li Renjun, let me tell you,

755
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,010
I could ask any random kid
on the street right now,

756
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,490
and even they'd say you did it.

757
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,050
That you were protecting Wang Yu,

758
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,300
and when things started falling apart,

759
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,740
you silenced him!

760
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,340
That's how you analyze a case?

761
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,690
Then tell me how it should be deduced?

762
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,300
How do you explain it
to the organization?

763
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,050
Can I have a sip of alcohol?

764
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,210
Yes

765
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,210
or no?

766
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,490
Ziyan, go find some.

767
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,300
Check the trunk.

768
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,940
To be honest,

769
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,650
as a...

770
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,380
law enforcement officer,
I know very well.

771
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:15,860
The first thing

772
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,130
I should do is be honest and open.

773
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,300
If I can't even do that,

774
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,570
how can I talk about
fairness and justice under the law?

775
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,260
But

776
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,380
it's too hard.

777
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,130
How many people can

778
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,420
really be honest and open?

779
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:39,940
If I could

780
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,860
understand this earlier,

781
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,460
if I'd come clean during the last talk

782
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,090
we had,

783
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,900
maybe Wang Yu wouldn't have died.
