1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,700
If you're gonna throw paperwork at me

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,460
just to push through
this second autopsy,

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,330
then take the body.

4
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,140
But if we're doing this by law,

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,900
as Qiao Zhenxing's family,

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,530
let me be clear,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,690
you don't have my consent.

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,180
If

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,580
I hadn't said yes this morning,

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,330
would I

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,180
have gotten to see Qiao one last time?

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,090
Qiao!

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,090
- Qiao!
- Mei.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,220
Mei...

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,370
Mei, it's alright.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,540
Qiao!

[In the Name of Justice]

18
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,160
[Episode 11]

19
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,500
Qiao's at the funeral home now.

20
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,980
His memorial's tomorrow morning.

21
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,450
I figure, when the memorial wraps up,

22
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,100
it should be around ten o'clock.

23
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,340
Then he'll go into the cremator.

24
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,850
At that point, we won't be able to do

25
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,450
a second autopsy.

26
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,780
Here's a plan,

27
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,340
I'll request a refrigerated van
from the office.

28
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,170
Once the service is over,

29
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,890
we'll take the body straight to our lab.

30
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,500
Great idea. Amazing.

31
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,570
Let me report it to the leadership.

32
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,730
Who exactly?

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,060
Commissioner Sun.

34
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,940
Report what?

35
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,380
That we want a second autopsy.

36
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,730
But there is a problem, boss.

37
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,340
If the van shows up,

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,570
but the family refuses,

39
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,980
that's gonna make us look bad.

40
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,410
Right?

41
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,260
Then we split up.

42
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,570
You go talk to Qiao's family.

43
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,130
Get them on board.

44
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,730
- Okay.
- I'll check with the higher-ups.

45
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,730
But there is still a small issue.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,500
I pissed off Zhou Mei.

47
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,410
I can't face her right now.

48
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,060
And most importantly, look at the time.

49
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,850
It's middle of the night.

50
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,780
Widow and child in the house,
and I'm a man...

51
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,380
Just say it straight.

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,940
I can't go there alone.

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,780
I'll go with you.

54
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,290
Now?

55
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:12,980
Yeah.

56
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,730
That's amazing.

57
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,170
Ms. Zheng,

58
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,730
if you hadn't come with him,

59
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,220
I wouldn't have opened the door.

60
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,220
The day I signed that paper,

61
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,810
I gave him a call.

62
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,900
Didn't really have anything to say.

63
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,290
Just wanted to talk.

64
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,170
It rang four times,

65
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,780
then he hung up.

66
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,980
I get it.

67
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,930
The video came out.

68
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,100
The money was found.

69
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,580
He also believes that

70
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,220
Qiao is an embezzler.

71
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,290
So he's trying to keep his distance now.

72
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,370
I can understand.

73
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,660
Ms. Zhou,

74
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,580
I'm not defending him.

75
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,540
But that's

76
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,370
how anyone would react.

77
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,980
No one knows what really happened.

78
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,980
The facts are all out there,

79
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,140
blaming him won't help.

80
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,930
I'm his leader.

81
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,850
And we're here tonight
representing the top-level authorities.

82
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,490
If you don't trust him,
you can trust me.

83
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,850
As the family of a prosecutor,

84
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,220
you should understand

85
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,340
we wouldn't show up
in the middle of the night

86
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,140
asking for something like this

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,170
if it wasn't for a good reason.

88
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,170
You...

89
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,580
Did you find something?

90
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,660
That... we can't share yet.

91
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,250
But rest assured,

92
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,020
Dongping's officials

93
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,460
haven't heard about this plan yet.

94
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,610
After tomorrow's memorial,

95
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,290
the provincial office

96
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,370
will arrange a car to pick up Qiao.

97
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,340
Forget it.

98
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,460
It's not necessary.

99
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,780
I used to be hung up on it too.

100
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,780
I was also trying to figure out

101
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,370
how Qiao actually died.

102
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,460
But look at it now,

103
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,610
none of that matters.

104
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,660
Homicide

105
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,700
or suicide.

106
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,700
He's gone.

107
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,140
Truth or no truth,

108
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,340
he's gonna turn into ashes in the end.

109
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,490
Now, we just

110
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,930
want to live our lives in peace.

111
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,100
I believe

112
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,660
that's what Qiao himself

113
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,410
would want for us.

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,220
How do you know,
if he's really watching,

115
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,140
that he wouldn't want...

116
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,810
If

117
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,100
you're gonna throw paperwork at me

118
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,810
just to push through
this second autopsy,

119
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,730
then take the body.

120
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,100
Why bother to ask me?

121
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,930
But if we're doing this by law,

122
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,340
you want me to sign something,

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,610
as Qiao Zhenxing's family,

124
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,220
let me be clear,

125
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,410
you don't have my consent.

126
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,220
Hong.

127
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,140
Do you think

128
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,610
it'll hurt my dad?

129
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,460
If we go through with it,
it's just like falling asleep.

130
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,050
It won't hurt.

131
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,250
Then how come
when I fall asleep at night

132
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,900
and fall from bed,
I'll wake up from the pain?

133
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,610
Your dad sleeps really deep.

134
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,410
It's like surgery.

135
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,980
The doctor will give him anesthesia.

136
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,410
Didn't he have a surgery before?

137
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,580
That time...

138
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,580
the doctor wasn't very good.

What's going on?

142
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,060
I don't know, boss.

143
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,610
Everything's gone when we got here.

144
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,340
What? Check the cameras!

145

Hurry up, what are you looking at? Move!

146
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,060
Boss, look.

147
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,730
Mr. Chen,

148
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,220
sorry to bother you this early.

149
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,700
That shipment of yours,

150
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,940
my brother took it all.

151
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,370
So let's call that your apology.

152
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,100
Let's quit all the fighting
and violence,

153
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,770
quit acting like street thugs, alright?

154
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,180
And from now on, this freight yard

155
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,820
doesn't have a place for you anymore.

156
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:32,850
So...

157
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,130
it was nice working with you.

158
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,220
Let's go.

159
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,100
Go.

[Hong Liang,
I agree to the second autopsy.]

So,

162
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,530
who's reporting to the leadership,
you or me?

163
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,460
Report what?

164
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,220
Letting them know.

165
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,530
Ask them to send a vehicle.

166
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,060
I checked the timing,

167
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,130
if they leave now, it'll take two hours.

168
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:51,940
Traffic in the city's bad.

169
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,650
By the time I get there,

170
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,580
the memorial might already be over.

171
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,300
We might need to stall a bit.

172
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,010
I'll handle it.

173
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,250
Okay.

174
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,490
Good.

175
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,730
Get up, come with me.

176
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,420
Hong Liang.

177
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,250
I took a chance last night.

178
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,770
The car is already on the way.

179
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,060
Will arrive soon.

180
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,530
How much longer?

181
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,700
Thirty-two minutes.

182
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,580
I'm almost there. Where are you?

183
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,060
On the road, almost there too.

184
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,300
There's something

185
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,060
I need to tell you.

186
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,890
After today's memorial,

187
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,460
there will be a car from us

188
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,060
taking Qiao

189

378
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,180
I can't go back
to the freight yard anymore.

379
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,010
I've done all I could.

380
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,220
From today on,

381
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,980
we're even.

382
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,570
Alright?

383
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,770
Say no more.

384
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,380
Let's drink.

385
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,290
Why did it take me so long
to realize this?

386
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,330
I can't stay in Dongping anymore.

387
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,490
If I keep hanging on here,

388
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,140
I won't even know how I end up dead.

389
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,010
Hong.

390
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,980
I've worked hard here

391
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,250
half my life.

392
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,700
Finally had a place to settle.

393
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,570
But tomorrow,

394
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,380
I have to pack my things

395
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,570
and go back to my hometown.

396
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,050
Let me say something,
don't take it the wrong way,

397
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,220
I envy you.

398
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,900
When you want to leave, you can just go.

399
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,220
I also want to leave,

400
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,530
but I'm drowning in debt, how can I?

401
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,380
I can't go.

402
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,620
Chao.

403
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,220
The goods,

404
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,660
they really were taken by Wang Yu.

405
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,980
It really has nothing
to do with me at all.

406
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,420
If you don't believe me,

407
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,810
go ahead and beat me up.

408
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,290
I won't do that.

409
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,530
What's the point?

410
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:45,860
Uncle,

411
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,180
I thought about it,

412
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,810
dealing with this kind of people,

413
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:53,810
you can't back down.

414
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,290
The more you back down,
the more they walk all over you.

415
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,530
Your Highness, I'm begging you. Okay?

416
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,860
Don't stir up more trouble for me.

417
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,860
Just keep your head down.

418
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,620
Youcai,

419
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,700
tell me, who does this freight yard

420
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,330
belong to now?

421
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,420
Now...

422
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,620
it belongs to Wang.

423
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,620
If Wang Yu won't let
our Wan family survive,

424
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,980
then we won't let him
have it easy either.

425
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,140
As long as there's no court ruling,

426
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,380
this freight station

427
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,860
always belongs to us,

428
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:39,980
not Wang.

429
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,250
My condolences.

430
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,050
I'm really truly sorry.

431
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,250
We've already called the police.

432
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,010
They will be here in a minute.

433
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,250
The two staff members involved

434
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,660
have been detained.

435
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,570
Don't worry.

436
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,570
Our funeral home

437
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,940
will give your family
a full explanation.

438
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,220
This...

439
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,140
Is it Qiao?

440
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,700
Don't move.

441
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,490
Zhou Mei.

442
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,700
Let me take you and the child home.

443
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,420
No need.

444
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,460
Mr. Li.

445
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,700
You wouldn't even let us

446
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,050
hold a memorial,

447
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,050
and now,

448
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,980
you won't even let us
say goodbye to Qiao

449
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,700
one last time?

450
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,220
Let's go.

451
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,090
Qiao.

452
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,940
Let's go home.

453
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,010
I was wrong.

454
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,290
Was I really wrong?

455
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,250
If

456
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,570
I hadn't said yes

457
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,290
this morning,

458
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,770
would I

459
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,660
have gotten to see Qiao one last time?

460
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,050
Give me your phone.

461
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,660
Phone.

462
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,730
Come on, Li Renjun,
don't you understand plain words?

463
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,810
Let me see your phone.

464
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,730
Yes.

465
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,090
Hello, Mr. Li?

466
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,330
Hong Liang called me just now.

467
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,140
The Provincial Procuratorate wants to
do a second autopsy on Qiao Zhenxing.

468
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,770
What's that about?

469
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,330
What?

470
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,900
Wouldn't Qiao's body be cremated today?

471
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,530
I don't know the details.

472
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,860
They said after the ceremony,

473
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,700
a car from the Provincial Procuratorate
would come

474
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,700
and take Qiao's body.

475
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,380
How could they do this?

476
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,420
They're taking him soon,

477
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,380
why are we only being told now?

478
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,380
Alright, enough about this.

479
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,330
Let's talk later.

480
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,620
Hello? Mr. Li?

481
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,010
Stop crying.

482
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,530
Give it to me.

483
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:22,860
What?

484
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:23,980
Your phone.

485
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,010
Why should I give you my phone?

486
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,980
This morning,

487
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,330
I said we needed a second autopsy.

488
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,660
I only told him about it.

489
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,770
And the first thing

490
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,620
he did was call you.

491
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,490
So, show me your phone.

492
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,330
I want to know who you contacted.

493
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,490
Xie, come on, give it to me.

494
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,490
Are you suspecting me?

495
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,940
Cut the cr*p. Hand it over.

496
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,940
You know what?

497
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,050
Lately, everything you people do,

498
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,090
you keep me in the dark.

499
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,900
Like I'm some kind of thief.

500
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,490
Xie.

501
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:56,050
I'm not giving you my phone.

502
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,730
I've had it with you.

503
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,330
You know that?

504
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,770
What are you doing?

505
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,810
What are you doing?

506
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,530
Zheng Yaping
searched for evidence for days.

507
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,900
Everything she looked into
was about Wan Hai.

508
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,290
Never mentioned Zhang Wenjing.

509
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,330
You think we did this?

510
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,690
You don't get to cry!

511
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,780
Zhenxing is your friend

512
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,170
but also mine!

513
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,340
You think we wanted this to happen?

514
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,460
Hong Liang.

515
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,380
Enough already.

516
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,740
Chao.

517
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,460
Auntie Qiu.

518
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,860
Long time no see.

519
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,610
I'm here for our company seal.

520
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:19,420
Give it to me.

521
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,610
That's not appropriate.

522
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,980
Did you get permission from Mr. Wang?

523
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,650
Auntie,

524
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,300
before my dad went in,

525
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,210
did he ever treat you badly?

526
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,820
Mr. Wan was kind to me,

527
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,130
but this is different.

528
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,210
You should talk to Mr. Wang.

529
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:34,940
Who?

530
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,210
As long as Mr. Wang says yes,
I'll hand it over.

531
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,380
Unless the court rules otherwise,

532
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,460
this freight hub still belongs to
our Wan family.

533
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,570
Auntie.

534
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,460
My dad taught me one thing growing up,

535
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,260
never hit women.

536
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,690
So, don't push me.

537
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,050
Don't make it hard.

538
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:55,980
Take it!

539
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,010
What are you doing?

540
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,130
I'll call the police!

541
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,130
What are you doing?

542
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,530
You can't do this!

543
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:01,900
Shut up!

544
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,740
Call the police now!

545
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,170
Chao.

546
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:06,820
Go.

547
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,690
What are you doing?

548
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,940
What are you doing?

549
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,090
Ignore them.

550
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,780
Let's go.

551
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,690
Where do you think you're going?

552
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,940
What's all the yelling?

553
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,260
Mr. Wang, they took the company seal.

554
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,050
Come.

555
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,530
Hand it over! Now!

556
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,460
I mean, kid, how dare you

557
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,650
try to steal that from us?

558
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,690
Who's this?

559
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,420
Isn't that our Wan family's
old watchdog, Wang Yu?

560
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,300
You don't get to call him that!

561
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,940
I'm talking to you.

562
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,900
Don't make me lose patience!

563
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,090
Listen up, Wang Yu,

564
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,690
this place is ours.
