00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,570
I feel

377
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,090
I've let you down.

378
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,620
I thought bringing you
into the Guidance Group

379
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:58,660
might

380
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,730
help make things right,

381
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,700
maybe even clear your name.

382
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,380
But it all turned out to...

383
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,220
to be for nothing.

384
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:07,980
And you've

385
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,380
worked so hard.

386
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,900
I'm truly sorry.

387
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,900
Ms. Zheng.

388
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,420
Ms. Zheng.

389
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,900
Please don't say that.

390
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,050
It's normal

391
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,290
for investigations to hit snags.

392
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,490
To be honest, I feel bad

393
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,940
that I haven't been of much help to you.

394
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,940
No, no, don't say that.

395
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,980
Please don't say that.

396
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,140
Mr. Wang,

397
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,490
I know I've offended you before,

398
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,900
please forgive me.

399
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,490
What are you talking about, Zhang?

400
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,050
You were just doing your job.

401
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,250
I understand.

402
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,010
Me, too.

403
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,290
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

404
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,380
Thank you, Ms. Zheng.

405
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,810
I've been

406
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,940
holding back a lot of things,

407
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,290
and today I want to

408
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,860
let it all out with the help of alcohol.

409
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,810
I want to

410
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,010
apply for a transfer

411
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,220
to First Division,

412
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:56,940
what do you think,

413
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,050
would you take me?

414
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,010
Ms. Zheng,

415
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,660
this kid's got potential.

416
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,010
Besides, only when young people
are passionate about their work

417
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,140
can they truly do it well.

418
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,250
Look at how determined he is.

419
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,460
Just give him a chance.

420
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,050
Ms. Zheng,

421
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,330
a toast to you.

422
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,530
It's not up to me.

423
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,050
You need to improve yourself.

424
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,700
Eleventh Division

425
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,330
is not that bad.

426
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,730
Alright,

427
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,730
enough talk.

428
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,250
Bottoms up!

429
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,220
To...

430
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,380
I wish you all well!

431
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,180
Cheers!

432
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,180
Is everyone full?

433
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,700
Alright then, let's call it a night.

434
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,330
Yeah.

435
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,570
I do have to get home early.

436
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,330
Okay.

437
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,860
Alright.

438
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,810
Zhang, can you give Mr. Wang a ride?

439
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:00,730
Sure.

440
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,460
No problem, ma'am.

441
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,010
Ms. Zheng,

442
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,140
I've really

443
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,570
enjoyed working alongside you

444
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,730
in this period.

445
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:10,730
Thanks.

446
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,140
Say hi to Mrs. Wang for me.

447
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,810
Alright, I'll take Mr. Wang home.

448
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,980
Go!

449
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,250
Mr. Wang, take care.

450
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:34,940
Hong Liang,

451
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,810
we've been buddies
for over twenty years.

452
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,330
How often does life

453
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,490
give you that?

454
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,770
Good mates like that don't come easy,

455
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,460
and one's gone now.

456
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,860
I don't know about you,

457
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,570
but to me,

458
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,940
you're like a brother.

459
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,050
Aren't you leaving for Beijing soon?

460
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,700
Who knows when we'll

461
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,770
see each other again,

462
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,290
or if we ever will.

463
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,050
I guess you don't really want to see me.

464
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,140
So this is goodbye,

465
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,090
okay?

466
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,900
No matter where you go,

467
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,180
I'll be right here.

468
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,660
If you ever need anything,

469
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,620
just tell me.

470
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,570
I'm confident

471
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,090
that I've been just

472
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,940
with the Wan Hai case.

473
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,620
If the Guidance Group

474
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,010
is holding on to the Wan Hai case

475
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,380
because you're embarrassed

476
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,330
about failing in the Zhang Wenjing case,

477
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,380
then please go back to the
Provincial People's Procuratorate

478
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,090
and ask Mr. Zhang to send another
Guidance Group.

479
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,330
I'll fully cooperate
with the new Guidance Group

480
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,180
like I did with the Zhang Wenjing case.

481
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:11,900
Other than that,

482
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,860
don't bring up the Wan Hai case
with me again.

483
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,290
The most important thing to me
is the Wan Hai case.

484
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,530
My position makes it clear,

485
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,860
the Wan Hai case takes top priority.

486
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,220
You're investigating Qiao Zhenxing
just to get to me?

487
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,090
Go on! Investigate me!

488
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,140
I was calling my wife

489
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,050
the other day

490
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,090
and was telling her about

491
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,250
that student council president election

492
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,010
back when we were in school.

493
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,730
Who did Qiao Zhenxing vote for?

494
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,380
Li Renjun.

495
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,140
And who did Li Renjun vote for?

496
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,180
Li Renjun as well.

497
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,940
I've been joking about this
for twenty years.

498
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,090
After twenty years,

499
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,420
aren't you curious

500
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,620
who I voted for?

501
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,570
I'll tell you.

502
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,900
No, I'm not curious.

503
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,810
I don't care who you voted for.

504
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,900
What matters is that the student council
made significant progress

505
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,180
after I became the president.

506
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,490
Just like now,

507
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,050
it doesn't matter to me how you see me.

508
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,860
What truly matters

509
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,660
is that I'll soon
be officially appointed

510
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,700
as the Prosecutor-General

511
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,290
of the Dongping People's Procuratorate,

512
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,810
and I'll uphold justice

513
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,730
and the rule of law better than ever.

514
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,700
This isn't

515
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,940
just my oath as a prosecutor,

516
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,220
but what I truly believe in.

517
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:57,940
Good luck.

518
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,090
It's pointless telling you this.

519
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:10,860
Safe travels.

520
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,620
When are you leaving?

521
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,810
It's fine.

522
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,250
I can stay with you a bit longer.

523
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,940
I mean when are you resigning?

524
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,980
Weren't you going to be a lawyer?

525
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,570
I haven't decided yet.

526
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,730
Yeah, you do need to think it through.

527
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,140
Young people gotta be cautious

528
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,730
when looking for jobs,

529
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,860
just like with dating.

530
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:35,940
Ms. Zheng,

531
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,860
you must really dislike me.

532
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,940
You can tell?

533
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,570
Why would I dislike you,

534
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,460
silly?

535
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,530
I know,

536
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,330
I'm not as smart as Mr. Hong,

537
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,900
or as experienced and insightful

538
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,860
as Mr. Wang.

539
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,730
And compared with Zhang,

540
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,490
even though we're both young,

541
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,660
he's much more focused

542
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,660
and enthusiastic.

543
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,380
I'm nowhere near him.

544
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,050
Ms. Zheng,

545
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,460
I have obtained four certificates,

546
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,700
but

547
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,180
I still don't know what I want to do.

548
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,660
I just want to leave here.

549
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,620
Don't take it the wrong way,

550
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,180
but I just don't want to live
so constrained like you.

551
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,220
I want to be able to
afford nice clothes,

552
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,220
and nice makeup,

553
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,250
I...

554
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,140
You want to make more money.

555
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,620
There's nothing wrong with
wanting to make more money.

556
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,730
I want that too!

557
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,490
Nobody's better or worse for it.

558
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,900
Honestly, Ziyan,

559
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,460
life is your own.

560
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,570
Find a way that works for you

561
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,940
and make the best of it.

562
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,460
I respect your choice.

563
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,330
You've been with me for a long time,

to high standards,

or what you do,

you'll do it brilliantly.

Sweetie,

575
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,220
you're home!

576
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,530
Be careful!

why didn't you tell me
you were coming back?

C'mon, let's go inside!

What's with your belly?

590
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,660
Has the mayor been dragging you
out drinking again?

591
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,220
Stop it!

Hey, I'm serious,

593
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,530
I'll have words with him

594
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,330
if he takes you drinking again.

595

Alright, got it.

no more drinking.

Not bad, huh?

682
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,650
there's a little problem,

686
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:19,980
if Dou

687
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,570
goes to school in Beijing

688
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,010
and Min works there too,

689
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,210
won't it be hard for you to live alone

Don't worry, Mom,

693
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,900
I've got a solid plan

694
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,940

00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,900
So,

699
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,570
lately,

700
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,130
I've gained

701
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,780
some new perspective on life.

702
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,010
The inspiration

703
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,690
came from a woman in my department

704
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,090
who retired last year.

705
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,420
We were chatting the other day...

706
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,260
What are you doing, Mom?

707
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,210
I'm posting this on social media.

708
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,860
Why are you posting it?

709
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,170
I want to show off to my friends

710
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,420
how handsome my son is.

711
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,130
What's there to show off?

712
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,090
It's not often you come home in uniform.

713
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,010
Listen, Mom,

714
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,210
my office doesn't know I came back.

715
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,690
And since I'm in uniform,

716
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,740
if you post this,

717
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,940
and my superior sees it,

718
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,940
they'll ask
why I didn't report my leave.

719
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,050
I could get in serious trouble.

720
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:30,900
Oh, that's right.

721
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,460
You're right.

722
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,210
So please.

723
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,260
Fine, fine.

724
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,300
I'll delete it.

725
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,980
Will you

726
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,610
delete your post too?

727
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:38,740
But I...

728
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,490
Oh my, you sent it to the mayor?

729
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,690
You traded my photo for drinks?

730
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,490
Seriously, do I have to

731
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,610
watch you all the time?

732
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,530
Take it back!

733
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,340
Fine, fine.

734
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:49,940
But...

735
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,610
You...

736
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,780
you're just gonna take away our phones?

737
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,210
Lately, I've gained
some new perspective on life,

738
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,650
inspired by something

739
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,380
my former colleague said
before she retired.

740
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:00,900
She told me

741
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,530
she regrets

742
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,610
not trying new things

743
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,460
or going to a new place

744
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,900
to embrace the world and her true self

745
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,940
while she was still young.

746
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,610
That gave me a lot to think about.

747
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,860
About what?

748
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,650
Since Min is in Beijing,

749
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,340
and Dou is going there too,

750
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,820
I'm planning to move to Beijing

751
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,170
as well.

752
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,570
You mean working
at Beijing's Procuratorate?

753
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,530
Yes, in Beijing,
but not the Procuratorate.

754
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,340
I'll still be working in law,

755
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,690
staying

756
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,860
in my field,

757
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,650
as general counsel

758
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,380
at a

759
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,490
state-owned company.

760
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,490
But, sweetie,

761
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,780
does that mean

762
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,690
you'll be taking off

763
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,260
this uniform?

764
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,530
Strictly speaking,

765
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,090
this is the last time

766
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,530
I wear this uniform

767
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,940
in front of you.

768
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,690
Sweetie,

769
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,490
it was already hard for you

770
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,690
to come home

771
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,610
when you were living in Haizhou,

772
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,340
if your whole family

773
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,820
moves to Beijing,

774
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,340
when will I get to see you all again?

775
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,260
See that slide by the door?

776
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,780
Dou's only played on it once

777
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,980
since your dad bought it.

778
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,690
Your dad cleans it every day,

779
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,460
waiting for you to come back.

780
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,420
Sweetie,

781
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,050
did Min ask you to go be with her?

782
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,460
You've been married for many years,

783
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,090
can't you talk to her

784
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,980
about transferring back?

785
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,690
Sweetie, you've had this job
for 18 years.

786
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,980
Can you really let it go?

787
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,900
Are you truly okay with that?

788
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,170
I'm really okay with it.

789
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,300
Different stages of life

790
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,860
require different roles.

791
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,010
Plus, moving to Beijing

792
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,650
doesn't mean we won't come back,

793
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,740
or that you guys can't come visit us.

794
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,940
If you

795
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,780
don't want me to buy another slide,

796
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,570
I'll just take this one apart

797
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,740
and bring it to Beijing.

798
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,050
Besides, it's expensive
to raise a kid these days.

799
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,380
The new company is offering me

800
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,130
triple the salary.

801
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,940
I'd be a fool to say no to that.

802
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,130
But, hold on a minute,

803
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,010
what you're saying,

804
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,490
have... have you already done it

805
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,300
or it's just a plan?

806
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,780
It's just a plan.

807
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,650
Why are you staring at me like that?

808
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,820
I've already

809
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,380
submitted

810
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,690
my resignation,

811
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,050
I'm just waiting
for my superior's approval.

812
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:55,860
Stop crying!

813
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,050
Liang,

814
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,820
you've always

815
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,740
excelled in school

816
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,460
since you were a kid.

817
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,420
From elementary to middle school,

818
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,490
from high school to college,

819
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,300
and to grad school—

820
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,860
you never missed a beat.

821
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,300
After graduation,
you passed the civil service exam,

822
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,170
and earned this uniform.

823
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,780
It wasn't easy for you

824
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,090
to get here.

825
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,530
You brought honor to this family,

826
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,740
and both your mom and I

827
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,380
are so proud of you.

828
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,090
It's not easy to earn this uniform.

829
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,780
Can you really take it off this easily?

830
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,900
Don't give us this

831
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,690
"wearing the uniform

832
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,940
one last time for us" act.

833
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,690
So you're gonna take it off?

834
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,130
Then do it now.

835
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,420
Go ahead!

836
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,050
Take it off!

837
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,210
Pick it up!

838
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,170
Pick it up!

839
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,610
Hang it properly!

840
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,530
Do... do you think you're only

841
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,740
wearing that uniform for yourself?

842
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,380
You're a role model
for our whole village,

843
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,090
do you realize that?

844
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,340
You're taking it off just like that?

845
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,460
How will people think of you?

846
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,300
How will they think of me?

847
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,780
Or our family?

848
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,210
What kind of family will we be then?

849
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,820
You are a family with honor!

850
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,300
Liang.

851
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,650
Mayor.

852
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,050
You're back!

853
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,210
Why didn't you say anything?

854
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,490
Let's have a drink at my place later.

855
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,380
Mr. Hong,

856
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,740
why did you

857
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,090
retract the photo

858
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,010
you just sent me?

859
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:44,860
Hong Liang

860
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,740
is the pride of our village.

861
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,380
We gotta let him shine,

862
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,130
right?

863
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,780
Do you not know how to take photos?

864
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,260
Hong Yi!

865
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:56,650
Liang.

866
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:57,940
Mr. Hong.

867
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,300
The lighting here is no good.

868
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,260
Let's go take a photo outside.

869
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,010
Yeah, let's go outside.

870
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:03,460
C'mon.

871
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,090
Why did you take off your jacket?

872
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:07,900
It's too warm.

873
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,900
You gotta wear your uniform
for the photo!

874
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,170
Put it back on.

875
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,460
Come on.

876
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,210
Put it on!

877
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,210
Put it on!

878
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:05,900
You look great!

879
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,130
So handsome! Let's go.

880
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:07,490
Perfect!

881
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,460
Let's go.

882
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,860
Let's go outside.

883
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,820
C'mon, Liang.

884
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,530
- Let's go take a photo outside!
- C'mon, let's go outside!

885
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,530
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming back?

886
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,570
We're drinking at my place tonight!

887
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:19,690
Mr. Yan,

888
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,570
the Guidance Group

889
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,570
has retreated as per your instructions.

890
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:24,900
The moment

891
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,090
we found some leads, we were cut off.

892
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,050
Every time we tried to dig deeper,

893
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,010
someone would pull strings to stop us.

894
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,210
You know why?

895
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,490
Because they've got power.

896
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,490
The Central Political

897
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,090
and Legal Affairs Commission

898
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,900
wants us

899
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,490
to be thorough,

900
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:44,090
to think long-term

901
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,530
and aim bigger.

902
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,460
Next time,

903
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,490
we'll take the whole pot!
