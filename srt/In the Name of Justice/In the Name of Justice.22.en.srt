this and that.

141
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,540
Didn't bring us in.

00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,460
Don't hit me!

195
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:12,850
I dare you…

196
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,370
- I'm sorry!
- Thief!

197
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,340
Thief!

198
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,340
You dare steal from us?

199
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,940
I… I'm sorry.

200
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,060
Now you're sorry?

201
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,580
Too late!

202
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,460
Where are you from?

203
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:29,850
Where's your family?

204
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,890
I don't have one.

205
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,250
Why not?

206
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,980
My dad's dead.

207
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,420
My mom…

208
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,980
I don't know where she went.

209
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,730
Enough.

210
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,980
Don't waste your breath on him.

211
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,340
Just take him to the police.

212
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,490
Make the call.

213
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,300
Didn't you hear me?

214
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,250
Mr. Yu,

215
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,300
can we let him stay?

216
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,300
Stay?

217
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,730
He's a thief.

218
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,650
You want him to stay?

219
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,700
Mr. Yu,

220
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,850
I'll watch him.

221
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:07,770
I'll make sure

222
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,730
he'll never

223
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,180
steal again.

224
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,100
Get him cleaned up.

225
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:34,730
Yes.

226
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,460
I keep that in my heart.

227
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,250
What do you mean?

228
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,890
You want me

229
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,420
to choose

230
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,460
between you

231
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,460
and Mr. Yu?

232
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,300
Is that what you mean?

233
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,420
Exactly.

234
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,490
Captain Liu…!

235
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,700
We're not mining!

236
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,700
The seal's still on!

237
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,300
Wan Chao.

238
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,300
Who are you?

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,850
You don't need to know.

240
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,460
You know this is illegal, right?

241
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,980
Stop it now!

242
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,060
Who do you think you are

243
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,420
to tell me what to do?

244
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,700
Wait a minute!

245
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,060
Wait!

246
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,130
Wait!

247
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,130
Get down there and bring the workers up!

248
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:29,820
Yes!

249
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,940
What the hell are you doing?

250
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,300
I'm telling you,

251
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,610
I've already called the cops!

252
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,130
They'll be here any minute!

253
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,220
Get the hell out,
or you'll all go to jail!

254
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,300
Bro.

255
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,180
It'll be a mess if the cops come.

256
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,460
Calm down.

257
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,250
Chill out.

258
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,300
Bro…

259
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,420
Calm down.

260
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,340
- I dare you!
- Just go.

261
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:49,770
Go.

262
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:55,610
Chao.

263
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,140
Chao, are you okay?

264
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,690
Uncle,

265
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,530
you can't call the police.

266
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,820
We're illegally mining.

267
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,060
Silly boy, would I really call them?

268
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,220
If I hadn't said that,
would they have left?

269
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,610
It hurts.

270
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,890
It hurts.

271
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:13,890
Bro.

272
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,490
Think about it.

273
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,580
Don't you feel like

274
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,370
Mr. Yu's not thinking straight anymore?

275
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,580
Back then,

276
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,300
if I hadn't knocked him out,

277
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,370
let you carry him away,

278
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,610
and I went to jail for him instead,

279
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,890
would he even have had all this now?

280
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,340
Would he have had this mine?

281
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,770
This feels amazing!

282
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,460
Mr. Yu, I love you!

283
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,730
Slow down.

284
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,460
Mr. Yu!

285
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,300
Slow down.

286
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,180
Let's go!

287
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,130
Slow down.

288
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,300
It's really different

289
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,250
to drive after a few drinks.

290
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,700
He's totally drunk.

291
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,010
But you're not.

292
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,890
Speed up.

293
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,490
Pass him.

294
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,010
Slow down…

295
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,940
Brake!

296
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,610
Mr. Yu, feeling good?

297
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,610
Slow down…!

298
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:00,980
Mr. Yu…

299
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,700
what now?

300
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,850
Get off.

301
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,010
Go over there.

302
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,490
Hurry up.

303
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,820
Come, help him.

304
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,370
Get him over there.

305
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,460
Out.

306
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,420
Hurry up.

307
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,490
Stop crying!

308
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,490
Get in there.

309
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,530
Uncle Yu,

310
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,250
what do we do, Uncle Yu?

311
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:28,940
Don't cry.

312
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,460
Uncle Yu.

313
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,890
Stop crying! Stop!

314
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:32,890
Mr. Yu, what are you doing?

315
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,060
What are you doing?

316
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,250
She's dead. You'll go to jail!

317
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,220
Let me take the fall!

318
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,980
I'll do time for it!

319
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,650
Let me!

320
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,060
Get out of here!

321
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,460
Pull him out, quick!

322
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,580
Mr. Yu, you can't take the fall for this!

323
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,530
Go away!

324
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,220
Come with me!

325
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,100
Leave it!

326
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,820
Don't be angry.

327
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,530
Let go of me!

328
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,180
Are you crazy?

329
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,610
He won't blame us.

330
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,730
This means real prison time.

331
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,460
Stay out of it!

332
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,460
Let me take the fall!

333
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,250
I'll take it!

334
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,530
Get him in the car, hurry!

335
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:57,580
Hurry.

336
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,460
Hurry.

337
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,370
This phone

338
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,650
is my life.

339
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,570
Keep it safe for me

340
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,050
until I get out.

341
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,420
Give me your phone!

342
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:10,810
Go…

343
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,460
Are you serious…?

344
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:11,860
Go!

345
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,490
Go!

346
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,700
Hurry!

347
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,380
Pull yourself together!

348
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,810
I was the one driving,

349
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,940
not you!

350
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,460
Yes…

351
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,770
It was you. You hit her.

352
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,530
I didn't kill anyone.

353
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,050
You killed her.

354
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,140
I didn't kill her.

355
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,860
I didn't kill anyone.

356
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,490
I was in a car accident.

357
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,290
Did I go to jail for Mr. Yu?

358
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,490
I did it for Jiang Yuan, that bastard!

359
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,420
Haven't I done enough?

360
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,570
Long,

361
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,420
how did it come to this
between us and Mr. Yu?

362
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,050
If we really do it,

363
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,810
we're done with him.

364
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,900
It's over.

365
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,660
There's no going back.

366
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,700
We can't go back anyway.

367
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,220
I finally see it now.

368
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,770
We're just servants

369
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,140
to him.

370
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,220
We have been his loyal servants

371
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,460
for twenty years.

372
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,010
I want to be myself now.

373
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,140
You call that being yourself?

374
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,420
You're being an ingrate.

375
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,620
So what?

376
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,530
What else can I do?

377
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,420
Bro,

378
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,380
think about it.

379
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,980
If we let Jiang Yuan take the mine,

380
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,490
and Mr. Yu retires,

381
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,980
can the two of us even stay in Dongping?

382
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,140
You have a waste treatment plant.

383
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,900
I have Tianlong Company.

384
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,290
But will we still have good days?

385
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,770
This is not betrayal.

386
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,940

391

Okay.

392
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,570
Wang Yu, right?

393
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,010
This way, please.

394
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,730
Hello.

Hello…

396

Mr. Li.

397
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,660
Isn't this Mr. Li?

Our hero.

399
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,220
Thank you

400
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,730
for getting rid of a bully
for Dongping.

401
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,010
If it weren't for you,

402
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,050

been long gone from my hands.

413
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,570
Yes.

414
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,090
Wait, why are you recording this?

415
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,250
So formal.

416
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,220
Isn't the case closed already?

00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,490
It's part of our procedure.

418

The Wan Hai case.

421

We asked you here today

422
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,460
mainly to ask about your connection

423
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,700
with people from Tianlong Company.

424
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,980
Tianlong Company? Yeah.

425
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,290
Isn't their

426
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,940
general counsel Cheng Zijian?

427
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,250
Isn't he

428
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,460
your brother-in-law?

429
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,290
Are you close?

430
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,250
Sort of.

431
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,250
We've done business together.

432
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,660
Over time, of course we got familiar.

433
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,010
Besides, in Dongping,

434
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,010

435
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,570
between Cheng Zijian
and the prosecutor-general,

436
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,460
how can you even survive
in this city, right?

437
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,490
Tell us about your interactions.

438
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,460
What…

439
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,860
what interactions?

440
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,380
We just…

441
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,220
do business.

442
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,730
He came to buy, and I sold.

443
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,860
Is that… is that a crime now?

444
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,010
When was it?

445
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,220
That was

446
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,900
years ago.

447
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,220
About three years.

448
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,730
At that time,

449
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,570
three years ago,

450
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,900
wasn't Wan Hai the owner
of the Freight Hub?

451
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,050
Why would they come to you

452
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,460
instead of the actual owner?

453
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:34,900
Well,

454
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,620
because I was the one

455
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:37,940
managing the hub.

456
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,660
I knew the business.

457
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,940
Isn't a buyout

458
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,250
just a deal?

459
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,420
If the price is right, it gets done.

460
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,180
That Freight Hub…

461
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,490
Wan Hai locked you up and beat you

462
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,730
until you agreed to sell it to him
at a low price.

463
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,220
So why did you

464
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,730
still choose to work for him?

465
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,460
Wait,

466
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,940
what are you getting at here?

467
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,140
Let me lay it out for you.

468
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,620
The first person who reported
Wan Hai's a gangster

469
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:20,860
was you.

470
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,330
The one who provided
the evidence against him,

471
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,290
also you.

472
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,220
Am I right?

473
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,700
And you testified in court.

474
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,250
After Wan Hai got convicted,

475
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,620
the biggest beneficiary was still you.

476
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,050
Now the Freight Hub
is back in your hands.

477
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,010
The facts are clear.

478
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,530
Here is the procuratorate.

479
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:40,900
You are not called in

480
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,570
for no reason.

481
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,860
We're already well aware

482
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,620
that you couldn't have done this alone.

483
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,530
Someone in the system helped you.

484
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,660
Someone made introductions.

485
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,860
Someone provided the money.

486
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,140
Someone did the dirty work.

487
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,140
So, Wang Yu, we called you in,

488
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,770
because we want you to come clean.

489
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,700
This is your chance.

490
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,660
But chances,

491
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,010
once missed, are gone for good.

492
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,900
If we find out everything ourselves,

493
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,530
you won't be sitting here

494
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,290

495
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,250
Understand?

496
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,180
Understand what?

497
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,530
What do you want?

498
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,490
And you're filming this, for what?

499
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,810
Trying to overturn the case?

500
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,050
I'm the whistleblower.

501
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,900
I reported him for
being in organized crime.

502
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,250
Is this how you treat whistleblowers?

503
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,010
You're turning this back on me?

504
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,810
Accusing me?

505
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,660
Listen, Li…

506
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,530
Mr. Li,

507
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,770
can you say Wan Hai isn't a gangster?

508
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,290
Do you have evidence?

509
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,810

I'm in the procuratorate, so?

516
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,460

show me the proof.

517

00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,420
Then go rescue them!

578
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,330
Calm down. Listen to me.

579
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,460
I've called the cops,

580
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,700
they'll be here soon.

581
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,290
We still have to rescue them!

582
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,660
Calm down!

583
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,660
Calm down!

584
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,660
Listen to me!

585
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,330
You're the legal representative.

586
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,250
If anyone dies,
you'll be held responsible.

587
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,250
You might end up in prison!

588
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,570
I already told Wan Hong to come over.

589
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,940
We've got this.

590
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,090
You leave now.

591
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,460
Or when the police get here,
you won't be able to.

592
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,530
Go, hurry.

593
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,180
Hurry.

594
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,620
Hang on.

595
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,290
Take the back roads.

596
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,140
Don't go on the main road.

597
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,050
Go!

598
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,570
Officer, up there!

599
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,380
Hurry up.

600
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,530
Jin,

601
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,620
tell the Control Center

602
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,460
we've arrived at the scene.

603
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,900
Copy.

604
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,330
Yang Jing,

605
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,050
lead the team.

606
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:29,810
Take control of the scene.

607
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,250
Okay.

608
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:31,860
Keep up.

609
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,010
Hurry.

610
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,420
This way.

611
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,180
This way.

612
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,900
This way.

613
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,290
Officer,

614
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,290
hurry up, here.

615
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,330
- Police.
- Hurry up.

616
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,010
Hurry!

617
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,660
Hurry!

618
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,090
Over here.

619
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:07,860
Move!

620
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,940
Help rescue the injured.

621
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,860
Jin, Yang Jing,

622
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,860
find the person in charge.

623
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,220
Yes, sir.

624
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,860
Control Center…

625
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,700
Call 120 to the site immediately!

626
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,050
Hurry!

627
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,620
Come on.

628
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,380
Haven't had time to ask,

629
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,380
did you return that house?

630
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,490
What do you want to be when you grow up?

631
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,690
Study law. Become a prosecutor.

632
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,980
Renjun,

633
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,210
your son says he wants to study law

634
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,170
and be a prosecutor one day.

635
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,260
Hear that?

636
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,690
You can't study that.

637
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,170
Look at your dad, can't stop

638
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,490
thinking about cases even at home.

639
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,780
- Learn from Auntie.
- Go wash your hands.

640
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:41,820
Be a journalist.

641
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,490
Come on.

642
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,570
You seem distracted. What's wrong?

643
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,300
Ah…

644
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,210
nothing.

645
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,090
These two days,

646
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,090
I'm a bit out of it.

647
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,530
Keep thinking about

648
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,570
when I first joined
the Municipal Procuratorate.

649
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,650
Back then,

650
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,130
I swore

651
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,260
I'd become the prosecutor-general.

652
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,130
It's been over a decade,

653
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,740
now that it's finally happened,

654
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,740
I feel kind of empty inside.

655
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,300
You're just nervous.

656
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,780
You'll be fine in a bit.

657
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,460
Auntie, let's eat.

658
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,090
Okay.

659
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,650
Come on.

660
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,130
Please take your seat.

661
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,050
Here.

662
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,340
The seat of honor.

663
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,170
Sitting here makes me feel
ten years older.

664
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:28,980
Where's the kid?

665
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,460
Well, you're the head of the family.

666
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,260
Actually, we're just
having dinner together

667
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,210
as a family.

668
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,530
No need for this fancy title.

669
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:36,690
How could I not?

670
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,860
You've been promoted
to be prosecutor-general

671
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,170
and can't go out drinking
with your coworkers.

672
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,780
We should at least
celebrate properly at home.

673
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,420
Little rituals make life feel special.

674
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,900
Am I right, prosecutor-general's wife?

675
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,460
Stop it.

676
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,420
But it's been a while
since we got together.

677
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,130
Auntie,

678
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,780
say a few words,

679
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,570
then we'll raise our glasses.

680
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,820
Me again?

681
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,900
She always says I sound too official.

682
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,740
Today, I'm just here for the free food.

683
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,460
Um…

684
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,260
Renjun, you say something.

685
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,610
Why don't you return to the house
in Dadu Xishan?

686
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,170
Li Renjun, what's your problem?

687
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,690
Are you still going on about this?

688
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,340
Didn't I tell you?

689
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,090
It's not like we didn't pay for it.

690
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,980
What are you afraid of?

691
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,380
You oversee Tianlong Company
in the development zone.

692
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,530
And I just got promoted.

693
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,570
You can't take that house

694
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,530
at such a steep discount.

695
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,130
You just got appointed,

696
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,570
and you're already lecturing me?

697
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:34,860
Zijian, you tell him.

698
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,050
Was that price just for me?

699
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,170
Of course not, sister-in-law.

700
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,690
Ms. Lan, Renjun,

701
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,900
they dropped the price
to clear inventory.

702
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,420
Anyone would get the same price.

703
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,530
Hear that?

704
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,210
Same price for anyone,

705
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,210
why can't I buy it?

706
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,210
Anyone else can buy it,

707
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,130
just not us.

708
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,940
Why?

709
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,780
Renjun was right.

710
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,780
Anyone can buy it, except you.

711
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:57,570
Auntie…

712
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,900
Come on, let's eat.

713
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,820
We asked you to say something good.

714
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,420
Why'd you have to bring that up?

715
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,900
You don't understand. Don't interrupt.

716
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,900
I'm serious.

717
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,130
You've ruined the dinner.

718
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,780
Come on, let's have a drink.

719
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,860
Yes, let's drink.

720
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,980
Sister, don't be mad.

721
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:14,420
Come on.

722
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,490
Cheers, Renjun.

723
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,860
What's wrong with you?

724
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,260
So annoying.

725
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,490
Hello?

726
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:21,460
Hello?

727
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,010
Everyone, make way!

728
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,170
The ambulance's here.

729
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,260
Make way!

730
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,490
Make way.

731
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,780
Everyone, step back.

732
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,340
Make way.

733
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,050
Let the car through.

734
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,650
Everyone, back down.

735
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:55,570
Captain An.

736
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:56,820
How many of you are here?

737
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,460
Thirty people.

738
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,130
What's the situation inside the mine?

739
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,690
The cage fell down.

740
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,460
How many people are down there?

741
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,170
Fifteen, as far as we know.

742
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,650
How many ambulances are on site?

743
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,610
Five, so far.

744
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,380
Not enough. Dispatch more.

745
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,010
OK, Mr. Xu.

746
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,420
Where's the mine manager?

747
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,340
He's helping manage the situation.

748
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,610
- You go help.
- Can the rescue ladder be lowered?

749
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:12,940
Okay.

750
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,090
No, the mine's too deep.

751
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,460
Rope.

752
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,610
Can we send people down by rope?

753
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,690
Ropes won't reach either.

754
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:20,860
What's going on?

755
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,530
Wasn't this mine sealed?

756
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,570
They were mining in secret.

757
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,740
- Do you copy?
- Captain Wang.

758
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,490
Mr. Wang is here.

759
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,380
Mr. Wang.

760
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,090
Sir.

761
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,170
Mr. Wang.

762
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,300
Where is the accident site?

763
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,120
Up there.

764
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,880
[Wang Jianning
Party Secretary and Mayor of Dongping]

765
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,460
