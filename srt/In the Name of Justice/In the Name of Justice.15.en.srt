[Fu Bing's Law Firm]

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,250
Do you know what it felt like

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,650
to stand at the defense table?

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,490
This Zhang Wenjing,
she's nothing but a shyster.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,650
She kept holding onto a false hope,

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,050
thinking that if she made enough noise,
she might get something out of it.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,580
But I didn't do anything.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,170
It was you who forced me

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,620
into that courtroom as a defendant.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,490
Justice means

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,810
the innocent should be spared
from wrongful accusations,

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,810
and the guilty should be
punished accordingly.

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,370
We don't operate on the principle

14
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,010
that anyone we catch
counts as a conviction.

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,180
But before a bigger mistake was made,

16
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,980
we uncovered the truth

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,690
and restored justice to you.

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,050
What justice you're giving me?

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,620
What innocence did you restore?

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,940
The outcome
of the Guidance Group's investigation

21
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,450
tested our case-handling capability.

22
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,980
It also proved that
we can address issues

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,410
with a factual, professional
legal mindset.

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,820
This was an extreme insult

25
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,130
to my character and my career.

[Episode 15]

28
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,450
Ms. Lan,

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,380
do you think

30
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,170
this will affect

31
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,130
how the higher-ups view
the entire Wan Hai case?

32
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,660
Two prosecutors-in-charge in a row
had issues,

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,850
and now there's the Zhang Wenjing case,

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,380
this could very well be escalating.

35
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,380
You tell me if it'll have
an impact or not.

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,500
Hypothetically,

37
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,010
even if Zhang Wenjing was framed,

38
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,130
I believe

39
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,010
it was likely due to Xie Hongfei's
personal misconduct.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,410
You,

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,170
as the supervisor,

42
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,940
do bear some responsibility
for inadequate oversight.

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,890
But I don't think

44
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,780
it will affect the overall outcome
of the Wan Hai case.

45
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,730
You have to have confidence
in the whole case.

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,290
What if

47
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,340
someone insists

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,060
on holding onto this matter

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,290
and wants to merge the two cases?

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,820
We still have to stick to the facts.

51
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,540
Trust the Guidance Group,

52
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,220
they will make the right call.

53
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,260
Now that it's come to this,

54
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,690
we'll self-inspect immediately.

55
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,890
If Zhang Wenjing is indeed innocent,

56
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,340
release her immediately.

57
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,570
Clear her name.

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,850
You know what to do next.

59
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,570
I came today

60
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,010
to tell you,

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,980
your son has been picked up
by your brother.

62
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,540
He's safe now.

63
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:02,940
Thank you.

64
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,450
There's one more thing

65
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,730
we need your help with.

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,900
If the Guidance Group
comes to you again,

67
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,540
just say that you blamed Zhang Wenjing

68
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,660
to lessen your sentence.

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,220
You framed her.

70
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,850
Zhang Wenjing

71
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,980
is off the hook now?

72
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,250
What about my reduced sentence?

73
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,050
How many more 'favors'

74
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,100
do you need from me?

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,050
Even if I say she's clean,

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,900
will they believe me?

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,490
You don't need to worry about that.

78
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,780
Just say what we told you to.

79
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,250
Mr. Zhang, this is Zheng Yaping.

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,730
Hello, sir, I am Hong Liang.

81
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,100
Go ahead.

82
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,610
On behalf of the Guidance Group,

83
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,020
we're reporting our findings so far.

84
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,290
Currently, the Zhang Wenjing case,
Qiao Zhenxing case,

85
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,340
and the Wan Hai case
all contain major doubts.

86
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,850
Based on recent events

87
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,610
in Dongping

88
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,140
and the leads we've uncovered,

89
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,100
we have some early assessments.

90
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,580
Go on.

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,850
Our investigation suggests

92
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,340
Xie Hongfei, the prosecutor-in-charge,

93
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,730
may have abused his power.

94
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,780
The witnesses accusing Wan Hai
of being a gangster

95
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,220
may have given false testimony.

96
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,100
At the same time,
Zhang Wenjing's charges

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,140
may have been exaggerated.

98
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,580
And another issue is,

99
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,580
each time we uncover a lead,

100
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,780
someone inside

101
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,900
leaks it.

102
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,780
So before we verify all these problems,

103
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:15,930
we recommend

104
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,930
applying to delay the trial

105
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,700
of the Wan Hai case.

106
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,460
Mr. Zhang,

107
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,490
please give us some more time

108
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,020
to thoroughly investigate Wan Hai

109
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,410
and related cases.

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,980
Mr. Zhang?

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,460
Mr. Zhang.

112
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,170
Dongping's situation

113
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,900
is indeed complicated.

114
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,050
I'm aware of what's going on.

115
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,100
Renjun is here

116
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,460
reporting to me now.

117
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,780
You wait for my instructions.

118
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,540
Alright?

119
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,050
Mr. Zhang,

120
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,580
the escalation
of the Zhang Wenjing case

121
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,730
has made

122
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,140
many higher-level officials

123
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,900
disappointed in me and
in the city office.

124
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,540
For this matter,

125
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,610
I did take it too lightly.

126
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,170
It was negligence on my part.

127
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,220
I take full responsibility.

128
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,700
I'm willing to accept

129
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,810
any criticism.

130
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,100
Don't jump to conclusions yet.

131
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,730
The current focus
remains the first trial

132
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,780
of the Wan Hai case.

133
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,930
Wan Hai case

134
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,250
can't afford another mistake like this.

135
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,020
Yes.

136
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,490
But I think

137
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,250
we need

138
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,340
a balanced view.

139
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,930
The Zhang Wenjing case is one thing,

140
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,850
the Wan Hai case is another.

141
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,850
Though they're related,

142
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,370
they can be handled separately.

143
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,610
Mr. Zhang.

144
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,730
I believe

145
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,580
an error in the Zhang Wenjing case

146
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,900
doesn't mean
the entire Wan Hai case is flawed.

147
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,020
I can say this

148
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,370
because I trust my colleagues.

149
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,220
Our Dongping legal team

150
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,660
has worked hard

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,100
and made sacrifices

152
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,250
over the last two years.

153
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,980
Handling this case is a joint effort,

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,650
it wasn't easy.

155
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,820
Jing Ming,

156
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,610
you came late at night for tea,

157
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,130
I know what you mean.

158
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,650
However,

159
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,980
I've been away from
the system for years.

160
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,890
About this case,

161
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,890
I truly

162
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,700
can't say much.

163
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,060
No, sir,

164
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,250
I'm not here

165
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,370
for myself or anyone else.

166
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,490
I'm here for Dongping.

167
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,850
I remember when you worked here,

168
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,530
you said, "Whatever benefits
Dongping's development,

169
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,100
our leaders must

170
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,700
push forward

171
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,340
at all costs."

172
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,770
Your word

173
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,180
has always guided my work.

174
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,770
I understand your dedication
to Dongping.

175
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,820
But this Guidance Group,

176
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,940
they have their own procedures.

177
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,460
That's something
you must also understand.

178
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,060
I do.

179
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,460
Ever since the Guidance Group arrived,

180
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,340
Dongping's case-handling organs

181
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,580
have fully cooperated.

182
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,610
But, sir,

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,770
the Wan Hai case

184
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,700
is about to go to trial.

185
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,130
If they keep holding on to this case,

186
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,130
I'm afraid two and a half years
of hard work

187
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,100
by the Dongping legal system

188
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,820
might be all discarded.

189
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,610
In the past two years,

190
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,580
Dongping's political and legal system
has done well

191
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,820
under your leadership.

192
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,370
I believe

193
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,730
it can withstand scrutiny and testing.

194
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,980
I just worry that
correcting mistakes too harshly

195
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,250
might dampen morale

196
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,700
and affect future work.

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,490
I know

198
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,580
Dongping Municipal Procuratorate
has invested a lot

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,850
for over two years.

200
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,370
This case only came this far

201
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,820
thanks to everyone's effort.

202
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,940
And because of that,

203
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,580
our future work

204
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,730
should be more cautious.

205
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:32,850
Right?

206
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,730
Mr. Zhang, you are right.

207
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,300
Lately,

208
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,460
I've clearly felt

209
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,820
our comrades'

210
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,650
confidence

211
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,250
and morale

212
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,980
have all been affected
to some extent.

213
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,730
In this critical period,

214
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,370
I really hope

215
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,130
no one gets upset

216
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,060
or loses their drive.

217
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,820
Xie Hongfei

218
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,890
may have issues.

219
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,940
Have they found solid evidence?

220
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,300
Tell us if they have.

221
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,300
We'll handle it accordingly.

222
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,420
But if they haven't,

223
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,490
why won't they let it go?

224
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,820
This unclear mess,

225
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,610
how are we supposed to take it?

226
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,530
Many comrades may stay silent,

227
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,490
but I don't know
what they think about it.

228
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,530
I've known Hong Liang

229
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,580
for many years.

230
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,060
I know his temperament

231
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,060
and style.

232
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,460
Supporting the Guidance Group

233
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,770
is our duty.

234
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,580
But right now,

235
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,180
I wonder,

236
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,490
has the team misunderstood

237
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,180
our efforts?

238
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,250
I understand your point.

239
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,340
I mentored Hong Liang myself.

240
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,940
I know him well.

241
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,460
I can say,

242
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,700
I care about him as much as you do.

243
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,420
I worry

244
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,340
if he keeps this up,

245
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,250
it will hurt not just Dongping,

246
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,770
but could

247
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,650
possibly

248
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,130
make himself a target.

249
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,580
It may even hurt

250
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,340
his own career path.

251
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,490
Grandpa, I finished my homework.

252
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,460
Great.

253
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,610
Dou, come.

254
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,820
This is Grandma Lan.

255
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,610
Grandma Lan.

256
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,180
Hello.

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,130
Here, Dou,

258
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,100
how about

259
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,610
you take this nut

260
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,850
and let nanny

261

take you to your room,
you can watch cartoons for a while.

262
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:48,980
Okay?

263
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,060
- Okay.
- Grandpa will be with you soon.

264
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,300

265

Sweet girl.

266
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,850
You have a lovely grandkid

267

and filial children.

268
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,940
It's a life many would envy.

269
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,940
Jing Ming,

270
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,730
are you sure

271
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,490
the Wan Hai case
won't have any more issues?

272
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,060
I'm sure.

273
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:17,770
Mr. Zhang.

274
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,010

and prosecution

277
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,420
of Zhang Wenjing,

278
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,980
the Municipal Procuratorate has decided

279
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,940
to re-examine

280
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,700
her case file

281
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,340
and clear her name as soon as possible.

282
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,340
Meanwhile,

283
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,820
we'll also

284
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,130
strictly review case procedures

285
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:39,980
and details

286
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,220
to ensure this becomes a flawless case.

287
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,010
Renjun,

288
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,370
your attitude is commendable.

289
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,460
Let's do it this way.

290
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,300
Once you're back,
take charge of the work.

291
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,420
Just like you said,

292
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,420
turn this case

293
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,220
a solid, unquestionable one.

294
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,010
Okay?

295
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,770
Mr. Zhang, I'll take my leave now.

Well played.

Come on, switch players.

I'm really getting old.

302

Just a few moves

303
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,420
and I'm sweating all over.

304
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,580
Can't keep up
with you young folks anymore.

305
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,400

309

impressed.

The organization

314

keeps stressing younger cadres,

315
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,420
giving them more opportunities.

316

Looking at you

317
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,980
reminds me of myself,

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,610
fearless during my two years
in Dongping.

319
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,460
I'd take down anyone,

no matter how high up.

321
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,530

remember you fondly.

325
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,490
Dongping's biggest problem now

326
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,100
is the Wan Hai case.

327
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,460
Mr. Yan,

328
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,890
I know you've invested

329
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,010
great effort into it.

330
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,100
From a case-handling standpoint,

331
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,980
our comrades have worked hard.

332
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,890
But I...

333
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,820
would like to offer a reminder,

334
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,530
perhaps it's time
to look at this differently.

335
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,610
We must fight crime

336
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,250
but also protect development.

337
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,650
Now this Wan Hai case

338
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,890
is no longer just a random case.

Its impact and disruption

340
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,130
have seriously affected Dongping's

341
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,650
stability and progress.

344
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,700
this morning, right?

345
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:15,890
Let's hear your thoughts.

346
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,700
Ms. Lan,

347
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,340
I think,

348
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,700
this case was rushed.

349
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,130
When it was returned for
supplementary investigation,

350
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,460
only three days were given.

351
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,340
I repeatedly stressed at that time,

352
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,460
this was too rushed.

353
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,010
It might cause problems

354
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,850
with evidence.

355
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,250
This is indeed my oversight.

356
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,060
I take full responsibility.

357
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,820
Mr. Li,

358
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,420
that's not what I meant.

359
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,420
I also made mistakes on my part.

360
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,130
This can't fall entirely on you.

361
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,060
Our two prosecutors

362
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,010
have had issues to some extent.

363
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:58,650
So,

364
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,010
I can't shirk my responsibilities.

365
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,370
Yesterday,

366
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,090
I already gave a report
and self-criticism

367
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,860
to the provincial leadership.

368
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,220
But what matters now is

369
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,330
what do we do

370
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,660
next?

371
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,730
Sounds like

372
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,570
you already have an idea?

373
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,140
Since the Zhang Wenjing case

374
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,810
was mishandled,

375
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:21,980
we should immediately

376
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,010
clear her name.

377
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,090
This can also prove

378
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,490
our caution and thoroughness

379
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,730
in the Wan Hai case.

380
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,810
Mr. Li is right.

381
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,530
The Zhang Wenjing case

382
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,140

386
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,420

387

Since you asked,

398
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,220
then I'll

399
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,010
report a few things.

400
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,610
Mr. Yan, as you know,

401
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,380
Dongping, as an old industrial city,

402
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,420
once made major contributions
to the country.

403
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,420
It used to be one of
the province's GDP leaders.

404
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,090
But it's been declining

405
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,010
in recent years.

406
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,260
To help with old cities' transition,

407
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,850
both central

408
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,140
and provincial governments

409
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,730
have provided strong policy support.

410
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,460
Dongping's leadership team

411
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,180
has worked hard these two years,

412
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,250
trying to drive
the transformation of this city

413
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,690
and build a brand new Dongping.

414
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,660
This team is

415
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,900
full of drive, courage,

416
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,380
and determination.

417
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,050
For such a team

418
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,730

419
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,420
and great responsibilities,

420
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,010
we should not only offer support

421
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,900
but also protect them

422
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,900
and help them remove roadblocks at work.

423
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,250
Especially in our
political and legal system,

424
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,210
while handling cases

425
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,050
we must also safeguard

Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Yan?

428
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,900
In a few days,

429

the Provincial Committee of the CPPCC
will visit the Provincial Procuratorate

430
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,450

440
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,210
So,

441
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,770

I'm not worried that
the Zhang Wenjing case

452
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,970

453
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,210

it might hurt morale

461

the innocent should be spared
from wrongful accusations,

462
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,770
and the guilty should be
punished accordingly.

573
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,940
Presented by the director
of our First Division,

574
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,770
Zheng Yaping, also the leader of

575
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:25,970
the Guidance Group.

576
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,490
Dear Vice Chairman and all leaders,

577
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,490
I'll now report

578
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,660
on behalf of our team

579
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,690
regarding

580
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,420
recent case assessments.

581
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,140
Since February this year,

582
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,340
the Guidance Group has reviewed

583
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,290
all local court cases

584
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,050
involving organized crime

585
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,620
in Haidong.

586
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,860
We examined all case files,

587
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,340
interrogated multiple suspects,

588
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,450
and interviewed witnesses.

589
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,770
During the review, we found

590
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,770
some local courts had issues

591
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,340
with unclear facts

592
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,620
and insufficient evidence.

593
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,620
Additionally...

594
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,180
I've confessed!

595
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,140
You can leave Dongping now.

596
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,690
I beg you to stop bothering me!

597
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,820
I

598
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,050
am a gangster.

599
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,940
There is no doubt that
Wan Hai's involved in organized crime.

600
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,580
So I can only go with a guilty plea.

601
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,860
You signed the agreement,

602
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,210
but denied everything in court.

603
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,010
Should I suspect

604
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,340
you faked it all?

605
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:43,900
Ms. Zheng,

606
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,770
is that really a fair question?

607
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,820
What's the Guidance Group for?

608
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,820
Do you have any grounds for that?

609
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,210
They offer guidance.

610
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,340
We can't

611
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,420
rely on them for every little thing.

612
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,140
They can't do everything themselves.

613
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,660
Because Zhang Wenjing case failed...

614
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,250
Criticize and give feedback
when needed...

615
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,380
What do you want to know?

616
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,770
Don't worry about appearances...

617
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,250
Now they're holding onto
the Wan Hai case...

618
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,210
We believe

619
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,900
some cases

620
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,140
may not meet the standard of

621
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,210
organized crime.

622
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,530
Mr. Xie.

623
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,900
When he found the gold bars,

624
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,730
why were you so nervous
and kneeling to him?

625
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,140
What were you afraid of?

626
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,900
The most important thing to me
is the Wan Hai case.

627
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,180
My position determines

628
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,490
it takes top priority.

629
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,490
Hello, leaders,

630
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,380
I'm the deputy leader of the group,

631
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,380
I'd like to add that

632
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,530
some case officers

633
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,050
are currently under our investigation.

634
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,210
Therefore

635
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,660
we have to

636
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,970
question some of their

637
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,730
decisions

638
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,580
during their case handling.

639
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,580
We request

640
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,490
the court to delay trial
for certain cases

641
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,100
and allow us to

642
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,100
conduct

643
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,770
further in-depth investigation.

644
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,340
Have you gathered enough evidence

645
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,290
to make this request?

646
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,100
We've uncovered major leads,

647
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,180
but they're still being verified...

648
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,100
We need more time.

649
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,250
This case is under national scrutiny.

650
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,690
It is also a

651
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,050
public concern.

652
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,210
To be honest, handling such a case

653
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,340
requires prudence,

654
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,050
fairness, and justice.

655
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,770
No guilty goes unpunished

656
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,820
and no innocent gets framed.

657
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,530
We must ensure that.

658
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,140
Indeed,

659
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,050
it's a real test

660
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,660
of every prosecutor's skill.

661
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,290
I'm here to apologize to you.

662
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,340
I know

663
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,450
it's too late for me to say anything.

664
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,690
But I still want to

665
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,770
apologize to you in person.

666
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:15,940
I am sorry.

667
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,690
Because of our mistakes,

668
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,900
you've had to endure

669
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,140
pressure and humiliation

670
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,530
you never should have faced.

671
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,940
I don't accept your apology.

672
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,340
I understand

673
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,250
this verbal apology

674
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,450
means nothing to you.

675
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,530
But

676
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,620
before

677
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,340
a bigger mistake was made,

678
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,820
we uncovered the truth

679
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,970
and restored justice to you.

680
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,620
We cleared your name.

681
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,010
We promise

682
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,420
to improve our professional capabilities

683
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,490
and try our best to avoid
mishandling future cases.

684
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,210
Please be seated.

685
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,530
Let me say a few words.

686
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,690
After hearing

687
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,690
the Guidance Group's report,

688
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,770
I feel both relieved and encouraged.

689
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,530
In such a short time,

690
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,380
our team pushed through

691
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,820
hardships

692
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,580
and made significant progress.

693
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,010
It also proved that
we can address issues

694
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,730
with a factual, professional
legal mindset.

695
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,860
But

696
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,820
I must also remind everyone,

697
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,140
we must approach problems dialectically.

698
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,860
We must view issues from both sides.

699
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,490
When a mistake is found,
we must correct it firmly,

700
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,940
but you can't doubt everything.

701
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,770
Don't throw the baby out

702
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,450
with the bathwater.

703
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,290
We shouldn't deny
the entire outcome of cases like this

704
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,530
just because of a lack of

705
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,970
definitive evidence.

706
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,940
Do you know what it felt like

707
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,450
to stand at the defense table?

708
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,050
This was an extreme insult

709
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,340
to my character and my career.

710
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,340
You disrupted courtroom order,
you're only adding to your crimes!

711
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,250
As a core member of
a criminal organization,

712
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,180
you colluded with Wan Hai,

713
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,450
used organized violence and threats,

714
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,530
bullied and intimidated others,

715
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,730
and forced unfair deals.

716
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,730
Sorry.

717
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,340
I can't defend you anymore.

718
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,660
If I, Zhang Wenjing,

719
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,380
had committed any crimes,

720
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,860
then what you did would've
been justified.

721
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,180
But I didn't do anything.

722
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,690
It was you who forced me

723
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,100
into that courtroom as a defendant.

724
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,450
What were you doing back then?

725
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,940
And now you came to me and said this,

726
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,900
don't you think you're a hypocrite?

727
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:03,970
I am sorry.

728
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,210
We've already initiated
the national compensation process,

729
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,970
you will be compensated.

730
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,010
Mr. Li,

731
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,970
have you ever wondered

732
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,900
why they were so determined

733
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,970
to label me as a member
of a criminal organization?

734
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,700
Who's framing me?

735
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,650
Why are they framing me?

736
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,740
Have you figured that out?

737
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,490
No,

738
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,530
right?

739
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,260
So what did you apologize for?

740
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,300
What justice you're giving me?

741
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,900
What innocence did you restore?

742
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,820
Who told you to apologize to me?

743
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,940
Who are you representing?

744
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,130
I represent
Dongping People's Procuratorate.

745
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,450
Is that all?

746
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,610
Since

747
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,940
your only concern is to
wrap things up as quickly as possible,

748
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,740
without ever truly understanding
what actually happened,

749
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,130
then what kind of apology is this?

750
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,740
The Wan Hai case has been
going on for over two years now.

751
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,940
As long as the facts
are reasonably clear

752
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,090
and the evidence solid,

753
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,650
then indict where necessary,

754
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,900
and sentence where appropriate.

755
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,900
Don't get caught up

756
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,970
in minor issues.

757
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,340
Move forward.

758
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,450
Right, Mr. Zhang?

759
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,570
Yes.

760
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,300
Guidance Group

761
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,220
is merely here to provide
supplementary guidance.

762
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,820
Cases like this

763
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,420
should still be handled
by the local procurators.

764
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,900
Then I'm thinking,

765
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,940
shouldn't the extension
of the trial period

766
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,420
take into account

767
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,970
the opinions of
local case-handling organs?

768
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,700
This is very important.

769
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,170
Mr. Jiang,

770
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,570
what do you think?

771
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,220
I

772
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,900
agree with Zhang Fang.

773
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,050
Good deeds

774
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,260
should be done quickly.

775
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,780
Reach a conclusion soon,

776
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,700
so the public

777
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,170
can feel reassured.

778
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,740
How is this okay?

779
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,900
Mr. Zhang, Commissioner Sun,

780
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,650
we've already found the loose thread.

781
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,740
We absolutely cannot let go now!

782
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,610
Mr. Zhang.

783
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,570
Yaping,

784
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,050
hold your horses.

785
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,970
You're a seasoned prosecutor.

786
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,860
You should know,

787
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,740
in a case report like this,

788
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,170
we're supposed to stick to the facts

789
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,780
and leave out the suspicions.

790
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,740
But you couldn't hold back,

791
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,740
mentioned quite a few uncertainties.

792
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,530
Mr. Zhang.

793
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,010
I know we need to be careful
about verification.

794
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,050
But you...

795
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,700
need to give us the time to verify.

796
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,220
How about this,

797
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,340
I'll go talk to Zhang Wenjing.

798
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,700
She must know something critical...

799
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,420
Yaping,

800
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,940
any other questions?

801
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,970
So...

802
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,490
is our Guidance Group

803
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,780
being disbanded?

804
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,130
About Zhang Wenjing's case,

805
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,900
I still want to raise one point,

806
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,340
you can talk to her,

807
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,780
but not persuade or pressure her.

808
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,940
You need to ask her clearly,

809
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,820
what does she intend to do next?

810
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,700
What she wants to do

811
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,570
and how she would like to do it

812
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,420
depend on her personal will.

813
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,010
We can't encourage her

814
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,860
to appeal

815
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,940
or to press charges.

816
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,610
We're prosecutors.

817
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,260
Procedural fairness matters.

818
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,130
Got it?

819
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,740
Yes.

820
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,650
And about Xie Hongfei,

821
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,090
we must go by the findings

822
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,530
of the internal oversight investigation
from Dongping Procuratorate.

823
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,130
Their input must be

824
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,570
taken into account.

825
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,610
Hong.

826
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,900
What you said is absolutely right.

827
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,900
Leaders,

828
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,740
about the flash drive

829
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,450
I submitted earlier,

830
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,130
the one that belonged to Qiao Zhenxing,

831
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,170
I wonder what you both thought

832
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,970
after reviewing its contents.

833
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,220
I've reviewed it.

834
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,090
The missing staff

835
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,340
of Dongping Funeral Home, Lei Guangfa...

836
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,970
do we need to follow up on that?

837
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,260
Dongping Police is handling it.

838
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,860
We can wait on that for now.

839
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,340
Understood.

840
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,740
Do we have the report of
the water sample

841
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,820
suspected to be linked to Qiao Zhenxing?

842
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,170
Also,

843
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,860
you two previously

844
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,260
instructed me to

845
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,420
look into

846
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,300
what the report letter

847
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,420
told us.

848
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:43,700
Do I

849
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,220
still need to

850
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,940
look into it?

851
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,570
Yaping,

852
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,010
Hong Liang.

853
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,260
Safe travels

854
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,900

855
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,970
Yes, sir.

859
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,170
Come check out your tomato plants.

860
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:58,940
They're doing pretty well.

861
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,650
Xudong, let me tell you.

862
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:04,610
I use

863
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,010
organic fertilizer

864
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,570
on these two babies.

865
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,650
I measure it down to the gram

866
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,130
on a scale every week

867
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,220
before adding it.

868
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,940
So, hard work really does pay off.

869
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,170
Come here.

870
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,420
Look at mine.

871
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,380
See.

872
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,050
I just

873
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,610
water it every few days.

874
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,780
Only water,

875
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,610
no fertilizer at all?

876
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,340
No.

877
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,700
Weren't these planted at the same time?

878
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:42,570
Yeah.

879
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,970
Well,

880
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,610
mine clearly falls a bit short then.

881
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,570
So,

882
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,130
sometimes,

883
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,780
the more you interfere,

884
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,220
the worse things might get.

885
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,490
Xudong.

886
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,700
I also have to tell you.

887
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,610
Everyone in the office felt that

888
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,610
your speech today

889
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:08,970
was highly strategic

890
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,300
and politically insightful.

891
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,570
We've all learned a lot.

892
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,050
Maybe my remarks
at the meeting this afternoon

893
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,650
came off a little sharp.

894
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,050
But regarding the Wan Hai case,

895
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,570
your thoughts about it are
both too naive,

896
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,820
and too complicated.

897
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,700
Could you elaborate?

898
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,220
Trying to figure out

899
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,300
such a complicated case
in such a short time,

900
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,570
that's 'too naive'.

901
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,940
But trying to overturn

902
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,700
a case that's already clearly identified

903
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,220
as organized crime,

904
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,530
that's 'too complicated'.

905
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,900
Just let Dongping

906
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,570
handle its own case.

907
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,900
Let their political and legal
departments investigate.

908
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,260
Water them yourself.

909
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,820
Just like my tomatoes,

910
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,170
I barely touched them.

911
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,700
But look how well they grew.

912
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,530
You can eat it next week.

913
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,570
Will you be around next week?

914
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,780
I suppose.

915
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,380
One more thing.

916
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,300
I have to go back to Dongping
tomorrow morning.

917
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,260
The Guidance Group
still needs to wrap things up.

918
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,130
This is good.

919
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,780
