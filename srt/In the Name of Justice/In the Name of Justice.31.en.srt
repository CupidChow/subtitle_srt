1
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,010
Your bureau had already classified

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,050
Qiao Zhenxing's case as a suicide.

3
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,980
What was your motive

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,170
for revisiting the timeline?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,770
Dongping's a small city,

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,370
and the network of connections

7
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,820
runs deep and is very complicated.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,050
Dongping wasn't built in a day,

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,050
and neither was

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,730
its judicial system.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,820
Everyone who's part of this system

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,410
has layers of personal connections.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,220
I doubt it's possible

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,820
that every single case in Dongping

15
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,260
is squeaky clean.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,050
But I can guarantee you one thing—

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,300
we've never deliberately

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,580
mishandled a case.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,820
I stand by that

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,260
with my personal integrity.

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,000
[In the Name of Justice]

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
[Episode 31]

23
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,820
Mr. Cheng,

24
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,450
what did you, my brother

25
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,850
and Mr. Chen tell me three years ago?

26
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,730
You said I should sue Wan Hai,

27
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,410
and then the Freight Hub will be mine.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,980
No problem, and zero cost, right?

29
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,890
Is it still zero cost now?

30
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,260
The Task Force's arresting people,

31
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,980
how can you cover it up now?

32
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,100
First they took Sun Fei,

33
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,220
then Jiang Hongjun!

34
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,450
And did you know

35
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,820
they even questioned Li Renjun?

36
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,730
You didn't know?

37
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,660
Well, now you do.
Li Renjun's under the spotlight.

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,500
Who's next?

39
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,260
Huh?

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,820
It's Xie!

41
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,570
If they arrest him,

42
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,980
what are you going to do?

43
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,980
Long, don't you have magic touch?

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,260
Isn't this the time to use it?

45
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,730
C'mon, show me what you can do!

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,100
Tell me, when is the Task Force leaving?

47
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,610
Huh? What day?

48
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,730
Mr. Wang,

49
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,610
I know you're stressed

50
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,660
and uneasy.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,340
If

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,010
you're okay with it,

53
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,850
I can arrange for you

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,060
to stay away for a while

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,340
until this blows over,

56
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,500
okay?

57
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,260
Long, what are you saying?

58
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,260
You want me to

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,570
run?

60
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,450
Do you want me to lie low for a while,

61
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,850
or vanish for good?

62
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,690
Give me a number.

63
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,370
How many days should I be away?

64
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,250
Will I find that the Freight Hub
is no longer mine

65
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,100
when I come back?

66
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,900
If the Wan Hai case gets overturned,

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,850
who's going to defend me?

68
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,250
Let me be crystal clear,

69
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:36,930
Mr. Chen,

70
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,460
I'm not going anywhere.

71
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,730
I'm staying right here.

72
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,370
Mr. Chen, aren't you

73
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,220
the big shot?

74
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,610
Then do something! Get me out of this!

75
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,730
Mr. Wang, you don't need to corner me.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,540
I told you

77
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,610
we're all in the same boat.

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,780
We'll figure this out together.

79
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,850
Don't be so shameless.

80
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,850
I'm shameless?

81
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,290
Fine, Chen Shenglong,

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,900
let me show you just how 'shameless'
I can be.

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,250
I reported Wan Hai,

84
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,780
I gave the false testimony,

85
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,540
and I wanted the Freight Hub, huh?

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,370
Fine.

87
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,850
If I really go down,

88
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,340
I'm taking all of you with me.

89
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,370
I'll say you were behind all of it.

90
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,700
Push me overboard,

91
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,100
and see how far your boat gets.

92
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,930
Xiong, calm down!

93
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,100
Shut up already!

94
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,490
What,

95
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,250
I'm not even allowed to vent?

96
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,370
Didn't I tell you
everything's under control

97
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,100
and we're handling it?

98
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,810
Xiong, calm down. Take it easy.

99
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,020
You got a death wish?

100
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,540
Sit down!

101
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,460
Sit down first!

102
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,250
Calm down.

103
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:56,810
Mr. Wang,

104
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,980
Xiong just had a few too many drinks.

105
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,490
It's no big deal.

106
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,810
Just some heated words. It's all fine.

107
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,980
Just for today,

108
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,250
I'm letting it slide,

109
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,850
on your account.

110
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,540
Of course.

111
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,580
C'mon.

112
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,780
Have a seat.

113
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,660
Mr. Wang,

114
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,050
I promise you,

115
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,660
as long as we stay united,

116
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,850
no one's getting thrown overboard.

117
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,370
Trust me.

118
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,460
Right, Long?

119
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,540
Mr. Wang,

120
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,900
let's keep drinking.

121
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,460
Come on.

122
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,100
To you.

123
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,170
We're here.

124
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,810
I lost my cool earlier.

125
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,900
I got a bit worked up.

126
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,610
Please tell Long

127
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,780
I didn't mean anything by it.

128
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,980
I'm just

129
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,850
a bit too stressed lately.

130
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,220
I'm kind of at my limit.

131
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,020
I get it.

132
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,850
Really.

133
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,050
But Yu, listen to me,

134
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,460
you don't need to worry.

135
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,250
Long wouldn't take it to heart.

136
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,490
You spoke your mind,
that's what brothers do.

137
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,980
We'll face it together.

138
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,370
Now that's what I like to hear.

139
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,370
How many years have we worked together—

140
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,250
three, four?

141
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,980
We've been through everything, right?

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,370
Yeah.

143
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,490
And come on, I don't believe

144
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,370
those punks can really

145
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,580
wipe out the entire

146
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,810
Dongping political and legal system,

147
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,540
and all those officers!

148
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,290
It's impossible, right?

149
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,250
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

150
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,850
Yu, let me be honest with you.

151
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,810
Long is only after Wan Hai's mine

152
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,340
for his mentor, Yu Tiancheng.

153
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,460
And you know
who Yu Tiancheng is working with?

154
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,980
Jiang Yuan.

155
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,660
You know what kind of power he's got.

156
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,780
They are both Long's backers.

157
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,370
Think about it,

158
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,580
how long have Long and his mentor

159
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,020
been running things in Dongping?

160
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,580
This is nothing but a small ripple.

161
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,290
I don't know

162
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,850
why I couldn't see this earlier.

163
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,610
Who really calls the shots here, right?

164
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,050
Yeah!

165
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,780
When you go up,

166
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,460
please tell Long that

167
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,050
I owe him my life.

168
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,050
Yu, that's so touching.

169
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,980
Alright, take care.

170
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,900
- See you around.
- Alright, bye.

171
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,100
And please pass the message to Long.

172
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,700
Of course.

173
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,250
Don't forget!

174
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,220
- Bye.
- Bye.

175
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,220
See you around.

176
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,130
- Bye!
- Good night!

177
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,940
- Bye.
- Alright, bye.

178
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,650
Drive, now.

179
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,770
Goodbye!

180
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,460
See you around!

181
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:43,940
Step on it.

182
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,180
Yu,

183
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,100
why do you look so rattled?

184
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,370
What did you talk about?

185
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,250
Run,

186
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,340
now.

187
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,700
I know too much.

188
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,980
Are you sure
you're not overthinking this, Yu?

189
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,580
It's all clear to me now.

190
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,010
Chen Shenglong

191
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,370
is setting me up to take the fall.

192
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,250
Stop. It's fine.

193
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,060
Here, take it.

194
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,610
Take it.

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,370
Keep it for yourself.

196
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,980
No, Yu, take it.

197
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,580
No, I don't want it. Listen to me,

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,770
find somewhere to lay low
for a few days.

199
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,850
I'll contact you

200
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,940
once I'm all settled.

201
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,100
No time to waste.

202
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,370
But...

203
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:33,820
I gotta go now.

204
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,180
Yu,

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,010
maybe you're overthinking this?

206
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,850
Is it possible that you...

207
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,850
Mr. Wang,

208
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,180
where are you headed

209
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,530
at this hour?

210
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,890
Nowhere.

211
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,220
Mr. Chen wants to see you.

212
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,980
Yu, run!

213
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,890
Watch it!

214
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,980
Mr. Wang, come on down.

215
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,460
What are you doing?

216
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,820
- Get out of my car!
- Come out!

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,130
Don't force me to come up.

218
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,820
Wang Yu!

219
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,300
Excuse me.

220
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,770
Come in.

221
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,100
Hello, Mr. Xu.

222
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,530
We're the special Task Force

223
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,460
and will be asking you some questions.

224
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:46,820
Okay.

225
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,490
Mr. Xu,

226
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,460
the Task Force

227
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,530
has detained two police officers

228
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,420
from your precinct

229
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,370
for investigation

230
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,980
recently.

231
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,650
Let's start with Jiang Hongjun.

232
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,300
What do the Dongping Municipal
Bureau of Public Security

233
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,490
and you personally

234
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,370
think of this officer?

235
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,980
It's shocking.

236
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,130
An officer at Jiang Hongjun's level

237
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,130
had over

238
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,060
three million in cash in his home?

239
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,490
Mr. Xu,

240
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,180
sorry to interrupt,

241
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,130
but where did you get the information

242
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,530
that over three million in cash

243
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,730
was found in Jiang Hongjun's home?

244
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,580
Sun Fei, the second officer

245
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,130
you detained,

246
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,530
told me that information.

247
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,530
Before he was taken away,

248
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,490
he came to my office,

249
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,300
hoping I could pull some strings
at the provincial office

250
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,100
and help him out.

251
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,890
I remember telling him that...

252
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,460
You practically fought

253
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,580
to take on those cases.

254
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,250
I only entrusted

255
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,180
the cases to you out of trust,

256
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,770
and even more so because
Ms. Lan trusted you.

257
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,300
But you have let down

258
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,770
both the bureau and Ms. Lan.

259
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,890
So your only option is to

260
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,220
cooperate with the investigation

261
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,530
and accept the facts.

262
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,340
That's the gist of it.

263
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,300
According to our investigation,

264
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,980
you did some work that

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,460
actually helped the case in private.

266
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,420
Why did you keep it private?

267
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,100
Let me put it this way,

268
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,130
in this line of work,

269
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,730
I've learned that some cases

270
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,530
are extremely sensitive.

271
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,980
One misstep could disrupt
the whole case.

272
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,300
Sometimes I investigate discreetly

273
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,530
to avoid
derailing the overall investigation.

274
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,580
Considering that

275
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,850
Jiang Hongjun,

276
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,460
a low-ranking officer,

277
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,610
accepted confirmed bribes

278
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,130
totaling over 3.2 million,

279
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,370
and Sun Fei is implicated
in various problems—

280
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,060
both of which occurred under your watch—

281
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,460
what do you

282
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,370
consider your responsibility

283
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,850
as chief of the Dongping Municipal
Bureau of Public Security?

284
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,460
Hong Liang,

285
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,730
I'll speak from the heart,

286
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,730
anyone who's been in this line of work

287
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,530
knows what matters most:

288
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,490
it's results.

289
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,130
That means solving cases
and solving them fast.

290
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,490
When higher-ups are
breathing down your neck for results,

291
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,060
and the victims' families
are demanding justice,

292
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,730
you can't cover everything.

293
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,980
I had to focus on the big picture.

294
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,180
You should understand that

295
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,130
Sun Fei was transferred
to the police bureau midway.

296
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,650
He didn't go through

297
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,650
proper political
and ideological education,

298
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,130
and so when faced with temptation,
he crossed the line.

299
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,940
But what happened with Sun Fei

300
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,460
and Jiang Hongjun

301
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,770
is an isolated incident.

302
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,460
It's not a reflection
of Dongping's entire police department.

303
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,100
If you're asking
whether I'm accountable,

304
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,980
I admit there was a lapse
in leadership on my part.

305
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,180
Alright, I understand.

306
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,250
Mr. Xu, I have one more question.

307
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,650
Go ahead.

308
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,610
Around

309
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,700
March 10th this year,

310
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,370
you showed someone

311
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,490
the activity log from the day

312
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,820
Qiao Zhenxing died.

313
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,820
What was your reasoning

314
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,700
for doing that?

315
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,100
Hold on.

316
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,100
I need to use the restroom.

317
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,060
Take a look at this file.

318
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,340
Did I do that?

319
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,100
How come I don't remember?

320
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,850
Hold on,

321
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,650
I think I remember now.

322
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,730
Qin Feng

323
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,220
came to talk to me about something else.

324
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,580
I probably left this file

325
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,490
lying on the desk.

326
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,100
Could that punk have peeked

327
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,100
and leaked it?

328
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,010
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Xu,

329
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,420
but that's not my point.

330
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,850
What concerns me is that,

331
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,370
prior to that day,

332
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,100
your bureau had already classified

333
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,180
Qiao Zhenxing's case as a suicide

334
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,460
and had sent an officer

335
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,650
to obtain the signature

336
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,100
of the victim's wife,

337
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,980
Zhou Mei.

338
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,700
So if the police have already

339
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,490
reached a conclusion

340
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,820
and the matter was supposedly settled,

341
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,650
what was your motive

342
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,850
for revisiting the timeline?

343
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,580
The truth is, Hong Liang,

344
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,700
I had some doubts

345
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,890
about Qiao Zhenxing's case,

346
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,650
but it was already officially closed,

347
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,650
there wasn't any obvious evidence.

348
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,940
So I had Qin Feng

349
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,370
look into it

350
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,700
under the radar.

351
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,220
And since Qin Feng has been
transferred to the logistics division,

352
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,730
it was technically improper
to assign him to a case,

353
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,610
so

354
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,180
I had to do it that way.

355
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,300
Hong Liang,

356
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,300
let me say this again.

357
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,130
Dongping's a small city,

358
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,770
and the network of connections runs deep

359
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,250
and is very complicated.

360
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,980
Dongping wasn't built in a day,

361
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,610
and neither was

362
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,290
its judicial system.

363
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,330
Everyone who's part of this system

364
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,290
has layers of personal connections.

365
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,380
Take Sun Fei for example,

366
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,090
you're well aware of

367
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,460
how he got his position, aren't you?

368
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,250
Someone

369
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,900
who's been in the system

370
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,460
for a decade,

371
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,770
two decades,

372
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,490
or in my case, thirty years,

373
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,570
nearly retired—

374
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,940
do you think we can avoid
getting tangled in those connections?

375
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,140
It's impossible.

376
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,730
I doubt it's possible

377
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,250
that every single case in Dongping

378
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,770
is squeaky clean.

379
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,250
But I can guarantee you one thing,

380
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,530
we've never deliberately

381
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,810
mishandled a case.

382
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,250
I stand by that

383
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,810
with my personal integrity.

384
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,010
Ms. Zheng.

385
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,570
Ms. Zheng.

386
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,730
Did you pull an all-nighter again?

387
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,290
Someone's here to see you.

388
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,090
I know your heart
still longs for justice

389
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,050
and you hope the Wan Hai case
can be overturned.

390
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,900
Please don't lose faith
in the legal system,

391
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,860
or in yourself.

392
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,010
Having faith in lawyers

393
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,490
is essential to building

394
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,900
a rule-of-law society.

395
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,730
Based on Zhang Wenjing's tips,

396
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,940
we've confirmed the testimony

397
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,380
of key witnesses in the Wan Hai case,

398
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,570
including Zhang Wenjing, Chen Youcai,

399
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,090
Qian Bo, and Wu Xiaotian.

400
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,900
We now have solid evidence

401
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,980
that Wang Yu and Cheng Zijian
falsely accused Wan Hai

402
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,330
and used threats and bribes
to coerce false testimony.

403
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,330
They must be brought in immediately.

404
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,900
All units,

405
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,220
move out.

406
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,010
Yes, sir!

407
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,980
Sir, we need you to cooperate.

408
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,050
Cheng Zijian,

409
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,770
you need to come with us.

410
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,620
The investigation

411
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,570
has reached this point,

412
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,860
and even your lawyer has been taken in.

413
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,730
At this stage,

414
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,900
you should know

415
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,050
who's next.

416
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,220
Long,

417
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,290
maybe you should lie low for a while.

418
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,010
It would be best

419
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,380
for everyone.

420
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,460
I'm not leaving.

421
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,660
You're not leaving?

422
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,900
Do you realize

423
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,330
that all this mess in Dongping

424
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,530
is because of you?

425
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,090
You don't get to say you're not leaving.

426
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,220
Jiang,

427
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,940
you and I are in the same boat.

428
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,090
If I go down,
you're not walking away either.

429
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,050
It's all your fault.

430
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,770
You're the one dragging all of us down!

431
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,770
Who do you think you're talking to?

432
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,380
Without your high-ranking official daddy,
you would be a nobody!

433
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,290
You think you would get to
sit at the same table with me?

434
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,570
I could end you in a second!

435
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,570
That's right!

436
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,980
You only came after me to coerce my dad

437
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,050
into helping you take Wan Hai's mine.

438
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,330
You think I didn't know that?

439
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,290
The only reason I even met you

440
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,420
is because of my dad.

441
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,660
Give me your money.

442
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,810
I don't have any.

443
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:00,940
Your phone then.

444
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,700
I left it at home.

445
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,220
Let me check.

446
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,180
No, I swear,

447
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,810
I left it at home.

448
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,900
What are you looking at?

449
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,290
Get lost!

450
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,660
What is this then?

451
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,490
Don't know what honesty is, huh?

452
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,730
Teach him a lesson.

453
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,810
What are you doing?

454
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,010
Ganging up on him?

455
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,010
This doesn't concern you.

456
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,490
Buzz off!

457
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,090
- What did you say?
- I said,

458
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,900
- buzz off!
- Come on, say it again.

459
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,980
Beat it!

460
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,010
You'll pay for this!

461
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,420
Let's go!

462
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,810
What are you staring at?
Get out of here!

463
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,290
Go home!

464
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,730
Thank you.

465
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,700
What's your name?

466
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,810
Jiang Yuan.

467
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,810
How about buying us dinner?

468
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,140
No problem.

469
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,090
If you ever need anything,

470
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,420
Drive.

471
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,180
I've

472
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,700
got your back.

473
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,140
Happy birthday!

474
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,420
Happy birthday!

475
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,180
Thank you!

476
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,490
Jiang Yuan,

477
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,570
you're eighteen now!

478
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,050
That means you can drink all night!

479
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,090
Bottoms up!

480
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,380
Bottoms up!

481
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,530
I got you a present!

482
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,180
What'd you get me?

483
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,860
It's downstairs!

484
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,620
Let's go!

485
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,420
So cool!

486
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,940
What car is this?

487
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:49,770
A sports car.

488
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,050
Sports car?

489
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,900
Jiang Yuan, this is amazing!

490
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,290
What do you think?

491
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,730
You like it?

492
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,570
This is mine?

493
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,330
Who else could it be for?

494
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,420
Just a little something.

495
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,490
Thank you so much!

496
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,620
Go on.

497
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,250
Get in.

498
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,090
Happy birthday, Yuan.

499
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,860
Happy birthday!

500
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,810
You really think I don't see through

501
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,180
your little games?

502
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,770
Tell me,

503
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,940
without me

504
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,420
and my dad,

505
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,770
do you think you'd be
where you are today?

506
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,730
You think you'd get to
sit here and eat with me?

507
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:29,730
Enough!

508
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,180
Like things aren't bad enough?

509
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,860
Don't you get what kind of situation

510
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,900
we're facing?

511
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,860
What are you doing?

512
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:57,860
Sir,

513
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,290
I'll say it again,

514
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,900
I'm not leaving.

515
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,620
We're all on the same boat.

516
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,730
I know you don't want me to go down.

517
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,330
If you know what's going on

518
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,140
with the Task Force,

519
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,570
please give me a heads-up

520
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,940
so I can be prepared.

521
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,250
My dad really can't get
any information right now.

522
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,810
Don't you have a brother-in-law?

523
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,660
Like he takes orders from me.

524
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,770
If you can't handle it,

525
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,460
that's your problem.

526
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,180
Let's see what they can do now.

527
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,980
Do you think my family
runs the Task Force?

528
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:04,900
Chao.

529
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,900
Chao,

530
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,900
I know you don't want to talk to me,

531
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,220
but kid,

532
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,660
we're family.

533
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,860
Everything I did

534
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,980
was for you.

535
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,380
My biggest regret

536
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,290
is not giving you to Zheng Yaping.

537
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,810
If we'd taken the risk

538
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,620
and sent you to Haizhou,

539
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,810
even if the cops had caught you,

540
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,380
it would still be better than this.

541
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,770
Chao,

542
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,980
I'm truly sorry.

543
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,140
I don't think we're getting out.

544
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,570
I failed to protect you.

545
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,730
I'm a coward.

546
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,940
Please don't hate me.

547
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,250
Come on, get up, Kid.

548
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:33,900
Get up.

549
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,180
Uncle,

550
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,900
you're a grown man.

551
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,050
Don't cry like this.

552
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,460
If my dad saw you like this,

553
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,250
he'd have to smack you.

554
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,620
I wish your dad could slap me now,

555
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,730
but it will never happen again.

556
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,180
Chao,

557
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,730
I've always

558
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,980
been a coward.

559
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,010
I always dodge conflict

560
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,460
and walk away when things get tough.

561
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,940
Your dad told me many times

562
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,770
that I need to be tough,

563
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,660
but when it comes down to it,

564
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,460
I just chicken out.

565
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,570
You tell me, what should I

566
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,900
have done with the mine?

567
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,660
What choice did I have?

568
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,050
You have no idea, kid,

569
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,010
but I'm so worried about you.

570
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,660
I watched you grow up.

571
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,140
I'd never hurt you.

572
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,620
Uncle.

573
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,050
Uncle,

574
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,570
listen.

575
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,290
Listen,

576
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,140
I

577
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,770
don't blame you.

578
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,980
What good would it do

579
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,900
at this point?

580
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,570
But

581
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,250
just now, lying here,

582
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,380
I kept wondering

583
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,220
what my dad is doing now.

584
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,090
Uncle,

585
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,570
I miss my dad.

586
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,380
Don't think about that, kid.

587
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,330
I miss him.

588
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,530
Untie him.

589
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,220
What are you staring at?

590
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,730
What are you gonna do about it?

591
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,290
Who are you?

592
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,660
Mr. Chen.

593
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,140
Why are you there?

594
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:37,660
No, please.

595
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,090
You little punk.

596
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,090
Chen Shenglong,

597
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,140
so this is you.

598
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,770
Want to eat?

599
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,400
[Impartial in Law Enforcement
Manage With Pace]

600
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,140
Ms. Zheng.

601
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:07,660
Hello.

602
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,050
Please come in.

603
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,140
Thank you.

604
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,460
What are you doing here?

605
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,980
If you keep appealing,

606
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,290
I'll keep defending you.

607
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,730
Knock it off.

608
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,700
I thought you got out.

609
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,940
Why did you come back?

610
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,810
I did leave Dongping for a while

611
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,490
and quit being a lawyer.

612
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,420
I wanted a different life.

613
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,660
Isn't that a good thing?

614
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,220
Then Ms. Zheng found me.

615
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,700
After a lot of thought,
I decided to come back.

616
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,810
Mr. Wan,

617
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,860
I think

618
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,330
we should reveal the truth
behind this case

619
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,700
and clear everyone's name.

620
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,940
I don't have it in me.

621
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,620
Do you know Chen Shenglong?

622
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,570
Do you know Chen Shenglong?

623
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,730
Don't worry, you two.

624
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,530
From now on,

625
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,730
I promise

626
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,940
you'll be well fed and cared for,

627
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,810
but you'll have to

628
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,660
stay here a few more days.

629
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,140
Once things calm down

630
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,090
and everyone's fine,

631
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,050
we'll talk again.

632
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,860
Wait, Mr. Chen,

633
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,860
you're confusing me.

634
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,090
My brother's already been sentenced.

635
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,380
This is over.

636
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,290
What do you mean
"once things calm down"?

637
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,980
The higher-ups sent a Task Force

638
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,290
to investigate.

639
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,220
Only if you stay here

640
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,250
will your brother not appeal.

641
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,330
Like I said,

642
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,380
we'll talk once things

643
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,900
settle down.

644
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,700
Chen Shenglong,

645
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,180
were you behind

646
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,810
the mining accident?

647
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,330
Answer me.

648
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,080
Yes.

649
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:18,940
Chen Shenglong,

650
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,530
do you think the Task Force is here

651
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,300
to investigate my dad?

652
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,940
The mining accident was man-made.

653
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,090
And I recorded proof on video.

654
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,380
Do you believe me?

655
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,260
What did you just say?

656
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,460
What are you,

657
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,210
deaf?

658
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,900
You little punk!

659
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,380
Are you crazy?

660
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,340
Are you trying to fool me?

661
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,210
Why are you

662
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,650
so worked up?

663
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,780
Did you do it?

664
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,130
None of your business.

665
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,980
You said you caught it on camera,
what was it?

666
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,860
Someone unscrewing the bolts.

667
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,490
Where did you film it?

668
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,090
From the window.

669
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,420
You're lying!

670
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,050
I checked the window myself,

671
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,340
there was no one there!

672
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,460
Do you think I'm that careless?

673
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,170
Who do you think you're fooling?

674
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,090
You're the murderer
behind the mining disaster.

675
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,090
You're not a cop.

676
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,340
Chen Shenglong,

677
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,090
do you get
why the Task Force is here now?

678
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,740
I have video evidence of you
impersonating a cop.

679
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,490
And I didn't forward it

680
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,570
to the municipal authorities,

681
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,490
I sent it directly
to the provincial office.

682
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,300
Do you believe me?

683
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:46,860
Chao!

684
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,780
Calm down, Chao!

685
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,010
- Stop.
- I'll kill you!

686
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,340
Chao, calm down.

687
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,210
Stay calm.

688
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,780
Uncle,

689
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,420
at this point,

690
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,740
we have nothing to be afraid of anymore.

691
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,610
Don't lose your cool, Chao.

692
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,740
Stay calm.

693
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,940
I promise you,

694
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,300
that cop has been arrested by now.

695
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,010
Chen Shenglong,

696
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,010
do you think he'll confess

697
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,530
or

698
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,650
not?

699
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,740
Clean this up.

700
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,650
Let's talk about

701
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,340
Wanchuan Mining.

702
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,860
We carried out a detailed
investigation into your mine

703
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,210
and found some major turning points.

704
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,090
The first was three years ago,

705
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,690
when they discovered copper and nickel,

706
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,170
and the mine's value shot up.

707
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,170
Another one

708
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,460
was thirteen years ago.

709
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,460
Thirteen years ago,

710
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,650
you absorbed Dacheng Mining next door,

711
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,090
almost doubling Wanchuan Mining's size.

712
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,740
And we found

713
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,260
you didn't buy them out—

714
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,460
in fact,

715
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,610
you paid nothing.

716
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,300
How did you pull that off?

717
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,940
They had outdated equipment

718
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,050
and poor management,

719
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,170
so they transferred it to me.

720
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,210
As we understand,

721
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,940
the copper and nickel

722
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,170
was first discovered in Dacheng Mining,

723
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,650
right?

724
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,130
Ma'am, the tunnels underground
are all over the place.

725
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,530
I don't know where

726
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,460
it was discovered exactly,

727
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,530
but it was our mine.

728
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,690
Okay.

729
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,490
One more question:

730
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,210
thirteen years ago,

731
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,090
Chen Shenglong

732
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,130
was the business manager
at Dacheng Mining

733
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,740
and did quite well there.

734
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,050
He worked there for a long time.

735
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,380
Have you ever come across him?

736
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,210
You said it yourself,

737
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,780
he was just a business manager,

738
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,340
not someone important.

739
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,780
I didn't have to know him.

740
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,530
He's trying to buy your mine now.

741
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,530
Surely you know about that.

742
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:13,900
Ma'am,

743
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,610
you know what happened

744
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,610
at our mine.

745
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,940
I told Wan Hong

746
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,380
to sell it to whoever wants to buy it

747
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,650
and ask for as much as he could.

748
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,740
Did Wan Hong not tell you
Chen Shenglong was the buyer?

749
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,460
Or are you hiding something?

750
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,340
I'm not.

751
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:32,860
Wan Hai,

752
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:34,940
we believe

753
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,740
this whole case was a setup.

754
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,420
The Wan Group

755
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,940
might have committed some violations

756
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,260
in business,

757
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,380
but it wasn't enough to be seen
as organized crime.

758
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,380
Somebody wanted to take your mine

759
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,740
and used legal tactics

760
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,050
to make you and your staff
look like a criminal gang.

761
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,050
And out of self-preservation or fear,

762
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,740
you had to play along.

763
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,300
It's not Wang Yu

764
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,460
who's truly after you,

765
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,820
but Chen Shenglong

766
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,780
and his Tianlong Company.

767
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,900
Thirteen years ago,

768
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,460
Dacheng Mining

769
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,050
was right next to Wanchuan Mining.

770
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,460
And who owned Dacheng Mining?

771
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,300
It was Yu Tiancheng.

772
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,130
Those two

773
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,090
fought fiercely

774
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,340
over the resources,

775
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,210
always attacking each other

776
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,090
and fighting,

777
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,090
until Yu Tiancheng lost his temper

778
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,570
Wan Hai!

779
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,780
and sent two men with guns,

780
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,420
killing two people.

781
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:46,980
Your dad

782
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:48,820
was lucky.

783
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,570
He jumped out the window and escaped.

784
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,530
Wan Hai!

785
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,570
Then they

786
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,530
discussed...

787
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:09,980
Negotiated.

788
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,010
Negotiated

789
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,900
and Wanchuan Mining

790
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,690
got Dacheng Mining

791
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,690
without spending a penny.

792
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,530
You give Mr. Wan

793
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,130
Dacheng Mining for free.

794
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,530
This

795
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,380
ends here.

796
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,530
Let it go.

797
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,980
Then Yu Tiancheng

798
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,460
left Dongping

799
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,900
for good.

800
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,980
So, tell me,

801
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,130
after thirteen years of mining

802
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,050
and two deaths,

803
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,300
is this mine just yours?

804
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,860
What about others?

805
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,940
That's why your brother

806
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,420
got worked up

807
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,780
when you mentioned me

808
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,090
and Yu Tiancheng to him last time.

809
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,860
Don't blame me.

810
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,210
Blame the previous generation.

811
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,300
So I believe,

812
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,900
once this storm passes,

813
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,940
we can still work together.

814
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,010
Work together my ass!

815
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,050
My dad was framed by you!

816
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,010
My dad is not mafia,

817
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,740
neither is my uncle,

818
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,690
nor I!

819
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,340
You're the real mafia,

820
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,650
Chan Shenglong!

821
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,570
You,

822
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,090
you,

823
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:44,650
and you.

824
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,130
You are the real criminals!

825
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,460
Wan Hai,

826
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,300
we're close to the truth.

827
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,380
Why are you still holding back?

828
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,530
Ma'am,

829
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,460
please don't push me.

830
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,780
You haven't denied it.

831
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:10,940
Wan Hai,

832
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,260
unless we work together

833
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,170
to clear this case,

834
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,650
your family will never rest easy.

835
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,170
You're well aware

836
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,010
of the consequences to come.

837
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,650
Do you think I want this?

838
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,170
Wan Hai,

839
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,820
what are you running from?

840
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,010
You need to trust the law

841
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,130
and justice,

842
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,740
not street codes.

843
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,340
What has street codes ever gotten you?

844
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,260
You're in here, aren't you?

845
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,010
Did they spare you?

846
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,940
Or your son?

847
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,300
Enough.

848
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,340
Ma'am,

849
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,900
your stories

850
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:05,900
were compelling,

851
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,610
and I appreciate what you're doing,

852
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,610
but you do your job—

853
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,170
arrest who you must
and follow the evidence—

854
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,260
there's nothing I can do for you
from in here.

855
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:15,130
And you,

856
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,170
please stop meddling, okay?

857
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,090
Who's looking after your daughter now?

858
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,900
Who's looking after your daughter now?

859
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,780
We will find Wan Chao.
