483
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,380

on that 300 million loan from the bank

491
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,140

talk about the interest?

and I don't have anyone
to discuss it with out here.

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,900

506
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,570
is out in the open,

507
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,940
I'm guessing

508
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,050
we're gonna lose... lose the mine.

509
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,180
Why'd you bring up the mine?

510
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,460
- Let me finish!
- Why'd you bring that up?

511
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,220
Sit back down, Wan Hai.

512
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,050
Just let me finish!

513
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,530
Hai, I've been thinking,

514
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,940
instead of dragging it out

515
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,140
and letting the bank take the mine
through foreclosure,

516
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,180
maybe it's better if we think of a way

517
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,810
to get out of this.

518
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,010
Otherwise,

519
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,420
we'll truly lose everything, Hai.

520
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,620

521
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,860
No matter what,

522
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,980
we can't sell the mine.

523
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,380
It has copper and nickel.

524

Once we restart it,

525
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,980
I'm sure we can make a comeback, Dad.

526
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,290

Alright, I won't say more.

531
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,140

533
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,220
but don't be like me.

534
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,140
Look, look at me now.

535
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,860
This is a lesson right here.

536
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,730
You have to listen to your uncle.

537
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,380
Pick that up.

538
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,050
Listen to your dad.

539
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,460
Listen to your dad!

00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,900
That is my little brother,

Peace is a real blessing.

544
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,490
Your uncle and I started out as miners.

545
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,900
Sure, it was tough,

546
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,900
but we had what we needed.

547
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,290
Now, we have to give up what we must.

548
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,810

549

or the Freight Hub,

550

555
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,490
Whether it's the bank foreclosing

556
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,900
or someone buying it outright,

557
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,700
just make sure you get a fair price.

558
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,660
Let's not cause trouble for the bank

559
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,250
or the government.

560
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,220
Our family was well-off

561
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,380
and you've had it easy

562
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,860
compared to many people.

563
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,140
I never pressured you.

564

Your uncle wanted me
to send you to study overseas,

569
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,860
but I said no.

570
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,330

Now,

572
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,460
I see I was shortsighted.

573
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,660
The Wan family

574
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,250
has fallen.

575
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,660
But we will accept defeat.

576
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,180
We'll start over, somewhere far away

577
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,460
from all this.

578
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,860
Your uncle will find a way
to get you some money.

579
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,220
Don't come back.

580
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,250
Remember what I said.

581
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,770
I'm

582
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,620
counting on you

583
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,490
to take care of me
when I get out of here,

584
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,180
you hear?

585
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,900
Sir, I've been thinking about it,

586
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,330
and I'm convinced that this is reliable.

587
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,770
Didn't you ask me to get the land?

588
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,660
So we bid for it.

589
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,810
That shouldn't be a problem at all.

590
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,770
But she came to us about the mine.

591
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,090
This is what's called

592
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,490
a supply chain.

593
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,180
I believe as long as we are careful,

594
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,220
we can make big money this time.

595
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,620
Long,

596
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,620
when was

597
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,420
this property built?

598
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,220
Eh...

599
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,860
It's been six or seven years

600
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,620
since you acquired this land.

601
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,660
And when was this house built?

602
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,530
I think we laid the foundation

603
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,050
three years ago.

604
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,330
And this garden?

605
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,700
It's been a long time.

606
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,770
You've been fixing it up

607
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,700
ever since you moved in.

608
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,810
It's still not finished, right?

609
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,140
That's right.

610
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,620
So don't underestimate this garden.

611
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,250
It's not easy

612
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,860
to maintain it.

613
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,730
Can you see the green

614
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,290
from outside this time of year?

615
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,250
Before planting these flowers,

616
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,380
you have to first

617
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,900
prepare the soil,

618
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,530
fertilize it,

619
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,730
and let it rest.

620
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,940
Just this will take a few years.

621
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,730
And only after

622
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,330
the soil is optimal

623
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,460
do you plant them.

624
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,090
You mustn't

625
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,620
act on a whim.

626
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,700
I've been planning this for years.

627
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,810
It's time to let you know.

628
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,330
Remember

629
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,290
when I asked you

630
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,180
if we could bring down Wan Hai

631
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,900
four years ago?

632
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,380
Sir,

633
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,420
you've worked so hard all these years.

634
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,010
From now on,

635
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,620
you can just tend the garden here

636
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,460
and drink some tea.

637
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,010
Long and I

638
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,090
will come visit you often.

639
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,220
They say that

640
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,380
the fallen leaf returns to its roots.

641
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,090
Do you think

642
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,810
I'll ever

643
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,860
make it back to Dongping?

644
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,570
I heard Wan Hai's

645
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,420
living it up now.

646
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,770
He's the reason

647
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,700
I hit rock bottom.

648
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,620
The only way I can return to Dongping

649
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,570
is by

650
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,700
taking down Wan Hai.

651
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,620
Do it then.

652
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:07,940
Leave it to me.

653
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,620
Once Wan Hai is caught,

654
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,940
I'll lock down their mine.

655
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,420
He owes the bank 300 million.

656
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,420
When he can't pay back the debt,

657
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,090
the bank will sue him.

658
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,490
Once the trial is over,

659
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,460
the mine will be ours.

660
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,770
So,

661
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,010
you don't need to step in just yet.

662
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,770
Just wait it out.

663
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,140
You already planned this four years ago?

664
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,140
Why didn't you tell me

665
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,810
about something this important?

666
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,010
Tell you?

667
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,180
The more you know,

668
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,330
the more you worry.

669
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,570
I was afraid you'd feel overwhelmed

670
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,700
and end up doing nothing.

671
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,250
Long,

672
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,490
this was

673
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,290
my call to make.

674
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,730
But once it's done,

675
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,900
we all win,

676
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,010
right?

677
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,180
I'm getting old.

678
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,770
Now the rest

679
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,180
is up to you young folks.

680
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,810
You don't come here often.

681
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,660
I keep

682
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,380
some free-range chicken here.

683
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,290
I'll have the cook make one for us.

684
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,460
Have a drink with me.

685
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,740
Wan Hong,

686
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,820
what's your plan here?

687
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,210
You keep talking about the mine.

688
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,210
My dad's in jail.

689
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,380
Why'd you bring it up with him?

690
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,260
There's nothing he can do.

691
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,490
This is no small matter.

692
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,090
I have to discuss it with your dad.

693
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,460
It's not like
I can talk about it with you.

694
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,530
Why can't you talk about it with me?

695
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,940
I'm the legal representative
of the mine,

696
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,820
and I'm telling you,

697
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,420
I'm not selling it,

698
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,260
and no one can change my mind.

699
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,460
And I'll tell you again too.

700
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,050
Selling the mine is for your own good

701
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,130
so that we don't lose everything.

702
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,010
Your dad's in jail,

703
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,980
and we two can't beat them alone.

704
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,170
So what if we can't beat them?

705
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,050
I'm telling you, I'll stand my ground
to the very end!

706
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,530
If you ever bring up
selling the mine again,

707
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,340
I won't let you set foot in there again,

708
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,090
I swear!

709
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,740
Fine, you're bold.

710
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,610
You're tough.

711
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,490
You'll be dead before you even know
what hit you.

712
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,420
If I'd known you'd be like this,

713
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,530
I should've just let Wang Yu kill you.

714
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,260
Who?

715
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,570
Wang Yu?

716
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,010
Let him.

717
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,690
I would like to see him try.

718
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,690
You're the one who brought him up.

719
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,980
I knew something was off with you two.

720
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,860
Tell me, what did he promise you?

721
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,460
What did you ask him for? Tell me.

722
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,530
Gimme a break.

723
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,300
I'm raising the price with him for you.

724
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,460
You talked money with him?

725
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,860
Why would you do that?

726
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,420
So,

727
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,010
how much did Wang Yu offer you?

728
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,380
Show me some respect!

729
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,650
I'm your uncle!

730
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,130
I...

731
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,530
Stop!

732
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,260
I've been watching you two.

733
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,940
You're fighting in prison?

734
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,820
Would you like to go to jail?

735
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,690
Don't push me,

736
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,610
or I can't promise what I'll do.

737
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,340
Ms. Liu,

738
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,900
when you visited our company last time,

739
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,570
you outlined

740
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,940
a very precise plan for us.

741
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,610
Afterward, Mr. Chen and I

742
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,490
got a better understanding
of the new energy sector.

743
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,050
It's a state-level priority project

744
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,090
and a crucial pillar

745
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,980
for Dongping's economic transformation.

746
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,490
If our company
can seize this opportunity,

747
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,900
it will hugely benefit

748
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,090
our future growth.

749
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,610
Business takes guts and smarts.

750
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,530
Indeed, when you
seize the right opportunity,

751
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,260
the future of the company

752
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,490
for the next decade or two
is basically guaranteed.

753
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:10,900
Yeah.

754
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:11,820
Please.

755
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,820
Ms. Liu, I have a question.

756
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,420
About that copper-nickel mine,

757
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,690
I heard that Wanchuan Mining

758
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,010
owes the bank 300 million

759
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,130
and is insolvent.

760
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,530
I'd like to know

761
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,260
if the bank is preparing to sue

762
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,090
and push for foreclosure.

763
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,300
To be honest, we don't want to
resort to foreclosure.

764
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,300
First,

765
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,690
foreclosure comes with
too many uncertainties.

766
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:35,860
Second,

767
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,210
Wan Hai's loan was guaranteed

768
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,130
by the Pingshan Development Zone
Managing Committee.

769
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,650
If the foreclosure covers the debt,

770
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,210
great.

771
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,300
If it doesn't,

772
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,300
the government
will have to pay the rest,

773
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,090
and as the director,

774
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,530
I would also take the blame.

775
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,690
So I want to
talk to Wanchuan Mining first.

776
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,460
Whether it's a buyout or partnership,

777
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,690
we would

778
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,490
try to avoid foreclosure.

779
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,780
The copper-nickel mine

780
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,900
is crucial for Dongping's
new energy development.

781
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,380
So we'd like

782
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,940
a local company to revitalize it,

783
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,380
so

784
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,820

785
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,260

No.
