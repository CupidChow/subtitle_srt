That's not good.

in the hallway,

192
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,180
and there's none in the morgue.

193
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,580
However,

194
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,700
Lei Guangfa

195
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,010
and Zhang Shuang

196
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,770
explained that

197
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,370
due to a busy cremation schedule

198
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,220
and heavy workload yesterday,

199
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,490
they were both rushing during

200
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,610
the transportation of the bodies,

201
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,060
which is why

202
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,370
the mix-up happened.

203
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,180
Mr. Xu?

204
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,490
Did you run a background check
on these two cremators?

205
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:13,980
Yes.

206
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,940
Zhang Shuang has a clean record

207
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,890
and a good reputation.

208
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,130
He can be ruled out as a suspect.

209
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,850
Lei Guangfa

210
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,130
has problems with gambling

211
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,250
and drinking.

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,850
His gambling buddies

213
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,130
have confirmed this.

214
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,650
We also

215
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,700
looked into Lei Guangfa's phone

216
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,890
and bank records,

217
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,580
but found nothing suspicious.

218
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,060
This unlucky?

219
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,340
Tell me about it.

220
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,420
This is the preliminary report.

221
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,730
Sir, please review it.

222
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,180
What? Any other instructions?

223
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,580
No.

224
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,850
Very well.

225
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,100
Then I'll get back

226
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,130
to my work then.

227
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,250
Goodbye, sir.

228
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,890
Later at the meeting,

229
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,340
you take the lead, and I'll go along.

230
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,180
Understood.

231
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,340
Maintain your composure.
Don't overdo it.

232
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,820
Hello, sir.

233
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,060
Who are you here to see?

234
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,340
We're here to see the Guidance Group.

235
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,220
You'll need to make an appointment

236
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,460
to see them.

237
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,440
[Guan Wenbo]

238
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,340
Nobody's answering.

239
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,460
Hello, Mr. Li.

240
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,130
Are you there?

241
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,980
Yes, we're here.

242
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,820
But they're not

243
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,100
seeing anyone

244
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,220
or taking calls now.

245
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:06,980
Wait then.

246
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,250
Just wait there.

247
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,420
Okay.

248
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,130
You came unannounced.

249
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,650
Yeah.

250
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,580
What's wrong?

251
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,420
Is it Qiao?

252
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,420
This situation has really

253
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,580
put me in a difficult position.

254
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,360
[Report on the Accidental Cremation
of Qiao Zhenxing's Body]

255
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,770
I was about to push the dial button,

256
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,530
but changed my mind

257
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,730
at the last second and decided

258
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,100
to show you in person.

259
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,850
The sub-bureau interviewed

260
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,980
all personnel involved

261
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,730
and concluded that

262
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,010
it was an operator error
on Lei Guangfa's end.

263
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,890
The body was cremated

264
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,420
by mistake.

265
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,300
Mr. Xu, don't give me that.

266
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,530
I can read the report,

267
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,940
but let me ask you,

268
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,530
do you believe it?

269
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,250
How many of such mistakes happen
every year?

270
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,580
And this time it just happened
to be Qiao Zhenxing?

271
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,420
But

272
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,250
the sub-bureau

273
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,220
did question everyone involved,

274
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,300
and their conclusion is that

275
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,650
it was an accident.

276
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,420
Then how should I explain this?

277
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,300
What do I tell the Guidance Group?

278
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,700
As soon as they requested
the second autopsy,

279
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,820
the body gets cremated 'by accident'?

280
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,060
The moment Hong Liang
left the crematorium,

281
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,130
the Guidance group
relocated their office.

282
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,770
They completely refused
to see my people.

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,250
And you expect me to go see them

284
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,100
with this?

285
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,530
- What should I tell them, huh?
- Hold on.

286
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,060
They did what?

287
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,530
That is outright distrust
of the Dongping Procuratorate.

288
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,980
Mr. Xu, be honest,

289
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,660
do you really

290
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,940
believe this report?

291
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:12,730
I...

292
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,040
[Hong, is there anything we or
the Jiangnan Procuratorate can help with?]

293
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,490
They must really not trust you

294
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,940
to relocate the office.

295
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,570
Now you want me to

296
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,940
settle this mess?

297
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,380
How shameless of me.

298
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,570
How did it get to this point?

299
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,980
With this cremation incident,

300
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,810
it'll even be harder
to earn back their trust.

301
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,050
Earn back their trust?

302
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,620
They will never trust you again.

303
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,010
Haven't you thought about

304
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,700
why the Provincial People's Procuratorate
ordered the second autopsy?

305
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,730
And just when they requested the body,

306
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,980
it's cremated by accident?

307
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:01,810
Honestly,

308
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,980
I don't have words.

309
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,530
See for yourself.

310
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,880
[Thank you, Ms. Lan. I'll be sure
to contact you if we need anything.]

311
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,220
Aright…

312
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,180
Put him down.

313
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,620
Wan Chao,

314
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,620
I think I've been too kind to you.

315
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,940
Still want to act tough?

316
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,380
Ready to back down yet?

317
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,530
You're not worthy of speaking to me.

318
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,460
Won't you look at him?

319
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,940
Wang Yu,

320
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,090
kill me if you've got the guts.

321
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,460
Get him up.

322
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,090
Seriously, you're still acting

323
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,570
like a punk at this age?

324
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,250
And what's with that hair color?

325
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,660
Let me tell you,

326
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,860
clearly your father failed,

327
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,010
so I'll discipline you for him.

328
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,460
Screw you.

329
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,570
Wang Yu!

330
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,900
Wang Yu!

331
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,980
Wang Yu!

332
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,380
Wang Yu!

333
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,530
Wang Yu,

334
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,700
my dad saved you.

335
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,010
Without him,

336
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,290
you'd still be begging for scraps

337
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,250
on the streets,

338
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,770
you ungrateful wretch!

339
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,380
Kicking me when I'm down, huh?

340
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,490
Here's my proposition.

341
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,700
Say yes,

342
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,460
and you can remain the manager

343
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,050
of this freight station.

344
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,050
I'll pay you,

345
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,900
and I won't interfere
with how you run it.

346
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:39,940
And

347
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,380
if you're able to increase profits,

348
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,570
I'll even throw in some shares too.

349
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,730
Fair enough?

350
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,940
You'll pay me in cash?

351
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,940
Tell Zhang Wenjing

352
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,090
to draft a contract as I specified.

353
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,290
Come,

354
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,530
let's take a photo together.

355
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,490
Yeah.

356
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,620
To remember this.

357
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,140
C'mon. One, two.

358
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,050
After some thought,

359
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,900
I think you're right.

360
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,770
Your father

361
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,860
did help me back then.

362
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,050
Now that he's back in prison

363
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,290
and you're struggling,

364
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,730
how about this,

365
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,380
I'll give you 25 million.

366
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,620
Tell your dad

367
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,770
to transfer the property

368
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,570
back to me,

369
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,660
and we'll call it even.

370
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,460
Deal?

371
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,810
Wang Yu,

372
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,660
I know exactly what you're after.

373
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,810
Let me make this perfectly clear to you:

374
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,420
no way.

375
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,730
As long as I'm alive,

376
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,010
you're not taking

377
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,980
this freight station.

378
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,140
What?

379
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,490
Trying to intimidate me?

380
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,620
Go ahead,

381
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,660
let's see

382
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,660
if you have the guts to kill me.

383
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,660
Still talking back?

384
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,290
You,

385
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,490
take his video.

386
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,290
Take his video

387
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,900
and I'll have Zijian
show it to your father.

388
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,490
Go ahead and speak.

389
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,180
Dad,

390
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,940
I am still holding on.

391
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,490
Listen up,

392
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,770
if I can still hold on out here,

393
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,490
you must hold on inside

394
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,050
as well!

395
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,730
Dad,

396
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,090
once you're released,

397
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,860
please kill that b*stard Wang Yu!

398
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,290
Kill him!

399
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,460
What is wrong with you?

400
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,860
Bring it on!

401
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,010
Bring it on!

402
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,600
[16 March
Day 18 Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

403
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,360
[16 March
Day 19 Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

404
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,490
Right now,

405
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,730
I'm surviving solely on these drinks.

406
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,570
I'm so sick of the takeout

407
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,180
and instant noodles.

408
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,220
The instant noodles have
numerous flavors,

409
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,900
try something else.

410
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,730
Mr. Wang,

411
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:02,860
how much longer

412
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,250
do you think

413
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,050
we still have to wait?

414
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,810
The officials

415
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,220
must follow proper procedures,

416
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,290
step by step.

417
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:12,940
Just be patient a little longer.

418
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,330
Zhang,

419
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,180
can you go ask?

420
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,770
Sir, ma'am,

421
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,700
has Commissioner Sun responded yet?

422
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,700
That's not your concern.

423
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,050
We're not even worried,

424
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,810
so why are you?

425
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,460
It's been three days.

426
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,660
Should we keep waiting?

427
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,700
They changed vehicles again today.

428
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,420
Did Commissioner Sun specify

429
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,050
how long we should wait
when you briefed him?

430
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,050
I don't know that brand,

431
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,090
but it looks expensive.

432
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,570
I can't keep waiting.

433
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,380
It's too frustrating.

434
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,010
Isn't that

435
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,940
a woman in the car?

436
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,490
I'm being serious.

437
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,810
And I've told you seriously

438
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,660
several times.

439
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,290
When I briefed the Commissioner,

440
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,290
he just said,

441
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,140
"wait".

442
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,980
I think that means

443
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,900
we need to

444
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,250
wait.

445
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,940
Wait?

446
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,980
Is this how Eleventh Division operates?

447
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,700
What, First Division
never had any delays?

448
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,530
We don't!

449
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,180
First Division doesn't operate this way!

450
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,940
You can quit anytime,

451
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,770
but I can't.

452
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,530
I have to keep working.

453
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,770
Remember, Hong Liang,

454
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,010
this operation was your proposal.

455
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,730
You'll bear full responsibility
if anything goes wrong.

456
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,860
You're the leader,

457
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,660
I'm just a deputy.

458
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,700
I merely made a suggestion

459
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,940
which you approved.

460
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,460
The decision was ultimately yours.

461
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,420
You even praised me at the time.

462
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,250
You... I...

463
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,940
This is all your problem.

464
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,490
Don't resort to violence.

465
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,250
This is the third one today.

466
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,490
We're all drowning
in phone calls these days.

467
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,010
I've never complained.

468
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,660
Ms. Zheng.

469
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,730
Ms. Lan.

470
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,010
Hong Liang,

471
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,460
I heard everyone's been working hard,

472
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,810
and would like to
invite you all to dinner

473
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,460
in the canteen of

474
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,730
Political and Legal Affairs Commission,

475
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,180
what do you say?

476
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:12,980
Hello?

477
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,490
Sorry, Ms. Lan, the line broke.

478
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,420
Could you repeat?

479
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,010
I said everyone's been working hard

480
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,530
and would like to invite you all
to a simple dinner in the canteen,

481
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,980
what do you say?

482
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,860
Sounds great.

483
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,330
When works best for you?

484
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,380
Ma'am,

485
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,140
whenever suits you best.

486
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,290
Alright,

487
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,730
no time like present.

488
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,900
How about tonight,

489
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,570
say 6:30 PM?

490
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,700
Perfect.

491
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,620
I'll send a car for you.

492
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,900
We have a car.

493
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,660
Very well,

494
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,770
see you at 6:30 PM.

495
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,090
Alright, Ms. Lan, see you tonight.

496
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,530
Mr. Cheng.

497
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,530
Mr. Wan.

498
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,700
Sorry for making you come here.

499
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,900
Mr. Wan,

500
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,620
what couldn't you tell me over the phone

501
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,770
that I had to come here?

502
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,770
Please, sit.

503
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,700
Have a seat.

504
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,330
Have some tea first.

505
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,530
Mr. Wan,

506
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,180
if Wang Yu has Wan Chao,

507
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,250
you should call the police.

508
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,570
Why did you call me?

509
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,980
You could help me

510
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,900
more than the police.

511
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,980
Please, have some tea.

512
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,770
I am

513
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,530
merely a lawyer.

514
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,860
I can be your brother's attorney,

515
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,810
but there's nothing else

516
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,420
I could do.

517
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,330
Mr. Cheng,

518
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,010
we've known each other a long time,

519
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:37,980
do...

520
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,290
do you really take me for a fool?

521
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,700
Are you really representing my brother,

522
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,900
or Wang Yu?

523
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,140
You can't do this.

524
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,290
I see.

525
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,570
If you're not satisfied with my defense,

526
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,810
you can have my client,

527
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,050
your brother,

528
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,090
fire me.

529
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,660
But this isn't something

530
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,530
we can just casually agree on
between the two of us.

531
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,090
It has to go through
formal legal procedures.

532
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,810
On behalf of

533
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,290
Political and Legal Affairs Commission,

534
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,180
I'd like to thank everyone
in the Guidance Group with this dinner.

535
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,380
Renjun has reported to me

536
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,460
the diligent work

537
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,730
your team has been doing.

538
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,620
It has really helped us

539
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,010
resolve many issues.

540
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,090
Ms. Lan, you flatter us.

541
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,530
We were just

542
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,420
doing our job.

543
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,290
Here,

544
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,810
a toast

545
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,420
to the Guidance Group.

546
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,900
Here. Thank you!

547
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:44,980
Cheer.

548
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,860
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

549
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,660
Please be seated.

550
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,290
Alright,

551
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,660
let's dig in.

552
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,620
The Guidance Group

553
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,050
has indeed been

554
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,940
a great help to us,

555
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,460
and offered us a chance

556
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,330
to reflect and grow.

557
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,090
That's too kind.

558
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:22,900
We only hope

559
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,810
we haven't caused you any trouble.

560
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,380
What are you

561
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,730
talking about?

562
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,290
We're all colleagues,

563
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,180
and we all want to solve this case.

564
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,770
Mr. Xu,

565
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,570
brief us

566
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,330
on Qiao Zhenxing's case.

567
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,250
An extensive investigation

568
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,700
has confirmed

569
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,090
that the body

570
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,180
was cremated

571
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,330
by accident.

572
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,290
We understand

573
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,050
you have doubts about
whether it was truly accidental,

574
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,940
but our findings did reveal

575
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,010
clear lapses

576
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,770
in the crematorium's

577
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,860
operating procedures.

578
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,660
So it's no surprise something like this

579
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,180
could happen.

580
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,050
It is

581
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,290
statistically improbable

582
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,380
yet

583
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,380
theoretically possible.

584
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,530
I was

585
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,810
skeptical as well

586
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,290
when Mr. Xu told me.

587
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,290
But like Mr. Xu said,

588
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,570
it's unlikely

589
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,420
but not completely impossible.

590
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,090
It was

591
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,420
a mere misfortune.

592
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,490
Yeah…

593
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,090
How about this,

594
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,980
Lei Guangfa is still in custody,

595
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,730
the Guidance Group

596
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,940
could interrogate him again

597
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,770
with our accompaniment.

598
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,570
You're also free to question him alone

599
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,730
without our presence,

600
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,420
as well as others involved—

601
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,220
the other cremator,

602
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,620
the funeral director,

603
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,460
and Lei Guangfa's gambling associates.

604
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,940
In short,

605
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,570
the Guidance Group

606
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,700
has our full

607
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,570
and unwavering cooperation.

608
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,220
We believe

609
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,250
Dongping Bureau's report.

610
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,700
It was an accident.

611
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,250
Let's dig in.

612
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:02,940
Yeah.

613
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,050
Dig in.

614
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,730
Mr. Cheng,

615
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,860
though you only came

616
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,900
after Zhang Wenjing's arrest,

617
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,420
you've long been involved in this case.

618
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,900
It wasn't hard to uncover your connection

619
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,050
to Wang Yu.

620
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,250
Dongping is only this big,

621
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,530
right?

622
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,050
And your links

623
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,570
with the Municipal Procuratorate

624
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,570
are even more obvious.

625
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,220
And it was all

626
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,180
clearly stated in your CV.

627
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,380
You were a prosecutor

628
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,620
just like Xie Hongfei.

629
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,220
And your fiancée

630
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,380
is Municipal Procuratorate's

631
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,620
prosecutor-general's sister,

632
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,940
am I correct?

633
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,330
Differences of opinion

634
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,770
are normal

635
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,660
in the workplace,

636
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,220
but there's no need to hide them.

637
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,420
Just lay everything on the table,

638
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,420
and we'll

639
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,860
solve the problems together, okay?

640
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,380
Go sit down.

641
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,610
I really need to

642
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,940
criticize you.

643
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,860
The problems keep coming up,

644
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,980
what does that say?

645
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,690
It means there's still a significant gap

646
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,690
between us and them.

647
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,050
Otherwise the Provincial Procuratorate
wouldn't have sent the Guidance Group.

648
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,380
So, I'm here

649
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,900
to make my stance clear.

650
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,690
Everyone in the Guidance Group,

651
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,980
please carry out your work
without worries.

652
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,210
Do what you

653
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,530
have to do,

654
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,530
and don't worry if it'll embarrass us.

655
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,820
Let's not be cruel, shall we?

656
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,050
My brother has only one son.

657
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,900
He will put up

658
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,860
with a lot,

659
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,650
but if anything happens to Wan Chao,

660
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,980
you all know his temper.

661
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,010
And you need to stop pushing me.

662
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,260
If you keep pushing,

663
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,650
one day I might really
go to the Guidance Group.

664
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,260
Then I won't promise

665
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,300
what I'll tell them.

666
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,010
Dongping Hotel.

667
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,490
I know the way.

668
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,860
Mr. Cheng,

669
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,940
let's stop pretending.

670
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,380
Have Wang Yu do the math—

671
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,490
is Wan Chao worth more,

672
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,650
or is this lawsuit?

673
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,010
Fine.

674
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,820
I understand.

675
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,690
But listen carefully,

676
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,380
the Guidance Group is here

677
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,940
to guide,

678
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,300
to offer 'guidance'.

679
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,420
Don't expect them

680
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,490
to do all the work for you.

681
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,900
There are only a few of them.

682
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,490
They can't possibly handle
every single thing themselves.

683
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,610
Besides,

684
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,570
if you do everything for them,

685
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,820
won't that just make them lazy

686
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,340
and complacent?

687
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,610
Thank you, Ms. Lan,
for your trust and guidance.

688
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,050
We'll try our best.

689
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,490
I've learned a lot

690
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,940
from everyone here as well.

691
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,340
I'm also considering

692
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,380
whether I should go back

693
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,130
and discuss with my superior

694
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,130
how to proceed

695
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,740
with the following work.

696
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,260
Of course.

697
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,460
In short,

698
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,050
I hope everyone

699
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,300
can be open-minded

700
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,570
and work together in the future.

701
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,340
We are a team.

702
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,980
It's just one case.

703
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,740
We've got this.

704
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,160
[Commissioner Sun
I'll be at Dongping Hotel in 15 minutes.]

705
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,940
Aren't you cold?

706
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:03,740
What's going on?

707
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,300
Commissioner Sun will arrive
at Dongping Hotel

708
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,740
in fifteen minutes.

709
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,610
Really?

710
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,170
Mr. Wang!

711
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,650
Oh my god!

712
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:22,860
It's true!

713
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,170
Mr. Wang!

714
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,570
He's finally here!

715
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,740
My goodness!

716
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,860
Why... Why didn't he tell me?

717
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,010
Because I'm the leader.

718
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,520
[Sun Xiangqun
Director of Eleventh Division]

719
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,820
You've been stuck in this room
for three days.

720
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,130
Looks like you've done a lot of work.

721
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,210
First, I have some good news for you.

722
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,940
The Technical Information Center
has analyzed

723
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,570
[Forensic Handwriting Analysis Report]
Zhang Wenjing's signatures,

724
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,340
and found three of them
are possibly forged.

725
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,380
Commissioner,

726
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:21,980
Mr. Wang was the first

727
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,900
to suspect Zhang Wenjing's signatures.

728
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,570
Good job, Chunxiang.

729
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,460
Lately, you've been refusing to see
anyone from the Municipal Procuratorate,

730
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,210
and I get it.

731
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,420
If we had found anything by now,

732
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,740
it would be truly embarrassing.

733
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,130
Isn't that right, Hong Liang?

734
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,420
Sir.

735
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,050
I hope you realize

736
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,420
how serious this is.

737
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,980
The stakes are high,

738
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,380
you must think carefully.

739
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,820
Once the bow is drawn,

740
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,530
there's no turning back.

741
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,050
I need your clear stance.

742
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,090
Under

743
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,170
Ms. Zheng's leadership...

744
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,130
We must draw the bow.

745
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,650
There's no turning back.

746
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:12,820
Commissioner,

747
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,420
as the leader,

748
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,980
I'm willing to take full responsibility

749
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,740
if anything goes wrong

750
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,300
because of a misjudgment.

751
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:53,820
Good.

752
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,490
I am here to tell you

753
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,530
Provincial Party Committee's decision:

754
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,860
you may conduct investigations

755
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,210
on Li Renjun

756
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,130
and Xie Hongfei.

757
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,740
Considering the upcoming workload,

758
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,210
Haoze and Liang

759
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,170
will stay behind to assist you.

760
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,900
On the day Qiao Zhenxing's body
was cremated,

761
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,460
after receiving a call from Li Renjun,

762
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,650
Xie Hongfei immediately
called Cheng Zijian.

763
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,380
The call lasted 56 seconds.

764
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,820
I need to report something.

765
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,170
Cheng Zijian

766
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,460
is Wan Hai's defense lawyer,

767
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,170
as well as Li Renjun's
future brother-in-law.

768
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,010
So,

769
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,050
was Li Renjun

770
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,940
telling Cheng Zijian to...

771
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,420
When Li Renjun got news
of the second autopsy,

772
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,740
he didn't tell Cheng Zijian directly,

773
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:57,210
but passed the message
through Xie Hongfei.

774
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,740
But why increase the risk

775
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,900
by telling another person?

776
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,980
So you think

777
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,690
calling Cheng Zijian

778
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,610
was likely

779
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,900
Xie Hongfei acting on his own.

780
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,780
I'll go back to Haizhou tomorrow morning.

781
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,420
Keep me updated.

782
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:19,980
Hold on.

783
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,490
This is

784
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,650
a USB drive Qiao Zhenxing left
before he died.

785
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,380
It contains all his investigation

786
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,260
and analysis

787
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,460
on the Wan Hai case.

788
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,490
Please review it.

789
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,380
Ma Chongyang gave this to me personally.

790
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:50,440
[17 March
Day 20 Since the Wan Hai Case Trial Began]

791
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,210
Care to explain?

792
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:55,900
Mr. Li,

793
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,740
I just got these results

794
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,420
and immediately

795
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,420
sent them to
the Judicial Expertise Center,

796
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,010
but there's no reply yet.

797
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:05,610
Mr. Xie,

798
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,530
what did you tell me

799
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,340
at that time?

800
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,820
The evidence provided
by public security was solid,

801
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,820
sufficient, and unquestionable.

802
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,650
We've worked on this case
for over two years,

803
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,570
how come problems keep popping up
ever since the Guidance Group came?

804
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,900
Is this how you handle the case?
