00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,340
no wonder you asked Cao Ye
to come here first.

Ever since we set up the Task Force,

74
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,410
you've been slouching around
like this every day.

75
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,490
What on earth do you want?

76
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,100

Do I read it or not?

79
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,530
I went back to Dongping a while ago.

80
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,250
I didn't expect

81
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,420
that Qiao was investigating

82
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,940

before he died.

83
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,060
Neither did I expect
the mistakes to be that serious.

84
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,730
So I wrote up this report.

85
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,940
I was going to give it to Mr. Zhang.

86
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,340
Is what you wrote in here true?

87
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,940
Did you guys really
mess up the case back then?

88
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,220
It's pretty much confirmed.

89
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,420
Then why didn't you

90
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,220
hand it to Mr. Zhang?

91
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,530
I was going to.

92
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,220
I even had it in my hand the other day.

93
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,250
But then you knocked, went in,

94
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,730
and showed us Jiang Hongjun's video.

95
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,820
Then you just dragged me

96
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,460
into this team, no questions asked.

97
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,940
I even tried to stop you. Remember?

98
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,370
I did. But you didn't listen.

99
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,770
So why didn't you hand it in
after I left?

100
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,060
I took a chance.

101
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,980
That's how people are.

102

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,460
you start hoping for the best.

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,490
In my eyes, there's only
right and wrong,

124
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,650

125
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,370

126
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,770

127
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,580

128

I have no one to turn to!

129
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,820
I had to come to you!

130
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,460
I thought that

131
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,420
after doing this job for over 20 years,

132
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,890

133
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,300
Who'd have thought

134
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,370
it would blow up like this?

135
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,820
Maybe I'll take off
the prosecutor's uniform

136
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,890
and end up in a prison jumpsuit.

137
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,060

138
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,060
if I take the fall for this,

139
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,850
I can't stay in the Task Force.

140
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,820
Then what?

141
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,700
I won't be able to look into

142

143
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,650

144
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,580
would stay dead without any answers.

145
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,460
I won't be able to help

147
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,060

163
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,980
he went furious.

164
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,700
Did you push him too hard?

165
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,700
Then he asked me

166
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,010
how to file an appeal.

167
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,130

170
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,340

176
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,250

to take care of before...?

177
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,530

191
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,370
Isn't that enough?

192
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,220
Don't go overboard.

193
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,130
Don't think we can clean up
all your messes.

194
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,060
Back then,

195
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,060
things only worked out
because that one up top helped.

196
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,300
Otherwise, no one would've
risked that for you,

197
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,700
taking on your mess.

198
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,300
That's not something
a few people could fix.

199
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,060
Chen Shenglong, let me ask you.

200
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,370
Now,

201
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,940
is that person up top

202
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,340
still covering you?

203
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,300
So,

204
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,490
get your head straight.

205
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,340
Don't keep pushing it,

206
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,460
and don't push your luck!

207
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,180
If this blows up,
none of us walks away clean.

208
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,250
What do you mean?

209
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,700
Who do you think you're yelling at?

210
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,650
Can't you talk nicely?

211
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,250
What now?

212
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,980
You're still breathing here because of me!

213
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,890
Wang Dayou,
why your name is now Xiong Lei?

214
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,770
Don't you remember?

215
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,420
I changed my name
from Wang Dayou to Xiong Lei.

216
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,980
Did you do it for nothing?

217
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,250
Did you not get paid?

218
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,100
Did you call in any favors?

219
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,610
I'm telling you...

220
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,010
What?

221
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,580
I don't even want to look at you.

222
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,530
Cut it out!

223
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,890
Here's your chance, come on, now.

224
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,300
What?

225
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:24,940
Hit me, come on!

226
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:25,980
Listen up.

227
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,420
A new ID card

228
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,420
doesn't mean you're someone now.

229
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,700
Without me, you'd be dead already!

230
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,730
My power plant is short on garbage.

231
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,770
You wanna be in it?

232
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,340
Do you wanna die?

233
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,370
Everyone, take a look.

234
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,700
This is the first arrest operation
carried out by our Task Force

235
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,180
since its establishment.

236
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,890
Let's have Mr. Hong

237
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,730
give us a quick briefing.

238
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,460
Alright,

239
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,610
let me walk you through
the basic situation.

240
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,010
After several days of surveillance,

241
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,650
we found that the target

242
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,490
follows a fairly regular routine.

243
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,890
Especially on weekdays.

244
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,940
Every morning

245
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,980
between 7:10 and 7:15,

246
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,940
he leaves to drop his kid off at school.

247
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,100
It takes 20 minutes

248
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,100
from his home to the school.

249
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,700
Because parking is not allowed
at the school gate,

250
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,010
he usually parks his car

251
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,010
on the roadside diagonally
across from the school

252
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,060
and then walks the kid over.

253
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,420
About five minutes later,
he returns to his car

254
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,650
and drives to work.

255
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,890
Now I'll go over

256
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,060
the arrest plan jointly formulated

257
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,220
by Mr. Hong and Captain Hu Zhinan.

258
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,010
First,

259
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,140
Zhang and I

260
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,180
will keep watching
in the underground garage

261
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,220
of the target's residence.

262
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,770
As soon as the target leaves,

263
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,010
we'll head upstairs immediately.

264
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,660
Captain Hu Zhinan

265
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,420
will lead a team

266
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,220
to set up surveillance
near the school gate,

267
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,810
waiting for the right moment
to make the arrest.

268
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,010
I'll be in charge on-site.

269
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:21,940
I'm on Channel 1.

270
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,140
Please switch your walkie-talkies
to Frequency 11.

271
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,290
If there are no questions,
let's move out.

272
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,560
[Block 2]

273
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,010
Ate enough?

274
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,810
Yes.

275
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,900
Target spotted.

276
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,730
Vehicle departing.

277
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,620
Go.

278
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,380
You are?

279
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,530
We're from the Procuratorate.

280
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,600
[Search Warrant]
Conducting a lawful search

281
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,980
of Jiang Hongjun's residence.

282
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,810
What happened

283
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,380
to my husband?

284
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:36,860
Thank you.

285
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,570
Search thoroughly.

286
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,770
Check carefully, hurry.

287
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,860
Target spotted.

288
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,810
All units, stay alert.

289
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,660
Does Captain Jiang often read?

290
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,250
Those books were left by his father.

291
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,730
Thought so.

292
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,810
Remember, healthy lunch.

293
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,290
Ning.

294
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,530
Give Daddy a kiss.

295
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,620
The kid has entered the school.

296
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,380
Go.

297
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,660
The target's fleeing toward Anning Street.

298
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,330
This is Anning Street.

299
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,180
Your kid goes to school right next door,

300
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,220
and you're trying to run?

301
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,700
Doesn't look very good.

302
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,250
Don't move.

303
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,250
Mr. Cao.

304
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,570
How was it?

305
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,860
Found nothing.

306
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,420
Nothing.

307
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,660
No...

308
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,010
Let's pull out.

309
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,860
Sorry for the disturbance.

310
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,810
Who lives next door?

311
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,250
Who lives next door?

312
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,620
I'm asking you.

313
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,700
My next door

314
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,330
is Jiang's brother's place,

315
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,620
but he's abroad.

316
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,860
No one's lived there for a long time.

317
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,660
Open the door.

318
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,420
Zhang.

319
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,700
Zhang!

320
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,330
After sending the email

321
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,460
to Ms. Zheng from this computer,

322
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,900
Wan Chao left the Internet café,

323
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,730
walked through this alley,

324
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,380
and disappeared.

325
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,530
The area's a mess,

326
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,380
no good surveillance.

327
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,530
So we lost the trail after that.

328
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,490
Our team was on-site quickly

329
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:23,810
but

330
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,660
has found no leads.

331
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,180
We've already deployed
plainclothes officers in Dongping

332
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,010
to keep looking for him.

333
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,940
Thank you.

334
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,180
Mr. Song, I know

335
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,010
the police officers are
under a heavy workload.

336
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,660
But I still hope

337
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,900
you can track a few leads for us.

338
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,860
I'm glad to, Ms. Zheng.

339
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,660
These people

340
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,460
[List of Individuals to be Investigated]
are key figures in the Wan Hai case.

341
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,490
When our Guidance Group
went to Dongping earlier,

342
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,490
we found some leads

343
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,460
but couldn't follow up
due to interference.

344
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,730
I hope you can help me

345
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,090
investigate them thoroughly.

346
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,010
Their backgrounds,

347
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,220
social connections,

348
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,660
communications, and bank statements.

349
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,010
Okay.

350
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,010
Meanwhile,

351
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,420
we still have to find Wan Chao
as soon as possible.

352
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:07,810
Please.

353
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,250
No problem.

354
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,090
Buying cigarettes?

355
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,940
I need to make a call.
Do you have a phone?

356
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,730
Yeah, inside.

357
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,220
Who's that?

358
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,220
Uncle,

359
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,620
it's me,

360
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,490
Chao?

361
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,050
Where are you?

362
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,730
I can't get out.

363
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,250
I'm still in Dongping.

364
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,250
The cops have my face
on wanted posters

365
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,530
everywhere.

366
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,420
And someone else is after me too.

367
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,460
I'm hiding in that old factory,

368
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,770
the bathhouse, remember?

369
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,620
I stay there now.

370
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,660
Uncle, come quickly.

371
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,900
I'm starving.

372
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,900
Okay, I see.

373
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,290
Listen,

374
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,250
don't go anywhere,

375
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,220
just stay hidden.

376
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,940
I'm coming to you.

377
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,090
Okay, I'll wait for you there.

378
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,290
Okay...

379
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,160
[Dongping Public Security Bureau]

380
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,090
Mr. Sun.

381
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,490
Hello?

382
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,090
Mr. Sun.

383
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,770
This morning, a whole team
came and searched my house.

384
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:42,810
And

385
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,570
they found cash at home.

386
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,700
That's ridiculous.

387
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,420
Why would you keep cash at home?

388
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,860
Did they show any certificates?

389
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,090
They did, but

390
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,940
I was so scared.

391
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,490
I don't remember

392
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,330
anything they said.

393
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,290
After they left,

394
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,050
I tried to call Jiang

395
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,860
but couldn't reach him.

396
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,460
I didn't know what to do,

397
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,900
so I called you.

398
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,180
Mr. Sun.

399
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,460
You must save Jiang.

400
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,490
Okay, I got it.

401
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,810
Wait for my update.

402
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,660
And keep your mouth shut,

403
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,330
don't tell anybody anything.

404
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,570
Where is this?

405
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,570
Let me go!

406
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,140
Where is this?

407
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,050
Turn to the side.

408
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,770
Chao, it's me.

409
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:57,900
Chao.

410
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,380
Chao.

411
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,380
Chao.

412
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:21,620
Chao.

413
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,860
Chao.

414
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,140
Uncle.

415
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,330
Where have you been?

416
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,620
Do you know how much trouble
you got into?

417
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,530
I haven't eaten for two days.

418
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,330
It hurts.

419
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,660
Hungry?

420
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,460
I brought you food.

421
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,140
Don't cry.

422
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,140
It's okay now.

423
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,700
So miserable...

424
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,530
Here, drink some water first.

425
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,730
No. I want food.

426
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,380
What you wanna eat? Take a look.

427
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,620
There's sausage.

428
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,380
Sausage.

429
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,530
Thank God I found you.

430
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,530
Chao.

431
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,530
This place is not good.

432
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,860
Not safe enough.

433
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,090
We have to move to another place.

434
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,420
They've been looking for you
all over the past two days.

435
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,940
Maybe they'll come here soon.

436
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,330
They?

437
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,010
Who are they?

438
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,250
Who?

439
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,010
Police, who else?

440
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,730
This place is sealed by the police.

441
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,900
If the cops don't come here,

442
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,730
who's trying to catch me?

443
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,490
I mean, what if the police come?

444
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,460
If they catch you, it's over.

445
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,620
Listen to me.

446
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,770
Come with me.

447
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,420
- Hurry.
- Where are we going?

448
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,090
The mine.

449
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,570
What? Isn't that sealed too?

450
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,490
What's the difference?

451
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,730
The mine is more dangerous than here.

452
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,490
The more dangerous the place,
the safer it actually is.

453
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,420
Hiding in plain sight.
Ever heard of it, kid?

454
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,530
Go!

455
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,250
What now?

456
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,570
Uncle.

457
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,980
I owe you an apology.

458
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,620
I shouldn't have gone mining secretly.

459
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,090
Don't talk about that now, let's go.

460
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,330
What I want to tell you is…

461
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,770
I swear

462
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,530
I checked

463
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,940
every single safety measure
before we started.

464
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,530
No way anything could've gone wrong.

465
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,980
If someone did this to us,

466
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,460
who would that be, Uncle?
Who did we offend?

467
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,460
Chao...

468
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,290
Nobody did it to us.

469
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,770
We didn't offend anyone.

470
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,180
Remember, this was an accident.

471
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,420
Just an accident.

472
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,330
Don't think about anything.

473
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,220
As long as you're safe,

474
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,570
your father didn't go to jail for nothing.

475
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,220
Understand?

476
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,290
Keeping you alive is
all that matters now.

477
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,460
Keep who alive?

478
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,700
Keep me alive?

479
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,660
Who's trying to kill me?

480
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,250
Uncle.

481
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,420
I'm begging you.

482
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,180
If you know something, tell me!

483
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,620
I don't know anything!

484
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,770
All I know now is
nothing can happen to you.

485
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,250
Nothing can happen to you!

486
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,050
Chao,

487
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,620
can you listen to me?

488
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,460
I'd never hurt you.

489
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,460
Go.

490
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,660
Wait...

491
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,180
Where is this?

492
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:50,730
Be quiet.

493
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,490
Let go of me.

494
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,940
Turn around.

495
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,490
Do not move.

496
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,010
Who's in charge here?

497
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,380
What's the meaning of this?

498
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,250
We're on the same side.

499
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,220
Hong Liang!

500
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,250
Hong Liang!

501
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,940
Have you got it?

502
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,730
Yes.

503
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,340
How much?

504
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,900
3.23 million in cash and 28 gold bars.

505
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,490
I'll send it to Luo.

506
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,260
Okay.

507
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,490
Bring your superior here.

508
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,260
Where is he?

509
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,340
Anyone here?

510
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,780
You arrested me and just leave me here?

511
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,490
Sorry, I'm late.

512
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,570
Shall we start?

513
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,610
Name?

514
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:49,530
Name?

515
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,130
Jiang Hongjun, can't you hear me?

516
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,300
You already know that, why ask?

517
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:58,860
Captain Jiang,

518
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,460
you're an old hand
in criminal investigations.

519
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,050
Is it really worth your time

520
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,050
to nitpick the basic procedures?

521
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,820
An old hand getting bullied
by some rookie.

522
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,530
Do you think I'd just accept that?

523
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,300
What's this, kid?

524
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,490
You think you can interrogate me?

525
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,260
When I was doing interrogations,
you were still in diapers.

526
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,260
Right.

527
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,690
I'm young.

528
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,900
But Haidong Provincial Procuratorate
is not.

529
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,340
Hong Liang.

530
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,980
You say it.

531
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,940
Show the young one some respect.

532
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,900
Let him get some practice.

533
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:41,980
Jiang Hongjun.

534
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,860
42 years old.

535
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,340
Ethnicity, Han.

536
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,340
Place of origin,
Xinhua District, Dongping City.

537
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,090
Position and occupation,

538
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,940
Captain
of the Criminal Investigation Unit,

539
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,380
Dongping Development Zone sub-bureau.

540
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,610
Married.

541
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,740
My wife is a full-time housewife.

542
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,650
I have a daughter who is ten years old

543
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,740
and in third grade of primary school.

544
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,650
Anything missing?

545
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,260
Shouldn't you show me
a little respect too?

546
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,610
What's with all these restraints?

547
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,940
If you don't get something
clear out of me today,

548
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,380
Hong Liang,

549
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,940
once I get out,
you must take full responsibility.

550
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,050
How can I handle
that kind of responsibility?

551
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,420
You guys

552
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,420
were too rough.

553
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,420
He's from the political-legal system.

554
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,570
He won't hurt you.

555
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,490
Come on, hurry.

556
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,820
We're newly set up,

557
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,570
and everything's chaotic.

558
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,170
I didn't get a chance
to brief them properly.

559
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,090
Plus,

560
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,740
you're the first one we've arrested...

561
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,340
invited.

562
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,460
So they went a bit too welcoming.

563
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,460
Hope you understand.

564
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,570
Captain Jiang.

565
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,260
Stand up...

566
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,210
Stretch a bit.

567
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,690
Since getting in your car,

568
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,980
I've counted about

569
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,900
28 intersections.

570
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,940
I'm getting old

571
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,740
and can't remember that well.

572
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,380
Did you

573
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,780
turn left or right

574
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,010
at the 12th intersection…?

575
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,820
What are you shooting?

576
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,740
Souvenir shot for the opening day.

577
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,940
I asked you,

578
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,130
left or right?

579
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,900
Left or right?

580
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,610
Does that matter?

581
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,010
If it was a left turn,
you're just circling around in Dongping.

582
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,860
If it was a right turn,

583
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,380
then we're in Jiangnan now.

584
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,650
See how familiar he is
with the roads.

585
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,010
That's the charm
of a seasoned investigator.

586
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:45,780
Respect.

587
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:48,940
We turned right.

588
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,380
Off-site investigation.

589
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:03,420
Look,

590
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,260
you don't have to feel pressured.

591
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,780
You're just here
to assist with some questions.

592
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,010
I ask, and you answer.

593
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,170
Tell us what you know
and what you're willing to share.

594
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,900
But of course,

595
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,530
you'll need to stand by what you say.

596
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,940
I'll be responsible too.

597
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,740
If there's something you don't know
or don't want to say,

598
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,820
you don't have to.

599
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:23,980
I'm not here to force you

600
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,610
or pin anything on you.

601
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,260
I know,

602
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,900
being in this seat all of a sudden

603
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,740
is quite a shock.

604
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,460
I'm only here

605
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,610
because of orders from above.

606
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:33,980
We each

607
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,460
have our roles to play.

608
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,130
That Wanchuan Mine,

609
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,780
where an accident happened
a few days ago,

610
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,090
is in your jurisdiction, right?

611
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,170
So was your Criminal Investigation Unit

612
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,820
one of the first

613
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,300
to arrive on the scene?

614
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,300
What about it?

615
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,380
There was a mine accident,

616
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,690
casualties,

617
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,780
maybe a confrontation.

618
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,010
We've gotta be there,

619
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,940
control the scene,

620
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,980
and manage the situation.

621
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,010
So I asked you,

622
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,050
was your unit

623
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,300
one of the first to arrive on the scene?

624
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,860
So when the police dispatch center

625
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,460
got the report about the accident,

626
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,900
they didn't call

627
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,740
the local police station
or the law and order brigade first

628
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,570
but called Criminal Investigation Unit.

629
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,610
Is that right?

630
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,490
So when you got to the scene,

631
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,340
you must've been standing
right up front.

632
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,130
In the middle?

633
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,340
The very back?

634
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,740
If you were in the back,

635
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,860
that gave you a chance to slip away

636
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,740
without getting noticed.

637
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,130
Was there any moment

638
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,340
you moved around the site on your own?

639
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,210
No.

640
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,130
See,

641
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,780
you must not have heard it clearly.

642
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,170
What I asked you is,

643
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,860
did you act alone at any point

644
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,260
that night at the accident site?

645
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,860
Hong Liang, can you not
understand human language?

646
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,900
I told you

647
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,940
I didn't act alone. I didn't!

648
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,210
Why are you pinning this on me,
Hong Liang?

649
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:18,900
No...

650
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,530
- Don't move.
- Hong Liang.

651
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,340
Wait, I...

652
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,300
What is wrong with you?

653
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,050
Don't...

654
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,090
Don't buckle it.

655
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,170
I'm telling the truth.

656
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,740
Did I say anything wrong?

657
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,210
I've answered your question!

658
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,530
I just said

659
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,490
we both have to take responsibility
for our words.

660
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:35,900
I gave you a chance.

661
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,690
But you didn't cherish it.

662
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,860
Take a look at this video.

663
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,490
I recorded it.

664
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,050
I only sent it to Chao.

665
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,380
Wan Chao, right?

666
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,010
He sent it to us.

667
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,690
You saw that guy in the video
that night.

668
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,940
What else did he do later?

669
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,690
That day,

670
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,300
I shot this video from this spot.

671
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,650
After the man left,

672
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,690
I came in.

673
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,300
The floor was covered in oil.

674
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,780
Way more than you see here now.

675
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,860
The official police conclusion was

676
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,820
that the oil pipe was old

677
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,010
and leaking.

678
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,340
But a leak should be slow,
dripping little by little.

679
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,980
How could it cause such a huge puddle?

680
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,740
Someone clearly opened the valve

681
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,300
and let the oil

682
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,740
gush out all at once.

683
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,980
Look here.

684
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,010
This is obviously from a spray.

685
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,380
Would a drip splash this far?

686
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,610
Leave marks like this?

687
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,610
Also,

688
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,490
after the oil drained,

689
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,130
the winch lost traction.

690
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,610
That lifting cage

691
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,090
would fall off for sure.

692
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,690
That's no work accident.

693
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,690
It's obviously man-made sabotage.

694
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,130
You saw that video too.

695
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:57,980
This man

696
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,530
turned clockwise, back toward me.

697
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,460
He must've reattached

698
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,490
the valve

699
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,610
to fake a leak afterward.

700
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,340
Doesn't that make sense?

701
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,260
Manager,

702
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,940
was there anyone suspicious

703
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,340
who entered the winch room

704
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,980
before the accident?

705
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,860
I'm not sure.

706
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,780
I was in the duty room that night,

707
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,940
not handling the personnel arrangements.

708
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,260
Do you have the list

709
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,130
of the workers
who went underground that day?

710
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,900
You should ask Chen Hui about this.

711
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,130
It was his team that went down
that shift.

712
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,690
He works with the miners every day,

713
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,050
eats with them, and sleeps with them.

714
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,130
He knows.

715
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,490
Okay.

716
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,530
Thanks for your time.

717
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,380
Please don't talk to anyone about
what we discussed today.

718
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,300
This stays confidential.

719
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,860
If anything comes up,
contact us directly.

720
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,460
Give him our number.

721
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:52,860
Thank you.

722
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,380
Jiang Hongjun.

723
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:57,860
Section chief rank?

724
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,860
Your base salary

725
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,900
is just over 5,000 yuan a month.

726
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,340
And last month,

727
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,260
with all the bonuses and extras,

728
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,090
you took home 6,742 yuan.

729
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,860
According to what you said,

730
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,570
your kid's in school,
and your wife's unemployed.

731
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,530
You don't have any family business

732
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,940
or rental properties.

733
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,260
So your whole family
lives on your paycheck.

734
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,570
Do you have any other income sources?

735
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,380
Finances?

736
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,170
I can stand up to any scrutiny.

737
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,340
No extra income?

738
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:25,900
None.

739
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,460
Then any extra assets?

740
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,300
None.

741
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,690
No extra income, nor extra assets?

742
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,090
No.

743
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:31,980
Then where

744
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,130
did the 3.23 million in cash

745
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,650
and 28 gold bars come from?

746
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,420
You've got it all wrong.

747
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,570
My brother

748
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,050
does business abroad.

749
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,610
It's not safe over there,

750
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,460
so he stores his money in China.

751
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,530
All that money is his,

752
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,050
and it's in his house.

753
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,170
When did I ever say

754
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,820
