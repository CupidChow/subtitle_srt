1
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,010
Oh, yeah!

2
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,370
Is this all you can do?

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,860
We take money, not lives.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,730
Do you know your actions

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,860
almost ruined three years of our work?

6
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,980
So you've been in on this
for three years?

7
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,650
I've busted my ass

8
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,540
for this for three years!

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,940
I didn't do it for you!

10
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,730
If that's how you want to put it,
I won't argue.

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,200
[In the Name of Justice]

12
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,200
[Episode 21]

13
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,940
You're the one who said
the police report was wrong,

14
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,450
and took me to the hospital
to question Yang Zheng again.

15
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,100
You're also the one who wanted to
report it to Mr. Xu.

16
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,170
So, why won't you
sign the report I wrote?

17
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,130
Why won't you sign it?

18
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,060
Why won't you sign it?

19
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,260
Tell me!

20
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,010
Tell me!

21
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,010
Tell me why won't you sign it?

22
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,060
Fine, I'll tell you.

23
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,540
I'll tell you.

24
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,780
I didn't believe

25
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,260
that Yang Zheng is dead,

26
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,540
so I went to the hospital to see him.

27
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,010
Why are you here?

28
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,260
Mr. Xu told me Yang Zheng

29
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,450
changed his statement,

30
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,260
so I came to see why.

31
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,890
Yang Zheng

32
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,540
died.

33
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,660
So unfortunate.

34
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,780
Nice work recently.

35
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,010
You've really taken the initiative.

36
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,610
Captain Sun,

37
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,170
is the Criminal Investigation Unit
hiring new officers?

38
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,940
Submit a report,

39
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,660
and I'll get you transferred here.

40
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,450
We can work together from now on.

41
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,580
To be honest,

42
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,980
I wanted to

43
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,850
keep investigating,

44
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,660
but they transferred me
to the countryside.

45
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,540
I couldn't anymore.

46
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,290
I couldn't anymore!

47
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,540
Zijian, take a look.

48
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,410
Look at this.

49
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,290
See this?

50
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,660
These are all your phone numbers!

51
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,810
It's clear as daylight.

52
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,370
You've been involved with Wang Yu
for three years,

53
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,980
prior to the Wan Hai case.

54
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:52,900
What do we do now?

55
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,340
First thing tomorrow,

56
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,730
I'll have to give this to Li Renjun.

57
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,250
Say something!

58
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,020
Xie, calm down. It's not a big deal.

59
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,660
I'm perfectly calm right now.

60
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,100
Why did Li Renjun

61
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,810
ask me to look into this phone record?

62
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,660
Because he believed
he could connect it to Wang Yu,

63
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,980
which would in turn
lead to Tianlong Company,

64
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,250
and from there,

65
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,980
straight to me, Xie Hongfei!

66
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,930
Do you two even think?

67
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,540
All you do is eat!

68
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,460
Did you think once the case is closed,
it's all over?

69
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,340
Fools!

70
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,850
And you call yourself a lawyer?

71
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,290
Fool!

72
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,170
Xie,

73
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,460
have you ever taken any money
from Wang Yu?

74
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,610
That's ridiculous.
Why would I take money from Wang Yu?

75
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,460
You're the ones who wanted to
take down Wan Hai, not him.

76
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,460
So,

77
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,340
who was the one
that wanted to sue Wan Hai?

78
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,580
It was Wang Yu.

79
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,370
If something goes wrong,
they would trace it back to him.

80
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,730
They won't get you, or me.

81
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,020
Besides, Xie,

82
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,050
at this point,

83
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,290
who would be bold enough to claim
Wan Hai is not mafia?

84
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,490
Fine.

85
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,370
Fine.

86
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,610
I'll submit these call records
to the higher-ups

87
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,050
first thing tomorrow.

88
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,730
Mr. Chen,

89
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,810
Mr. Cheng,

90
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,540
let's leave the past behind us.

91
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,020
Now the case is closed,

92
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,700
I've done

93
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,020
what you asked me.

94
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,100
You

95
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,170
gave me these before.

96
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,170
And I haven't touched a cent
on the card.

97
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,250
Xie, what's this about?

98
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,930
Let me finish.

99
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,410
What are you...

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,050
We're all friends here.

101
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,140
Let's part on good terms.

102
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,660
After this,

103
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,020
don't ever come to me again.

104
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,170
Please,

105
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:43,930
I beg you.

106
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,540
From now on,

107
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,340
let's just pretend that
we don't know each other.

108
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,370
Xie.

109
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:50,980
Xie.

110
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,580
Xie.

111
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,020
This was a gift, don't give it back.

112
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,810
- Hey, what do you mean?
- Take it.

113
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,140
Cheng Zijian, you take it.
What do you mean?

114
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,250
After all these years,

115
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,250
you deserve this for your hard work.

116
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:58,700
Keep it.

117
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,050
Don't talk to me about hard work.

118
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,660
I've had it tough.

119
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,410
If not for yourself,
keep it for your mother.

120
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,410
Don't you dare mention my mom!

121
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,140
- I'm telling you,
- Fine, fine.

122
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,810
leave her out of this!

123
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,340
Take it!

124
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,580
Xie,

125
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,700
you always run away
when things get tough.

126
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,420
That's not good.

127
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,250
Whatever it is,
we can figure it out together.

128
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,370
There's always a solution, right?

129
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,730
Why are you just sitting there?

130
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:56,820
Eat.

131
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,580
Here.

132
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,530
We're here. Right here.

133
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,890
Check out the smart lock.

134
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,820
What do you think?
The whole place is automated.

135
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,700
We'll check the living room later.

136
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,820
Let's start with the master bedroom.

137
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,820
Come on.

138
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,100
I love this window wall.

139
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,100
Look at them!

140
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,460
It would be so bright!

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,060
This house

142
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,010
is huge! How fantastic!

143
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,580
Besides, we didn't even
pay for this house.

144
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,130
Long gave it to us
as an employee benefit.

145
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,650
It was free?

146
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,650
In Dongping,

147
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,610
aside from you,

148
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,650
Mr. Chen is like family to me too,

149
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,940
and Zijian is like
a little brother to me.

150
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,700
Just imagine having tea here

151
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,610
on a weekend afternoon,

152
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,700
bathed in sunlight.

153
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,180
How relaxing!

154
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,130
If you want to change anything, tell me.

155
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,130
I'll write it down and take care of it.

156
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,530
So, what do you say?

157
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,180
We should give this house back.

158
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,610
What?

159
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,060
I said, give it back.

160
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,300
Why?

161
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,490
No reason.

162
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,730
Just give it back.

163
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,060
If you want me to give it back,

164
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,700
you should at least give me a reason.

165
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,940
This is a rare bargain,

166
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,370
why should I give it up?

167
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,700
It may seem like a bargain to you,

168
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,730
but have you

169
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,250
considered that

170
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,580
they only gave it to us

171
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,250
because of our positions and status?

172
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,250
You're overthinking it.

173
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,490
If I don't buy this house,

174
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,820
someone else will.

175
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,060
Tell me,

176
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,130
has Chen Shenglong

177
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,940
ever asked you for a favor?

178
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,220
No.

179
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,490
If anything,

180
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,940
I'm the one who's asked him for help.

181
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:49,890
What do you mean?

182
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,100
The Wan Hai case
went on for three years,

183
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,060
and I was left to clean up

184
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,100
all the messes in our department.

185
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,010
I'm too embarrassed to hold my head up

186
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,420
when I go to meetings in the city now,
you know that?

187
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,890
Have you ever thought about me?

188

377
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,620
Accomplice Wang Dayou

378
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,770
was sentenced to 17 years.

379
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,940
He was released from custody
for medical treatment of liver cancer

380
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,980
and passed away a year later.

381
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,940
With you two here,

382
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,290
this whole place just feels livelier

383
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,330
and more vibrant.

384
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,290
Then we'll visit more often, sir.

385
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,140
Here,

386
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,810
- this is for you.
- Thank you, sir.

387
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,700
Take the one with more sauce.

388
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,180
He loves the sauce.

389
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:55,980
Thank you, sir.

390
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,010
Sir,

391
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,460
that's enough food.

392
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,810
It's just the three of us.

393
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,330
You young people should eat more.

394
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,290
Speaking of barbecue,

395
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,570
Long and I have quite a tale to tell,

396
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,290
don't we?

397
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,900
Do you remember what happened
at that barbecue place?

398
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,420
I'll never forget it.

399
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,810
It was my first time having barbecue.

400
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,080
I just took over
this coal preparation plant.

401
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,680
[Twenty-Eight Years Ago]

402
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,460
It's small,

403
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,810
but rest assured,

404
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,050
my prices

405
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,810
are the best in all of Dongping.

406
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,660
Weren't you a teacher?

407
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,290
How come you're doing this now?

408
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,140
I decided to change my career.

409
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,490
- Kid, what are you doing?
- That took some guts.

410
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,140
I thought you finished eating.

411
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,730
No, we're still eating.

412
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,420
You little thief,

413
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,420
get out of here!

414
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,730
I wasn't stealing!

415
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,700
You were stealing my food!
You are a thief!

416
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:50,940
What are you doing?

417
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,090
You punk,

418
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,730
beat it!

419
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,660
Either spit out the meat,

420
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,460
or pay up!

421
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,420
I'll pay for it!

422
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,660
I'll pay for it!

423
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,490
Who are you?

424
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,090
I'm his teacher.

425
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,700
This is all I have. Please forgive him.

426
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,090
I didn't see you last semester.

427
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,460
Why aren't you in school?

428
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:13,940
My dad died,

429
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,140
and my mom ran off with another man.

430
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,180
What about you? What are you doing now?

431
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,290
Where do you live?

432
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,380
Slow down. You're gonna choke.

433
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,530
It's all yours.

434
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,660
Can I have a drink?

435
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,660
What do you want?

436
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,180
Beer.

437
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,010
Here.

438
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,620
The hard days are behind us,

439
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,900
but don't forget how we got here.

440
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,460
Sir,

441
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,810
if I hadn't met you,

442
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,420
I'd be just a thief.

443
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,530
What? What are you talking about?

444
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,050
Who are you calling a thief?

445
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,770
What is this?

446
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,460
Alright,

447
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,050
I won't fight you for the "thief" title.

448
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,660
But Long,

449
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,050
I still remember

450
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,290
how you knelt to Mr. Yu.

451
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,530
What's wrong with kneeling to Mr. Yu?

452
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,530
I owe him my life.

453
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,290
Don't say that.

454
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,860
If not for you two,

455
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,250
I'd be just

456
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,860
a lonely old man.

457
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,380
I won't have anyone
to cook barbecue for.

458
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,420
Out of everyone,

459
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,010
Long has been with me the longest.

460
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,010
He took the brunt of it

461
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,010
and even served a year in prison for me.

462
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,770
Sir, I'd do it again.

463
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,490
I owe you.

464
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,770
What are you saying, sir?

465
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,660
You don't owe me anything.

466
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,660
You started with me?

467
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,660
That smells amazing.

468
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,050
Who's that?

469
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,380
Did you save me some?

470
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,420
You like this?

471
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:47,770
Mr. Chen,

472
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,490
long time no see.

473
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:58,700
What,

474
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,330
you don't recognize me?

475
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,420
I'm Jiang Yuan.

476
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,250
Xiong Lei.

477
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,050
That's what you go by now, right?

478
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,860
Personally,

479
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,660
Wang Dayou has a

480
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,090
far better ring to it than Xiong Lei.

481
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:33,940
Yu,

482
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,330
the meat's not bad, huh?

483
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,250
It's good.

484
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,420
I picked it myself

485
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,490
to celebrate you two.

486
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,570
Good job these past three years.

487
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,770
Now that we've made it,

488
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,330
it's time for the next chapter, right?

489
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,250
Here, yours.

490
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,090
Thanks.

491
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:04,860
Sir,

492
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,140
what's he doing here?

493
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,810
Sorry,

494
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,290
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

495
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,050
Come, have a seat.

496
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,620
From now on,

497
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,770
we're a family.

498
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,050
Jiang Yuan's back

499
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,530
from studying overseas,

500
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,140
with a degree in renewable energy.

501
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,700
Having him on board

502
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,010
is critical

503
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,530
for our next move

504
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,730
into the new energy sector.

505
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,380
That's right.

506
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,010
Once we get the mine

507
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:33,900
and the land,

508
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,140
we can build an EV battery plant.

509
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,940
Once things take off,

510
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,660
we'll bring in investors.

511
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:41,730
And then,

512
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,460
we could even manufacture our own EVs.

513
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,140
Sir,

514
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,460
I'm already in negotiations

515
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,180
about the land.

516
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:50,620
I can also

517
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,010
secure the mine

518
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,090
without the foreclosure.

519
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,290
How will you do that?

520
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,530
The Wans are barely hanging on,

521
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,290
and the officials

522
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,980
want to keep their company afloat,

523
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,140
so I can swoop in anytime.

524
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,010
Long,

525
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,770
don't you know Wan Hai by now?

526
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,660
You think he'll sell?

527
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,180
Especially when he knows...

528
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,620
He's nothing!

529
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,900
What can he do?

530
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,620
I could crush him anytime!

531
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,700
Is that all you can do?

532
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,330
Kill prosecutors,

533
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,180
steal bodies,

534
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,530
murder cremators?

535
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,420
We take money, not lives.

536
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,460
Do you know your actions

537
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,460
almost ruined three years of our work?

538
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,620
So you've been in on this
for three years?

539
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,330
I've busted my ass for this

540
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,220
for three years!

541
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,660
I didn't do it for you!

542
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,460
If that's how you want to put it,
I won't argue.

543
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,090
Sir,

544
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,980
I'm open to cooperation,

545
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,860
but not with him.

546
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,770
You think I want to work with you?

547
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:27,900
Yu,

548
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,380
you didn't talk to him?

549
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,220
What am I supposed to do now?

550
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:39,490
Long,

551
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,770
you know nothing about new energy,

552
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,220
neither do I.

553
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,290
Like they say,

554
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,490
you should leave professional matters

555
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,050
to the experts.

556
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,570
Jiang Yuan

557
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,660
majored in new energy.

558
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,570
It's a good thing that he's willing

559
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,660
to work with us.

560
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,530
Don't be too difficult.

561
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,770
Let me be clear,

562
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,730
from now on,

563
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,380
we're all on the same side.

564
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,140
To a win-win cooperation.

565
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,010
C'mon,

566
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:14,900
a toast.

567
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,490
Jiang Yuan.

568
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,220
Long,

569
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,330
what is it?

570
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,140
Sir,

571
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,220
you're about to retire.

572
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,730
I thought you did what you did

573
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,180
to go back to Dongping,

574
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,290
but turns out it was for him?

575
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,570
How am I supposed to eat like this?

576
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,530
Sure, you can eat,

577
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,220
just depends on how much I let you.

578
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,530
I don't want to eat with you!

579
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,010
Long.

580
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:49,810
Leave,

581
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,180
now.

582
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,730
Chen Shenglong,

583
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,530
you can

584
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,860
forget about

585
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,180
the mine.

586
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,290
What's the matter with you?

587
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,700
Stand up straight!

588
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,180
I've told you,

589
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,730
he's the expert in new energy.

590
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,220
He's our top guy in Dongping.

591
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,530
He's our best choice!

592
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,730
It's not like you can do it!

593
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,660
Basically,

594
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,010
he's just working for us.

595
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,900
You think I don't know
who matters more to me?

596
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,380
You think I'd forget about you?

597
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,090
Sir,

598
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,180
so you're choosing him over me?

599
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,730
Kid,

600
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,010
have you heard nothing I've said?

601
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,090
You didn't understand anything?

602
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,140
Sir,

603
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,330
it's either him or me.

604
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,220
Here, I'll do it.

605
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,620
Guys,

606
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,570
into the mine!

607
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,380
When you come out,

608
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,730
I'll pay you in cash!

609
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,050
Alright!

610
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,010
C'mon! Lights on!

611
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,780
Let's go!

612
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,130
Follow Mr. Wan!

613
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,860
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

614
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,420
Let's start working!

615
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,610
Mr. Wan!

616
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,780
Mr. Wan!

617
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:24,530
Let's play team.

618
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,300
Mr. Wan!

619
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,820
Watch my back.

620
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,980
The Mining Bureau is here!

621
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,260
Where?

622
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,980
Downstairs.

623
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,260
Stop playing, sir!

624
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,860
What is it?

625
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,300
The Mining Bureau's here!

626
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,170
How'd they know I was mining?

627
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,650
We got snitched on.

628
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,980
I told you not to mine illegally,

629
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,490
but you did it anyway!

630
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,690
How would I make any money
if I don't mine?

631
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,820
Go. Stop them!

632
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,380
- Captain Liu!
- Captain Liu!

633
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,210
Captain Liu, wait!

634
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,530
- Wait!
- Captain Liu, wait!

635
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,980
- Captain Liu!
- Captain Liu!

636
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,340
Captain Liu,

637
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,530
why didn't you tell me you were coming?

638
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,530
Captain Liu!

639
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,260
Captain Liu, why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

640
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,340
How would I catch you
if I gave you a heads-up?

641
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,940
No.

642
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,820
Wait, Captain Liu.

643
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,170
You could've just called.

644
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,780
Let's talk in the office.

645
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,740
We're not mining illegally.

646
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,260
We'd never do that!

647
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,210
We always listen to you, Captain Liu!

648
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,650
Was it you who ripped off the seal?

649
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,690
It wasn't me, Captain Liu.

650
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,980
No one would dare, Captain Liu.

651
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,170
No one dares to touch it

652
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,050
after you warned us last time.

653
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,740
Captain Liu.

654
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,860
Have a smoke, Captain Liu.

655
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,980
Captain Liu, it was me!

656
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,260
- You ripped it?
- I ripped it off!

657
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,090
Do you know breaking a seal is illegal?

658
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,380
I know. I just did it yesterday.

659
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,210
It's just one day.

660
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,940
You can't break it,
not even for a second.

661
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,050
But, I just broke it.

662
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,210
We haven't even begun mining,
Captain Liu.

663
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,490
Captain Liu, you know our situation.

664
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,300
We had no choice.

665
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,050
Is it here?

666
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,090
Did you rip that seal or not?

667
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,050
Take photos as evidence.

668
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,460
No, no photos, please!

669
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:27,880
No photos.

670
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,690
Is anyone down there?

671
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,610
No, no one's down there.

672
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,460
No one?

673
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:30,900
No.

674
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,300
Seal it.

675
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,420
No, please, don't do this.

676
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,050
Didn't you already seal it?

677
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,340
Is there anyone down there? Answer me.

678
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:36,610
Yes.

679
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,340
How many?

680
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,300
Four or five.

681
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,010
Be precise.

682
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,940
How many miners went down?

683
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,570
Twenty-one.

684
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,650
Twenty-one?

685
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,420
Please...

686
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,980
Write it down, 21 people.

687
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,820
Make sure to count them later.

688
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,130
Just let me finish one load.

689
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,860
Can they come up?

690
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,780
Are they coming up?

691
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,460
Just one load, please.

692
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,050
Seal it. Now.

693
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,260
Fine…

694
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,900
Go tell them to come up. It's over.

695
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,490
Go now.

696
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,010
Go tell them.

697
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,820
Seriously!

698
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,820
Just my luck!

699
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,130
Can't we just talk this out?

700
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,460
Is our shift already over?

701
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,050
Everyone quiet! Stop talking!

702
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,210
Come out! Come out!

703
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,050
Be quiet.

704
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,530
The officials are here.

705
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,860
Captain Liu, all 21 are accounted for.

706
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,650
Alright.

707
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,050
Captain Liu, I told you
it was 21 people.

708
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:21,900
Mr. Wan,

709
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,650
we've known each other a long time,

710
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,050
[Mineral Resources Management Bureau]
but still,

711
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,210
rules are rules.

712
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,210
There's nothing I can do.

713
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,010
Alright?

714
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,010
Maybe this will

715
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,380
help you learn your lesson.

716
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,530
Just give us a verbal warning.

717
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,490
It won't happen again.

718
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,650
- Listen,
- Please, sir.

719
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,980
I'm letting you off easy.

720
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,940
Next time, it might not be me
who comes here.

721
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,530
Captain Liu, you know

722
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,820
our financial situation.

723
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,900
I've considered your own circumstances,

724
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,090
that's why I'm only making you
pay this much.

725
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,650
Here, look.

726
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,010
Captain Liu.

727
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,490
Captain Liu, this is too much.

728
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,460
Please, can you help us out?

729
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,740
Pay the fine

730
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,860
within three days

731
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,900
or there'll be a late fee.

732
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,210
Let's go back.

733
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,780
Mr. Wan.

734
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:57,780
What?

735
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,860
Can you pay us?

736
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,860
We all have families to support.

737
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,610
Yeah!

738
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,690
Pay us.

739
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,490
Yeah.

740
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,240
[Serve the People]

741
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,420
Are you really going to appeal?

742
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,940
Have you read these?

743
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,210
Do you see anything wrong?

744
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,050
Mr. Li,

745
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,090
the Wan Hai case is closed.

746
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,780
The entire political and legal system
of Dongping

747
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,610
worked hard for years for this.

748
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,530
I'm fully aware.

749
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:57,900
Alright,

750
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,170
then I'll get back to work.

751
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,210
Xie,

752
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,010
do you know

753
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,050
why I picked you for this?

754
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,170
I hope you're still

755
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,570
the person I trust.

756
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:10,160
[Cheng Zijian]

757
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,900
When did you meet Xie?

758
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,820
How long have you known him?

759
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,940
I've known him for a long time.

760
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,050
It's been so long I don't even remember

761
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,780
how I met him.

762
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,530
I didn't know you and Mr. Sun
were this close.

763
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,980
You collaborated well
on the Wan Hai case.

764
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,490
We make a good team.

765
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,780
After all these years,

766
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,820
we've built a lot of trust.

767
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,160
[Were Dongping political and legal system,
Xie Hongfei, and Sun Fei aware?]

768
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,650
The reason

769
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,420
they framed me

770
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,260
and forged evidence

771
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,300
was that

772
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,170
I was in their way
of taking down Wan Hai.

773
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,650
Who do you mean by 'they'?

774
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,860
Dongping Municipal Bureau
of Public Security

775
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,380
and Dongping People's Procuratorate.

776
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,340
What did you offer Zhang Wenjing
in return?

777
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,740
Money, of course.

778
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,820
How much?

779
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,740
How many times? When,

780
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,820
and how much each time?

781
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,210
If you re-examine every detail

782
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,010
of the case,

783
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,420
you will find evidence.

784
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,010
If the Wan Hai case doesn't hold,

785
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:19,170
then my case will also be overturned.

786
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,280
[Was Wan Hai wrongfully convicted?]

787
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,420
Why do you think
Wang Yu reported Wan Hai?

788
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,130
It was because

789
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,780
Wan Hai took over his Freight Hub.

790
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,130
Then why didn't he say anything
when Wan Hai took it?

791
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,300
Not only did he not run,

792
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,420
he even went to

793
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,460
work for Wan Hai.

794
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,050
Only after the assault case was closed,

795
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,420
which was six months later,

796
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,380
did he bring it up.

797
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,860
What was he waiting for?

798
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,530
[What was Wang Yu's motive]
If Wang Yu is compromised,

799
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,740
[for reporting Wan Hai?]
that means the Wan Hai case

800
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,980
might not hold up.

801
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,530
Think about it.

802
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,050
But later,

803
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,650
Qiao Zhenxing was replaced

804
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:03,090
by another prosecutor, Xie Hongfei,

805
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,780
the one you just mentioned.

806
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,490
He said I was dragging the case out
for too long

807
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,090
and asked if I could change my lawyer.

808
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,170
I told him my lawyer was fine.

809
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,170
I didn't want to change her.

810
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,570
[Wang Yu, Xie Hongfei, Cheng Zijian]
Then, just a few days later,

811
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,940
Zhang Wenjing was accused
of mafia connections.

812
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,050
I knew something wasn't adding up,

813
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,360
so I had Mr. Sun look into it,

814
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:21,840
[Wang Yu, Xie Hongfei, Cheng Zijian,
Sun Fei]

815
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,130
and I was right.

816
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,210
As for Xie Hongfei,

817
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,460
he told me as long as I plead guilty,

818
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,530
he can get me sentence reductions.

819
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,940
A win-win.

Mr. Wan,

822
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,260
you asked me to find you some miners.

823
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,690
And now that we've done the job,

824
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,380
you need to pay us.

825
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,050
Yeah.

826
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,460
Please.

827
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:07,900
To be honest,

828
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,170

831
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,820
I really

832
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:16,900
can't come up

833
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,570
with the money right now.

834
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,420
You can't do that.

835
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,420
You need to figure something out, okay?

836
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,300
Please.

837
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,530
Alright!

Shut up!

839
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,340
How about this:

840
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,340
I'll rip off

841
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,380
that new seal,

842
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,340
