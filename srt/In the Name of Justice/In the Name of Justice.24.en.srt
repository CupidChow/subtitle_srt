00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,940
Mr. Chen, what are you doing?

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,530
Chen Shenglong

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,420
used judicial means

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,940
to completely crush his opponents.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,010
My wife Liu Yun is the deputy director
of the Development Zone.

00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,620
She helped Chen Shenglong
acquire Wanchuan Mining.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,620
And I was

10
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,940
in charge of the Wan Hai case.

11
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,620

Please welcome

the Deputy Director of Pingshan
Development Zone Managing Committee,

19
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,660
Liu Yun.

20
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,260
At 7:37 PM on May 16th

21
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,500
in Dongping City, Haidong Province,

22
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,980
a lifting cage accident occurred

23
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,660
at Wanchuan Mining's Mine No. 18.

24
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,500
There were 15 people
inside the cage at the time,

25
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,100
all trapped underground.

26
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,610
After the accident,

27
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,060
the Dongping Municipal Government
attached great importance to it,

28
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,660
immediately activating
a Level II emergency response,

29
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,380
establishing a municipal-level
on-site command center,

30
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,130
and formulating a rescue plan.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,730
Rescue operations have been
carried out with full effort.

32
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,220
As of now,

33
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,010
all the injured have been rescued

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,540
and sent to the hospital for treatment.

35
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,610
Among them,

36
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,060
two people have been confirmed dead.

37
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,660
The remaining 13

38
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,380
have all been out of danger.

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,100
Six of them are severely injured,

40
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,290
and seven have minor injuries.

41
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,010
In terms of aftermath handling,

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,450
the Development Zone Managing Committee
has assigned a dedicated team

43
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,690
to form a working group,

44
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,060
which will ensure

45
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,290
survivors' families receive
timely and compassionate support.

46
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,660
Regarding

47
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,540
the cause of the lifting cage's fall,

48
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,010
the Public Security Bureau
and the Emergency Management Bureau

49
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,290
have launched an investigation.

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,940
Preliminary findings indicate that

51
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,690
the accident was caused by
aging of the traction system

52
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,730
and long-term overcapacity operation.

53
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,410
Despite repeated warnings,

54
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,100
the company continued
illegal mining activities

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,660
and refused to carry out rectifications,

56
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,940
which ultimately led to
this work safety accident.

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,780
At present,

58
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,660
the individual responsible, Mr. Wan,

59
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,220
is being actively pursued.

60
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,980
We will continue to release
case information

61
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,010
in a timely and accurate manner

62
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,380
and launch

63
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,930

inspection and rectification.

64
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,730
Mr. Chen, Mr. Wan's here.

65
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,930
Our honored guest.

66
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,610
Mr. Chen…

67
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,170
Mr. Wan…

68
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:25,700
Welcome…

69
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,250
Sorry to call you over at this hour.

70
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,100
It's alright.

71
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,660
Come on in.

72
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,490
First time at the company, right?

73
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,170
Mr. Chen, what's going on here?

74
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,050
I'll give you a proper tour in a bit.

75
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,490
I bet you haven't had a decent meal

76
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,930
since the accident.

77
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,700
This is our favorite food.

78
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,370
Come on.

79
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,850
Okay.

80
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,580
Eat while it's hot.

81
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,140
Mr. Chen, you're doing pretty well.

82
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,340
Impressive.

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:43,850
Mr. Wan,

84
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,780
here, eat up.

85
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,490
Don't mind if I do.

86
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,050
Hurry…

87
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,660
Come on…

88
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,490
Okay…

89
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,700
Mr. Wan,

90
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,700
how are things at the hospital?

91
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,810
Don't mention it.

92
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,900
Two dead.

93
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,660
Some of them

94
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,930
survived,

95
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,810
but they're basically done for.

96
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,700
To be honest,

97
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,460
for the dead ones,

98
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,020
I can at least put a number
on the compensation.

99
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,460
But for the injured ones?

100
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,100
There's no end to it,

101
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,700
it's gonna be like a black hole.

102
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,370
I'm so screwed.

103
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,490
Can't believe this happened to me.

104
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,290
Mr. Wan,

105
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:26,980
don't be upset.

106
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,580
What did the government say?

107
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,050
What can they say?

108
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,730
They're pressuring me to pay the families.

109
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,220
Mr. Chen,

110
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,660
you know I'm broke.

111
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,410
What do I have to pay with?

112
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,610
It's not that
I don't want to compensate,

113
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,930
I just…

114
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,850
I can't.

115
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,410
It's driving me crazy.

116
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,050
How much are they asking?

117
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,850
Some want a million.

118
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,900
And some even want two.

119
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,900
They're insane.

120
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,370
Tell me, is my life even
worth a million?

121
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,490
If you think it is,

122
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,220
take it,

123
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,370
go ahead.

124
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,850
If it comes to that,

125
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,580
I've got nothing left to lose.

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,220
Screw it.

127
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:06,980
I'm done.

128
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:08,900
Mr. Wan,

129
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,050
don't worry.

130
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,290
I'll help you

131
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,580
carry this burden.

132
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,020
Mr. Chen, thank you.

133
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,850
Don't try to make me feel better.

134
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,340
I'll cover the compensation.

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,140
Whatever the families ask for,
I'll handle it.

136
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,810
You'll do that?

137
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,290
While I'm at it,

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,700
I'll pay off your bank loans too.

139
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,170
The money's ready.

140
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,730
Here's the deal, talk to your brother,

141
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,370
have him hand the mine over to me.

142
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,700
The loans are massive,

143
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,730
and with all the interest,

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,020
there's no way you'll ever
pay them back.

145
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,220
Also…

146
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,730
Kick a man when he's down.

147
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,370
Capitalize on a bad situation.

148
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,660
Mr. Chen, you may as well
just rob me outright.

149
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,340
Mr. Wan.

150
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,700
You let your brother give me the mine,

151
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,370
you can ask me for whatever you want.

152
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,370
Mr. Chen,

153
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,290
thanks for the food.

154
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,170
Really.

155
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,980
But there's a pile of mess
at the hospital

156
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,850
waiting for me.

157
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,490
I need to be there.

158
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,610
So I'm gonna head back now.

159
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,580
As for the mine,

160
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,780
you don't even need to ask my brother.

161
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,460
I won't agree to it.

162
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,900
Forget it.

163
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,780
Goodbye.

164
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,050
Did we say you can leave?

165
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,810
We're not done talking!

166
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,100
Why so worked up?

167
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,900
We'll talk later.

168
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,220
Where do you think you're going?

169
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:56,610
Go back.

170
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,370
Back.

171
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,170
No, get out of my way.

172
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,170
Go back!

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,410
Freeze!

174
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:02,660
Don't move.

175
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,540
What are you doing?

176
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,580
My back!

177
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,140
Let me go!

178
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,290
Mr. Chen.

179
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,140
Mr. Chen, what are you doing?

180
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,290
You know, I've got a back injury!

181
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,370
Go on then.

182
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,220
Just kill me.

183
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,250
Kill me.

184
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,850
I don't even care anymore.

185
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,020
Just kill me.

186
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,290
That lifting cage

187
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,850
in your mine

188
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,930
fell down just like that.

189
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,650
Do you know why?

190
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,300
Because the winch had no brake force.

191
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,250
And why did it

192
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,650
have no brake force?

193
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,820
That's because

194
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,420
it had no brake fluid.

195
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,370
Why did it have no brake fluid?

196
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,530
Because

I drained it.

hand that mine over

willingly.

it won't happen again.

209
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,420

doesn't agree to give me the mine,

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,820
whether the Wan Hai case

qualifies as an organized crime case,

224
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,130
and whether

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,650

is still legal oversight,

but criminal elements

301
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,850
are also involved.

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,890
Dadu Xishan,

378
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,580
is the best whether in location
or quality.

379
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,700
There's

380
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,700
no guarantee you can buy in,
even if you have the money.

381
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,730
But isn't giving away

382
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,370
such a huge place a little much?

383
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,490
Not at all.

384
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,700
Zijian is gifted.

385
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,980
Since he joined,

386
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,980
Tianlong Group has been thriving

387
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,820
year after year.

388
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,700
I have to say,

389
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,420
three houses wouldn't even be too many.

390
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,820
They dropped the price
to clear inventory.

391
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,370
Anyone would get the same price.

392
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,100
Oh, right,

393
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,650
when I went to the tax office
to check Tianlong's records,

394
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,180
I heard Mr. Qiao had been there too.

395
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,370
Qiao…

396
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,130
looked into Tianlong Company?

397
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:26,940
Yes.

398
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,650
When?

399
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,490
It should be

400
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,700
shortly before Mr. Qiao
had his incident.

401
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,250
Yun,

402
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,650
you gave us the opportunity.

403
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,180
Now it's time for us
to return your favor.

404
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,010
How could we just walk away?

405
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,420
I appreciate that

406
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,490
you're willing to do this.

407
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,890
But to you, this is business.

408
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,300
To me, it's my job.

409
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,460
Let's keep our personal relationship
out of it.

410
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,700
You should give it some more thought.

411
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,940
If that's the case,

412
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,900
then let me give you an update

413
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,940
on our company's future plans

414
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,380
to ease your concerns.

415
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,980
We've already submitted the application

416
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,810
for the land expropriation rights
in Hongjia Village.

417
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,050
If you have time,

418
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,180
please help move it along.

419
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,620
We're planning to

420
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,380
build a battery plant there.

421
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,460
So Wanchuan Mining and the battery plant

422
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,010
are part of our integrated
new energy strategy.

423
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,940
Acquiring Wanchuan Mining

424
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,700
is a key part of the whole plan.

425
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,180
So it doesn't matter

426
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,490
if we're taking some losses now.

427
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,810
In that case,

428
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,660
let me make it clear.

429
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,380
I'll fully support

430
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,660
your new energy project.

431
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,220
Okay.

432
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,090
Thank you.

433
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,320
[Personal Information of Chen Shenglong]

434
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,940
Has Chen Shenglong
ever asked you for any favors?

435
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,810
The Wan Hai case has been
dragging on for three years.

436
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,180
The Development Zone's been a mess.

437
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,460
It wasn't easy convincing Chen Shenglong

438
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,660
to invest in our zone.

439
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,220
If anything,

440
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,620
I was the one asking him for favors.

441
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,330
Which company are you
talking business with now?

442
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,220
Tianlong Company.

443
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,700
Chen Shenglong wants to
go into new energy.

444
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,010
Copper and nickel were found
in Wan Hai's mine.

445
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,620
Before Qiao died,

446
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,620
he had investigated Tianlong Company.

447
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,660
Is there a problem, Mr. Li?

448
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,940
The Guidance Group said it before,

449
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,530
there were issues with the Wan Hai case.

450
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,010
On the very first day in court,
Zhang Wenjing shouted

451
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,380
that Wan Hai was innocent.

452
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,010
If that's really true,

453
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,620
could this all be an interest struggle

454
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,700
between Chen Shenglong and Wan Hai?

455
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,290
Chen Shenglong

456
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,140
used judicial means

457
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,860
to completely crush his opponents.

458
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,090
Mr. Li, that's a dangerous assumption.

459
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,700
My wife Liu Yun is the deputy director
of the Development Zone.

460
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,220
She helped Chen Shenglong
acquire Wanchuan Mining.

461
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,420
And I was

462
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,730
in charge of the Wan Hai case.

463
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,490
If we accept that assumption

464
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,770
as true,

465
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,530
do I look like the protector
of Tianlong Company?

466
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,220
Yes…

467
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,940
Maybe…

468
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,220
445310, Wan Hai is here.

469
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,700
Why did this happen all of a sudden?

470
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,250
What's the cause?

471
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,250
It was my fault.

472
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,050
Before, Chao kept insisting
on mining secretly.

473
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,090
I tried my best to stop him,

474
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,090
but I failed.

475
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,940
What else could you do, really?

476
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,010
Brother, where's Chao?

477
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,980
He was scared of getting caught,

478
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,330
and ran after the accident.

479
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,900
Where did he go? Can you find him?

480
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,460
Yes.

481
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,530
I'm looking for him.

482
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,700
I'm sure I'll find him, brother.

483
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,250
Don't worry about Chao, leave it to me.

484
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,420
Bro,

485
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,980
two people died

486
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,250
in the accident.

487
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,940
I was thinking if we could offer to

488
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,330
compensate the families more,

489
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,220
get them to sign a mediation agreement,

490
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,010
maybe Chao could get off easier.

491
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,380
It's easier said than done.

492
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,050
Where's the money?

493
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,380
Where can you get the money?

494
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,330
If the accident hadn't happened,

495
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,860
maybe someone would take over the mine.

496
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,700
But with the accident…

497
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,140
Well,

498
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,810
don't get too upset.

499
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,380
I've been thinking about this in here.

500
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,420
If worst comes to worst,

501
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,860
just sell my houses.

502
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,700
No, bro.

503
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,770
No need.

504
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,900
Someone's willing to pay for this now.

505
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,810
Who?

506
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,330
That…

507
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,140
Tianlong Company.

508
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,530
What Tianlong Company?

509
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,380
Never heard of it.

510
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,420
Mr. Chen.

511
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,250
What's his name?

512
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,180
Chen Shenglong.

513
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,420
Who?

514
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,180
Chen Shenglong.

515
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,330
His company is pretty famous
in the city.

516
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,250
Mr. Chen also promised to

517
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,010
cover the workers' medical bills
and compensation.

518
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,380
Bro,

519
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,420
I really had no choice.

520
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,940
This is a great opportunity.

521
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,380
Let's just sell the mine.

522
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,010
Brother, Wan Hai's here!

523
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,570
Wan Hai!

524
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,860
Mr. Wan,

525
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,980
I am here to apologize to you.

526
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,900
If there's any problem,

527
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,140
we can fix it.

528
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,940
Bro, what's wrong?

529
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:52,900
Bro…

530
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,860
When did you

531
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,460
start dealing with Chen Shenglong?

532
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,090
It wasn't me.

533
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,420
Director Liu from the Managing Committee
brought him to me.

534
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,380
He approached us.

535
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,900
When was that?

536
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,330
Just recently.

537
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,050
What day exactly?

538
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,380
What day…

539
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,620
About a week or two ago.

540
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,460
How many times?

541
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,810
Just a few times.

542
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,180
I thought his offer was quite good,

543
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,700
so I talked to him.

544
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,530
Then tell me,

545
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,220
was this really a work safety accident?

546
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,700
Because

547
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,660
I drained it.

548
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,730
If your brother

549
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,490
doesn't agree to give me the mine,

550
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,420
then Wan Chao's life

551
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,420
is in God's hands.

552
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,730
Well, the police said it was.

553
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,660
Bro, what are you implying?

554
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,530
Wan Hai is not guilty!

555
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,290
We're not a criminal organization!

556
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,620
This is all slander!

557
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,180
Tell them you're not a gangster!

558
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,860
It was Wang Yu who set you up.

559
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,290
This case is unjust!

560
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,010
Zhang Wenjing is right!

561
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,860
My dad is not a gangster!

562
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,900
Let me ask you,

563
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,860
am I a gangster?

564
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,380
You're not?

565
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,050
Now, you've been

566
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,090
labeled as the leader
of a criminal organization.

567
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,810
It's a done deal.

568
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,660
We promised

569
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,770
to reduce your sentence,

570
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,090
none of that will change.

571
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,530
I did as Zhang Wenjing said.

572
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,050
I hired some guys
to beat Wang Yu into submission,

573
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,330
and then forced him to sign the contract.

574
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,330
She drafted the contract.

575
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,620
And when my club's head of security

576
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,250
crippled that man,

577
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,220
she arranged the false testimony

578
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,330
to cover me.

579
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,620
I am a gangster.

580
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,460
I'll always be.

581
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,620
Defendant Wan Hai,

582
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,980
the court sentences you

583
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,900
to a combined prison term

584
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,980
of 10 years and 10 months
for multiple crimes.

585
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,010
You know what,

586
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,180
you go tell Yu Tiancheng,

587
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,140
if he wants to kill me,

588
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,180
he doesn't have to go through all this.

589
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,090
Sentencing me to ten years and ten months?

590
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,620
So he's been plotting this

591
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,010
for three years.

592
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,250
I can sell the mine

593
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,010
to anyone,

594
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,530
except him.

595
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,900
Pass that along

596
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,330
to Chen Shenglong,
let Chen Shenglong tell him.

597
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,140
Wait, brother…

598
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,730
what exactly is going on
between you two

599
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,490
that I don't know about?

600
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:00,770
Bro…

601
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,860
Brother.

602
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:04,860
I…

603
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,700
I can't take it any longer.

604
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,250
I just can't.

605
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,530
You don't know how ruthless
Chen Shenglong is.

606
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,180
Whatever he wants, he gets.

607
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,570
He'll do anything.

608
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,940
We can't fight him.

609
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,290
That press conference just declared it

610
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,140
a work safety accident,

611
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,250
and then he told me right away

612
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,730
he did it.

613
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,980
If he can get you convicted
as a gangster,

614
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,460
what else can't he do?

615
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,330
I'm so sorry for what happened

616
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,220
at your mine.

617
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,620
Looks like our public security efforts

618
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,700
still need

619
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,460
improvement.

620
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,940
We fell short

621
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:54,980
in many aspects.

622
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:55,940
Captain Sun,

623
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,620
we don't blame you.

624
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,330
Those guys from the neighboring mine
are too aggressive.

625
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,860
They weren't just after money.

626
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,050
They wanted my life. My mine.

627
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,490
Mr. Wan.

628
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,290
Mr. Wan, calm down.

629
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,220
I've heard about the rivalry

630
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,570
between your companies.

631
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,050
But to be honest,

632
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,050
and I hope you won't take offense,

633
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,140
it takes two to tango.

634
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,290
This can't keep going on

635
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,460
forever.

636
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,180
Now that I'm here today,

637
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,250
I'd like to help address

638
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,530
the real root of the problem.

639
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,490
How do you plan to do that?

640
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,140
Listen to me.

641
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,330
Wait, where are you going?

642
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,760
Mr. Yu, come on.

643
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,520
[Office]

644
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:39,810
Come.

645
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,420
Come here.

646
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,530
Say it. Apologize.

647
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,220
Say you're sorry.

648
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,290
Mr. Wan.

649
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,010
I am here to apologize to you.

650
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,530
Wait, what's he doing here?

651
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,700
I know

652
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,490
you two have been
at each other's throats

653
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,220
for years.

654
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,330
But let's be honest,

655
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,620
well,

656
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,330
the things you did at the mine

657
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,290
weren't any better than his.

658
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,700
If we really dig deep,

659
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,250
neither side will come out on top.

660
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,330
What are you saying?

661
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,860
He killed two people at my mine.

662
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,940
How dare you try to help a murderer?

663
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,140
And I almost got shot.

664
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,810
I won't just let this go!

665
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,380
Do you still want to keep
doing business in Dongping?

666
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,490
Are you threatening me?

667
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,090
I'm reminding you.

668
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,330
A kind reminder.

669
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,220
I believe there's justice in Dongping!

670
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,460
I'm done talking to you.

671
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,810
Get lost.

672
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,770
I'll sue you.

673
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,330
Brother,

674
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,490
he said

675
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,050
if we refuse to sell the mine,

676
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,140
then Chao's life

677
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,570
is as good as gone.

678
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,460
We can't risk Chao.

679
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,980
We have to survive, brother.

680
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,180
Brother.

681
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,140
Please…

682
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,570
Mr. Xudong,

683
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,330
have some late-night snack.

684
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,140
Liang, your phone.

685
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,140
Ma'am.

686
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,980
Did you finish packing?

687
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,700
When are you planning to come over?

688
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:47,570
I…

689
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,090
I need to

690
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,180
report something to you.

691
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,090
Go on.

692
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,010
Well,

693
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,570
I need to go on

694
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,250
a business trip.

695
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,770
Once it's done,

696
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,050
I'll come join you.

697
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,530
Hong Liang, give me a straight answer.

698
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,770
Are you coming or not?

699
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,180
If you're not,
then I'll just let this go.

700
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,460
But if you are,

701
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,810
stop making excuses every time.

702
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,490
Don't get mad.

703
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,090
I'm just telling you this news.

704
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,330
If you're not okay with it,

705
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,010
then I'll just

706
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,570
turn this down.

707
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,860
I'll cancel the trip

708
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,290
and come straight to you. How's that?

709
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,180
You said it.

710
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,980
Then I'm booking your ticket right now.

711
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,050
Hong Liang, be honest with me.

712
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,090
You don't want to
come to Beijing at all, do you?

713
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,050
No, I…

714
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,420
What did I say tonight

715
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,220
to make you think that?

716
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,860
Then why are you still taking on cases

717
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,010
if you're about to leave the job?

718
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,050
Don't say it. I know.

719
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,660
Ever since you came back from Dongping,

720
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,140
you haven't looked happy at all.

721
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,530
Deep down,

722
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,250
you don't want to come to Beijing,

723
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,570
and you don't want to
quit the job either.

724
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,900
You feel like all of us

725
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,330
are forcing you to do something
you don't want.

726
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,570
So you've been feeling stuck
and aggrieved.

727
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,050
You never actually agreed
to come to Beijing.

728
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,050
Then what was all that acting about?

729
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,290
I wasn't acting…

730
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,730
Hong Liang, think about it.

731
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,860
What kind of life

732
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,810
do you actually want?

733
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,200
[Hong Liang]

734
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:23,770
Great.

735
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,900
I've pissed off my "boss at home."

736
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,730
Forgot to tell her.

737
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,140
Can you believe my office?

738
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,660
Just had to send me
on another trip at the last minute.

739
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,290
I figured,

740
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,810
after all these years,

741
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,050
the leadership has treated me
pretty well.

742
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,730
Maybe I can leave on a good note,

743
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,050
so I said yes impulsively.

744
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,530
But right after, I regretted it.

745
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,220
Didn't even know how to explain it
to Min.

746
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,180
Anyway,

747
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,180
I…

748
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,180
I'll finish up this business trip,

749
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,460
then head to Beijing

750
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,940
and meet up with her.

751
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:57,980
Liang,

752
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,940
you're about to resign,

753
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,620
why they're still giving you work?

754
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,220
I know, right?

755
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,180
Back then,

756
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,220
maybe I wasn't that capable,
so they didn't use me much.

757
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,940
Now that I'm leaving,

758
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,290
maybe they realize I'm actually good,

759
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,220
so they keep piling on the tasks.

760
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,860
Who gave you this task,

761
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,730
Sun Xiangqun or Zhang Fang?

762
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,380
That's confidential.

763
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,530
Liang,

764
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,730
I've never once heard you say that

765
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,860
to Dad in all these years.

766
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,220
It's because there's a case

767
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,940
I took on a while back.

768
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,220
It's been dragging on,

769
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,490
and now something new has come up,

770
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,180
so I've got no choice
but to deal with it.

771
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,620
Hong Liang.

772
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,570
Tell me,

773
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,090
is it that the case needs you,

774
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,220
or you need the case?

775
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,530
There'll always be another case.

776
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,860
But you only have

777
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,620
one family.

778
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,460
So I hope

779
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,330
you'll really figure out

780
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,180
what matters more.

781
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,380
Liang,

782
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,140
I know it's hard

783
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,050
to just walk away

784
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,380
from something you've done
for over a decade.

785
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,290
Actually,

786
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,730
don't worry about

787
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,700
that job in Beijing.

788
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,770
I can take care of it
with one phone call.

789
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,940
Dou might need

790
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,490
a bit of time to adjust.

791
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,620
But that's easy.

792
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,940
I'll bring her to Beijing myself first.

793
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,380
And don't worry about my sister.

794
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,620
You two have been together for years.

795
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,050
You know her,

796
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,140
spoiled by our old man.

797
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,620
Just find some time to apologize to her,

798
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,810
and it'll all blow over.

799
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,730
As for our father,

800
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,420
I'll go talk to him.

801
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,090
Comrades,

802
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,300
in the course of our recent work,

803
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,690
we found that the Wan Hai case

804
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,650
handled by

805
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,010
Dongping Municipal
People's Procuratorate

806
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,210
may involve a miscarriage of justice.

807
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,490
Some state functionaries,

808
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,940
especially those
in the political and legal system,

809
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,050
are suspected of
protecting local criminal organizations

810
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,900
and colluding with them.

811
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,780
According to preliminary investigation
by the procuratorate,

812
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,340
the nature of the Wan Hai case

813
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,050
is still under question,

814
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,130
with evidence remaining
insufficient and unclear.

815
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,860
During the handling of this case,

816
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,340
a prosecutor died,

817
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,690
workers went missing,

818
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,420
and there were attempts to
cover up the cause of a mine accident.

819
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,490
There is serious suspicion
of criminal offenses,

820
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,940
duty-related crimes
among judicial personnel

821
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,420
and corruption

822
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,690
among state functionaries.

823
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,740
[Suspect Information Record]
Such a serious and harmful criminal case

824
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,980
is rare nationwide.

825
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,490
It must be thoroughly investigated

826
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,380
and eradicated.

827
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,740
With the approval
of the Provincial Party Committee,

828
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,570
a Task Force is hereby established today

the related criminal leads.
