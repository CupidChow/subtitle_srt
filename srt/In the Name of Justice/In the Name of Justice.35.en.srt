Oh,

119
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,780
and he requested pen and paper
from the guards,

120
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,050
he said he wanted to write a statement.

127
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,610
I heard Wan Hai's cellmates
calling for help,

128
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,810
I rushed over immediately.

129
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,610
Wan Hai was clutching his chest,

130
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,020
clearly in pain,

131
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,730
so I took him straight to the infirmary.

132
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,170
The initial diagnosis
was acute coronary syndrome.

133
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,220

134
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,370

135
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,610
But at 6 AM,

136
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,900

142
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,370
he had been receiving
long-term treatment.

143
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,340
I filled his prescriptions regularly
according to the medical plan,

144
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,020

No.

Take care of yourself.

168
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,370

Don't worry.

It's safe with me.

174
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,490
It won't go wrong.

175
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,890
Leave it with me instead.

176
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,010
It's not safe on the road.

177
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,370
Mr. Yu,

178
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,530
I'd rather keep it with me.

179
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,650
I'd feel safer that way.

180
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,980
Long.

181
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,490

182
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,300
You don't

183
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,490

189
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,460
don't worry about Long.

190
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,370
He wouldn't harm you.

191
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,490
But in his hand

192
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,370
lies the one thing
that could destroy us all.

193
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,770
That thing

194
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,010
could kill me.

195
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,130
Dayou,

196
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,610
save his life

197
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,580
or save mine,

198
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,980
you choose.

199
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,890
Mr. Yu.

200
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,490
Mr. Yu.

201
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,850
Please.

202
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,730
Long is...

203
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,490
He's not thinking straight now.

204
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,420
I'll talk to him.

205
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,340
I'll take that recording...

206
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,820
You're his brother.

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,420
Finish him yourself.

208
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,250
Mr. Yu...

209
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,770
Thank you all

210
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,820
for giving me this chance
to open up to the organization.

211
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,770
Even if

212
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,010
you hadn't called me in today,

213
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,580
I would've come myself

214
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,820
to talk to you.

215
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,730
To be honest,

216
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,370
during my time
as chief of First Criminal Division,

217
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,980
I never crossed any lines
when it came to principles.

218
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,220
I've always been loyal

219
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,890
to the Party, to the organization,

220
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,890
even more so to the law.

221
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,890
I swear

222
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,890
I've always dealt with cases

223
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,220
fairly and justly by the law.

224
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,940
But maybe

225
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,300
I did break a few
minor disciplinary rules,

226
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,130
went against some personal principles.

227
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,940
At least, I never crossed over
into illegal territory.

228
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,820
But today,

229
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,850
what I really want to talk to you about

230
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,180
is Xie Hongfei.

231
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,770
If

232
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,580
you've already started
investigating him,

233
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,490
then consider
what I'm saying now irrelevant.

234
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,420
Xie Hongfei

235
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,890
ignored penal code,

236
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,100
pushed forward with prosecution

237
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,890
against Wan Hai without solid evidence,

238
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,180
and made an inappropriate
sentencing recommendation.

239
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,610
Of course,

240
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,060
in the process,

241
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,130
I messed up too.

242
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,420
I didn't scrutinize the indictment
he submitted

243
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,460
carefully enough.

244
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,060
I let him lead me astray

245
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,530
and ended up making a wrong judgment.

246
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,220
I found out afterward

247
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,820
he deliberately twisted the law
for personal gain.

248
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,980
That's my mistake.

249
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,940
I confess.

250
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,820
Long,

251
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,770
we were both

252
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,980
born into hardship.

253
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,700
No real family.

254
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,130
If it weren't for Mr. Yu,

255
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,130
taking us in,

256
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,460
we wouldn't have had a home.

257
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,770
Once you've got a home,

258
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,100
there's nothing to be afraid of,

259
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,490
right?

260
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,890
Pity.

261
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:43,890
That home

262
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,820
is gone.

263
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:53,770
Long.

264
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,300
Why'd you record that audio?

265
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,490
No reason.

266
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,580
Got used to being afraid growing up,

267
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,370
it's just habit.

268
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:08,940
Long.

269
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,300
Listen to me.

270
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,820
Hand it over.

271
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,340
He sent you?

272
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,130
I promise

273
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,850
he wouldn't hurt us.

274
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,730
You go first.

275
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,940
Find a safe place.

276
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,940
I'll come find you later.

277
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,890
We'll disappear together.

278
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,420
Never come back,

279
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:45,940
okay?

280
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,300
You holding on to that thing,

281
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,580
it's like carrying a bomb.

282
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,060
Why keep it?

283
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,890
What for?

284
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,650
To keep me alive.

285
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,250
Why don't you trust him?

286
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,130
Has he ever trusted me?

287
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,220
Has he ever really trusted anyone?

288
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,180
Of course, he has.

289
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,220
If he hadn't trusted us,

290
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,700
how would we even have what we have now?

291
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:10,850
Brother.

292
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,650
Brother.

293
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,940
What are you thinking?

294
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,130
Brother.

295
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,580
I've been thinking
about this a lot lately.

296
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,940
If we hadn't met Mr. Yu,

297
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,340
what would we be like now?

298
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,580
Maybe we wouldn't have money,

299
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,820
couldn't afford meat

300
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,730
or good booze,

301
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,820
but at least we wouldn't be

302
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,610
living like this.

303
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,620
I've never regretted

304
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,810
anything I've done.

305
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,660
Really.

306
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,620
Regret is useless.

307
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,490
You just asked me

308
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,460
why I keep this recording.

309
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,730
Because it makes me feel safe.

310
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:34,860
Brother.

311
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,770
Just wait.

312
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,180
See if this thing can

313
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,700
save both our lives one day.

314
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,380
I think you were right.

315
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,730
You said,

316
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,050
what can we do if we go abroad?

317
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,810
We don't speak the language.

318
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,290
Can't get used to the food.

319
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,490
We won't even know

320
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,570
where to go to the bathroom.

321
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,220
So brother, think about it.

322
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,620
This thing

323
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,940
might just be our meal ticket one day.

324
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,220
And you're blaming me?

325
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,290
I thought about it all day...

326
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,940
Brother!

327
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:33,940
Brother!

328
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,330
Brother!

329
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,940
Brother!

330
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,810
Don't blame me!

331
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,810
To Mr. Yu,

332
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,250
we're just like dogs.

333
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,140
Loyal dogs.

334
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,420
The way they're solving this problem

335
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,460
is by throwing you and me under the bus.

336
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,770
We're not a family anymore.

337
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,010
His family is Jiang Yuan.

338
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,090
If we let Jiang Yuan take the mine,

339
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,050
your waste treatment plant,

340
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,940
my Tianlong Company,

341
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,330
will we still have good days?

342
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,810
Why don't you trust him?

343
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,460
Has he ever trusted me?

344
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,530
Has he ever really trusted anyone?

345
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,220
Don't let me see you again!

346
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,250
Get out of here!

347
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,140
Mr. Yu.

348
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,700
I...

349
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,660
I just can't do it!

350
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,420
We...

351
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,900
Um,

352
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,330
Ms. Zheng,

353
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,010
could you wait just a little longer?

354
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,490
How much longer?

355
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,700
Twenty minutes.

356
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,140
My mom

357
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,220
always takes a nap around this time.

358
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,570
She'll wake up

359
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,810
in about twenty minutes.

360
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,090
Okay.

361
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,530
You cooked all this?

362
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,810
Two dishes still left.

363
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,860
Then finish them.

364
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,380
It's my mother's birthday today.

365
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:19,940
Thank you.

366
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,090
Thank you.

367
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,620
We don't have much,

368
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,220
I tried my best.

369
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,530
Thank you.

370
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,530
Forget it.

371
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,570
We're not waiting anymore.

372
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,660
Let's go.

373
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,010
Can you say I'm turning myself in,

374
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,730
since I'm being cooperative?

375
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,860
I want to earn some merit.

376
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,140
Ms. Zheng.

377
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,220
Hong Liang.

378
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,420
I want to earn some merit.

379
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:14,570
Okay.

380
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,900
You'll have the chance once we're back.

381
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,900
To be honest,

382
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,330
I've been holding in so much
all these years.

383
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,010
I want to let it all out.

384
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,330
Don't worry.

385
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,810
I'll tell you everything I know.

386
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,660
No holding back.

387
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,220
And I hope I can earn some merit,

388
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,090
so I can celebrate
my mother's 80th birthday with her.

389
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,330
There are some things

390
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,770
I might only be able to
say to you alone.

391
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,010
If I go back with you now,

392
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,980
I won't be able to speak freely.

393
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:51,860
What are they?

394
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,140
Ms. Zheng,

395
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,460
can I talk to Hong Liang alone
for a bit?

396
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,770
You know the rules.

397
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,460
You can talk
when we're back to the base.

398
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,010
Let's go.

399
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,010
It's nothing.

400
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,220
My mother's not in great health.

401
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,860
Hong Liang is from Dongping,

402
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,140
knows his way around.

403
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,380
I want him to help take care of my mom.

404
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,290
We're not short on time.

405
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,180
Let's talk when we're there.

406
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,220
Let's go, Xie.

407
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,490
Hong Liang.

408
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:14,900
Xie.

409
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,330
Do me a favor.

410
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,530
I just want to talk to you.

411
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,810
Maybe just...

412
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,700
a few minutes.

413
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,140
He won't bite.

414
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,570
We have rules.

415
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,900
In Eleventh Division,

416
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,620
we sometimes do have some flexibility.

417
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:44,860
Not like them...

418
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,980
Still, you gotta follow the policy.

419
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,620
I repeat, we have rules.

420
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,380
You guys get in the car first.

421
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,490
Stick to the rules.

422
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,530
Don't take too long.

423
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,620
Hong Liang.

424
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,140
I actually wanted to tell you

425
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,050
my mom's not well,

426
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,140
needs regular meds every month.

427
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,810
So please

428
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,050
help her.

429
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,490
By the way,

430
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,490
Jiang Xudong
is your father-in-law, right?

431
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:29,860
What's your point?

432
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,250
Say hello to him for me.

433
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,330
Actually,

434
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,700
you can come to me

435
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,940
and ask me anything, I know it all.

436
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,290
You want the truth, right?

437
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,010
I

438
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,140
have already told you.

439
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,180
How's Xie Hongfei's family?

440
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,420
I just came back from the hospital.

441
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,700
His wife is quite upset.

442
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,090
I told her,

443
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,980
the organization will take care of it.

444
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,770
Told her to rest assured.

445
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,660
What about Xie Hongfei's mother?

446
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,700
His wife said

447
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,860
his mother's old

448
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,860
and unwell.

449
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,330
They're keeping it from her for now.

450
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,660
Where's Hong Liang?

451
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,380
Hong Liang's here.

452
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,530
Hong Liang.

453
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,380
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhang. I messed up.

454
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,090
When you're dealing with suspects,

455
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,180
you must be extra cautious.

456
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,700
No room for error.

457
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,290
Be careful...

458
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,620
Haven't I said that already?

459
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,460
Wan Hai, Wang Yu were all dead.

460
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,860
Sun Fei won't talk.

461
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,250
Xie Hongfei's arrest

462
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,050
is crucial to this case.

463
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,860
Now all leads are cut off.

464
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,090
Your actions

465
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,050

to the office.

467
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,940
The leadership just met.

468
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,420
You're removed from your position
as deputy leader of the Task Force.

469
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,420
Return immediately
for disciplinary review.

470
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,090
Hand over your work

471
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,900
to Cao Ye now.

472
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,380
Mr. Zhang,

473
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,140
I accept any punishment.

474
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,380
It's just that the Task Force

475
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,250
is at a critical point,

476
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,620
do you think maybe I can

477
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,180
at least stay temporarily to help?

478
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,940
I'll prepare a written report

479
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,290
and submit it

480
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,220
to the office for now.

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,570
This is not just a formality.

483
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,620
This is a regulation

by Supreme People's Procuratorate.

for breaking the rules?

Understood.

Have Cao Ye take the call.

488
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,140
Yes.

489
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,770
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

490
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,490
What did he tell you?

491
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,730
Hand over the work to Cao Ye.

492
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,250
I mean Xie Hongfei.

493
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,810
I'll go back to Haizhou tomorrow.

494
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,380
Okay, I see.

495
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,050
When you arrive at Haizhou,

496
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,900
go home first.

call me.

499
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,010
Jiang Xudong is your father-in-law,
right?

500
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,530
Say hello to him for me.

501
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,250
Think about Sun Fei,

502
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,980
you really don't know
how he got promoted?

503
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,980
Mr. Jiang jumped me all the way

504
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,010
to my position today.

505
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,620
Mr. Jiang helped me a lot.

506
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,570
It's only right.

507
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,290

Jiang Yuan is working with Yu Tiancheng.

511
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,180
Yu Tiancheng is his boss.

512
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,570
Thirteen years ago,

513
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,620
Wan Hai acquired Dacheng Mining.

514
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,530
That's how his mine grew to this size.

515
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,620
The strangest thing is

516
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,980
he didn't spend a single dime.

517
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,650
Yu Tiancheng's trying to kill me
and take my mine.

518
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,610
They asked me to meet again.

519
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,210
That was quite a scene.

520
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,940
There was not only Sun Fei,

521
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,260
but also Xie Hongfei.

522
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,490
Then another big leader came.

It's from Vice Chairman Jiang Xudong.

524
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,570
Call him back.

525
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,460
As long as the facts are clear,

00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,900
You think I've done it for you?

571
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,170
You can't touch the mine,

572
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,090
and definitely not the land.

573
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,820
You can't take this mine.

574
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,380
Why are you back suddenly?

575
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,340
Is Xudong here?

576
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:51,940
He's in the study.

577
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,780
Xudong.

578
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,900
Aren't you

579
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,380
with the Task Force?

580
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,690
What do you want to see me?

581
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,130
I just

582
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,340
wanna ask you something

583
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,530
about Yuan.

584
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,980
Yuan?

585
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,420
What's his connection to Yu Tiancheng?

586
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,570
Do you know?

587
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,300
Can I ask one more question?

588
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,380
In Dongping,

589
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,340
there was a case thirteen years ago,

590
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,980
called the Wanchuan Mining Shooting.

591
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,050
Do you know?

592
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,090
Liang.

593
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,300
Why are you asking all this?

594
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,260
It's a little urgent.

595
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,010
I hope you can

596
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,300
talk to me.

597
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,420
Tell me

598
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,340
what you know.

599
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,260
For example, Yu Tiancheng.

600
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,780
How long have you two
been working together?

601
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,780
Over three years. So?

602
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,170
Do you have anything to do
with the Wan Hai case?

603
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,900
What Wan Hai case?

604
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,300
No.

605
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,610
Can you answer the question properly?

606
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,780
What do you mean?

607
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,490
You suspect me?
Are you interrogating me?

608
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,610
What exactly are you suspecting me of?

609
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,860
I do have a few questions for you.

610
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,940
There's a reason for that.

611
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,980
I hope you can be honest with me.

612
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,010
If I don't understand what's going on,

613
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,260
I can't help you

614
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,210
or know what I should do next.

615
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,610
I'm asking because I want to help him.

616
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,090
Because I'm a prosecutor,

617
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,460
I know what can be done to protect you.

618
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,490
I just need you to be

619
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,530
straight with me.

620
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,820
Okay?

621
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,940
Otherwise,

622
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,210
you'll have to come with me
to the Task Force.

623
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,260
- By then it'll be too late.
- Don't scare me!

624
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,010
My business with Yu Tiancheng
is legitimate.

625
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,340
What, doing business is a crime now?

626
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,420
Let me be clear,

627
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,740
Yu Tiancheng and Chen Shenglong
are involved in organized crime.

628
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,820
How about this?

629
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,010
You go to the Task Force with me now.

630
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,900
If it has something to do with you,

631
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,130
turning yourself in
might get you leniency.

632
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,530
If it doesn't,

633
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,820
then you can clear your name right away.

634
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,260
Trust me on this.

635
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,380
Why should I go with you?

636
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,260
Are you crazy?

637
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,210
Are you my family or not?

638
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,690
What?

639
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,420
You came back just to arrest me?

640
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,210
You're the prosecutor!

641
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,940
Fine. Then arrest me.
You got any warrant?

642
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:33,780
Warrant!

643
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,130
Arrest Warrant

644
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,900
or whatever paper you've got!

645
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,130
Do you have any? Show me!

646
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,170
Come on, show me!

647
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,010
Jiang Yuan.

648
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,900
Get out.

649
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,460
No! Why should I...

650
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,490
Come out.

651
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,980
Let me go.

652
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,380
Sit down.

653
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,210
Hong Liang.

654
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,010
Look at this,

655
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,380
if you'd listened to me back then

656
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,610
and just gone to Beijing,

657
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,460
maybe you wouldn't be

658
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,980
stuck in this mess now.

659
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,820
So,

660
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,740
you do know
how deep Yuan's involved?

661
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,050
Whether Yuan is involved or not,

662
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,530
let the Task Force figure it out.

663
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,170
We're family.

664
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,980
Are you gonna report him?

665
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,650
Wait...

666
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:23,380
I've been in law for over twenty years.

667
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,490
If I know something and keep quiet, I...

668
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,090
I can't...

669
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,300
I can't live with that.

670
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,460
You're right.

671
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,980
But think about Min.

672
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,780
Think about Dou.

673
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,380
This is your home, too.

674
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,490
If you report him,
what happens to them?

675
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,380
Xudong, can we just...

676
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,460
Please tell me,

677
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,260
how deep

678
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,130
Yuan is in this?

679
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,980
From everything I know about
this system after all these years,

680
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,980
if he goes with you to the Task Force,

681
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,420
he may never come back.

682
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,400
[Hong Liang's here. Knows about us.
About to report. Handle it!]

683
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,680

684
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,320

00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,530
