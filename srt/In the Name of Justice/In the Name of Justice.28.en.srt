1
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,650
Cheng Zijian,

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,690
general counsel of Tianlong Company,

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,780
has close ties to Wang Yu,

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,170
Xie Hongfei, and Sun Fei.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,140
And

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,050
he's Li Renjun's brother-in-law.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,460
I want to take someone,

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,370
or a company,

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,300
out of the game.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,650
Can you help me?

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,980
I can make it look like

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,980
Wan Hai bullied him

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,770
into selling the hub.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,620
In this case alone,

15
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,650
you've got

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,860
unlawful detention,

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,900
assault,

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,090
forced deal,

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,180
and extortion.

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,980
Any one of those
could take Wan Hai down.

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,900
Together, and it's game over.

22
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,220
Just be straight with me,

23
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,820
what do you want?

24
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,280
[In the Name of Justice]

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,320
[Episode 28]

26
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,100
So this is the "great" team I built.

27
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,850
Dongping's officials

28
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,730
are getting taken in, one after another.

29
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,130
They're knocking on our doors now.

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,170
And I'm completely in the dark.

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,850
The Wan Hai case

32
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,380
ended up like this,

33
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,060
and no one's told me the truth!

34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,940
And of course,
no one bothered to warn me.

35
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,060
If this case blows up,

36
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,260
you all know the consequences.

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,890
Xu,

38
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,940
you really think

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,260
you'll coast to retirement untouched?

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,500
And you, Li Renjun,

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,340
our new prosecutor-general.

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,940
You think your seat's secure?

43
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,410
If this all goes south,

44
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,290
I'll become a joke across the province.

45
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,170
Ms. Lan,

46
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,010
maybe we should

47
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,130
all take a breath for now.

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,380
About this matter, I...

49
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,610
Sit down.

50
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,260
We still don't know what Sun Fei

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,290
and Jiang Hongjun did,

52
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,450
or if there are

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,260
more bad apples like them in our ranks.

54
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,260
Their selfish actions

55
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,380
have seriously damaged the image

56
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,540
of Dongping's entire
political and legal system.

57
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,570
All we can do now is wait
for the hammer to fall.

58
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,340
Eat.

59
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,490
What, do I have to feed you now?

60
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,050
Has anyone come by?

61
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,370
The investigators?

62
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,780
I told you last time, didn't I?

63
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,810
Why are you still obsessing over this?

64
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,460
You're delusional.

65
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,410
It's not happening!

66
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,490
Don't believe me?

67
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,460
Go wait by the door

68
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,660
and see if anyone actually comes.

69
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,410
I just don't get it.

70
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,490
Doesn't the law matter anymore?

71
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,170
Isn't anyone going to step in?

72
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,290
Why is this happening?

73
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,930
Why?

74
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,290
Well,

75
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,100
I get where you're coming from.

76
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,780
You grew up

77
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,900
without ever losing,

78
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,610
never got tricked,

79
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,580
or took a fall.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,250
Things just fell into place for you.

81
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,610
You think you can always win.

82
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,410
But deep down, you should know,

83
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,580
it's because your dad
cleaned up every mess for you;

84
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,730
you never even had to know anything.

85
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,220
He took care of everything.

86
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,220
But that's changed now,

87
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,100
Chao.

88
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,140
Your dad's in prison.

89
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,370
The Wan family is fading.

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,780
You've been through a lot
these past two years.

91
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,730
It's time to grow up

92
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,580
and face reality.

93
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,020
I don't need anything else,

94
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,850
I just want to

95
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,850
settle this whole compensation mess.

96
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,540
Once that's done,

97
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,660
you are basically off the hook.

98
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,780
You can't just hide here forever.

99
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,220
Chao,

100
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,900
I've been there.

101
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,410
I've lost before.

102
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,220
Take it from me,

103
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,250
everyone

104
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,020
hits rock bottom sometimes.

105
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,610
You've got to know when to let go.

106
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,490
That's life. Accept it.

107
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,930
Fine.

108
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,100
Just tell me,
what am I supposed to accept?

109
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,340
What did we ever do wrong?

110
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,610
Now that

111
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,580
the provincial office
has actually sent people

112
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,460
to investigate the incident,

113
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,490
if they just catch the one
who set us up,

114
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,610
we wouldn't have to pay a cent.

115
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,370
And as for my dad,

116
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,540
is he a gangster?

117
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,340
If they clear his name,

118
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,980
my dad wouldn't be

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,020
sitting in there now, right?

120
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,810
You're not a kid anymore!

121
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,410
Isn't it obvious by now?

122
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,660
If the higher-ups could
actually fix things,

123
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,370
do you think we would be in this mess?

124
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,290
Would he still be locked up?

125
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,340
What does that tell you?

126
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,580
They control everything!

127
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,170
The more you push back,
the harder they press.

128
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,540
Me pushing back?

129
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,340
I'm not the problem here!

130
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,660
What did we do wrong?

131
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,580
Pushing back?

132
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,290
You're just scared, that's all.

133
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,900
What's the use of being scared?

134
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,810
Scared or not,

135
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,850
those people want you dead!

136
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,700
If you don't comply,

137
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,850
they'll destroy you!

138
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,660
Then so be it!

139
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,930
Like my dad said,

140
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,580
better to die on your feet
than live on your knees!

141
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,370
So tell me who they are,

142
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,370
I'll confront them myself!

143
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,780
Let me deal with them!

144
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,540
You're not going anywhere!

145
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,370
Let go of me, you coward!

146
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,460
I'll hit...

147
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,460
Hit me!

148
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,020
Go ahead!

149
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,980
Hit me if you want,

150
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,180
better you than them.

151
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,100
Come on, hit me!

152
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,770
Just listen to me, okay?

153
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,530
I'm begging you, please!

154
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,940
Don't go out there!

155
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,730
It's dangerous!...

156
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,180
Uncle...

157
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,060
I...

158
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,820
Chao, stay inside!

159
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,340
Let go of me!

160
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,180
Let me go!

161
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,010
Let go!

162
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,980
Let me go!

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,980
- Chao!
- Let me...

164
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,580
Mr. Wan,

165
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,770
impressive.

166
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,700
Right under my nose
this whole time, huh?

167
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,420
Well...

168
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,340
Uncle!

169
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,940
Is that him?

170
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,420
Get him.

171
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,010
Chao!

172
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,250
Chao, run!

173
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,490
Chao, get out!

174
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,700
Get him!

175
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,730
Chao, run!

176
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,460
Stop!

177
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,460
Stay there!

178
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,580
Go ahead, hit me!

179
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,580
Chao!

180
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,610
Are you okay?

181
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,060
You sure can run, huh?

182
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,610
Stop! That's enough!

183
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,130
Come at me!

184
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,300
Take them!

185
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,650
Sir,

186
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,700
wait...

187
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,340
Move it!

188
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,370
Who sent you?

189
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,130
Cut the crap!

190
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,730
Get in!

191
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,250
Mr. Chen is my friend.

192
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,060
You...

193
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,610
In the car!

194
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,180
Get in!

195
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,820
Where are you taking us?

196
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,700
Just get in!

197
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,130
Move!

198
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,890
Wait, man...

199
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,200
[Loyal to the Party
Serve the People]

200
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,420
So, what brings you here?

201
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,420
Work.

202
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,250
On what?

203
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,010
What's wrong?

204
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,340
You're not even gonna talk to me now?

205
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,650
You know Zhongxing Road?

206
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,770
There's a Jinhai KTV.

207
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,370
I just pulled

208
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,130
the surveillance footage
from around that area.

209
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,650
Jinhai KTV?

210
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,980
What case is that for?

211
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,610
Still my brother's case.

212
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,730
It's confirmed now.

213
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,850
Jinhai KTV

214
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,370
is where my brother

215
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,850
actually died.

216
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,340
We checked all around it.

217
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,060
No useful leads so far.

218
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,580
So, what now?

219
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,460
I'll keep digging.

220
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,370
Qin Feng,

221
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,370
you said your piece
outside my place the other day

222
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,010
and then just walked away.

223
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,820
Don't you want to hear my side?

224
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,300
You called yourself a coward,

225
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,530
but you know what I see?

226
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,530
Honestly,

227
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,370
I think deep down, you're a fighter.

228
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,460
You just never give yourself any credit.

229
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,580
That day, you said

230
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,850
you didn't deserve to like me.

231
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,700
But that's not
for anyone else to decide,

232
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,530
it's up to you.

233
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,130
If you can't believe in yourself,

234
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,610
how can you expect anyone else to?

235
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,650
That's my answer.

236
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,180
So, nothing you want to say to me?

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,100
I'm giving you one more chance.

238
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,340
Thank you, Jing,

239
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,940
for telling me all this.

240
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,980
Hopeless idiot.

241
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,010
Yanxin,

242
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,530
is Zijian home?

243
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,490
No, he's not.

244
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,610
He's swamped at work today.

245
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,370
Alright, I'm just outside your place.

246
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,060
What's with you lately?

247
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,180
You only show up when Zijian's gone?

248
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,300
You sure you're my brother?

249
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,060
What's up? Have a seat.

250
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,370
Nothing, really.

251
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,980
So,

252
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,100
how are things with you two lately?

253
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,650
We're fine.

254
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,580
He's been great,

255
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,850
just super busy.

256
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,850
He didn't even have time to help me

257
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,650
choose a wedding planner.

258
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,530
Wedding planner?

259
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,460
That's just the start.

260
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,130
I had to pick the venue,

261
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,130
the honeymoon location,

262
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,370
book every flight and hotel—

263
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,940
did it all by myself.

264
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,820
So,

265
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,340
what's keeping him so busy anyway?

266
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,850
Tianlong's business, what else?

267
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,980
I'm telling you,

268
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,530
Zijian is practically

269
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,220
running that place.

270
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,010
Long relies on him for everything.

271
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,180
If you ask me,

272
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,370
Tianlong would be lost

273
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,940
without him.

274
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,010
He's their future.

275
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,010
How's that?

276
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,580
You know, Long's trying

277
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,100
to get into the clean energy business?

278
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,370
Zijian and Yun's connections

279
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,420
saved him so much trouble.

280
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,460
Yun even introduced him

281
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,180
to Wanchuan Mining,

282
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,530
got Long's project moving.

283
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,820
Without Zijian,

284
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,820
he'd have to start from scratch—

285
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,730
even $500 million wouldn't be enough.

286
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,420
So that house of yours

287
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,300
is really nothing to worry about.

288
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,100
Long just wanted to show some goodwill.

289
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,490
Sometimes I wonder

290
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,100
if those childhood fevers
fried your brain.

291
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,340
Come on,

292
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,890
doesn't it all make sense?

293
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,490
That's not something you "just do"

294
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,610
for the sake of it!

295
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,610
- Listen to me...
- Hundred million...

296
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,940
- Honey.
- Five hundred million! Yun...

297
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,890
You're back already?

298
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,890
But you said you'd be busy all day.

299
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,890
Things were quiet at work,

300
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,340
so I figured I'd come home early
and see you.

301
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,460
Renjun's here.

302
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,770
Renjun, what brings you by?

303
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,850
I just wanted

304
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,220
to see how Yanxin was doing.

305
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,530
FYI,

306
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,180
Renjun ditched work just to see you.

307
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,460
Did you call him over?

308
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,050
Nope.

309
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,700
He just showed up out of nowhere.

310
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,460
Yeah,

311
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,180
I just happened to have some free time

312
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,900
and wanted to check in.

313
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,330
Renjun,

314
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,460
I heard you've been really busy lately.

315
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,940
Why do you say that?

316
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,460
Isn't there a new...

317
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,460
What?

318
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,980
I need to talk business with Renjun.

319
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,220
I'll go work on my draft.

320
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:31,770
Okay.

321
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,330
We'll talk later.

322
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,330
Renjun,

323
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,290
they sent in a task force, didn't they?

324
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,460
Pretty well-informed, huh?

325
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,940
They've taken in two people already.

326
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,090
How'd you know?

327
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,010
Dongping's not that big.

328
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,380
Renjun.

329
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,250
Did they question you?

330
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,050
Well...

331
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,050
Why do you think

332
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,330
they'd question me?

333
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,330
I've been

334
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,220
meaning to reach out to you,

335
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,980
but since you're here,

336
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,250
I think the two of us should

337
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,010
really talk this through.

338
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,460
I believe

339
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,940
the task force

340
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,250
is here because of the Wan Hai case.

341
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,090
Enlighten me,

342
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,290
what makes you so sure about that?

343
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,140
I can't figure it out.

344
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,460
Just tell me, am I right?

345
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,810
Who told you

346
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,490
about the task force?

347
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,050
Xie Hongfei.

348
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,860
Based on what we've found,

349
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,220
Cheng Zijian

350
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,220
has close ties to Wang Yu,

351
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,620
Xie Hongfei, and Sun Fei.

352
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,140
When did they first

353
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,330
start working together?

354
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,010
About three years ago.

355
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,860
Write that down.

356
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,180
Looking at their phone records,

357
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,730
after Cheng first reached out to Wang,

358
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,460
their relationship clearly got closer.

359
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,330
Judging by the frequency

360
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,330
and duration

361
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,660
of those calls,

362
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,660
they seemed to be up to something.

363
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,460
And I found something else interesting.

364
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,680
[Wen Qin]

365
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,380
Wen Qin?

366
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,400
[Chief Judge]

367
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,090
Chief Judge of First Criminal Division
at Dongping Intermediate People's Court,

368
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,050
and the presiding judge
for the Wan Hai case.

369
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,330
That's right.

370
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,620
Apart from Jiang Hongjun

371
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,620
and Chen Youcai,

372
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,940
Cheng Zijian maintained contact

373
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,420
with everyone else involved.

374
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,770
Chen Youcai had dealings with Wang Yu,

375
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,570
and Jiang Hongjun

376
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,860
was linked to Sun Fei.

377
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,770
So it's all connected.

378
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,140
Cheng Zijian sits at the center,

379
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,530
and the others

380
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,490
are all key players in the Wan Hai case.

381
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,530
Plus,

382
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,460
he's Li Renjun's brother-in-law.

383
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,090
A fixer in the legal world.

384
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,700
Cheng's background
isn't all that complicated.

385
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,180
He got his master's and started
at the county prosecutor's office.

386
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,860
About five years ago, he quit,

387
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,290
moved to Dongping,
and soon joined Tianlong Company

388
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,530
as their general counsel.

389
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,140
Right after that, he brought Tianlong in

390
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,660
as an investor
and set up his own law firm.

391
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,090
Renjun,

392
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,900
to be honest,

393
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,420
Xie and I get along pretty well.

394
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,700
We've known each other since our days

395
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,530
at the county prosecutor's office,

396
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,940
and got even closer
during the Wan Hai case.

397
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,330
Back then,

398
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,660
we watched out for each other.

399
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,700
It's just how it is, you get it.

400
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,530
Renjun,

401
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,140
keep that between us, okay?

402
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,420
Your office is handling
the Wan Hai case now,

403
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,290
so you gave him

404
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,900
the job as Wan Hai's defense lawyer?

405
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,700
He said my case was
dragging on too long.

406
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,460
Asked me if I could change a lawyer.

407
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,490
I said my lawyer was very good.

408
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,460
Why should I change?

409
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,940
He ignored me.

410
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,010
Unexpectedly, a few days later,

411
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,220
Zhang Wenjing suddenly became "a member
of criminal organization"!

412
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,090
Next thing I know,
Qiao Zhenxing was dead!

413
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,380
About the second autopsy,

414
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,180
you were the only person

415
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,420
in your Procuratorate that I called.

416
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,220
You called Xie Hongfei, and then he...

417
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,050
What did Xie Hongfei call you for?

418
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,220
I remember it was

419
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,940
about the Wan Hai case.

420
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,530
What else would we be talking about?

421
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,620
Here in Dongping,

422
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:56,770
Mr. Chen

423
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,620
also feels like family to me.

424
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,250
I see Zijian as my own brother.

425
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,770
Actually, today,

426
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,220
I wanted to take this chance

427
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,530
to apologize.

428
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,570
You asked me about this before,

429
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,940
and I wasn't straight with you.

430
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,810
It's been weighing on me

431
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,380
ever since.

432
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,220
I just couldn't let it go.

433
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,660
You've treated me like family,

434
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,490
and I think we should

435
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,730
be able to

436
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,420
talk openly about anything, right?

437
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,570
So I want to be straight with you now.

438
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,620
Thanks for saying that, Zijian.

439
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,010
It means a lot to me.

440
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,220
I've trusted you more than anyone.

441
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,250
That's why I let you marry my sister.

442
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,620
Like you said,

443
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,730
we're family.

444
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:02,940
So,

445
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,250
when it comes to

446
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,460
certain things,

447
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,090
I hope you can level with me.

448
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,700
What I really want to know is—

449
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,940
what's the real deal
between you and Chen Shenglong?

450
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,770
You're not

451
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,420
just his employee, are you?

452
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,730
What kind of guy is he, honestly?

453
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,860
Renjun, are you asking that now

454
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,460
because

455
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,380
the investigators are digging into him?

456
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,700
- No!
- They're suspicious about him?

457
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,770
Don't read too much into it.

458
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,860
I did look into him a bit.

459
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,530
I just find it strange, his company

460
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,530
went from nothing to huge,

461
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,380
with all the funding coming from abroad.

462
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,050
And as for Chen himself,

463
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,980
the more I dig, honestly,

464
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,250
the less

465
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,980
it adds up.

466
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,330
You know what I mean?

467
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,220
Renjun, you're digging hard here, huh?

468
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,380
I just don't get it.

469
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,420
Is there something off about them?

470
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,660
I'm telling you, don't overthink it.

471
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,810
Let's look at it from another angle.

472
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:14,980
Like,

473
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,620
can I unload that house or not?

474
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,090
And my wife's still helping him
with that mine

475
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,860
and all that clean energy stuff.

476
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,900
And you're about to marry Yanxin.

477
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,660
Which means, as a family,

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,700
we're all mixed up

479
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,860
with this businessman.

480
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,530
Yun and I, given our jobs...

481
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,700
You used to be an official, too, right?

482
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,620
We have to be careful, right?

483
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,140
With everything happening now,

484
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,700
what would you do if you were me?

485
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,980
So,

486
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,730
Zijian,

487
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,140
just tell me the truth.

488
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,330
At least give me some peace of mind,

489
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:50,730
okay?

490
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,770
Tianlong Company funds him.

491
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,570
Yeah.

492
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,810
The asset report shows

493
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,180
Cheng Zijian's entire fortune

494
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,810
is linked to Tianlong.

495
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,810
Nearly every case his firm handles

496
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,860
has something to do with Tianlong.

497
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,180
He even lives in

498
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,530
Dadu Xishan, which was

499
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,530
developed by Tianlong.

500
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,220
We got a pretty clear picture now.

501
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,900
It confirms what you
and Hong Liang suspected.

502
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,530
Wang Yu pulled these people together

503
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,730
and orchestrated the Wan Hai case

504
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,530
just to regain the freight hub.

505
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,860
Meanwhile, some officials in Dongping

506
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,140
were chasing big anti-gang wins,

507
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,570
and ended up helping him,
wittingly or not.

508
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,940
What about the mine incident?

509
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,940
It was staged.

510
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,530
So who was behind it?

511
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,380
Once the Wan Hai case was decided,

512
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,940
just getting the hub

513
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,810
wasn't enough for Wang Yu,

514
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,290
he wanted their mine, too.

515
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,420
So he made his move, taking advantage

516
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,460
when they were vulnerable.

517
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,290
Wan Hai was already crushed by Wang Yu.

518
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,460
If Wang wanted the mine,

519
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,980
why not just negotiate
with the Wan family?

520
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,730
Why stage a disaster

521
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,220
and put us onto it?

522
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,900
It's so risky.

523
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,940
Maybe the Wan family refused him.

524
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,900
But if we're talking about cost,

525
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,420
it'd be way cheaper

526
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,090
to deal with the Wan family,

527
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,380
not stage a whole mine accident.

528
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,090
A lot less risky, too.

529
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,490
Mr. Song,

530
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,940
you said

531
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,900
Cheng made the very first call

532
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,460
to Wang, right?

533
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,010
Yes.

534
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,570
Definitely not Wang calling first?

535
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,220
Positive.

536
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,140
So let's consider this possibility,

537
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,460
what if

538
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,250
the whole "Wan Hai is a gangster" setup

539
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,730
wasn't started by Wang Yu,

540
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,460
but by Cheng Zijian?

541
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,420
Or even by someone else,

542
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,860
someone

543
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,570
we haven't even thought about yet.

544
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,570
And Jiang Hongjun and Sun Fei

545
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,940
covered up the disaster for this person.

546
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,010
Mr. Song,

547
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,420
please have the police

548
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,220
keep digging into Cheng Zijian,

549
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,730
especially

550
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,380
that Tianlong Company he works for.

551
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,330
Understood.

552
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,940
And do it quietly.

553
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,250
If we're right,

554
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,530
this person is the key to everything.

555
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,860
To catch the big fish,

556
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,980
we need to be patient.

557
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,460
Got it.

558
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,660
You might think

559
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,090
Mr. Chen rose to the top overnight.

560
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,660
But the truth is,

561
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,570
he had a powerful mentor early on.

562
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,460
You've probably heard of him—

563
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,090
Yu Tiancheng.

564
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,770
Which "Yu"?

565
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,530
Like the legendary emperor Yu.

566
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,490
Actually, Mr. Chen

567
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,140
told me about this before.

568
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,620
He said

569
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,660
back in junior high

570
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,660
he dropped out

571
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,900
and started working for Yu.

572
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,330
They've been close since he was a teen,

573
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:50,860
over 20 years now.

574
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,050
His mentor's a good guy,

575
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,420
got vision and compassion.

576
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,730
Even after making it big,

577
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,860
he wanted to come back

578
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,140
and help Dongping grow.

579
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,860
That's why he set up Tianlong here,

580
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,460
for Chen.

581
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,140
Every penny

582
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,140
came from Yu.

583
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,490
Relax, there's nothing fishy going on.

584
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,620
People like you think

585
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,860
Chen is this mysterious man,

586
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,620
but there's no mystery here.

587
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,050
He got lucky with the right mentor.

588
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,290
After years of loyalty,

589
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,330
this mentor

590
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,380
gave him a chance.

591
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,940
That's why Chen's where he is today,

592
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,330
plain and simple.

593
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,490
Got it.

594
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,250
Oh, one more thing.

595
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,420
About

596
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,460
Wang Yu,

597
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,980
and his freight hub...

598
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,220
A couple of years ago,

599
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,380
Chen tried to

600
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,420
get his hands

601
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,730
on that hub, didn't he?

602
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,090
You were involved

603
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,530
in that whole thing, right?

604
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,010
Actually,

605
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,090
I need to get going.

606
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,140
Just remembered

607
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,730
I have work to take care of.

608
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,380
Alright.

609
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,220
My jacket.

610
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,940
I'll have Yanxin see you out.

611
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,730
Renjun.

612
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,860
You know,

613
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,090
it's a relief to have

614
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,980
an honest conversation with you,

615
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,980
just like family.

616
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,420
I'll promise you this,

617
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,980
as long as Yanxin is happy,

618
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,330
I don't mind
whatever I have to go through.

619
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,180
I get what you're saying today,

620
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,250
loud and clear.

621
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,180
Thanks, Renjun.

622
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,330
Got it.

623
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,420
Yanxin, I'm heading out.

624
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,490
Leaving already?

625
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,050
Renjun?

626
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,140
Renjun!

627
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,140
Renjun!

628
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,700
Did you come to see me?

629
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,380
Why'd you leave
right after talking to Zijian?

630
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,380
Hey, hold on!

631
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,570
Tell me the truth,

632
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,490
did you and Yun fight?

633
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,770
No worries, I'll call her

634
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,940
and smooth things over for you.

635
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,220
What are you even talking about?

636
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,770
Then what is it?

637
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,730
Silly girl, for your own good,

638
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,660
it's better not to know too much.

639
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,530
Go home.

640
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,380
Like you're some genius!

641
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,980
So dramatic.

642
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,250
What exactly are they investigating?

643
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,860
Still the Wan Hai case?

644
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,330
You think they'll overturn it?

645
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,570
How far do you think they've gotten?

646
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,250
Will they find anything on me?

647
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,980
It was Wang Yu who reported Wan Hai.

648
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,380
What's that got to do with you?

649
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,660
Think about it,

650
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,380
did you ever give Wang a single cent?

651
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,810
No, right?

652
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,700
So relax,

653
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,420
none of this comes back to you.

654
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,330
Nothing on me, huh?

655
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,620
How about you?

656
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,700
Long,

657
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,940
remember the first time you came to me

658
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,940
about Wan Hai?

659
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,530
Sir, Mr. Cheng is here.

660
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,420
Mr. Chen.

661
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,050
Can I trust you?

662
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,050
If you didn't,

663
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,900
you wouldn't be asking.

664
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,420
I want to take someone,

665
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,290
or a company,

666
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,940
out of the game.

667
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,250
Can you help me?

668
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,730
Who is it?

669
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,620
Which company?

670
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,330
You can't hide anything from me.

671
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,620
It's a company as big as mine,

672
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,140
maybe even bigger.

673
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,730
They have more resources,

674
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,980
but I won't stop until they're finished.

675
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,940
If I remember right,

676
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,730
it only took me a week,

677
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,770
less than a week, actually,

678
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,980
to dig up everything on Wan Hai,

679
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,900
even stuff

680
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,980
you wouldn't tell me—

681
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,380
the bad blood between you two.

682
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,780

[Profile: Wang Yu]
the original owner of the freight hub.

684
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,090
I can make it look like

685
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,130
Wan Hai bullied him

686
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,900
into selling the hub.

687
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,740
In this case alone,

688
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,690
you've got

689
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,940
unlawful detention,

690
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:31,980
assault,

691
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,130
forced deal,

692
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,340
and extortion.

693
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,460
Any one of those
could take Wan Hai down.

694
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,260
Together, and it's game over.

695
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,210
I've even lined up a witness for you.

696
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:41,900

His company's been
losing money for years,

699
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,490
he's scraping by.

00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,380
Getting him on board is easy.

701
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,690
Mr. Chen,

702
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,420
this is my plan.

703
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,570
Just follow my lead.

704
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,010
Mr. Cheng,

705
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,650

what do you really want?

707

You really want to know?

708
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:17,900
Mr. Cheng,

709
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,570
just be straight with me,

710
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,260
what do you want?

711
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,460
Mr. Chen,

712
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,300
I've heard your story plenty of times.

713
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,690
Want to

714
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,610
hear mine?

715
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,380
I'm just

716
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,860
a small-town kid.

717
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,260
Growing up, I always knew

718
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,740
studying was my only ticket out.

719
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,610
So I worked hard,

720
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,420
got into college,

721
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,340
and landed a job

722
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,610
as a prosecutor.

723
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,340
I thought that would change my life.

724
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,380
But I was wrong.

725
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,490
Turns out, I was never cut out for it.

726
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,650
I wasn't born

727
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,010
to do that boring job,

728
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,740
and live that boring life.

729
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,610
So one day,

730
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,170
I finally realized
exactly what I wanted.

731
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,530
I want to be somebody.

732
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,940
I want wealth, power.

733
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,130
I want to change my fate.

734
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,650
So I quit my job and came to Dongping.

735
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,380
And that's how I met you.

736
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:43,940
Long,

737
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,210
you saw my potential.

738
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,650
You gave me a shot.

739
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,050
Working with you,

740
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,050
I know I chose the right boss.

741
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,300
So, bottom line,

742
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,420
they'll never find anything on you.

743
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,780
But chances are good they'll get to me.

744
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,860
Even if they do,

745
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,530
I'll do whatever it takes

746
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,260
to keep you safe.

748
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,460
Draft a new contract.

749
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,210
Give yourself whatever share in Tianlong

750
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,860
you want.

751
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,860
They say everything
follows its own rules.

752
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,090
But I've never liked

753
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,570
playing by the rules.

754
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,940
I think life is only meaningful

755
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,490
when you break the rules.

756
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,490

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,490

00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,490
take control of our own fate.

759
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,690
In the end,

760
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,900
fortune

761
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,260
favors the bold.

762
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,460
So?

763
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,050
Got a good read on him by now?

764
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,490
"Read on him"? Please.

765
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,610
He'll confess

766
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,740
the second I step in the room.

767
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,010
Getting pretty cocky these days, huh?

768
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,210
Where's that confidence coming from?

769
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,570
Just don't go turning yourself into

770
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,940
the cautionary tale for the rest of us.

771
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,380
That'd be pretty embarrassing.

772
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,170
Five minutes. Bet?

773
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,490
Five minutes, huh?

774
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,610
Clock starts the moment you walk in.

775
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,690
I'll give you one more minute.

776
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,260
Now go, hurry up.

777
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,090
Hong Liang.

778
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:46,820
Seriously,

779
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,980
why drag Luo and Zhang

780
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,900
into this?

781
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,300
If you want to talk,

782
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,420
you could've

783
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,490
just come to me.

784
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,170
That's it. Because it's between us,

785
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,210
I'm actually

786
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,300
kind of struggling.

787
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,690
Nervous, you know?

788
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,300
Nervous? Come on.

789
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,340
Listen,

790
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:04,940
guys,

791
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,260
can you take that off Mr. Sun?

792
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,530
No, it's fine!

793
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,010
Listen, Hong Liang,

794
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,260
we're all civil servants here.

795
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,490
We should play

796
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,610
by the rules.

797
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,170
I appreciate it,

798
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,130
but just leave it be.

799
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,380
Thanks for cooperating, Mr. Sun.

800
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:18,900
No problem.

801
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,860
Respect.

802
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,050
Take five, guys.

803
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,420
Thanks.

804
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,940
Man, your hair's

805
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,780
getting so grey.

806
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,010
Gotten worse after all these years.

807
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,010
See?

808
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:34,980
Worse than I thought.

809
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,570
This job's aging me fast.

810
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,010
Yeah, at your wedding,

811
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,900
your hair was jet-black.

812
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,490
Remember

813
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,300
who drove your wedding car?

814
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,130
You forgot, right?

815
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,610
Me.

816
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,530
Yep.

817
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,380
You don't even remember...

818
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,900
You were so nervous that day,

819
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,780
you even messed up your tie.

820
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,980
And you forgot to zip your pants.

821
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:03,860
You ended up

822
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,420
pinning them shut with a safety pin!

823
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,170
Come on, give me a break.

824
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:08,940
Alright.

825
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,860
Let's get to why we're really here.

826
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,340
Yeah,

827
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,690
let's get to it.

828
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:14,900
Hong Liang.

829
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,570
There's

830
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,380
something

831
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,260
I've been holding onto

832
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,780
for over ten years.

833
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,170
A secret

834
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,530
I want to tell you.

835
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,570
Years ago,

836
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,170
you,

837
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,130
Qiao Zhenxing,

838
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,130
and

839
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:40,860
Li Renjun,

840
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,610
back when you started
at the prosecutor's office,

841
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,740
you ran into

842
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,650
something.

843
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,610
You know what I mean?

844
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,610
I'm sorry.

845
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,980
I made a mistake with that case.

846
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,010
Sun Yihu

847
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,460
might not have been the prime culprit.

848
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,780
Sun Yihu, sentenced to death,

849
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,010
and permanently
stripped of political rights.

850
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,260
It was definitely Wang Dayou

851
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,210
who pulled the trigger.

852
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,980
No way

853
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,490
it was your dad.

854
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,610
I wanted

855
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,610
to keep digging myself,

856
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,740
but they sent me to some remote post.

857
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,460
How was I supposed to keep digging?

858
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:24,980
You mean the case?

859
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,010
What case?

860
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,980
The one that changed everything.

861
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,740
Remember back then,

862
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,380
when Min had just finished college?

863
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,490
She was looking for a boyfriend.

864
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,380
Mr. Jiang

865
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,010
was sizing up

866
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,420
you three rookies.

867
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,610
He knew I had a knack
for reading people,

868
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,900
so he asked,

869
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,980
"Who do you think
would be good for her?"

870
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,900
I played it close to the vest,

871
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,130
because honestly,

872
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,570
I could tell you and Min

873
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,940
already had a thing for each other.

874
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,090
Really?

875
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,860
I could see right through you guys.

876
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,050
So I told him

877
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:05,530
that

878
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,210
"Renjun is

879
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,460
power-hungry."

880
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,130
See?

881
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,690
Turns out I was right.

882
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,570
"And Zhenxing is

883
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,210
way too stubborn."

884
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,340
"But Hong Liang's solid.

885
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,300
Thorough,

886
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,530
responsible,

887
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,380
honest, and kind."

888
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,210
And now, look,

889
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,210
you and Min are doing great.

890
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,130
Yeah, yeah,

891
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,570
so you're saying I owe my happiness

892
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,260
to you, huh?

893
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,690
I wouldn't go that far.

894
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,090
Not really.

895
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,050
Well,

896
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,650
we go way back, huh?

897
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:40,380
Absolutely.

898
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,900
So, friend to friend, mind telling me

899
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,050
why you're holding three fake passports?

900
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,610
