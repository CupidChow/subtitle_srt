00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,860
Thirteen years ago,

2
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,100
you merged with Dacheng Mining.

3
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,210
Who owned Dacheng Mining?

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,420
Yu Tiancheng.

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,330
The mining permit you requested
came through.

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,530
Go finish the paperwork.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:26,940
Thank you so much.

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,690
Thirteen years ago,
Wan Hai took Yu Tiancheng's mine.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,010
Ten years later,

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,580
Yu Tiancheng wanted to reclaim it

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,580
because they found
copper and nickel in it.

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,650
The two of them

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,130
fought fiercely

14
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,370
over those resources

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,300
for years.

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,330
Disputes between mines are common,

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,900
but you two took it to the extreme.

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,330
You managed the merger

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,540
without buying it out

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,690
or spending a single penny.

21
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,330
How did you pull that off?

[In the Name of Justice]

[Episode 27]

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,340
Jiang Yuan,

25
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,060
I get that

26
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,260
you want to come back

27
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,540
and make a name for yourself,

28
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,220
but you can't do it under my banner,

29
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,690
especially not where I used to work.

30
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,940
What would people think of you?

31
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,010
Or me?

32
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,340
Sir, I must object.

33
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,850
I've never used your name to do anything,

34
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,780
and I've never asked
for your help, right?

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,290
I built my business in Dongping

36
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,340
completely on my own.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,820
It's a time of fair competition now.

38
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,610
Dongping has resources
and development plans,

39
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,010
and I want to grow alongside it.

40
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,380
What's wrong with that?

41
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,690
Everywhere else is fine,

42
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,730
but not in Dongping.

43
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,570
But...

44
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,660
You need to leave Dongping.

45
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,980
But why?

46
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,100
I have to do it in Dongping.

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,690
Only Dongping has

48
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,260
copper and nickel.

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,570
Plus, I've planned this for three years,

50
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,290
and now you ask me to just leave.

51
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,170
H-How can I?

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,820
Three years?

53
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,610
Weren't you studying abroad
three years ago?

54
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,130
Sir, let me

55
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,290
walk you through it.

56
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,890
Here's the thing:

57
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,570
the copper-nickel mine
we found in Dongping

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,060
is actually

59
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,010
Yu Tiancheng's

60
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,500
old mine.

61
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,500
Which mine?

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,500
The one Yu Tiancheng used to own.

63
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,890
The mining permit you requested
came through.

64
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,690
Go finish the paperwork.

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,140
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

66
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,290
Thank you so much.

67
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,290
Remember, we're even.

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,340
Mr. Jiang,

69
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,020
I know

70
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,980
you're mad at me,

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,220
but I'm truly sorry

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,810
about what happened.

73
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,610
Yu Tiancheng,

74
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,780
don't think I don't know
what you're up to.

75
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,980
However, I didn't expect

76
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,490
you would go after my son.

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,410
Mr. Jiang,

78
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,410
I completely understand how you feel.

79
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,250
Your son Yuan is studying abroad,

80
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,100
but my student,

81
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,700
no,

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,020
my child,

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,490
is still in prison.

84
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,100
This record will stay with him forever.

85
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,580
Who will take responsibility
for his future?

86
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,140
Let's go.

87
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,980
You said

88
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,050
you started planning it three years ago?

89
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:14,850
No,

90
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,900
thirteen years ago.

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,810
Thirteen years ago, Wan Hai took
Yu Tiancheng's mine.

92
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,410
And three years ago,

93
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,250
Yu Tiancheng wanted it back

94
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,540
cause they found copper and nickel in it.

95
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,810
It just so happens

96
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,250
that Wan Hai is a mobster.

97
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,140
So that way,

98
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,490
we could...

99
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,730
What did you do?

100
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,020
Mobster?

101
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,410
Who do you think is the real Mobster?

102
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,020
Wan Hai or Yu Tiancheng?

103
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,250
Do you even know

104
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,700
what kind of man Yu Tiancheng is?

105
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,810
Why didn't you tell me?

106
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,700
But, what's wrong with him?

107
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,460
How long has it been
since you last saw Yu Tiancheng?

108
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,170
Do you even know what he's like now?

109
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,290
Yu Tiancheng's company has gone public

110
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,660
and is listed in Hong Kong.

111
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,850
I'm working with him

112
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,220
because he's useful to me.

113
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,980
He has the funds,
and I have the expertise!

114
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,140
And what does Wan Hai have?

115
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,660
He's just a small-time thug!

116
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,490
He won't pull this off!

117
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,580
Only Yu Tiancheng

118
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,660
and I can!

119
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,730
Wan Hai's a mobster now,

120
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,340
and he was one
thirteen years ago as well!

121
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,700
Who says Wan Hai was a mobster
thirteen years ago?

122
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,730
And who says Yu Tiancheng

123
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,460
wasn't a mobster thirteen years ago?

124
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,410
Let me tell you,

125
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,850
no way!

126
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,540
Wan Hai has to be a mobster!

127
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,050
If he weren't a mobster,

128
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,930
Yu Tiancheng and I
wouldn't get this mine.

129
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,100
And if I can't have this mine,

130
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,900
the past three years of my life
would be in vain!

131
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,410

132
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,140

this isn't over.

I understand there's some bad blood
between you two.

Disputes between mines are common,

140

141
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,100
This is

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,100
a grave matter

Considering that both your companies

and

158
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,610
leave Dongping

159
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,770

How did you find out I was here?

We're good at locating people.

on being a lawyer?

was a miscarriage of justice.

184
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,730
and we need your help.

185
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,700
What do you want me to do?

186
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,580
So Wan Hai isn't cooperating, huh?

187
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,820
Have you considered

188
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,850
why he isn't cooperating?

189
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,130
The legal system

190
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,490

191
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,580
for social justice.

192
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,460
But if the judiciary

193
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,700
and legal procedures aren't fair,

194
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,490
then what's the point
of having just laws?

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,980
If you don't get that,

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,770
I have nothing to say to you.

197
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,340
There's a protection network

198
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,490
within Dongping's judicial system.

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,700
Our firm was smashed.

200
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,610
We have to suspend practice.

201
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,530
What you call

202
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,820
fairness,

203
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,890
justice,

204
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,940
truth,

205
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,940
that's all perfect ideals

206
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,980
from textbooks.

207
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,300
But real life isn't ideal.

208
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,730
It's all about survival.

209
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,220
We have to put up with it.

210
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,700
We can't defeat them.

211
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,060
I didn't mention it,

212
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,300
but

213
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,770
one minute they accused me
of being a core gang member,

214
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,580
and the next

215
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,460
they dropped all charges

216
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,700
and let me go.

217
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,530
They decide

218
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,220
whether the evidence

219
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,770
is real or not.

220
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,650
That's how they operate.

221
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,220
You want me to help you?

222
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,060
But what will happen to me
when you're gone?

223
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,650
You can't overturn this case
just like that.

224
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,530
You couldn't before,

225
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,820
but you can now?

226
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,650
Please have faith in our determination
and strength this time.

227
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,730
Don't tell me that.

228
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,250
Ms. Zheng, as you've seen,

229
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,580
I'm not a lawyer anymore,

230
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,460
nor do I want to be one.

231
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,100
So none of this concerns me anymore.

232
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,700
You were the one
who gave my number to Wan Chao

233
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,420
and asked him to give me the evidence,

234
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,850
right?

235
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,770
We set up this special task force

236
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,890
because of that evidence,

237
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,460
that someone caused the mining accident.

238
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,650
I know you still
have a heart for justice

239
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,650
and want the Wan Hai case
to be overturned.

240
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,530
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
had Wan Chao reach out to me.

241
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,770
It's unclear whether Wan Chao is alive.

242
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,340
We have a moral and legal obligation

243
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,420
to thoroughly investigate
the Wan Hai case

244
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,130
and restore the Wans' reputation.

245
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,770
I know you want that too.

246
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,700
We really need your help.

247
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,370
Please keep faith in the justice system

248
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,340
and yourself.

249
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,490
Having faith that lawyers

250
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,980
are essential for building

251
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,460
a rule-of-law society.

252
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,010
Ms. Zheng,

253
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,890
you might be right,

254
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,770
but I'm ready for a different life.

255
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,580
I just want to work my nine-to-five job,

256
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,530
earn a steady paycheck

257
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,490
and spend all my free time
with my daughter.

258
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,300
Law is no longer a part of my life,

259
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,130
nor do I want it to be.

260
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,100
I have to go to work now.

261
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:22,700
Goodbye.

262
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,700
Ms. Zhang,

263
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,530
we'll meet again.

264
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,940
Excuse me.

265
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:48,850
Come in.

266
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,730
Mr. Xu,

267
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,460
I'm Song Yanchuan, chief

268
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,730
of Jiangnan Criminal
Investigation Detachment.

269
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,060
What brought the Jiangnan CID

270
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,370
to my office?

271
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,300
Have a seat.

272
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,460
Song,

273
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,340
I know you.

274
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,650
You don't just visit me for no reason.

275
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,250
So, what do you need?

276
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,370
I'm here in Dongping on a case.

277
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,980
I need

278
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,490
all the surveillance footage

279
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,610
from the Wanchuan Mining Accident

280
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,700
and Qiao Zhenxing's autopsy report.

281
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,370
Mr. Xiu,

282
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,250
Jiang Hongjun was arrested

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,890
and has been in custody in Jiangnan

284
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,730
for a full day now.

285
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,700
Jiangnan?

286
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,530
Is there anything you can do to help?

287
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,730
Come, have some tea.

288
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:48,890
Mr. Xu,

289
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,420
this is the official letter.

290
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,340
From the provincial office?

291
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,530
Must be a major case.

292
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,940
Please, have a seat.

293
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,010
Rest assured,

294
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,580
whatever you need our bureau to do,

295
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,300
just let us know,

296
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,770
and we'll cooperate fully.

297
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,890
The surveillance footage

298
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,180
is all stored in our

299
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,890
tech department.

300
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,730
You can take all of it

301
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,770
if you need it for your case.

302
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,820
As for the autopsy report,

303
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,820
I suggest you go to the ME's office.

304
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,010
I'll assign a colleague

305
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,940
to assist you as well.

306
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,850
Mr. Liu,

307
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,890
listen, there's an official letter

308
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,220
from the provincial office.

309
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,890
Mr. Song, Unit Chief of Jiangnan CID,

310
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,730
is in my office now.

311
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,060
I will send him to you shortly.

312
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,180
Please ensure he receives

313
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,180
your full cooperation.

314
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,060
Okay?

315
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,580
Great.

316
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,940
You can go see Mr. Liu later

317
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,940
and have him write an
introduction letter.

318
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,220
When officers from other jurisdictions

319
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,460
work on cases in Dongping,

320
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,730
that letter could

321
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,250
make everything more convenient.

322
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,700
Thank you so much.

323
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,340
Is there

324
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,490
anything else

325
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,140
I can help you with?

326
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:06,770
No, thank you.

327
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,530
I'll go see Mr. Liu then.

328
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,460
Alright.

329
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,980
Goodbye,

330
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,620
Mr. Xu.

331
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,770
Song,

332
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,330
there's something

333
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,460
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

334
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,180
They were mining illegally

335
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,620
on the day of the accident,

336
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,730
so they turned off
all the surveillance cameras

337
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,050
at important locations.

338
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,420
We've gone through

339
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,490
the available footage,

340
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,380
but we found nothing suspicious.

341
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,530
For your case, if necessary,

342
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,330
I'd suggest

343
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,900
collecting footage from a wider area—

344
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,620
just a thought.

345
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,180
Thank you,

346
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,700
Mr. Xu.

347
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,620
Take care.

348
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,490
Millions in cash!

349
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,380
He's the chief
of Criminal Investigation Unit!

350
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,250
Are you aware of the gravity
of this situation?

351
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:07,980
Yeah.

352
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,700
Let me ask you:

353
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,490
besides the investigations
into the mining accident

354
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,140
and Qiao Zhenxing,

355
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,860
was he involved in the Wan Hai case?

356
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,770
Yes.

357
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,280
[Judicial Expertise Center]

358
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,810
Wait for me here.

359
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,290
Alright.

360
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,700
Mr. Song,

361
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,490
here is Qiao Zhenxing's autopsy report.

362
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,900
The water sample from the scene

363
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,980
[Forensic Pathology Autopsy Report]
matches the liquid

364
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,220
[Diatom Test Report]
found in his lungs,

365
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,490
but there's something odd.

366
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,460
In my experience,

367
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,090
diatoms from the reservoir

368
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,290
are usually circular,

369
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,220
but the samples collected
by the sub-bureau

370
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,420
have an irregular form.

371
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,810
I've also

372
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,460
reported this to Captain Jiang,
who was in charge of the case.

373
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,940
Jiang Hongjun?

374
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,460
Yeah.

375
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,530
What did he say to you?

376
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,660
Captain Jiang told me

377
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,140
not to be subjective,

378
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,860
to stick strictly

379
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,090
to the actual results,

380
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,090
and not to concern myself
with anything else.

381
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,380
Mr. Song,

382
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,140
there's something

383
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,730
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

384
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:31,900
Go ahead.

385
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,250
The night I tested the water,

386
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,180
I saw Captain Jiang

387
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,090
in the hallway of the lab.

388
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,180
Captain Jiang?

389
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,220
Captain Jiang?

390
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,250
I thought it was you.

391
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,420
Mr. Liu.

392
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,050
What brings you here at this hour?

393
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,530
Mr. Sun asked me to get
Mr. Xu's signature.

394
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,530
Is he gone?

395
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,700
Yeah, you're too late.

396
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,490
Mr. Xu has already gone home.

397
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,290
Alright then.

398
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,330
I'll come back tomorrow.

399
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,730
Sure. Just come earlier tomorrow.

400
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,570
I'll let you get back to your work.

401
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,220
Alright.

402
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,860
Goodbye.

403
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,220
Goodbye.

404
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,380
This is the report

405
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,620
from the water sample

406
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,570
taken from the fish tank at Jinhai KTV.

407
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,860
And this is the report you submitted

408
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,250
for the water found
in Qiao Zhenxing's lungs.

409
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,770
According to your old report,

410
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,700
Qiao Zhenxing drowned
in the Yongqing River,

411
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,530
so the water in his lungs

412
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,940
should be from the river.

413
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,220
So can you explain to me

414
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,180
why this new report says
the water from his lungs

415
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,180
matches the water from the fish tank

416
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,290
of the KTV?

417
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:43,660
Look,

418
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,700
this is

419
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,700
the surveillance footage
from March 1st at 8:06 PM,

420
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,660
taken at the Dongping Judicial

421
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,050
Expertise Institution.

422
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,700
Witnesses have confirmed

423
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,220
that you were there at that time.

424
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,290
Why?

425
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,250
Alright.

426
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,490
Alright, let's move on.

427
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,460
Enough!

428
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,140
Enough, Hong Liang.

429
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,490
It was me.

430
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,330
It was all me.

431
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,770
I swapped the water sample
from Qiao Zhenxing's lungs.

432
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,730
I did it

433
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,940
under orders

434
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,010
from Sun Fei.

435
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,250
I don't know why,

436
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,140
but Sun Fei took a strong interest in me

437
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,380
ever since I joined the force.

438
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,460
Maybe it was because I was young

439
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,860
and always on the front line.

440
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,460
He said I was doing a good job

441
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,660
and wanted to take me under his wing.

442
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,700
I told him I...

443
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,330
I was fine.

444
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,010
Do you know what he told me?

445
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,810
He said, "Jiang Hongjun,

446
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,770
either you're in

447
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,530
or starting tomorrow,

448
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,460
don't let me see you in Dongping again.

449
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,530
If you follow me,

450
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:17,860
you'll

451
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,330
have a good life

452
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,420
in Dongping."

453
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,050
He said I was different from
officials like you.

454
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,330
Said you were properly trained,

455
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,490
and I was just a turncoat

456
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,810
who thought wearing the uniform

457
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,420
gave me the power

458
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,770
to do whatever I wanted.

459
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,620
Those were his exact words.

460
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,940
I tried to resist,

461
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,290
but he helped my family find jobs

462
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,530
and got my kid into school.

463
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,330
If I didn't comply,

464
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,660
my wife and child
would've been affected.

465
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,810
That's how he pulled me in.

466
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,940
But... but do you know, Hong Liang?

467
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,490
The temptations

468
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,180
were truly overwhelming.

469
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,730
You could get all the power and respect

470
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,900
you wanted.

471
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,460
Those around you,

472
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,090
and society at large,
would hold you in high esteem.

473
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,010
You could also satisfy

474
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,010
all your desires.

475
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,460
I was not

476
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,770
alone on board,

477
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,420
there were many others.

478
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,860
If it weren't for you,

479
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,180
who knows what we could've done.

480
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,220
Alright.

481
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,250
So tell me,

482
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,490
besides you and Sun Fei,

483
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,180
who else

484
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:30,860
is on board?

485
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,180
I'll tell you

486
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,090
just one thing,

487
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,730
do you know

488
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,250
how I got the cash every time

489
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,330
I finished a task Sun Fei gave me?

490
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,380
I would leave my car in a parking lot,

491
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,560
[Vehicle Footage
Dashcam, Format]

492
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,010
[Format the SD card?]
wipe the dashcam clean,

493
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,050
leave the doors unlocked,

494
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,620
and the next morning,

495
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,980
the money would be in the trunk.

496
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,460
So,

497
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,140
I don't even know who gave me the cash.

498
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,050
Do you really think I'd know
who else is on board?

499
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,050
I'm not worthy enough.

500
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,250
Are you sure you're sober now?

501
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,660
Can you be held accountable
for what you say?

502
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,140
I'm sober.

503
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,140
I take full responsibility

504
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,860
for every word

505
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,090
I just said.

506
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,010
Can you describe the person

507
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,220
who threatened you?

508
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,010
Any distinguishing features?

509
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,900
I was blindfolded for days.

510
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,140
I didn't see anything.

511
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,940
The only thing I remember

512
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,940
is one of my captors had long hair.

513
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,730
Try to recall

514
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,570
if there's anything else

515
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,660
you remember,

516
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,140
like the surroundings?

517
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,010
That place

518
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,380
smelled awful.

519
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,940
Smelled awful?

520
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:44,980
Like a chemical plant?

521
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,460
A bathroom?

522
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,980
No.

523
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,460
A paper mill?

524
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:52,810
Or

525
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,050
rotten meat?

526
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,730
No.

527
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,570
Was it garbage?

528
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,700
Yeah.

529
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,530
Garbage.

530
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,220
Just like

531
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,860
the smell of the dumpster outside.

532
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,940
Alright.

533
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,380
We've recorded
everything you said today.

534
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,530
You will await interrogation
regarding your accusation

535
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,770
against Qiao Zhenxing.

536
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,050
But I won't be in danger
if I go out, right?

537
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,180
What if they come after me again?

538
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,420
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Song.

539
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,380
Can I say something?

540
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:32,940
Biao,

541
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,380
it's me, Hong Liang.

542
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,900
I'm on the investigation team too.

543
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,090
I'm here.

544
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,010
Don't worry. You can trust us.

545
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,900
We will make sure you're safe,

546
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:47,730
alright?

547
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,290
Okay,

548
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,180
I trust you.

549
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,250
Call me

550
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,490
whenever you need me,

551
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,770
you have my full cooperation.

552
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,620
One more thing,

553
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,330
you really need to stop drinking.

554
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,570
Ever since

555
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,940
I reported

556
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,250
Zhenxing,

557
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,140
I've been drinking every day.

558
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,810
Now that I've told the truth,

559
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,980
I feel at ease.

560
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,490
No more drinking. I promise.

561
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,010
I've stressed countless times

562
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,380
that government and business must
keep a clear and close relationship.

563
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,140
Have you never

564
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,770
emphasized this to your bureau?

565
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,180
Now that your subordinates screwed up,

566
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,010
you're asking me for help?

567
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,010
What do you want me to do?

568
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,530
I know,

569
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,940
but he handled many major cases

570
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,250
in the bureau,

571
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,700
including the Wan Hai case.

572
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,570
What do you mean?

573
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,570
Are you suggesting the Wan Hai case
was wrong?

574
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,290
It's just my speculation.

575
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,810
But they wouldn't take action

576
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,420
if they didn't have any real evidence.

577
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,570
I told Mr. Xu before,

578
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,860
but he didn't say anything.

579
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,620
So now, I have no choice

580
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,570
but to come to you,

581
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,250
because I think this concerns

582
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,530
the reputation

583
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,220
of the entire Dongping judicial system.

584
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,010
Don't talk to me like that!

585
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,290
Are you threatening me?

586
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,290
Ms. Lan,

587
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,140
please help me.

588
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,530
You're respected.

589
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,660
They'll respect your position.

590
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,490
You're the only hope I have now.

591
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,700
Tell me,

592
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,530
did you know about

593
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,530
what Jiang Hongjun did?

594
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,050
I swear I had no idea.

595
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,250
Have you committed
any duty-related crimes?

596
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,900
No, Ms. Lan, I swear I haven't.

597
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,660
Then what are you afraid of?

598
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,380
How do you want me to help you?

599
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,050
Ms. Lan,

600
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,290
I...

601
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,620
I'm just scared.

602
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,940
If Jiang Hongjun goes down,

603
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,700
I'll definitely be held responsible.

604
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,980
But I swear to you and Mr. Jiang,

605
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,180
I really haven't done anything.

606
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,250
You went to Mr. Jiang?

607
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,140
No.

608
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,420
Mr. Jiang told you to come to me?

609
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,860
No, please don't misunderstand.

610
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,460
Sun Fei,

611
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,810
only you know

612
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,700
whether you're implicated or not.

613
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,860
If you're at fault,

614
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,940
neither Mr. Jiang

615
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,570
nor I can save you.

616
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,140
You're a properly trained

617
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,490
state official.

618
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,980
You know the right choice to make

619
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,220
under these circumstances.

620
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,980
Don't take chances.

621
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,700
Got it?

622
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,770
Sun Fei,

623
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,530
answer me-did you get it?

624
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,730
Yes, ma'am.

625
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:00,810
Luo.

626
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,460
Mr. Hong,

627
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,250
the suspect just left
the Dongping Party Committee

628
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,860
but isn't going to his office.

629
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,330
He's heading home.

630
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,900
Okay, copy that.

631
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,660
All units,

632
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,290
change your location.

633
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,980
The suspect may have gone home.

634
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,810
Follow him.

635
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,220
Copy that.

636
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,180
Got it.

637
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,090
We've already changed location.

638
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,330
Mr. Hong,

639
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,530
there's a new development.

640
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,860
We just intercepted a text
from the suspect—

641
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,010
he bought

642
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,810
a ticket from Haizhou International
Airport to Hong Kong

643
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,420
a few minutes ago.

644
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,530
He's trying to run?

645
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,770
Report it back now.

646
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,700
This is Cao Ye.

647
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,380
I'm requesting the assistance

648
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,420
of the Haizhou International Airport
Police Bureau.

649
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,490
The suspect may be on the run.

650
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,570
Prepare to intercept.

651
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,530
The suspect is in the car,

652
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,460
ready to leave the garage.

653
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,240
[Lamb Soup Diner]

654
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,290
All units, be alert.

655
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,490
The suspect stopped
in front of the Lamb Soup Diner.

656
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,080
[Lamb Soup Diner]

657
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,330
What a coincidence.

658
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,010
Hong Liang.

659
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,460
Liang,

660
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,460
you like lamb soup too?

661
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,810
Yeah.

662
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,730
You want some?

663
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,140
No thanks, I'm good.

664
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,620
Did you come all the way
just for this soup?

665
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,090
From Haizhou.

666
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,140
You look exhausted.

667
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,460
Did you sleep at all last night?

668
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,730
You can tell?

669
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,610
A suspect

670
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,130
I interrogated a few days ago

671
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,860
kept crying,

672
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,010
begging me for another chance.

673
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,820
He promised

674
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,050
he'd turn his life around.

675
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,610
I've seen many like him

676
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,860
over the years,

677
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,460
but

678
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,490
maybe with age,

679
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,570
my perspective is shifting.

680
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,010
I kept wondering,

681
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,340
if I really

682
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,860
gave him another chance,

683
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,980
could he really

684
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,380
contribute to society?

685
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,490
The law isn't only about punishment.

686
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,610
Sometimes,

687
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,090
it's also about education.

688
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,090
Of course,

689
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,420
as a prosecutor, you definitely

690
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,610
understand law more than I do,

691
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,610
but sometimes

692
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,820
the truth is blunt,

693
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,650
you know what I mean?

694
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,820
I'm rambling.

695
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,340
So, how's Mr. Jiang doing?

696
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,380
He's good.

697
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,530
And Min?

698
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:49,530
She's doing well too.

699
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,860
And your daughter?

700
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,690
What was her name, Dou?

701
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,460
Hong Dou?

702
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,050
I'm a

703
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,610
pretty nostalgic person.

704
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,490
I was Mr. Jiang's driver

705
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,300
for many years.

706
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,860
The Jiangs have really

707
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,340
helped me a lot.

708
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,130
I guess you can even say

709
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,260
that

710
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,340
they're like family to me.

711
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,740
Hong Liang,
it's been a while, hasn't it?

712
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,300
This is

713
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,490
a rare opportunity.

714
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,610
I'll go to the kitchen,

715
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,820
slip the owner a little cash

716
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,090
so the two of us

717
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,210
can catch up.

718
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,530
Wait for me.

719
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,050
Fei,

720
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,300
all the money

721
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,010
you have

722
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,260
has been frozen,

723
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,210
so this dinner's on us.

724
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,780
From now on, why don't you

725
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,530
do the right thing?

726
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,650
Let's sit down.

727
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,740
We're disturbing the others.

728
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:12,490
Sit.

729
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,340
This is really good.

730
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,130
You

731
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,900
don't have to drag me.

732
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,210
I can walk on my own.

733
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,980
Which room?

734
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:53,780
Keep going straight.

735
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:14,940
Alright.

736
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,820
Wasn't Hong Liang with you?

737
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,420
Where is he?

738
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,940
May I ask,

739
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,530
your device

740
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:54,570
looks pretty good,

741
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,210
is it a new model?

742
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,340
I saw it when I was at Provincial
Procuratorate for training last year.

743
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,050
We don't have it in Dongping.

744
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,170
The Provincial Procuratorate

745
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,210
is surely more equipped than we are.

746
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,900
You two

747
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,610
are from the Eleventh Division, right?

748
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,530
How do you know that?

749
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,780
I've been in this line of work
for decades.

750
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,490
May I ask how I should address you two?

751
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,340
I mean no offense.

752
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,170
I just want to be respectful.

753
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,010
I'm a prosecutor
from the Provincial Procuratorate.

754
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,860
My name is Luo Shixin.

755
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,860
You can call me Luo.

756
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:33,860
Luo.

757
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:35,940
And this is?

758
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,340
I'm Zhang Huai'en, assistant prosecutor
from the Provincial Procuratorate.

759
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,690
You both look like you're just

760
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,740
in your early thirties,

761
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,300
and you're already
deputy section chiefs?

762
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,380
So young

763
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,170
and already

764
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,490
handling the responsibility

765
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,380
of interrogating

766
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,780
an ex-official like me?

767
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,690
Your superiors must really trust you.

768
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,090
Mr. Sun, do you want to know

769
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,010
where I'm from?

770
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,090
I'll tell you.

771
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,420
I'm from Jiangnan.

772
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,050
M-My hometown isn't far from there,

773
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,530
so we're basically from the same town.

774
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,130
Yeah,

775
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,490
we have something in common, huh?

776
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:09,860
Yeah.

777
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,570
So let's get to the point.

778
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,170
'The point'?

779
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,530
Luo,

780
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,010
the essence of interrogation

781
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,260
is communication.

782
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,980
If our communication goes well,

783
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,130
it would really

784
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,340
help your career

785
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,420
a lot.

786
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,050
Your superiors never taught you this?

787
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,340
Enough, Sun Fei,

788
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,530
let's stop beating around the bush.

789
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,300
This isn't your precinct,

790
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,210
so drop that bureaucratic tone.

791
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,900
Your only option now

792
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,690
is to cooperate with our investigation.

793
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,380
Luo,

794
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,650
Zhang, rest assured.

795
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,210
Feel free

796
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,420
to ask me anything,

797
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,610
you have my full cooperation.

798
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,130
Alright.

799
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,460
Let's talk about the passports.

800
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,980
Passports? What passports?

801
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,050
We found

802
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,690
three passports on you,

803
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,860
all forged.

804
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,900
How do you explain that?

805
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,420
Oh, those passports.

806
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:02,980
That's

807
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,900
not your responsibility, right?

808
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,530
Aren't you with the Eleventh Division?

809
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,340
Maybe you should

810
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,130
ask Dongping Commission
for Discipline Inspection

811
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,690
to take over.

812
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:13,860
I promise

813
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,610
I'll tell them everything.

814
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,940
So, do you two

815
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,740
have any other questions?

816
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,130
I've got a mountain of work on my hands.

817
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,490
Ms. Lan and Mr. Xu are both

818
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,820
waiting for my reports,

819
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,740
alright?

820
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,690
Come in.

821
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:54,780
Ms. Lan,

822
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:55,860
what's so urgent?

823
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,780
Sun Fei and Jiang Hongjun
have been detained.

824
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,340
Are you aware?

825
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,260
Sun Fei and Jiang Hongjun?

826
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,380
By...

827
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,570
by whom?

828
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,090
I'm not clear on the details,

829
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,490
but Jiangnan Municipal Bureau
of Public Security showed up

830
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,170
with a letter from the provincial office

831
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,570
and asked for
Qiao Zhenxing's autopsy report.

832
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,210
It's a

833
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,780
joint police-prosecutor operation.

834
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,130
It seems

835
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,380
the Guidance Group

836
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,260
has been upgraded and is back.

837
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,050
They're here for the Wan Hai case.

838
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,900
Zheng Yaping has already

839
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,210
talked to Wan Hai in prison.

840
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,780
I warned you to be cautious

841
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,260
about whom you trust.

842
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,650
You put Sun Fei in charge of

843
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,570
both the Wan Hai
and Qiao Zhenxing cases?

844
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,460
How could you trust him that much?

845
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,940
Ms. Lan,

846
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,090
Sun Fei was brought up
by the higher-ups.

847
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,650
He thinks he's omnipotent

848
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,740
and never reported anything to me.

849
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,780
I had to chase after him for updates.

850
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,210
This is the 'great team' I have.

851
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,050
Dongping officials

852
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,860
are being taken away one by one.

853
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,300
The investigation
has reached our doorstep,

854
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,340
and no one told me anything?

855
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,130
Is this how you work?

856
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,420
Since the investigation

857
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,940
on the Wan Hai case started,

858
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,900
no one has ever told me the truth,

859
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,740
nor warned me.

860
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,570
I don't have to tell you
how big the impact will be

861
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,780
if the Wan Hai case goes wrong.

862
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,420
Xu,

863
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,380
you think

864
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,740
you can still retire peacefully?

865
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:44,980
And you, Li Renjun,

866
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,820
you think you can hold on to your

867
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,460

as prosecutor general?
