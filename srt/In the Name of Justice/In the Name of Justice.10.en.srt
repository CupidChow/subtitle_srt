[Episode 10]

3
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,220
Mr. Chen,

4
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,850
thanks for your generosity,

5
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,940
but isn't giving away

6
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,980
such a huge place a little much?

7
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,890
Not at all.

8
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,100
Zijian is gifted.

9
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,010
Honestly, I'd do even more

10
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,060
to keep

11
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,820
someone like him on my team.

12
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,260
So Mr. Chen,

13
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,100
how did you spot his talent?

14
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,060
Thanks to me!

15
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,940
Come on.

16
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,980
We've done a ton of interviews

17
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,690
with Long's company before.

18
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,610
I knew he needed a legal advisor,

19
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,100
so I recommended Zijian.

20
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,820
They hit it off right away, right?

21
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,060
Isn't that right, Zijian?

22
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:17,940
Of course.

23
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,660
Renjun,

24
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:20,570
Yun,

25
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,730
here in Dongping,

26
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,130
besides you two,

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,450
Mr. Chen

28
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,290
also feels like family to me.

29
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,610
I see Zijian as my own brother.

30
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,850
Now that we're all here,

31
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,340
let's get a group photo, guys.

32
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,380
Sure!

33
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,380
Come on.

34
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,890
Hurry up!

35
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,260
Over here!

36
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,010
Honey,

37
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,260
did you notice

38
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,730
Yun seemed

39
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,170
really into

40
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,130
this place today.

41
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,340
You saw that too, huh?

42
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,220
You know,

43
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,380
she was practically glowing

44
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,820
the whole tour.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,410
She couldn't stop raving about it.

46
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:03,890
For real?

47
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,610
Actually,

48
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,500
I have an idea.

49
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,170
What is it?

50
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,290
I was thinking,

51
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,410
just imagine,

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,660
if Renjun and his wife moved here,

53
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,020
they could

54
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,610
look after you when I'm tied up at work.

55
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,930
Oh, come on!

56
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,410
They're actually busier than you!

57
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,370
When would they ever have time?

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,050
Yeah, you're right.

59
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,290
But still,

60
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,540
if they ever did move nearby,

61
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,540
it'd be great
to have each other's backs.

62
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,290
Chen Youcai!

63
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,780
Chen Youcai!

64
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,290
What are you doing?

65
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,580
Are you out of your mind?

66
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,490
Chen Youcai, have you lost it?

67
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,610
Seriously, are you crazy?

68
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,050
Hit me, huh?

69
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,610
Come on.

70
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,020
Right here.

71
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,220
Hit me. Let's see!

72
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,900
You actually scared me for a second.

73
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,610
Chen Youcai, you punk!

74
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,290
What's going on here?

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,730
What's all the yelling about?

76
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,780
What are you staring at?

77
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:47,700
Mr. Wang,

78
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,140
Mr. Chen here is upset
about the rail car arrangement—

79
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,780
he threw a fit downstairs.

80
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,250
Look, I'm bleeding!

81
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:56,930
What are you doing?

82
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,340
Why'd you mess with my incense?

83
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,810
Now, for god's sake,

84
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,290
just tell me,

85
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,700
how can you hand
those cars over to someone else?

86
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,490
You promised me, in writing!

87
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,250
My goods are stuck here,

88
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,780
you're hitting me with storage fees,

89
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,290
and my clients
are on my back for penalties.

90
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,020
I'm broke, can't afford to pay!

91
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,140
Why are you doing this to me?

92
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:17,980
Put the incense back first,

93
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,100
now!

94
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,100
So,

95
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,660
whose goods are those?

96
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,580
Mine!

97
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,610
Say that again?

98
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,580
They're mine!

99
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,290
Okay.

100
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,050
Then come over here,

101
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,340
I'll show you something.

102
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,050
Still gonna play dumb?

103
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,220
Take a good look.

104
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,340
What's this then?

105
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,290
Go on,

106
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,220
look for yourself.

107
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,930
You really think Mr. Wang doesn't

108
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,370
know what you've been doing?

109
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,780
Answer me!

110
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,250
Didn't I tell you

111
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,340
I don't want anything

112
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,220
from the Wan family on my turf?

113
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,540
You know who they are?

114
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,050
They're gangsters!

115
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,700
Was I just talking to the wall?

116
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,930
Does what I say

117
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,170
mean nothing to you?

118
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,930
Mr. Wang,

119
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,290
if you don't let

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,250
their shipment out,

121
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,580
their ore will never

122
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,140
leave Dongping.

123
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:23,900
Mr. Wang,

124
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,700
the Wan family

125
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,930
is never coming back from this.

126
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,250
But we're all human,

127
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,850
we all have to make a living.

128
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,730
We can't just destroy

129
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,370
someone's livelihood like that.

130
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,490
Now you care about the Wan family?

131
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,810
Where were you before?

132
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,730
You've been playing both sides,

133
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,220
and now you want to act concerned?

134
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,340
What now?

135
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,020
Playing both sides, huh?

136
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,020
If I hadn't,

137
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,580
would you have this hub
back in your hands?

138
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,730
Would Wan Hai

139
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,250
have ended up as a gangster?

140
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,580
With the deity as our witness,

141
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,170
Mr. Wang,

142
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,410
remember how good Wan Hai was to you?

143
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,900
Don't push people too far;

144
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,140
or it could come back to haunt you.

145
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,220
Mr. Wang,

146
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,250
do me this one favor
for everything I've done for you,

147
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,170
let the Wan family ship this batch.

148
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,700
I let Wan Hong down.

149
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,060
I gave him my word.

150
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,530
Please, help me this one time.

151
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,460
Come on.

152
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,820
Help you?

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,730
Who do you think you are?

154
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,220
Come on, tell me!

155
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,580
You've never kept
a single promise to me!

156
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,650
Wanna kick down the ladder, huh?

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,980
Just so you know,

158
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,220
you pushed me to my limit today.

159
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,220
One day,
someone might push you even further!

160
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,130
Tell me,

161
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,940
what's written on that wall?

162
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,700
"Win-win cooperation."

163
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,130
Have you cooperated?

164
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,010
Did we both win here?

165
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,370
Chen, I'm done going easy on you.

166
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,420
Ms. Zheng, Mr. Wang,

167
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,730
this is the largest freight hub

168
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,700
in Dongping.

169
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,610
It handles not only bulk rail shipping

170
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,250
but also container transport.

171
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,850
There's also massive warehouse space

172
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,420
and logistics services.

173
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,370
The trains and trucks here

174
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,370
load and unload seamlessly,

175
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,850
connecting rail

176
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,850
and highway transport

177
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,890
for incredible efficiency.

178
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,250
Ms. Zheng.

179
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,300
Take it easy.

180
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,820
Mr. Wang, watch your step.

181
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,580
No worries.

182
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,890
This is really a huge place.

183
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,650
Back in the day,

184
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,610
this was just
a regular rail depot.

185
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,300
Its only job was

186
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,650
shipping coal and iron ore

187
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,100
from here and nearby mines.

188
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,180
Over time,

189
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,650
it grew into what it is today.

190
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,130
Now we got everything, fruit, veggies,

191
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,340
seafood, cold-chain, you name it.

192
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,940
It wasn't like this
before Wan Hai took over, huh?

193
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,010
As far as we know,

194
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,530
it really wasn't that big before,

195
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,700
just handling transfer

196
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,940
between trucks and trains,

197
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,890
no storage or logistics at all.

198
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,580
Just a basic cargo depot.

199
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,180
Exactly.

200
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,890
Wan Hai sure knew

201
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,610
how to grow a business.

202
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,610
This way.

203
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,370
Who is it?

204
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,200
Open up.

205
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,560
[Wanchuan Operations Office
General Manager's Office]

206
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,980
Looks like the boss lady's here.

207
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,730
The Guidance Group decided last minute

208
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,770
to drop by for a quick tour.

209
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,730
What,

210
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,890
you're not letting us in?

211
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,890
No!

212
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,940
Please, come on in!

213
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:36,770
After you.

214
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,730
Everyone, please come inside.

215
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,370
Sorry, it's a bit messy in here,

216
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,530
hope I got enough chairs.

217
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,890
Just make yourselves at home.

218
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,420
Youcai.

219
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,420
Look,

220
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,940
let's deal with our issue

221
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,940
another time.

222
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,490
We'll sort things out later—

223
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,220
the Guidance Group's here now.

224
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,420
Catch you later.

225
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,010
Now that Mr. Chen's here,

226
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,180
let's all sit down and talk together.

227
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,530
I actually have something urgent,

228
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,700
gotta go.

229
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,220
It won't take long.

230
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,100
Just a quick chat.

231
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,980
That alright with you, Mr. Wang?

232
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,580
Why not? No secrets here.

233
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,460
Let's all sit down.

234
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,490
Go take care of your business.

235
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,850
Come on, have a seat!

236
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,650
This way.

237
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,700
Have a seat.

238
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:27,940
It's fine,

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,610
just talk for a bit.

240
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,490
Hong,

241
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,530
I'm on Zhongxing Road.

242
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,890
Where exactly?

243
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,300
I'll send you my location.

244
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,220
Okay.

245
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,850
He sent the location.

246
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,610
Put it in the GPS.

247
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,650
Zhongxing Road.

248
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,650
What?

249
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,610
They're headed for Zhongxing Road?

250
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,650
Do something!

251
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,770
Do whatever it takes

252
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,980
to stop them.

253
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,820
Stall them

254
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,420
until I get there.

255
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,370
Run them off the road

256
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,010
if you have to!

257
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,010
Do not let them

258
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,980
beat us to Jinhai KTV.

259
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,370
Understood?

260
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,980
Got it, sir!

261
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,340
You guys hurry up.

262
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,300
Mr. Chen,

263
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,980
last time you said

264
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,890
you and Wan Hong were childhood friends,

265
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,180
and you've worked together for years.

266
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,610
So you two go way back, right?

267
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,130
When you testified for Mr. Wang,

268
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,770
did the cops ask you to,
or was it your call?

269
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,650
Better not lie,

270
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,300
we'll double-check it

271
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,340
with someone else.

272
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,610
I did it on my own.

273
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,610
You chose to testify

274
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,730
against your old friend?

275
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,850
Did you hesitate?

276
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,010
Come on, with the way things are now,

277
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,250
who really has 'friends' anymore?

278
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,580
Your 'friend' for now

279
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,700
can stab you in the back one day.

280
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,770
Someone like me,

281
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,730
I don't get the luxury of hesitation.

282
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,100
I'm just a

283
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,130
traitor anyway.

284
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,100
Hey, that's enough.

285
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,010
What's that supposed to mean?

286
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,060
I mean,

287
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,730
that's what I am, a traitor.

288
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,100
That's what they're all calling me now.

289
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,370
'They'?

290
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,460
You mean Wan Hong?

291
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,250
Not him.

292
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,060
Mr. Wang, maybe?

293
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,850
Definitely not!

294
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,100
It's just gossip,

295
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,340
nobody specific.

296
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,250
And your relationship with Mr. Wang?

297
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,650
Personally,

298
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,650
I think we're

299
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,250
as close as brothers.

300
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,340
He showed me the ropes,

301
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,580
taught me business,
helped me build everything.

302
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,980
I owe my success to him,

303
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,010
and he

304
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,650
owes his to me.

305
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,890
Mr. Wang always put me first.

306
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,700
Needed a yard?

307
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,220
Wanted rail cars?

308
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,010
No problem, right?

309
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,530
Chen,

310
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,420
I don't think I ever

311
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,580
gave you any special treatment.

312
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,460
Ma'am,

313
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,300
we are,

314
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,370
not that close.

315
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,180
He's still mad.

316
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,730
We'd just had a little fight

317
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,300
right before

318
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,610
you walked in.

319
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,820
Alright, let's all calm down.

320
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,060
That thing you wanted,

321
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,700
consider it done, okay?

322
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,580
How long have you
and Wan Hai known each other?

323
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:31,850
Well,

324
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,700
it's been so long

325
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,890
you can barely keep track?

326
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,700
Right,

327
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,530
it's definitely been quite a while.

328
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,130
Back when he and his brother

329
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,850
first started

330
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,460
at the mine,

331
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,420
they came here

332
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,940
to work in distribution.

333
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,940
After a while,

334
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,890
we got to know each other.

335
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,300
It's probably been

336
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,530
over

337
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,220
ten years or so.

338
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,300
Ten years or so?

339
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,530
Then you must be pretty close.

340
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,340
So why did he go through
Mr. Chen to buy the hub

341
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,220
instead of coming to you directly?

342
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,010
Actually, Chen and I,

343
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,490
we're closer!

344
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,220
We're like family, right?

345
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,820
So if Wan Hai

346
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,010
wanted my hub,

347
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,770
it had to

348
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,420
go through Chen,

349
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,980
right?

350
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,010
Without him,

351
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,700
I never would have met Wan Hai,

352
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,300
let alone

353
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,890
gone through all this mess.

354
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,730
Right, Chen?

355
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,300
So you don't blame him?

356
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,700
I used to, sure.

357
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,650
But then I figured,

358
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,890
Wan Hai's a gangster.

359
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,220
Chen

360
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,180
was forced into it.

361
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,650
When it came time to turn Wan Hai in,

362
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,810
Chen and I even talked it through.

363
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,290
Right, man?

364
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,460
Mr. Hong,

365
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,460
that car's been tailing us
this whole time.

366
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,460
You're always so paranoid.

367
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,700
You think you own the road?

368
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,180
I changed lanes to see

369
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,570
if they'd back off,

370
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,010
but they're still sticking to us.

371
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,420
There's a fork coming up.

372
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,960
[443 meters ahead
Turn onto Unnamed Road]

373
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,140
But that path's a dead end.

374
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,090
Got it.

375
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,330
See? Still on our tail.

376
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,490
Mr. Hong, no way out up ahead.

377
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,460
Huai'en,

378
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,220
we haven't done anything wrong,

379
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,810
no need to worry.

380
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,090
Mr. Hong!

381
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,010
Hurry!

382
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,220
Things must've really gotten ugly

383
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,900
between you and Wan Hai,

384
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,660
if he just took over your hub like that.

385
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,090
Of course, ma'am.

386
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,010
Why do you think I hated him?

387
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,330
Why else would I turn him in?

388
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,980
But he still kept you on as GM.

389
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,010
Why go along with that?

390
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,530
Ma'am,

391
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,490
the guy's a gangster!

392
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,860
He does whatever he wants,

393
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,860
simple as that.

394
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,940
He forced me!

395
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,620
What choice did I have?

396
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,220
That was rock bottom for me,

397
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,900
you know?

398
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,010
There was nothing I could do.

399
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,980
Wait, is this...

400
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,460
You didn't use this for gambling,
did you?

401
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,770
No...

402
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,460
You're right!

403
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,900
Mr. Wang

404
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,530
always says, "No risk, no gain.

405
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,180
Got to gamble to get ahead."

406
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,860
He loves to play games

407
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,660
wherever he is.

408
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,380
And at that time, if I recall,

409
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,140
you were seriously in debt, right?

410
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,140
Collectors were knocking at your door.

411
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,330
Chen, what are you talking about?

412
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,420
The inspectors are here!

413
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,940
What 'time' are you referring to?

414
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,380
Was it before or after

415
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,180
the deal with Wan Hai was made?

416
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,220
Just kidding.

417
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,420
Seriously, ma'am,

418
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,420
what exactly are you here for?

419
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,900
What do you want to know?

420
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,940
Check the records
if you've got questions!

421
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,860
I've already told you everything!

422
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,010
I've been fully cooperative.

423
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,490
So what more do you want?

424
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,980
Thanks for your time.

425
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,090
Sorry, officers.

426
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,180
I really am swamped,

427
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,090
one text after another.

428
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,090
Mr. Wang,

429
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,900
mind if I ask?

430
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,330
The hub is huge now—

431
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,570
what's it worth?

432
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,700
Over a hundred million, I assume.

433
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,570
You mentioned before

434
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,730
that when Wan Hai took it,
it was worth fifty million at best.

435
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,860
Once he's in prison,

436
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,140
you get your hub back.

437
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,980
You're coming out on top.

438
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,940
That's life, huh?

439
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,570
Take care.

440
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,810
See you.

441
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,010
Mr. Wang,
when can I get those rail cars?

442
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,050
Hong.

443
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:25,940
What's up?

444
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,380
Hurry up.

445
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:26,900
What's wrong?

446
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,380
Get in the car.

447
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:27,900
What's going on?

448
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:28,860
Quick!

449
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,220
What...

450
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:29,810
Wait...

451
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,420
Come on!

452
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:30,900
Drive!

453
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,530
Let's go!

454
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,290
Hurry!

455
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,380
- Where are we going?
- Just drive!

456
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:42,940
What's wrong, man?

457
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,380
I think we're good now.

458
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,180
Hong,

459
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,530
I just checked,

460
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,980
there are 18 shops here.

461
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,490
My brother was here

462
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,860
for six hours that day.

463
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,810
Someone must've seen him.

464
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,700
Not many shops are actually open.

465
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,250
Some are that way, and some over there.

466
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,490
And that side...

467
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,940
Hong,

468
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,290
got a minute?

469
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:45,660
Hello?

470
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,660
Hello?

471
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,530
Hong?

472
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,660
Are you busy?

473
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,180
Hello?

474
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,250
Ms. Zheng,

475
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,900
that's it for today's agenda.

476
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,810
Would you like to go back to the hotel,

477
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,460
or to the office?

478
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,330
It's still early.

479
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,140
Let's stop by the detention center.

480
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,220
I want to see Wan Hai.

481
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,140
Right now, ma'am?

482
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,180
Is that okay?

483
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,460
Of course!

484
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,570
I'll set it up. This way, please.

485
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,200
[Jinhai KTV, Zhongxing Road]

486
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,770
You two, hurry up!

487
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,980
Hey, over here.

488
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,140
Seriously? Why is this so hard for you?

489
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,700
Smash it.

490
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,290
Hong,

491
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,730
no one's seen him.

492
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,250
Give it to me.

493
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,810
Hurry! They're coming this way!

494
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,180
Come on!

495
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,530
Move!

496
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:58,980
Leave it!

497
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,530
Anyone here?

498
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,180
Gosh.

499
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,460
Hong.

500
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,940
The fish tank's shattered.

501
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,220
That water outside

502
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,290
must've come from here.

503
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,420
What happened here?

504
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,620
No idea, honestly.

505
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,810
Did you find anyone?

506
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:04,860
Nope.

507
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,290
Let's go.

508
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,050
Alright.

509
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,250
What's wrong?

510
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,250
I can't live with the guilt anymore.

511
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,010
Because I was

512
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,140
the umbrella
shielding Wan Hai's criminal outfit.

513
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,180
I admit it:

514
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,530
I took Wan Hai's money

515
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,140
and promised to clear his name.

516
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,620
I've failed the Party

517
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,180
and the nation that trained me.

518
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,530
Every step that led me here

519
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,620
was my own mistake.

520
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,250
I brought this on myself,

521
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,050
and I deserve whatever punishment comes.

522
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,620
Death would not be too much.

523
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,250
My brother...

524
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,180
Zhenxing...

525
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,380
Brother...

526
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,620
Hong, if this water matches

527
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,530
what was in Zhenxing's lungs,

528
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,290
then the evidence was planted, right?

529
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,380
Right?

530
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,660
Yeah.

531
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:40,980
Exactly.

532
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,900
Who are you calling?

533
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,050
Forensics.

534
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,330
Wait!

535
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,730
Why are you calling them?

536
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,010
To have them come out

537
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,090
and test the water!

538
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,460
Test this?

539
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:53,940
Right!

540
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,900
Who ran the tests last time?

541
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,490
Same people.

542
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,730
Same...

543
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,220
Hong, what do I do now?

544
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,700
Who can I go to?

545
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,330
Who can help me now?

546
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,490
No one can help.

547
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,460
No one!

548
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,290
What do I do?

549
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,180
Hong!

550
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,570
Help me figure something out.

551
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:17,940
Mr. Hong,

552
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,180
we should report this to the higher-ups.

553
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,380
Let our people handle it.

554
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,490
Tell Commissioner Sun.

555
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,660
Leave it.

556
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,010
This has nothing to do with us.

557
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:25,940
Keep your mouth shut.

558
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,490
Hong,

559
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,530
can you send your team out here?

560
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,860
I can't.

561
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,140
Just this once, help me,

562
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,700
please.

563
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,490
He doesn't get how this works. Drop it.

564
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,810
Please, help me, Hong.

565
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,290
Feng,

566
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,660
we're here for Zhang Wenjing's case,

567
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,420
You know that.

568
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,220
I'm begging you.

569
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,860
Get up, come on!

570
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,460
Feng!

571
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,420
Please, Hong!

572
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,050
Feng!

573
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,250
Come on, listen to me.

574
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,010
Please, I'm begging you.

575
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,290
Mei didn't deserve this...

576
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,380
And Zhenxing didn't
deserve to die like that!

577
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,330
Where is it?

578
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:30,980
Got it.

579
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,620
I'll inform the higher-ups right away.

580
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,290
Lock down the scene

581
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,010
until we arrive.

582
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,250
Ladies and gentlemen,

583
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,420
how much longer is this going to go on?

584
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,290
I've told you everything I know.

585
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,460
Wan Hai, watch your attitude.

586
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,290
Zhang Wenjing's case

587
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,460
can't be resolved
in just one or two talks.

588
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,620
The provincial leaders
are here again today.

589
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,420
Let's give them all the facts

590
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,250
about that case, okay?

591
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:12,940
Wan Hai,

592
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,810
what was your relationship with Wang Yu?

593
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,420
I thought it was about Zhang Wenjing.

594
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,900
Why bring up Wang Yu now?

595
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,660
Just answer the questions;

596
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,860
you don't need to know why.

597
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,090
What was your relationship with Wang Yu?

598
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:43,940
It was alright.

599
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,770
We weren't exactly close.

600
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,900
How long have Mr. Wang
and Wan Hai known each other?

601
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,660
Back when he and his brother

602
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,770
first started at the mine,

603
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,660
they came here to work in distribution.

604
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,700
After a while,

605
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,140
we got to know each other.

606
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,140
It's probably been

607
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,810
over ten years or so.

608
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,090
Why did you take over

609
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,420
his freight hub in the first place?

610
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,860
For the money.

611
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,490
At the time,

612
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,740
most ore from Dongping

613
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,380
went through his freight hub.

614
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,570
That Wang Yu

615
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,010
just sat back

616
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,010
and raked it in.

617
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,260
Naturally, I wanted a piece of that.

618
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,380
I tried to buy it.

619
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,980
Since you took...

620
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,490
bought the hub,

621
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,650
why keep him on

622
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:34,940
as manager?

623
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,780
Weren't you worried he'd try

624
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,460
to get back at you?

625
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,490
If you'd ever met Wang Yu,

626
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,490
you'd know that's not in his nature.

627
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,860
Why'd he agree so easily then?

628
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,210
Even if the hub was underpriced,

629
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,380
the contract says it sold for

630
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,090
over 20 million.

631
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,050
Why would he work for you?

632
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,860
How should I know?

633
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,570
Honestly,

634
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,300
you'll have to ask him yourself.

635
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,980
He loves to play games

636
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,740
wherever he is.

637
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,490
And at that time, if I recall,

638
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,260
you were seriously in debt, right?

639
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,260
Back then

640
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,650
Wang Yu owed a ton of gambling debts.

641
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,260
Collectors were on him day and night.

642
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,420
He was desperate,

643
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,300
so he sold the hub fast

644
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,300
for the cash.

645
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,780
That's how Wan Hai got the hub.

646
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,130
If,

647
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,820
I'm just saying, if,

648
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,690
Wang Yu

649
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,570
was drowning

650
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,570
in gambling debt,

651
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,530
and got roughed up by collectors,

652
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,940
maybe that's why

653
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,820
he let the hub go so cheap,

654
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,820
and you

655
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,340
got your bargain.

656
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,860
You're getting a 50 million freight hub

657
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,130
for 25? Seriously?

658
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,740
Wang Yu,

659
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,050
you made an urgent request, you know?

660
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,460
And you demanded all cash.

661
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,650
I scraped together whatever I could

662
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,900
to get 25 million in cash for you.

663
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,570
You're taking advantage
of me at my lowest.

664
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,900
Come on, that's not fair.

665
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,820
If I just cut out
your kidneys right now,

666
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,530
would I get 25 million for them?

667
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,380
If I invested the money anywhere else,

668
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,090
it'd make more.

669
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,490
If not for our history,

670
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,940
I wouldn't have bothered.

671
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,260
What 'history'?

672
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,300
I don't think so.

673
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,610
So, it's my fault?

674
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,210
You know what I heard?

675
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,050
You owed money all over,

676
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,170
to both Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li.

677
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,050
What, all the debts came due at once?

678
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,530
Yeah, that's why he...

679
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,690
Come on, stop it!

680
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,460
Took advantage of you?

681
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,860
I actually saved your skin.

682
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,380
If you really want it,

683
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,090
just name a fair price.

684
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,610
Here, you talk to him.

685
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,690
Wait, you...

686
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,860
What's going on, Mr. Wang?

687
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,300
We all came here to make a deal.

688
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,490
Youcai's here.

689
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,130
Go ask around,

690
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,940
who else in Dongping

691
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,740
could've raised 25 million
in cash overnight?

692
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,050
Think it over.

693
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,900
Surprisingly,

694
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,490
the business

695
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,300
took off over the years.

696
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,300
Wang Yu regretted selling it,

697
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,300
and wanted it back.

698
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,650
So,

699
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,530
he turned you in, called you a gangster,

700
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,940
and accused you

701
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,300
of forcing

702
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,300
a crooked deal.

703
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,380
That's how you wound up here.

704
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,490
Does that

705
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,940
make sense?

706
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,980
Ma'am,

707
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,940
are you saying

708
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,340
I was framed?

709
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,570
Ms. Zheng,

710
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,780
that's not really appropriate, is it?

711
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,460
Wan Hai,

712
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,940
if that's really the case,

713
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,980
then tell us

714
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,650
why did you admit it.

715
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,860
Who made you do that?

716
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,300
Are you hiding something?

717
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,530
Was there any

718
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,340
false accusation involved?

719
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,090
Think carefully.

720
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,260
Look, officers,

721
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,300
stop trying to catch me out.

722
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,490
The only reason I admitted to anything

723
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,940
was to try and get a lighter sentence.

724
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,530
Like I said before,

725
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,980
Wang Yu wouldn't sell,

726
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,690
so I tried everything to get it.

727
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:04,690
It's all on record...

728
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,650
Qiao Zhenxing is dead.

729
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,570
Did you know that?

730
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,570
Happened the same day as your hearing.

731
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,420
How would I know

732
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,050
in here?

733
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:16,740
Wan Hai,

734
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,340
this case just keeps getting bigger,

735
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,900
and the fallout is growing too.

736
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,740
It's no longer just

737
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,530
a local anti-gang case,

738
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,210
and it's not something

739
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,690
you can handle on your own.

740
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,530
If there's anything else
you need to say,

741
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,130
now's the time to be honest.

742
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,050
You have to fight for your rights,

743
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,820
and for your chance.

744
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,260
Wan Hai,

745
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,090
I don't know what you're so afraid of.

746
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,780
If the freight hub was yours,

747
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,490
and so was the club,

748
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,900
you should stand up

749
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,210
for them

750
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,210
and not let anyone take them from you.

751
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,780
Always remember,

752
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,530
the law is your weapon.

753
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,380
The justice system

754
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,260
has your back.

755
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,170
Ma'am,

756
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,820
thank you.

757
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,690
But I'm really not feeling well.

758
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,740
I need to rest.

759
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,300
Alright.

760
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,740
Wan Hai,

761
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,210
hope you feel better soon

762
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:00,860
Guard.

763
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,420
Thanks.

764
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,530
Thanks, Hong.

765
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,260
Don't mention this

766
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,530
to anyone,

767
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:57,820
not even your sister-in-law.

768
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:58,940
Got it.

769
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,860
Ran can keep them.

770
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,530
If

771
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,900
the water sample we sent tonight

772
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,940
matches the one

773
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,340
they got from Qiao,

774
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,050
the one from the reservoir...

775
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,570
Ma'am,

776
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,740
I just don't get it.

777
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,300
Where

778
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,690
was Qiao

779
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,300
actually killed?

780
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,130
It's not just about

781
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,340
where the crime happened.

782
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,260
If those samples match,

783
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,860
then the evidence was tampered with.

784
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,900
Those are your words, ma'am.

785
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:13,570
Hong Liang,

786
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,260
I think

787
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,130
we need to do a second autopsy

788
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,170
on Qiao Zhenxing's body.

789
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,090
Say something!

790
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,260
But there's a problem, ma'am.

791
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:36,650
The thing is,

792
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,170
Qiao's at the funeral home.

793
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,650
The farewell's tomorrow morning.

794
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,380
It'll wrap up

795
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,780
around ten,

796
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,090
and after that, he'll be cremated.

797
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,530
Once that happens,

798
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:57,130
a second autopsy won't be possible.
