1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,090
Don't just have porridge. Eat an egg.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,460
I can do it myself, Mom.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,700
Hurry.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:11,860
Take a handful.

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:14,620
Are you full?

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,010
Yeah.

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,730
- Gotta go.
- Now?

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,420
Hurry. Your dad already left. Quick.

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,810
We should eat slowly and chew well.

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,900
You have five minutes.

11
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,460
My name is Qiao Zhenxing.

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,810
Have some milk. That's too dry.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,530
I'm a prosecutor
at Dongping People's Procuratorate.

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:33,730
Today…

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,690
Why are you still home?

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,690
Is the first day of court…

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,090
- What are you watching?
- For the Wan Hai case.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,130
I can't live with the guilt anymore

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,690
because I am

20
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,620
the umbrella
shielding Wan Hai's criminal outfit.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,770
Wan Hai is on trial,

22
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,330
and I am

23
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,540
being judged too.

24
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,690
I admit it.

25
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,540
I took Wan Hai's money

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,410
and promised to clear his name.

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,690
I began as a common man…

31
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,130
Farming in my fields in Nanyang…

32
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,570
Farming in my fields in Nanyang…

33
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,690
Concerned only to survive
in a troubled age.

34
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,980
Concerned only to survive
in a troubled age.

35
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,690
Principal.

36
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,410
Ms. Zhou.

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,980
The police officers

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,290
need to talk to you.

39
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,780
Take a seat, please.

40
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,980
I'm sorry, Mei,

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,980
but this all came up suddenly.

42
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,570
It's urgent,

43
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,170
so we need you to come here

44
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,820
to do a simple…

45
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,540
Have you caught the person?

46
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,570
Mei,

47
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,780
we've asked you here today

48
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,010
to learn some other things

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,570
about Qiao.

50
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,380
Do you know

51
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,890
if he had financial dealings

52
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:57,940
with anyone

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,290
before he died

54
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,380
or any private loans

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,260
that you weren't aware of?

56
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,010
Let's put it this way.

57
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,500
Has there been

58
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,130
any unexplained money

59
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,170
in your bank account this past year?

60
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,850
Or

61
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,580
did he have any bad habits,

62
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,220
such as gambling?

63
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,340
Did he borrow cash from someone?

64
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,980
Is it possible that Qiao did something

65
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,100
- without…
- Stop.

66
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,290
What do you mean?

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,580
Just say it.

68
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,020
Okay.

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,580
I'll be blunt then.

70
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,340
We received a report

71
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,100
that Qiao Zhenxing

72
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,410
took a large bribe

73
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,980
in the middle of last year.

74
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,980
Are you aware of this?

75
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,660
If this is true,

76
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,780
do you know

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,850
where he hid the money?

78
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,730
Yang Jing,

79
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,460
show her the phone.

80
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,490
Mei, take a look.

81
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,610
Is this Qiao's cellphone?

82
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,930
Don't touch it.

83
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,140
It's…

84
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,730
It's Qiao's.

85
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,610
Play it.

86
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,340
My name is Qiao Zhenxing.

87
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,460
I'm a prosecutor
at Dongping People's Procuratorate.

88
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:51,980
Today

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,290
is the first day of court
for the Wan Hai case.

90
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,780
Isn't this Director Qiao
from First Division?

91
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,050
He died recently.

92
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,170
You just found out?

93
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,730
People've been talking for a while.

94
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,700
I can't live with the guilt anymore.

95
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,250
He's the umbrella?

96
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:08,900
Yeah.

97
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,140
Because I am…

98
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,290
Because I am

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,220
the umbrella
shielding Wan Hai's criminal outfit.

100
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,140
Wan Hai is on trial,

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,460
and I am

102
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,580
being judged too.

103
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,410
I admit

104
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,980
I took Wan Hai's money…

105
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,340
Why are you still home?

106
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,370
And promised to clear his name.

107
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,020
What are you watching?

108
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,610
I've failed the Party

109
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,610
and the nation that trained me.

110
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,050
Every step that led me here

111
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,140
was my own mistake.

112
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,410
I brought this on myself,

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,660
and I deserve whatever punishment comes.

114
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,900
Death would not be too much.

115
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,730
Zhou Mei.

116
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,170
Ran.

117
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,660
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,700
I'm so sorry.

119
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,700
I don't want to drag you down.

120
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,460
I'm leaving.

121
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,460
Take care of yourselves.

122
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,660
Stay well.

123
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,050
Let's go inside.

124
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:16,900
Mei,

125
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,850
this is the search warrant.

126
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,020
Take a look.

127
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,980
Li, search there with him.

128
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,020
You guys search here.

129
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,020
Search everything.

130
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:43,940
What are you doing?

131
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,610
Be careful.

132
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,730
Clean up after yourselves.

133
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,530
Qiao Yiran,

134
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,650
apologize to Liu Meiqi.

135
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,530
Why?

136
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,130
Because her mom was bullied by gangsters

137
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,580
when she set up her stall.

138
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,010
What's that got to do with me?

139
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,610
You should apologize
on your dad's behalf.

140
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,650
My dad didn't hit her.

141
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,370
But he was the protector
of the criminal organization!

142
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,580
Even if he's dead,
he was still a corrupt official!

143
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,610
He got what he deserved!

144
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,820
He wasn't corrupt!

145
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,580
Stop fighting!

146
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,130
Stop it!

147
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,980
My dad wasn't corrupt!

148
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,490
He was!

149
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,220
He wasn't!

150
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,340
Stop fighting!

151
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,770
Stop!

152
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,940
He was a big-time corrupt official!

153
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,700
Stop fighting!

154
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,300
You two, stop fighting!

155
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,850
Your dad was corrupt!

156
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,460
He wasn't!

157
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,700
He totally was!

158
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,180
Captain Jiang!

159
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:58,820
What's up?

160
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:00,940
There's cash under the bed.

161
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:08,940
Lift it.

162
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,610
Okay.

163
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,220
Come on.

164
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,220
My name is Qiao Zhenxing.

165
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,010
I'm a prosecutor
at Dongping People's Procuratorate.

166
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,650
Today

167
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,700
is the first day of court
for the Wan Hai case.

168
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,100
Mr. Li.

169
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,250
Where did you get this?

170
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,300
Mr. Li.

171
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,340
Mr. Li.

172
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:55,770
Bad news.

173
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,370
Something big happened to Qiao.

174
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,010
I already know.

175
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,820
Does Director Zhang know?

176
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,100
Which one?

177
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,220
The one from the Supervisory Commission.

178
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,890
Probably not.

179
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,650
I don't know.

180
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,420
Let him know.

181
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,100
Hurry!

182
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,580
Okay.

183
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,130
Okay.

184
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,420
Mr. Li.

185
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,490
Officers from the sub-bureau
of Development Zone

186
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,940
found cash at Qiao's house.

187
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,250
There's suspicion he took bribes.

188
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,610
They're still at Qiao's place.

189
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,420
Mr. Li, where are you going?

190
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,770
Qiao Zhenxing's home!

191
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,130
You can't go right now.

192
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,300
First, the investigation is still ongoing.

193
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,940
Second, if Qiao really did that,

194
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,010
you will only get yourself into trouble.

195
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:49,980
Is there any more?

196
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,700
No, that's it.

197
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,220
How much?

198
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,100
Three million. It matches.

199
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,220
Captain Jiang,

200
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,890
this isn't our money.

201
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,610
I understand.

202
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,340
No, you don't.

203
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,420
It's not what's going on.

204
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,180
Zhou Biao must have lied.

205
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,420
Qiao wasn't that kind of person.

206
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,100
Zhou Mei,

207
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,370
the evidence is solid.

208
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,490
It was just pulled from under your bed,

209
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,300
and it matches Zhou Biao's testimony.

210
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,460
What else do you want to say?

211
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,890
No way.

212
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,370
You must be mistaken.

213
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,460
We've never

214
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,060
seen that money in this house.

215
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,730
Captain Jiang, let me talk to Zhou Biao.

216
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,060
I have to ask him why he lied

217
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,820
and framed Qiao.

218
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,890
He's clearly making this up!

219
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,370
Zhou Mei!

220
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,250
The entire search

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,610
was recorded.

222
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:51,890
I know.

223
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,420
Do you understand?

224
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,250
Evidence bag?

225
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,220
Here you are.

226
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,220
Pack it up.

227
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,530
Zhou Mei,

228
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,130
we'll take this illegal money with us.

229
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,010
Hello.

230
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,770
Ms. Zhou.

231
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,370
Qiao Yiran got into a fight at school.

232
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,700
You'd better come to my office now.

233
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,700
What happened?

234
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,580
I'm sorry, Director.

235
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,370
Director,

236
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,650
what happened?

237
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,770
Her classmates said

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,010
she had a quarrel

239
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,890
with some classmates after PE class.

240
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,340
But somehow

241
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,370
it turned into a fight.

242
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,610
Did you look into it?

243
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,530
She called my dad a corrupt official!

244
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,650
Why shouldn't I fight back?

245
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,180
Your dad was…

246
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:55,770
Mei.

247
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,340
Mei,

248
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,220
I understand your family is dealing
with stuff now,

249
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,940
but you still have to

250
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,370
take care of your child, right?

251
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,700
Zhou…

252
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,010
It hurts! Mom!

253
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,370
It hurts!

254
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,980
Mom!

255
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,250
Now you know it hurts?

256
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,730
Who taught you to fight?

257
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,300
Why did you fight?

258
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,890
Is this what your dad and I taught you?

259
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,340
To start fights at school?

260
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,250
You like fighting, huh?

261
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,460
Then forget school.

262
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,370
Take off the uniform.

263
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,650
You don't act like a student anyway.

264
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,220
Take it off!

265
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,460
Go ahead.

266
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,730
Be a fighter.

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,180
You trying to drive me mad?

268
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,580
Like things aren't messy enough already?

269
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,530
How did you hit them?

270
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,130
You even bit someone?

271
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,250
Go ahead. Bite me!

272
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,300
Come on, bite!

273
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,650
Open your mouth!

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,220
Show me how you bit them!

275
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,250
They called my dad a corrupt official.

276
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,490
But he wasn't.

277
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,340
I'm sorry, Mom.

278
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,650
I won't fight anymore.

279
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,130
Mom, I'm sorry.

280
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,850
Let me see.

281
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,850
Any other bruises?

282
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,730
Mom.

283
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,460
What happened?

284
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,530
Why did the video end up online?

285
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,460
Ms. Lan,

286
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,580
that was my mistake.

287
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,340
Let's all sit down and talk.

288
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,580
Sit.

289
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,100
Sun Fei,

290
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,580
update Ms. Lan on what we found

291
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,940
about the video source.

292
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:10,820
Okay.

293
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,580
Ms. Lan.

294
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,460
According to our investigation,

295
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,420
the video of Qiao Zhenxing

296
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,300
wasn't leaked from within the Police.

297
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,770
The first upload happened

298
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,220
before we got his phone.

299
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,370
Our cyber team analyzed the account.

300
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,060
The phone number was newly registered,

301
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,130
and it used a virtual IP address,

302
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,530
so we couldn't trace the source.

303
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,610
We suspect

304
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,940
someone hacked Qiao's phone

305
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,820
and got the video.

306
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,730
Many people are following
the Wan Hai case.

307
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,340
Posting it online

308
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,060
was probably to attract more attention.

309
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,700
So we can't control it?

310
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,300
We've…

311
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,650
We're just letting it spiral?

312
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,130
We've already tried.

313
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,060
But we're short of time and hands.

314
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,940
Sun Fei,

315
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,820
I can assign more people
if you're short-handed.

316
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,490
If we're almost done

317
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,250
investigating the Qiao Zhenxing case,

318
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,770
we should clear things up

319
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,380
and give the public an explanation.

320
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,220
We will.

321
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,900
The Qiao Zhenxing case

322
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,330
is truly shocking.

323
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,620
As a leader, I must take responsibility.

324
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,860
We must stay vigilant.

325
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,530
There's no room for carelessness
in clean governance.

326
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,570
All of us here

327
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,380
hold power entrusted

328
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,980
by the Party and the people.

329
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,660
If we use it for personal gain,
take bribes, or break the law,

330
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,530
we will lose everything.

331
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,570
We must live up to the trust

332
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,860
of the 6.6 million people of Dongping.

333
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,570
Mr. Zhou,

334
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,330
when can we get our salaries?

335
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,090
I'm heading out for a few days.

336
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:39,900
Keep an eye on it for me.

337
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,660
Alright. Mr. Zhou.

338
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,050
Why did you say Qiao took the money?

339
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,940
When did he take any money?

340
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,570
Speak!

341
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,250
Mei,

342
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,010
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,330
I didn't want to.

344
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,090
I hurt you,

345
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,220
and I hurt Zhenxing.

346
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,330
Why did you do that?

347
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,860
Don't ask.

348
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,180
It was for your own good.

349
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,010
What do you mean,

350
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,010
for our good?

351
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,860
He's already gone.

352
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,220
No point in talking about this now.

353
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,010
Let's go.

354
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,380
Explain it to the Police.

355
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,730
Let's go!

356
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,250
Mei, we can't!

357
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,290
I'll tell you the truth.

358
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,980
Someone threatened him
with you and Ran

359
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,330
and put the money under your bed.

360
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,250
They forced me to report it to the Police,

361
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,980
saying it came from Wan Hai.

362
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,330
Who were they?

363
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,940
Don't ask!

364
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,730
Mei,

365
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,330
they poured boiling water

366
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,220
on my hand.

367
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,460
They locked me up,

368
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,980
starved me,

369
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,810
and didn't let me sleep.

370
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,290
You almost never saw me again.

371
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,250
I had no choice.

372
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,620
If you tell the Police,

373
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,380
you and ran will end up like Zhenxing.

374
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,660
He did all this to protect you.

375
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,460
Mei,

376
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,290
I'm begging you.

377
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,940
I don't even know who they were.

378
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,700
We can't find them.

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,090
Just accept it.

380
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,290
Come in.

381
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,090
Mr. Li.

382
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:30,900
Let's begin.

383
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,660
Okay.

384
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,140
Regarding the Qiao Zhenxing case,

385
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,220
the chain of evidence

386
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,980
is complete and closed.

387
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,810
He was suspected

388
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,700
of taking bribes from Wan Hai

389
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,180
and then committing suicide
to avoid punishment.

390
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,460
So we believe

391
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,660
the case can be closed.

392
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,090
But…

393
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,900
AI face-swapping tech is everywhere now.

394
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,730
Is there any chance

395
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,770
that the video is fake?

396
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,250
Our tech team has repeatedly

397
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,250
analyzed the video.

398
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,490
There are no signs

399
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,460
of editing or forgery.

400
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,250
We can confirm it was recorded by himself.

401
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,380
Aren't you wrapping things up
a little too fast?

402
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,250
Why are you so sure?

403
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,490
How did you confirm everything?

404
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,290
Well, first,

405
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,140
this is a major case,

406
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,570
and we've taken it seriously.

407
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,810
Second,

408
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,380
it shows our investigation team
has made solid progress.

409
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,490
Hold on, Mr. Xu.

410
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,490
Don't just talk about

411
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,810
your progress
and how seriously you took it.

412
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,380
Why is this video all over the internet?

413
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,420
Everyone knows

414
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,700
Dongping People's Procuratorate

415
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,050
has a prosecutor
who committed suicide out of guilt.

416
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,980
Why aren't you taking it seriously now?

417
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,290
Where's your progress?

418
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,900
Where are you when oversight is needed?

419
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,980
Where's your efficiency?

420
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,770
Mr. Li,

421
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,980
calm down.

422
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,810
We are already

423
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,900
digging into this matter.

424
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,860
And the Police will make sure

425
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,570
his family is taken care of.

426
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,940
Calm down now.

427
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,220
Mr. Xu, I was…

428
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,330
Hope you understand.
It was nothing personal.

429
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,530
I understand.

430
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,250
Things are changing fast.

431
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,180
It's not just the city.

432
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,380
People's hearts change fast too.

433
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,770
It's heartbreaking.

434
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,530
And humiliating.

435
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:46,980
I understand.

436
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,490
But you guys in Eleventh Division

437
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,530
must've seen this kind of thing a lot.

438
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,980
Not with someone this close.

439
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,530
But this is our job

440
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,900
in Eleventh Division.

441
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,140
Honestly, the leadership trusts us

442
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,250
and hands us the right.

443
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,140
So no matter how close the connection is,

444
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,860
we have to hold the line

445
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,660
and stick to our principles.

446
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,940
What's your next step?

447
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,380
I want to make a report.

448
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,460
Before we left,

449
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,090
the higher-ups

450
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,050
gave me three assignments.

451
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,010
Now that the Qiao Zhenxing case

452
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,770
is basically resolved,

453
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,290
I plan to drive back tomorrow

454
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,700
together with Huai'en

455
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,420
to give a progress report

456
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,900
to the Commissioner and Prosecutor Zhang.

457
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,220
Just give you a heads-up.

458
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,220
When are you coming back?

459
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,250
Well, Ms. Zheng.

460
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,420
Before I left,

461
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,420
I submitted my resignation

462
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,730
to the Commissioner.

463
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,530
The timing feels about right.

464
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,180
Got it.

465
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,700
Ms. Zheng,

466
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,420
so…

467
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,330
Wish you smooth work

468
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,660
and a successful wrap-up.

469
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,490
Thanks for everything.

470
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,940
Hong Liang!

471
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,010
Ms. Zheng.

472
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,250
How did you get into Eleventh Division?

473
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,290
Well,

474
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,810
18 years ago, I finished my master's…

475
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,330
Welcome home.

476
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,570
How did things

477
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,810
get this bad with Qiao?

478
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,010
They found three million in cash
at his place.

479
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,420
Who gave it to him?

480
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,050
Wan Hai?

481
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,810
Qiao…

482
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,330
To me, he was the last person

483
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,420
you'd expect something like this from.

484
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,700
You can never

485
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,490
truly understand someone.

486
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,490
But judging by the situation,

487
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,140
it's lucky

488
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,730
you pulled him off the Wan Hai case.

489
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,420
Otherwise, you'd have been involved too.

490
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,900
I still can't make sense of it.

491
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,010
He never seemed like

492
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,180
someone who cared about money.

493
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,380
There's something

494
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,380
I never told you.

495
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:37,730
He once

496
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,770
asked to borrow money from me.

497
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,530
Now you get promoted to acting director.

498
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,620
Hope you get confirmed soon.

499
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,860
I'm driving today.

500
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,810
Somehow I feel like this dinner

501
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,050
is not just a dinner.

502
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,530
Um…

503
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,050
Hello?

504
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,900
Just have him wait there for me.

505
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:04,900
Alright.

506
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,140
Sorry, but I gotta go now.

507
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,770
Bye.

508
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,660
Are you coming back?

509
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,700
No.

510
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,860
Say it if you have something to say.

511
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,940
I don't.

512
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,770
Then I'm leaving.

513
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:17,810
Um…

514
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,660
So you have something. Spit it out.

515
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,980
I want to borrow some money.

516
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,050
Just that? Then why bother having a meal?

517
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,810
How much?

518
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,460
Two hundred…

519
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,180
Thousand?

520
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,460
Would that be alright?

521
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,010
See?

522
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,530
No one is really above money.

523
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,250
It's all about the amount.

524
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,700
A million may be easy to turn down,

525
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,900
but what about ten million?

526
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,620
Or a hundred million?

527
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,770
Does Hong Liang know about this?

528
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,940
What did he say?

529
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,250
It's a big deal,

530
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,980
and it's all over the internet.

531
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,330
Hong Liang must've known this too.

532
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,290
He's probably feeling awful right now.

533
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,330
It's hard to accept all this,

534
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,660
but a fact is a fact.

535
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,620
You have to be careful.

536
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,050
Don't let this mess up

537
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,980
your relationship with Hong Liang.

538
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,700
Actually,

539
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,380
how about this?

540
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,330
Let's move up Yanxin and Zijian's

541
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,180
engagement party.

542
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,980
Since Hong Liang

543
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,860
is in Dongping now,

544
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,490
I'll invite Jiang Min too.

545
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,730
We can have a nice meal together

546
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,620
and cheer things up.

547
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,770
Maybe

548
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,770
that'll blow away some of the bad energy

549
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,730
and help everyone move on.

550
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,380
What do you think?

551
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,140
Isn't it inappropriate
to throw a party right now?

552
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,730
Why would it be?

553
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,620
He's gone,

554
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,050
but we still have our lives.

555
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,140
Don't worry about it.

556
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,140
I'll talk to Aunt.

557
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,460
When she sets a date,

558
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,810
we'll hold the party.

559
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,280
[Boss]

560
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,770
Huai'en,

561
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,010
it's my 'boss'.

562
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,250
She probably wants an update.

563
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,090
Do you

564
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,290
need me to join that?

565
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,530
No, thanks.

566
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:36,980
Alright.

567
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,700
Did you see Qiao's video?

568
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:51,860
Hold on.

569
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,660
What happened to Qiao?

570
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,330
Exactly what you saw.

571
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,420
So…

572
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,700
He killed himself, fine.

573
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,700
Why did he record the video?

574
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,730
How will Zhou Mei and their daughter

575
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,770
survive this?

576
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,420
Well, you…

577
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,940
It is hard

578
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,570
to comment on him now.

579
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,460
You don't know

580
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,530
what was going on with him.

581
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,050
Maybe making that video

582
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,330
was the only way

583
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,980
to sever ties with some people.

584
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,090
Maybe it was the only way

585
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,010
he could take the fall alone.

586
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,140
There's a lot we don't know.

587
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,090
But right now,

588
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,140
I just feel really bad.

589
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,770
Not just because

590
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,180
I lost an old friend.

591
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,250
I don't understand
why Qiao ended up like this.

592
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,330
I'm heartbroken. Do you get that?

593
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,050
I do.

594
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,700
But I need to remind you.

595
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,460
You can't show your sadness.

596
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,570

597

598
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,620
you can't show any sadness.

599
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,490
Got it?

600
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,460
And you're not living alone, right?

601
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,290
Even in front of your roommate,

602
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,050
you can't, either.

come to Beijing.

608
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,730

I do.

please help me!

654
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,900
The mine is in serious trouble.

655
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,940
Despite the trouble,

656
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,420
you still have to
pay the bank interest on time.

00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,210
You're right.

658
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,860
We want to pay,

659
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,170
but we can't.

660
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,260

That's your problem in operation.

666
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,380
Coming to me won't help.

667
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,340
There's nothing I can do.

668
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,380
You need to figure it out yourselves.

669
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,780
Director,

670
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,460
I've tried everything.

671
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,010
I'm truly out of options.

672
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,740
My brother's case still has no conclusion,

673
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,170
and because of that,

674
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,690
nothing else is moving forward.

675
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,340
I came to ask if you could

676
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,690
talk to the Development Zone Branch

677
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,170
to see if they can rework

678
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,380
our repayment plan.

679
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,780
Just give us a bit more time.

680
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,130
If he weren't involved in organized crime,

681
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,130
it'd be easier.

682
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,460
Now that he is,

683
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,300
your credit's ruined

684
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,570
across the banking system.

685
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,300
To be honest,

686
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,570
if the Managing Committee

687
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,460
hadn't guaranteed your loan,

688
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,460
the bank would've already sued you.

689
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,940
That's why I'm here today, Director.

690
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,650
You can't just wash your hands of this.

691
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,780
Let me be frank.

692
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,690
If this drags on,

693
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,210
the mine

694
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,570
will go bankrupt.

695
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,460
And if that happens,

696
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,260
we can't even pay the principal,

697
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,380
let alone the interest.

698
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,860
After all, you were the guarantor.

699
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,380
Stop!

700
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,650
It wasn't me.

701
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,210
It was the Managing Committee.

702
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,010
Of course.

703
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,380
I didn't take a dime.

704
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,740
All the procedures were legal and proper.

705
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,980
I had nothing to do with it personally.

706
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,210
Let's get that clear.

707
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,210
I understand, Director.

708
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,690
What I mean is,

709
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,570
if we can't pay back the 300 million,

710
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,130
the district government loses money too.

711
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,490
As the guarantor,

712
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,010
you can't be completely uninvolved.

713
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,050
And as an official,

714
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,900
you certainly don't want
to see that happen.

715
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,900
Please ask the bank to ease up a little.

716
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,460
Fine. Let me think about it, okay?

717
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,300
I'm running late.

718
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,900
Thank you!

719
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,570
And

720
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,490
don't come here again!

721
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,490
Meet me at my office!

722
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,340

723
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,530
Don't make trouble. Take it back.

724
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,090

725
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,650
Thanks again, Director.

726
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,340
Come in.

727
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,170
Mr. Xu,

728
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:31,940
you wanted to see me?

729
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,820
Come over here.

730
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,980

731
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,740
Today,

732
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,780
the sub-bureau will ask Zhou Mei
to sign the paperwork.

733
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,530
I expect

734
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,690
she won't take it well.

735
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,860
Can you go with them

736
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,260
and help keep things calm?

737
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,460
So this case

738
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:57,980
is being closed?

739
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,650
The physical evidence
and witness testimony

740
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,780
corroborate each other.

741
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,460
We have to

742
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:04,740
close it.

743
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,420
Mr. Xu,

744
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,530
we can't close it.

745
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,050
Qiao was threatened before he died!

746
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,260
Sun Fei never investigated that.

747
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:12,860
And

748
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,010
they said he drank a bottle of baijiu,

749
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,690
but he was allergic to alcohol.

750
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,900
Think about it.

751
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,340
How could he go to the Yongqing River

752
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,940
after drinking a bottle of baijiu?

753
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,610
And…

754
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,780
Enough…

755
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,050
What you're saying

756
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,650
is all speculation without any evidence.

757
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,530
But we can investigate.

758
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,300
We can verify these things.

759
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:32,900
Right?

760
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,050
If Sun Fei doesn't do it,

761
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,010
we can take the case back

762
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,860
and hand it over to the Municipal
Criminal Investigation Detachment.

763
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:38,650
Worst case,

764
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,820
hand it over to me.

765
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,740
I asked you

766
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,380
for his location records and call logs,

767
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,340
but you made me stay out of it.

768
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:45,690
Captain,

769
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,490
this isn't what you taught me in the army.

770
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,090
Why did you change

771
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,130
after leaving the service?

772
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,090
Is this how the Police handle cases now?

773
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,300
Just piece together

774
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,780
whatever they can and call it a wrap?

775
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,300
Isn't that reckless?

776
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,340
Isn't that being complicit?

777
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,050
Qin Feng! Have you lost your mind?

778
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,980
What are you saying?

779
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,740
Do you find it humiliating
being a policeman?

780
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,090
The army has its rules,

781
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,570
and so does the Police.

782
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,530
This case was handled by the sub-bureau.

783
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,900
You can't just overturn it

784
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,940
because you're not satisfied!

785
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:15,820
And

786
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,010
taking a case back from Sun Fei?

787
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,740
That's not something you can just do.

788
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,570
In the police uniform,

789
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,530
you're a police officer first

790
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,490
and a family member second.

791
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,010
You need to do your job well

792
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,900
and stay professional.

793
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,260
You can't just charge ahead like that.

794
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,460
What did I teach you?

795
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,130
You taught me to...

796
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,900
Listen to me.

797
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,210
Today

798
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,690
you'll go with Jiang Hongjun

799
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,820
and support the sub-bureau team.

800
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,130
I…

801
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,010
This is an order!

802
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,420
Zhou Mei,

803
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,130
I need

804
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,340
your signature here.

805
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,530
And this copy

806
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,690
is for you.

807
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,940
After signing,

808
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,650
take this notice

809
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,780
to the funeral home,

810
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,050
and they'll release the body.

811
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,160
You can make the arrangements from there.

812
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,520
[Pingshan Development Zone Sub-Bureau,
Appraisal Opinion Notice (Copy)]

813
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,780
If I sign this,

814
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,650
does that mean it's over?

815
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:29,820
Case closed.

816
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,260
Ms. Zhou,

817
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:50,690
this is

818
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,210
just the procedure.

819
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,420
Uncle,

820
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,650
my dad couldn't have killed himself,

821
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,690
right?

822
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,210
We can't just stay here.

823
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,530
Go downstairs,

824
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,210
and we'll talk.

825
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,260
Mom shouldn't sign that.

826
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,130
Let's go.

827
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:33,980
Let's go.

828
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:46,780
Zhou Mei,

829
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,820
I know

830
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,820
saying 'I understand'

831
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,900
may sound meaningless.

832
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,530
But I've known Qiao for over 20 years.

833
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,010
Even someone who just met him

834
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,740
wouldn't want to believe this,

835
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,740
let alone accept it.

836
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,210
But…

837
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,460
Sign it,

838
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:23,980
okay?

839
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,090
Mr. Li,

840
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,460
can we hold a memorial for him?

841
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,650
He was a prosecutor for almost 20 years.

842
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,530
He was a Party member.

843
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,900
He should be in the uniform,

844
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,050
