00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,460
to the provincial office

192
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,300
and finally

193
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,220
got to meet you, Commissioner Sun.

194
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,180
And you?

195
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,250
You told me it's gonna take time?

196
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,100
You told me to be patient?

197
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,250
But how long do I have to wait?

198
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,100
How much longer do I have to wait?

199
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,100
Hong Liang,

200
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,580
the Party Committee has decided

201
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,370
to appoint Cao Ye
to take over your position.

202
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,650
You know Cao,

203
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,420
He's very capable

204
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,370
and responsible.

205
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,530
Just a bit hot-tempered.

206
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,420
So when you're handing things over,

207
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,850
be patient with him.

208
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,010
Also,

209
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,340
you need to talk to Zhang Huai'en.

210
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,770
He also wants to transfer
to First Division.

211
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,730
No one wants to stay
in Eleventh Division now.

212
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,370
You've started a trend, see?

213
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,610
Come on.

214
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,340
Calm him down.

215
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,980
You mean Cao?
I know exactly how to handle him.

216
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,890
I can settle it in no time.

217
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,370
Not Cao.

218
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,940
I meant Zhang, Zhang Huai'en.

219
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,490
Cao's the one
you're handing work over to.

220
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,250
Zhang's the one you need to convince,

221
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,370
convince him to stay.

222
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,010
Right.

223
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,530
When you hand over the work,

224
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,420
give these materials

225
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,460
to Cao.

226
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:53,890
How long will it take?

227
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,130
What how long?

228
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,300
Last time, I submitted

229
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,820
the water sample on Zhongxing Road.

230
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,370
How long will it take?

231
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,610
Oh? What does 'oh' mean?

232
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,890
I'll check on that for you later.

233
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,820
Why later?

234
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,890
You can find out right now.

235
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,700
You told me last time,

236
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,180
once you got the results,

237
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,060
you'd let me know right away.

238
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:21,980
Just wait.

239
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,610
Wait? Until when?

240
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,300
Just wait.

241
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,460
When is it gonna be?

242
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,650
How would I know?

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,250
I told you to wait!

244
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,490
You keep telling me to wait,

245
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,700
but I've waited long enough...

246
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,100
What are you hassling me for?

247
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,530
Don't you understand the word "wait"?

248
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:35,650
Get out!

249
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,420
Mr. Wan,
Director Liu is waiting for you.

250
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,130
I brought you here

251
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,010
with some good news.

252
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,820
We found a company

253
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,490
that's willing to take over
Wanchuan Mining

254
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,180
and help you out of trouble.

255
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,100
Wait, director. What do you mean?

256
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,650
Have a seat.

257
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,820
I know

258
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,980
your company is barely holding on.

259
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,300
You're overwhelmed by bank loans.

260
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,060
Now, if someone's willing to take over

261
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,890
and assume your debt,

262
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,850
it's a good thing for you.

263
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,300
Besides,

264
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,770
you'll walk away
with a sizable amount of cash.

265
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,980
You could start other ventures easily.

266
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,220
That's way better than sitting here
watching the house burn down.

267
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,340
Director,

268
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,940
I understand your point.

269
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,370
You're right.

270
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,420
But the problem is

271
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,420
Wanchuan Mining is not mine.

272
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,220
I don't have the final say.

273
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,250
Wan Chao is the legal representative.

274
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,610
He'd never agree to sell.

275
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,180
What I'm trying to say is,

276
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,100
please help me

277
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,530
talk to the bank again.

278
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,650
I've done everything I can
with the bank.

279
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,700
If I didn't have to,

280
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,730
I wouldn't be meeting you today
to talk about this.

281
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,250
Think about it,

282
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,460
back then,

283
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,700
when your family first discovered
that nickel-copper mine,

284
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,730
your brother hyped it up big time,

285
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,460
convinced us to endorse you,

286
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,130
got the bank to approve the loans.

287
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,580
Director,

288
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,220
that wasn't hype.

289
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,820
We all discussed and agreed on it,

290
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,420
mutually, right?

291
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,060
Well, your brother got tied up
with organized crime.

292
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,100
Now he's gone.

293
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,220
The money's gone too.

294
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,420
He talked a big game
about new energy development,

295
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,490
but nothing ever materialized.

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,730
I hope

297
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,490
you can face the reality.

298
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,730
If this goes on,

299
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,010
we'll all be dragged down with you.

300
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,220
The only reality I can face right now is

301
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,530
Wanchuan Mining is the last hope

302
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,820
our family has left.

303
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,340
As long as we still have it,

304
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,890
there's a chance we can recover.

305
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,820
If we sell it,

306
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,650
we're left with nothing.

307
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,530
Please help us one more time.

308
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,810
This is me helping you.

309
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,050
Tianlong Company

310
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,620
is one of Dongping's top enterprises,

311
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,050
a major taxpayer
in our development zone.

312
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,220
If they are willing to take over,

313
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,490
it benefits us all.

314
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,620
To put it bluntly,

315
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,810
you're not desperate,
just too blind to see what you've got.

316
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,180
Look,

317
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,180
if you drag it out longer,

318
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,980
the debt ratio with the bank
only gets worse.

319
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,050
Then even if you want to sell,

320
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,090
you won't

321
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,530
get a good price.

322
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,250
Mr. Li, Director Liu,

323
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,570
welcome. Please, come in.

324
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,730
Wow...

325
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:12,980
Director Liu,

326
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,730
isn't this a bit much?

327
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,770
We're celebrating your birthday.

328
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,810
I wanted to show you how much I care.

329
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,570
- My star prosecutor.
- Watch your steps.

330
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,810
No, it's star prosecutor-general.

331
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,180
It's just a birthday.

332
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,460
A dinner at home would've been enough.

333
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,860
There are no outsiders today,

334
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,770
just a family gathering.

335
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,330
Mr. Li, Director Liu, please.

336
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,700
Good evening, Mr. Li, Director Liu.

337
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,420
How come everyone knows me?

338
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,420
You cracked the Wan Hai case.

339
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,180
Who in Dongping doesn't know you?

340
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,220
Good evening, Mr. Li, Director Liu.

341
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,330
All your dishes are ready, please enjoy.

342
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,050
We're here.

343
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,460
Mr. Li is here.

344
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,940
Mr. Li, our birthday star!

345
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,730
Hello, welcome.

346
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,380
We've been waiting for you.

347
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,140
See? I really pulled some strings.

348
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,620
Come on.

349
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,290
Mr. Xu is here too.

350
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,220
We're waiting for you.

351
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,980
Chief Judge Wen, come on.

352
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,660
Mr. Li, don't mind us.

353
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,140
We knew today was your birthday.

354
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,460
Didn't even apply through Ms. Lan,

355
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,140
we just showed up.

356
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,220
Well, since you're all here,

357
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,180
everyone take a seat.

358
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,330
Renjun, sit here.

359
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,180
Take a seat.

360
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,290
Hurry up, sit down.

361
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,380
Director Liu, I have a small request.

362
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,330
May I say a few words today?

363
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,140
You absolutely should.

364
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,010
All right, with this dinner,

365
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,050
I want to make a toast.

366
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,140
Originally, Liu Yun and I planned to

367
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,220
have a quiet birthday dinner
for Renjun at home.

368
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,420
But

369
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,900
he just wrapped up a major case,

370
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,940
we thought he could relax a bit.

371
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,980
Didn't expect so many of you

372
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,530
would show up
for our little family dinner.

373
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,330
Let me guess,

374
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,010
this was your idea, right, Liu Yun?

375
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,940
I might have encouraged it a little too.

376
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,010
Since you're here,

377
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,730
I can only welcome you.

378
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,290
Of course, we'll feed you.

379
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,250
You've all worked hard lately.

380
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,730
It's only right we have dinner together.

381
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,050
Just don't forget the rules.

382
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,770
Even though the big case is over,

383
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,330
but

384
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,010
we still need to stay humble
and disciplined.

385
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,180
Come on, everyone.

386
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,570
Ms. Lan is right.

387
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,660
Right!

388
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,530
Come on.

389
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,810
Can you be serious?

390
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,460
Okay.

391
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,570
I'm being very sincere.

392
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:34,980
Come on.

393
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,940
Thank you.

394
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,730
Renjun.

395
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,700
Take your seats.

396
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,940
Well, I've got to

397
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,180
fill this one for Ms. Lan.

398
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,700
You wanna make a toast?

399
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,570
Comes straight from the heart.

400
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,250
Ms. Lan.

401
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,770
Without your support,

402
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,460
we wouldn't be where we are today.

403
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,140
You set the big picture,

404
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,940
your direction

405
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,490
is the path we follow.

406
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,090
Twenty years ago,
you were the one who guided me.

407
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,770
Today, you still are.

408
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,860
This one's for you.

409
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,420
Thank you.

410
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,660
I'd also like to toast Ms. Lan.

411
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,730
Ms. Lan...

412
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,090
You sit down.

413
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,180
Alright, I'll sit.

414
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:18,940
Ms. Lan,

415
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,380
to be honest,

416
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,730
in the middle of
handling this Wan Hai case,

417
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,010
I had my doubts.

418
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,180
But seeing you and Mr. Li
being so determined,

419
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,700
leading us forward despite the pressure,

420
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,090
that cleared my doubts.

421
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,010
I will

422
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,490
learn more from you and Mr. Li
in the future.

423
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,420
Here's to that.

424
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,330
Thank you.

425
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:42,730
Well,

426
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,900
Ms. Lan,

427
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,090
I, I have to toast you too.

428
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,490
Just say it from your seat.

429
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,940
Sit down.

430
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,010
Okay.

431
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,090
Ms. Lan,

432
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,220
first, thank you for your understanding.

433
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,380
everyone knows,

434
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,010
my body

435
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,810
keeps letting me down.

436
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,380
I'm anxious about it too.

437
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,140
I'll do my best

438
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,140
to recover quickly,

439
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,090
so I can contribute more

440
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,490
like Mr. Li

441
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,290
and Chief Judge Wen.

442
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,660
Ms. Lan,

443
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,860
here's to you.

444
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,010
I...

445
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,050
would like to...

446
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,530
apologize first.

447
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,700
Well,

448
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,140
I know

449
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,700
the fact that I'm still
sitting here today

450
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,570
is because of Ms. Lan's

451
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,010
trust in me.

452
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,180
Actually,

453
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,530
I didn't handle this well.

454
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,810
Since I took on this case,

455
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,900
I was eager

456
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,330
to get it indicted.

457
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,290
I believed Zhang Wenjing had issues,

458
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,810
so I asked Mr. Sun to look into her.

459
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,940
Turns out she really did.

460
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,460
But in the end,
we still didn't handle it well.

461
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,140
So however I'm dealt with,
I accept it.

462
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,700
Today, I want to

463
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,140
apologize to you,

464
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:04,980
Ms. Lan.

465
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,620
I've always

466
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,330
worked diligently all these years.

467
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,770
If there was a flaw in this case,

468
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,290
that flaw

469
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,180
was me.

470
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,900
I let you down.

471
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,180
I failed to live up to your trust.

472
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,490
I am sorry.

473
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,770
And, Mr. Li,

474
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,730
this one's for you.

475
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,900
My reach is limited.

476
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,530
From now on,

477
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,180
I'll prove myself with actions.

478
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,220
Cheers.

479
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,770
Alright, Xie. You were
thinking about the bigger picture.

480
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,460
I believe Ms. Lan and everyone here

481
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,250
can understand.

482
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,620
Right, Mr. Li?

483
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,010
No case goes perfectly.

484
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,330
Besides,

485
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,900
Hongfei,

486
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,090
your intention was good.

487
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,330
Nothing wrong with that.

488
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,620
This case was incredibly complicated,

489
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,570
had all kinds of mixed-up clues.

490
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,730
It's understandable to make mistakes.

491
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,900
But in the future,

492
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,490
we need to be even more careful,

493
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,700
avoid repeating the same errors.

494
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,050
Let's turn the page on this.

495
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,460
We won't mention it again.

496
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,050
Thank you.

497
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,380
Mr. Li.

498
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,140
Director Liu.

499
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:08,900
Sit down.

500
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,330
Xie,

501
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,940
we all get where you're coming from.

502
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,570
Don't be too upset.

503
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,730
It's okay.

504
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,730
How was it?

505
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,810
I went to five law firms.

506
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,220
All rejected me.

507
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,090
Don't panic.

508
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,900
We'll think of something else.

509
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,770
And if not,

510
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,660
you could try something different.

511
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,220
Try something different?

512
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,620
Like what?

513
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,050
Civil service?

514
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,460
Prosecutor? Judge?

515
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,010
Would they even take me?

516
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,570
I'm a criminal defense lawyer.

517
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,490
Graduated from a top law school.

518
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,620
Why would they want me?

519
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,010
When they need me to be a 'criminal',

520
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,010
they could just label me as one

521
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,860
and lock me up.

522
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,810
When they need me to be clean,

523
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,700
I'm declared innocent

524
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,530
and released.

525
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,660
Can the law be used like that?

526
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,940
You're venting now,

527
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,050
it's pointless.

528
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,460
Who told you to take this case?

529
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,530
What if you didn't take it?

530
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,730
You got out safely now,

531
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,420
live with that.

532
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,530
How could I not take it?

533
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,770
They were twisting the facts,
don't you know that?

534
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,660
I'm the legal adviser to Wan Group.

535
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,180
I couldn't just walk away.

536
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,530
What did you say

537
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,490
when I was arrested?

538
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,140
Zhang Wenjing,

539
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,700
you are suspected of participating

540
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,140
in the Wan Hai organized crime case.

541
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,460
[Arrest Warrant]
You are now under arrest.

542
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,460
Cuff her.

543
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,250
What are you doing?

544
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,180
All right.

545
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,290
Go back to your work.

546
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,380
Let's not escalate this.

547
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,250
Go.

548
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:30,860
Zhang Wenjing,

549
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,660
go with the police for now.

550
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,140
I've got you.

551
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,180
You looked me in the eye and told me

552
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,940
to believe you, that you've got me.

553
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:39,980
And then?

554
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,730
You were the first to walk away.

555
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,140
You left me alone.

556
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,620
No one answered,
no matter how hard I cried for help.

557
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,700
What do you expect me to do?

558
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,290
What can I possibly do by myself?

559
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,330
Tell me!

560
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,490
What can I do?

561
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,180
When I graduated from college,

562
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,090
remember what you said back then?

563
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:54,940
You said,

564
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,570
'Justice has no right to be late.'

565
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,490
Right?

566
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,180
'Justice that comes too late
isn't justice.'

567
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,620
'It is at best a truth.'

568
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,770
Weren't those your words?

569
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,180
And now you're telling me this?

570
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,620
Forget it.

571
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,980
Some things,

572
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,220
you don't need to know.

573
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,490
Even if you do, it won't help.

574
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,810
Fairness,

575
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,940
justice, truth...

576
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,660
That's all stuff they teach you

577
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,700
in classrooms and textbooks.

578
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,330
But that's not life.

579
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,530
Life is just surviving.

580
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,700
Like how you're living right now.

581
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,140
Lawyer

582
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,380
is supposed to be

583
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,530
a profession that brings
justice and fairness.

584
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,420
For the Wan Hai case,

585
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,980
you need a fair and just
environment to handle it.

586
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,010
But someone already ruined that.

587
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,900
So there's no more justice.

588
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,050
I can't give you

589
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,090
what you want.

590
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,460
I don't know what to say anymore.

591
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,700
The Wan Hai case

592
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,180
is not just a case in Dongping anymore,

593
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,380
it's gone nationwide.

594
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,940
You should have some idea about that.

595
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,770
As for your job,

596
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,250
I'll try to figure something out.

597
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,980
See if there are any connections
I can pull.

598
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,220
Sometimes,

599
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,490
it's better to just not know too much.

600
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,700
Bye.

601
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,380
Today is a big day.

602
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,140
I suggest

603
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,980
we raise a glass to Mr. Li.

604
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,770
To wish him all the best
as our new prosecutor-general.

605
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,530
Good idea.

606
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,090
Let's all stand up for this.

607
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,660
Come on.

608
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,980
Mr. Li contributed a lot.

609
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,090
Here's to our hero.

610
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,010
Congratulations.

611
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,380
Thanks to you all.

612
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,330
Come on.

613
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,250
Congrats.

614
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,420
You guys drink.

615
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,140
I've prepared a little ceremony.

616
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,980
Ceremony?

617
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,140
Are you ready?

618
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,620
Let me turn off the light.

619
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,420
Congratulations!

620
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,250
Big congratulations!

621
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,290
Warm congratulations!

622
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,660
Dear leaders.

623
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,730
Dear leaders.

624
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,180
Allow me to introduce myself.

625
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,860
My name is Chen Shenglong.

626
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,730
Welcome all of you

627
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,330
to come to my restaurant.

628
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,250
When I heard you'd be here,

629
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,050
I was very excited.

630
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,140
There's so much I want to say,

631
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,330
but let's just call it fate.

632
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,330
I was

633
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,700
born and raised in Dongping,
and built my career here.

634
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,250
So I think I'm qualified
to speak for

635
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,730
all the citizens of Dongping.

636
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,010
Thank you, you are

637
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,530
the backbone of Dongping,

638
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,420
bringing

639
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,730
the people here a new dawn of justice.

640
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,530
We once

641
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,330
made a promise together.

642
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,380
We hoped

643
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,530
Dongping could be freed

644
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,420
from the cancer of organized crime.

645
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,420
Now this promise has finally come true,

646
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,570
so I think it should be us

647
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,220
who blow out the candles.

648
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,220
Is it okay, leaders?

649
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,250
It's ok.

650
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,460
Good.

651
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,980
One, two, three.

652
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,010
Blow.

653
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:51,980
Good!

654
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,050
Drink up.

655
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,250
Impressive.

656
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,330
All right, leaders,

657
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,900
sorry to interrupt your meal.

658
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,490
Mr. Chen,

659
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,090
very thoughtful of you.

660
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,700
We'll take our leave now.

661
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,010
Okay.

662
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,460
Mr. Chen is really thoughtful.

663
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,730
Ms. Lan,

664
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,010
he's Chen Shenglong,
CEO of Tianlong Company.

665
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,620
He's been a strong supporter

666
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,900
of our work over the years.

667
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,660
Are you close to him?

668
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,940
The central government
has made it clear,

669
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,940
party and government officials
and entrepreneurs

670
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,330
need to maintain a clean
and honest relationship.

671
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,980
Do you all remember?

672
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,250
So, how do you know him?

673
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,770
I...

674
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,700
Is this place open to the public?

675
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,180
I suppose so...

676
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,860
Did you pay the bill?

677
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,570
They already handled it.

678
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,700
Take my cell phone.

679
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,490
Go settle the bill.

680
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,900
There's no need.

681
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,180
Don't worry about it...

682
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,290
I said go pay. Now!

683
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,570
Mom, put that light on the star!

684
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,570
I can't reach it.

685
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,570
Dad, aren't you gonna help out?

686
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,730
Grandpa, go.

687
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,530
You want Grandpa to do it?

688
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,570
Yes, please.

689
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,090
Come on, right there.

690
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,700
Okay.

691
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,980
Only granddaughter can get you moving.

692
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,420
A little higher.

693
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,900
Why are you so picky?

694
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,770
Showing off just because
it's your birthday.

695
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,700
You all spoil her too much.

696
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,530
Go find your dad.

697
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,660
Comrade Hong Liang,
can you contain your wife?

698
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,380
I can't live like this.

699
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,570
Mr. Jiang, the car just
pulled into the courtyard.

700
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,380
OK.

701
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,490
How was it?

702
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,940
Uncle's back, let's go.

703
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,090
Go.

704
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,000
[Jiang Yuan
Hong Liang's Brother-In-Law]

705
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,490
Auntie Wu.

706
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,170
Jiang Yuan, you're back!

707
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,130
Help me get my luggage.

708
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:38,900
So many things.

709
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,780
Hold this for me.

710
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,340
Uncle!

711
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,650
- Welcome!
- Wow.

712
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,900
Welcome home.

713
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,340
Dou,

714
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,010
- my dear niece.
- Welcome.

715
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,690
All that spoiling paid off, sweetheart.

716
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,010
Look what Uncle brought you.

717
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,570
Got you a present.

718
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,530
Thank you, uncle.

719
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,300
Do you like it?

720
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,940
Yes.

721
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,570
Open it, take a look.

722
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,130
Dad, here's a gift for you. Dad.

723
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,490
A whole set?

724
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,860
You like it?

725
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,530
Yeah.

726
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,900
Pop quiz,

727
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,900
what is this?

728
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,690
You bought it at the airport?

729
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,300
What airport?

730
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,610
I got this from a flea market
in the U.S.

731
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,740
Antique!

732
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,530
Guess which era.

733
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,780
Looks brand new.

734
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,940
You did it on purpose.

735
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,940
It's got an inscription.

736
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,380
From the Jiaqing period.
It's the real deal.

737
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,570
Okay, stop teasing me.

738
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,820
Whatever this is,

739
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,490
what matters is, you remembered to bring

740
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,340
this old man something.

741
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,980
Sister, you have one too.

742
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,300
We all have gifts?

743
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,380
Of course.

744
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:49,980
This one.

745
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,820
It was hard to find.

746
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,980
Took me forever.

747
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,980
An all-English edition

748
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,420
of Criminal Behavioral Psychology.

749
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,610
It includes all the FBI's cases

750
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,530
from the last ten years.

751
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,380
There's no new ones.

752
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,940
I couldn't get those.

753
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,740
But I can guarantee this older volume,

754
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,570
there's no second copy in all of China.

755
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,210
Awesome.

756
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,130
Like it?

757
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,650
Thank you.

758
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,170
Brother-in-law,

759
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,260
I've also got one for you.

760
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,130
There's one for you.

761
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,340
This cloth.

762
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:28,530
Congrats on starting
a new chapter in life.

763
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,050
I know you're used to
wearing prosecutor's uniform,

764
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,490
so I picked one

765
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,300
with a similar color and cut.

766
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,300
So when you wear it,

767
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,570
it'll feel like a smooth transition.

768
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,010
Thank you, Yuan.

769
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,570
Mr. Xudong,

770
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,490
can I try it on?

771
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,860
Go on.

772
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,780
Auntie Wu.

773
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,490
You have one too.

774
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,610
Today is my birthday.

775
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,210
Can I say a few words
before we start eating?

776
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,900
Don't get too excited, no.

777
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,210
Fine.

778
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,260
At the dinner,

779
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,170
Auntie said you invited
all these people.

780
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,420
I just mentioned it to Sun Fei.

781
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,300
I don't know why they're all here.

782
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,090
Insisted on celebrating your birthday.

783
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,690
I asked Zijian about the restaurant,

784
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,610
he recommended it to me.

785
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,820
Next thing I know,

786
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,050
I'm getting called out
like I'm crossing the line.

787
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,300
Why was she so difficult?

788
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,530
Wan Hai is innocent!

789
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,210
We're not a criminal organization!

790
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,570
This is all slander!

791
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,130
This case was incredibly complicated,

792
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,090
had all kinds of mixed-up clues.

793
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,490
It's understandable to make mistakes.

794
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,820
I'm talking to you.

795
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,940
Auntie's

796
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,690
always careful about these things.

797
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,460
Just try to understand her.

798
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,090
What were you thinking?

799
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,340
I'm just wondering...

800
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,490
Don't you find it all

801
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,210
a bit strange?

802
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,690
Look at the seating.

803
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,050
Xu Yanwu

804
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,130
was sitting below
Wen Qin and Sun Fei.

805
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,340
What kind of
seating arrangement is that?

806
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,170
Does that show how close Auntie is

807
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,490
to some people and not others?

808
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,860
You see, Mr. Xu

809
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,490
sat there.

810
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,050
Right?

811
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,900
And there was Xie Hongfei.

812
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,690
Seriously...

813
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,460
Totally unexpected.

814
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,170
Xie Hongfei made such a big mistake,

815
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,780
and now this meal just swept it

816
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,300
all under the rug.

817
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,820
Husband,

818
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,530
if you ask me,

819
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,490
you're about to become
the prosecutor-general,

820
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,570
you need to keep an eye
on those under you.

821
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,460
You don't really know
how deep these ties run.

822
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,650
Judging from today's dinner,

823
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,420
they seem pretty close.

824
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,260
And it's clearly not a new thing.

825
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,530
Still, no one could be closer to Auntie
than we are.

826
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,530
She is our aunt, after all.

827
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,570
I think Mr. Xu looks really shrewd,

828
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,570
low-key

829
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,650
but clearly has his own ideas.

830
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,490
But eating with this group of people,

831
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,170
it's exhausting.

832
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,420
Lean on me a bit.

833
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,340
How long do you plan to stay this time?

834
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,490
Probably a while.

835
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,740
There's a business opportunity
here in Haidong.

836
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,300
I'm thinking of starting something here.

837
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,980
Spend more time with you

838
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,380
and this old man.

839
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,460
What kind of business?

840
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:06,820
New energy.

841
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,170
Hasn't the window for new energy

842
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,210
already passed?

843
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,300
Passed?

844
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,340
Sis, you're underestimating it.

845
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,210
The new energy sector

846
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,210
is far from reaching its peak.

847
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,690
Just imagine

848
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,210
if every car in the world went electric,

849
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,260
how big would that pie be?

850
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,570
That's true.

851
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,860
But I don't know much about this field.

852
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,130
That's called not having enough IQ.

853
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:30,900
You...

854
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,780
Don't argue.

855
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,740
The smartest person in the family
is my brother-in-law.

856
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,610
Brother,

857
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,860
let's do business together in Beijing.

858
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,740
What business?

859
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,130
Doesn't matter what,

860
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,090
are you in or not?

861
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,940
Of course, I'm in.

862
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,130
Alright, then.

863
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,340
I really owe you one.

864
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,940
This job of mine,

865
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,460
always dragging things out,
never wrapping up.

866
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,340
So I haven't made it to Beijing yet.

867
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,010
They were about to take me off the list.

868
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,530
The position's saved for his sake.

869
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,460
Brother-in-law,

870
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,530
I've gotta give you a piece of my mind,

871
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,740
why are you so good

872
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,690
at everything?

873
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,260
They've been asking me for you.

874
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,980
If you don't go, they're gonna kill me.

875
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,980
No wonder you're a PhD,

876
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,900
a very good talker.

877
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,010
Anyway,

878
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,210
thank you.

879
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,650
Sincerely.

880
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,380
We're family...

881
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,420
Are you celebrating my birthday
or having a meeting?

882
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,860
Happy birthday to you.

883
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,940
Happy birthday to you.

884
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,900
Happy birthday to you.

885
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:39,380
Happy Birthday to Dou.

886
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,690
Make a wish.

887
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,170
Boss...

888
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,090
Come to Mr. Zhang's office
first thing tomorrow morning.

889
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:57,860
What's wrong?

890
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,940
Your resignation letter,
he's ready to sign it.

891
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,380
Okay.

892
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,530
Thank you.

893
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,050
See you tomorrow.

894
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,980
Come, blow out the candles.

895
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,980
Blow the candles.

896
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,740
Good.

897
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,130
Happy birthday.

898
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,050
Happy birthday.

899
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,860
What wish did you make?

900
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,260
I wished that Daddy
could go to Beijing soon,

901
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,050
and Grandpa could retire soon.

902
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,300
This way,

903
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,530
Grandpa can come with me to Beijing.

904
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:31,900
That's what you meant?

905
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,780
Then our whole family can be together.

906
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,860
What a sweet kid!

907
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,210
All right, Hong Liang.

908
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,380
I've signed off on your resignation.

909
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,050
Go to the Political Department
to complete the final steps.

910
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,420
What's the rush?

911
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:10,860
Please have a seat.

912
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,420
According to our rules

913
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,820
and procedures,

914
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,420
before you officially leave,

915
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,130
we need to have a conversation.

916
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,740
Any last requests work-wise?

917
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,170
Anything left unfinished?

918
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,090
Any suggestions for the organization?

919
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,740
You can tell me now.

920
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,570
Also,

921
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,780
is there anything

922
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,090
you personally need help with?

923
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,210
As long as it doesn't violate policy

924
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,610
or principles,

925
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,300
the organization will do what it can.

926
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,900
Lately I've noticed

927
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,260
there are certain,

928
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,610
well, a very few

929
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,740
of our leaders

930
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,570
who don't handle issues

931
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,650
'fast' enough.

932
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,570
Kind of dragging things out,

933
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,570
even holding up work.
