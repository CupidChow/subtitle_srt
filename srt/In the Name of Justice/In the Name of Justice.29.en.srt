1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,250
If the Wan Hai case
was really mishandled,

2
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,810
I'd be doomed.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,980
I think a storm is coming

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,850
for Dongping's
political and legal system.

5
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,170
This Task Force is coming in hard,

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,050
not just here to check a box.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,050
You mean

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,620
this isn't just a passing gust?

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,450
Each time, it seemed like
the sky was falling.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,690
Everyone thought
everything's gonna change.

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,260
But what happened?

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,050
Dongping

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,010
stayed the same.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,260
So what are you gonna do?

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,050
Come forward to the Task Force,

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,450
or

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,500
file a report?

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,410
Some people

19
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,860
just start blindly ratting others out

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,090
at the first sign of trouble.

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,640
[In the Name of Justice]

22
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,640
[Episode 29]

23
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,010
Talk to me.

24
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,410
Bro, you're carrying
three fake passports.

25
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,850
Where were you planning to go?

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,850
Hong Liang.

27
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,340
I...

28
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,890
was wrong.

29
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,820
I messed up.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,380
As a public official,

31
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,220
I shouldn't have

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,100
bought fake passports.

33
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,890
It was wrong. A clear violation.

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,380
I'll be honest with you.

35
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,450
I was planning to go to Hong Kong

36
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,060
to get some insurance

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,450
for my kid.

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,260
If I told the organization about this,

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,130
they'd never approve it.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,100
And I couldn't talk to anyone else
about it either.

41
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,380
But for today's matter,

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,100
I should probably thank you.

43
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,820
If you hadn't stopped me,

44
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,010
I would've made an even bigger mistake.

45
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,450
It would've gone way too far.

46
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,060
You're welcome.

47
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,500
We're even now.

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,450
I believe that you must also understand

49
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,890
that we didn't invite you here today

50
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,290
just because of
those three fake passports

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,170
or your attempt to
leave the country secretly.

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,220
A couple of days ago,

53
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,290
someone

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,130
sat exactly where you are now.

55
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,500
He named you.

56
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,010
And you know him well.

57
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,570
An old subordinate of yours.

58
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,410
His name is

59
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,660
Jiang Hongjun.

60
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,940
Say no more.

61
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,890
He threw me under the bus,

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,010
didn't he?

63
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,450
Let's put it this way,

64
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,820
if you hadn't had solid evidence,

65
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,730
you wouldn't have arrested him.

66
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,220
If he hadn't given me away,

67
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,010
you wouldn't have

68
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,610
brought me in.

69
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,220
But my question is, Hong Liang,

70
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,340
do you think

71
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,010
I'm that kind of person?

72
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,250
Mr. Jiang jumped me all the way

73
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,290
to my position today.

74
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,730
Other people might not know who I am,

75
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,700
but you do.

76
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,850
People in charge

77
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,610
are always one step ahead.

78
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,220
Mr. Jiang,
sorry to keep you waiting.

79
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,100
Fortunately, it doesn't matter

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,580
early or late.

81
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,140
We still got time to
enjoy the view together.

82
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,930
Sir,

83
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,140
how many years

84
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,170
has it been

85
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,730
since we parted ways in Dongping?

86
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,780
Maybe over ten years?

87
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,170
We've both aged.

88
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,850
Well, I've aged.

89
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,370
But you still

90
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,140
look sharp as ever.

91
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,580
Back then, I thought

92
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,700
we'd go our separate ways forever,

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,900
never crossing paths again.

94
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,490
Wheel never stops turning.

95
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,540
You know what that means?

96
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,050
Sir?

97
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,460
It means

98
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,020
we were always bound to meet again.

99
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,900
But no matter how the wheel turns,

100
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,850
a cat is still a cat,
and a rat is still a rat.

101
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,660
Mr. Yu.

102
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,020
When people get older,

103
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,490
they should accept it.

104
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,250
Every generation has
its own way of life

105
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,660
and its own fate.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,810
Let the kids

107
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,900
walk their own path.

108
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,900
I heard that

109
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,850
you got a manor,

110
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,700
raising horses and planting flowers,

111
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,100
living the good life.

112
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,980
That's the way to
enjoy your later years.

113
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,490
Be content and happy.

114
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,220
Yuan told you this, right?

115
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,610
Speaking of Jiang Hongjun,

116
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,220
he's actually a good kid at heart.

117
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,980
Very good.

118
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,850
I don't know if you still remember

119
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,170
the 829 case.

120
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,660
That criminal was wild back then.

121
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,700
With two homemade five-shot guns

122
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,220
and hundreds of rounds on him,

123
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,290
he shot it out with us.

124
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,170
I was leading the team that day.

125
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,490
I kicked the door open myself.

126
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,170
Bullets

127
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,540
were flying right past my ear.

128
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,900
And Jiang Hongjun

129
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,100
tackled the guy on the spot.

130
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,780
That's how he earned
his second-class merit.

131
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,700
We promoted him

132
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,020
to captain after that.

133
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,980
That is to say,

134
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,850
Mr. Sun, you think

135
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,050
really highly of him.

136
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,580
Back then, absolutely.

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,050
Then help us analyze it,

138
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,100
since you know him well,

139
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,250
what does it take

140
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,020
for a brilliant policeman like him

141
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,580
to end up

142
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,490
in this very seat you're in now?

143
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,020
This seat...

144
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,810
I'm not convicted yet.

145
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,610
Yes.

146
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,170
How did he get here?

147
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,020
Let me put it this way,

148
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,730
after he became

149
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,220
the captain,

150
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,850
he started forming

151
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,850
his own little circle.

152
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,780
His social network
got extremely complicated.

153
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,580
Honestly,

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,850
I wasn't really sure

155
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,660
who he's been spending time with

156
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,220
or what kind of circles
he's been involved in.

157
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,700
Got it.

158
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,020
So you're saying that the two of you

159
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,980
gradually had less private contact.

160
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,540
But still, you were

161
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,220
superior and subordinate

162
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,580
or we can say, close as brothers,

163
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,490
how could he

164
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:17,780
end up sitting here

165
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,850
and pointing you out?

166
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,020
I think maybe it's because

167
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,530
I became an obstacle on his way up.

168
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,060
How so?

169
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,130
When it came to
joining the Party committee,

170
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,580
I voted

171
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,820
against him several times.

172
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,460
Why?

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,180
Because he's too street-smart.

174
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,530
I thought he needed more tempering.

175
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,250
Of course, I told him this directly too.

176
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,180
I said, "You can't be so street-smart.

177
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,250
You're a public servant.

178
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,850
You're a law enforcer.

179
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,730
You can't always talk about
personal favors and connections."

180
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,770
Maybe because of these things,

181
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,220
he came to

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,420
resent me.

183
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,300
He even said that

184
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,130
it was me

185
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,180
who pulled him onto this ship.

186
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,820
And more than once.

187
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,010
That really pains me.

188
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,010
So from now on,

189
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,650
I won't respond to
any of Jiang Hongjun's accusations

190
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,060
against me.

191
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,490
Because they're all false.

192
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,130
Sir,

193
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,060
I know

194
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,300
why you asked

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,820
to see me

196
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,340
today.

197
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,220
Actually,

198
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,010
I haven't really been involved in much
these past few years.

199
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,820
The tree may wish to remain still,

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,010
but the wind will not cease.

201
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,770
Yu Tiancheng, don't play dumb with me.

202
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,490
If you really wanted to retire,

203
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,580
you wouldn't have stayed just
because of a few words from Jiang Yuan.

204
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,700
You think I don't know
what kind of person you are?

205
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,130
For 50% profit,

206
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,340
you'd already dare to take risks.

207
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,650
If it's for 100% profit,

208
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,300
you'll be riding roughshod over the law.

209
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,010
And now for that copper-nickel mine,

210
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,980
you've killed and set fire.

211
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,820
But let me remind you,

212
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,060
this isn't ten years ago.

213
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,340
Party discipline and national law
are not to be violated.

214
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,220
If you try those tricks again,

215
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,370
I believe

216
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,530
you'll lose everything.

217
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,370
And you want to drag my family

218
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,980
down with you again?

219
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,300
Dad!

220
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,700
I did something bad!

221
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,420
I did something bad, Dad!

222
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,580
I hit someone with my car
and killed them.

223
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,460
What should I do?

224
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,250
You bastard!

225
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,420
Where did you get the car?

226
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,250
Dad...

227
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,730
Who let you drive?

228
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,820
Hello?

229
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,490
This is Yu Tiancheng.

230
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,850
Your son hit and killed someone.

231
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,770
He's drunk.

232
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:27,980
Unlicensed.

233
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,730
And killed someone.

234
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,700
Mr. Jiang,

235
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,730
this should be
at least seven years in prison.

236
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,650
We are now on Pingnan Avenue.

237
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,130
Come now

238
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,250
before I call the police.

239
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,180
Come here now, Mr. Jiang.

240
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,130
We can say

241
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,300
I'm the one who hit the person.

242
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,850
Yu Tiancheng,

243
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,420
I didn't expect you to
rack your brains so much

244
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,730
and target Jiang Yuan in the end.

245
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,130
Have you thought about the consequences?

246
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,130
What?

247
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,340
Mr. Jiang,

248
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,420
don't you care about
your own son's consequences?

249
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,820
You'll understand once you get here.

250
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,130
Mr. Jiang.

251
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,180
According to investigation,

252
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,820
the driver of the accident vehicle
wasn't Jiang Yuan.

253
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,130
You can take him home now.

254
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,300
We'll need him to come back later
for a statement.

255
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,610
Sister.

256
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:41,890
Slowly.

257
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,850
Sir,

258
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,850
what new energy?

259
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,180
How could an old man like me
understand any of that?

260
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,300
Yuan is knowledgeable

261
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,220
and ambitious.

262
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,700
He wants to make something of himself.

263
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,420
I'm really

264
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,530
just accompanying him.

265
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,650
Also, that Wan Hai case

266
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,820
isn't something
that I could ever come up with,

267
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,890
even if I rack my brains.

268
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,250
I know my son.

269
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,730
If it weren't for you
fanning the flames behind him,

270
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,060
would he have done all that?

271
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,650
You used him!

272
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,980
Okay, Mr. Yu.

273
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,940
What exactly do you want me to do

274
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,700
to let Jiang Yuan go,

275
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,490
to let my family go?

276
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,180
Sir,

277
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,300
who's letting who go here?

278
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,820
That mine was mine to begin with.

279
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,060
Things have gotten to this point,

280
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,010
none of us can stop now.

281
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,580
Me and my students,

282
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,220
including you,

283
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,700
have already been dragged into this.

284
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,420
And it was your Jiang Yuan

285
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,060
who dragged us all in.

286
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,730
Wasn't it?

287
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,100
Let me tell you the truth.

288
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,650
Jiang Yuan

289
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,130
started planning

290
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,180
three years ago.

291
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,250
Do you really

292
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,250
know your son?

293
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,370
We can't stop halfway up the mountain.

294
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,650
Come on,

295
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,850
let's keep climbing.

296
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,640
[Vigilance ensures safety,
Negligence causes accidents.]

297
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,340
Mr. Jiang.

298
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,980
You really are ruthless.

299
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,460
Are you kicking me
out of Dongping like this?

300
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,770
You don't have to accept it.

301
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,300
But you'd better understand

302
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,100
I'm the only one
who can help you with this.

303
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,610
Or you're a murderer.

304
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,130
Prison or leaving Dongping,

305
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,130
you choose.

306
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,060
I will accept it.

307
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,700
But you have to

308
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,010
do me one more favor.

309
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,100
Don't push your luck.

310
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,130
The shooter's name is Wang Dayou.

311
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,940
He's like a son to me.

312
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,820
You have to help me get him out.

313
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,820
Then,

314
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,490
I'll leave Dongping right away.

315
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,700
Jingming called and said

316
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,810
she wants to report on
Dongping's political and legal affairs.

317
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,220
And I invited Zhang Fang to join us.

318
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,860
Then let me start now.

319
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,980
Dongping has had
one issue after another,

320
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,420
causing a lot of troubles
for the organization.

321
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,980
A few days ago,
I was acting out of urgency

322
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,140
and called Mr. Zhang and the Secretary.

323
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,460
One reason was
to understand the situation,

324
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,530
and another was to
better cooperate with the investigation.

325
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,010
It was a little abrupt.

326
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,620
Then another emergency
came up a few days ago,

327
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,420
and as a subordinate,

328
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,900
I really couldn't sit still anymore.

329
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,940
I had to come directly
to you two for guidance.

330
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,810
Jingming,

331
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,810
I understand how you feel.

332
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,140
The situation is extremely serious now.

333
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,900
If you're still unresponsive,

334
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,380
then even if you didn't come to me,
I'd be coming to you.

335
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,530
Given the current situation in Dongping,

336
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,900
the Provincial Commission
has already formed a Task Force.

337
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,730
And the team has been
stationed for a few days now,

338
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,140
which you already know.

339
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:22,980
So,

340
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,490
I hope all of you

341
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,330
can raise your political awareness,

342
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,090
put aside your personal interests,

343
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,050
strictly follow
investigative discipline,

344
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,980
and fully cooperate with the Task Force.

345
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,490
Ms. Lan,

346
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,290
not informing you of the earlier work

347
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,490
was due to organizational decisions

348
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,810
and the needs of the investigation.

349
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,330
The Task Force

350
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,050
has already taken coercive measures
against two officials

351
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,700
in the public security system.

352
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,330
The case is still under further review.

353
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,250
I understand.

354
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,530
We've prioritized
cadre team construction

355
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,860
as required by central
and provincial authorities,

356
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,810
especially since
the 18th CPC National Congress,

357
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,620
tightening management
and enforcing stricter discipline

358
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,770
with high standards,

359
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,220
but many problems still occurred.

360
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,770
That is a dereliction of duty
on my part.

361
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,700
I will report and reflect
to the Municipal Party Committee.

362
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,380
Going forward,

363
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,940
I will fully cooperate
with the Task Force.

364
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,810
Jingming,

365
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,380
I'm glad to see this attitude from you.

366
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,700
I believe our efforts this time

367
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,810
will surely succeed.

368
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,290
Problems with work style tend to recur,

369
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,490
so

370
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,660
we must follow the central directives,

371
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,140
put discipline first,

372
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,050
and stay committed for the long haul.

373
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,860
Let's work together.

374
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,810
Following the lead from Cheng Zijian,

375
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,220
we dug up all the information

376
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,660
on Chen Shenglong and Tianlong Company.

377
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,620
Currently, Tianlong Company

378
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,770
is the leading large enterprise
in Dongping.

379
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,860
Recently, it's also moved into
the new energy sector.

380
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,770
That brought it into contact with

381
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,180
Wanchuan Mining.

382
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,140
How so?

383
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,810
Tianlong Company
wanted to buy Wanchuan Mining.

384
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,220
At that time,

385
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,380
Liu Yun, deputy director
of the Managing Committee,

386
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,090
even took them for a site visit.

387
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,290
But the deal didn't go through.

388
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,330
When was it?

389
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,010
Right before our Task Force arrived.

390
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,900
Before the mine accident.

391
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,180
Go on.

392
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,460
Fifteen years ago,

393
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,330
he served a one-year sentence

394
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,420
for a traffic accident.

395
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,530
After he got out,

396
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,220
he joined a company

397
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,180
called Dacheng Mining

398
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,220
as a business manager.

399
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,810
Two years later,
he established Tianlong Company.

400
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,900
That's a pretty fast rise.

401
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,980
And nothing unusual about his company?

402
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,620
When it was founded,

403
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,380
the registered capital
was 100 million yuan.

404
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,530
But our investigation shows that

405
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,570
no other companies invested in it.

406
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,860
The full amount was provided

407
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,330
by Chen Shenglong himself.

408
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,810
With no education, no background,

409
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,940
he built it all from scratch?

410
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,700
That's not all.

411
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,380
Tianlong Company

412
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,530
has always been involved in

413
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,290
real estate development
and urban renewal in Dongping.

414
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,010
Many well-known residential buildings

415
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,420
in the city

416
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,940
were built by them.

417
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,420
In particular,

418
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,770
their Dadu Xishan project

419
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,980
is currently the most upscale
residential complex in Dongping.

420
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,050
Isn't that the place

421
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,620
you visited before?

422
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,220
So we conducted
an in-depth investigation

423
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,730
into Dadu Xishan as well.

424
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,770
We found that

425
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,250
many judicial personnel in Dongping

426
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,700

427
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,570

00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,860
but the property is
under his wife Liu Yun's name.

432
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,570
Mr. Chen

433
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,140
really seems to care a lot
about Dongping's leadership.

434
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,250
He's basically building them
a relatives' courtyard.

435

Mr. Yan has informed Dongping's
Political and Legal Affairs Committee

447

about the Task Force.

00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,050
Dongping's had its share
of storms over the years.

529
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,290

the sky was falling.

everything's gonna change.

But this time, I feel

537
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,770
Dongping can't stay the same anymore.

538
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,530

fixed at the source long ago.

Anyway, I just wanted to

540
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,090
outline the possibilities for you.

541
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,420

564
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,490
Good timing.

565
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,490
Let me report to Xudong first.

566
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,180
Back when we were
part of the Guidance Group,

567
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,770
working in Dongping,

568
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:03,940
Ms. Lan

569
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,940
invited us to dinner.

570
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,940
I privately thought

571
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,330
she did it

572
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,570
because I was in the team.

573
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:12,860
At dinner,

574
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,090
the first thing she said

575
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,330
was to ask about you.

576
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,700
She really cares about you.

577
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,770
It was heartwarming.

578
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,700
Mr. Jiang helped me a lot.

579
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,700
It's only right.

580
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,770
I should learn from you.

581
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,250
All right.

582
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,250
Just sit down.

583
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:26,940
Okay.

584
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,660
I saw Mr. Yan today.

585
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,250
He told me to cooperate with you.

586
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,090
I haven't returned to Dongping yet,

587
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,940
and just

588
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,810
bumped into Hong Liang like this.

589
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,010
So now I'm here both
personally and officially

590
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,090
reporting to you.

591
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,330
Oh, I wouldn't dare.

592
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,940
Feel free to speak.

593
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,090
If there's anything I can help with
at work,

594
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,180
just let me know anytime.

595
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,900
And for our work in Dongping,

596
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,570
we hope you'll offer guidance

597
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,420
and support.

598
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,140
Thank you for your support.

599
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,940
The leaders

600
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,460
asked for our cooperation,

601
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,620
and I hope

602
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,250
we two

603
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,770
can first establish

604
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,940
more communication,

605
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,250
understand each other better,

606
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,420
support each other's work,

607
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,570
bring out

608
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,180
the full enthusiasm from both sides,

609
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,330
so that we can better

610
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,010
fulfill the task entrusted to us.

611
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,330
Understood.

612
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,490
But Hong Liang, to tell you the truth,

613
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,380
I'm not confident right now.

614
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,620
I don't know

615
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,220
how I can precisely support your work.

616
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:38,860
I...

617
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,010
Mr. Jiang, take the Wan Hai case.

618
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,090
First, I don't know what mistake
we made.

619
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,420
Was the handling of the accident

620
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,980
also problematic?

621
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,530
I'm even not so clear about
the situation with Sun Fei.

622
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,010
Do you think I'm that kind of person?

623
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,290
Mr. Jiang jumped me all the way

624
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,290
to my position today.

625
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,770
Other people might not know who I am,

626
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,620
but you do.

627
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,050
As for Dongping's situation,

628
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,980
sir, Hong Liang, you know it too.

629
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,220
We don't have many resources.

630
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,330
And it's an old industrial city.

631
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,050
So industrial transition
has always been its weakness.

632
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,770
You can even say

633
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,900
we were almost hopeless.

634
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,730
But this copper-nickel mine

635
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,660
brought us new opportunities.

636
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,290
Next month,

637
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,770
Mr. Wang plans to hold

638
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,330
a new energy investment conference.

639
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,010
That's good.

640
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,140
Yes, preparations are in full swing.

641
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,180
Then a call came in,

642
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,010
asking that

643
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,290
"Dongping's had
quite some scandals recently,

644
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,290
is it still ok to invest?"

645
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,380
So,

646
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,810
now the leaders are anxious.

647
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,420
They want me to give an explanation.

648
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,530
I'm desperate.

649
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,860
So I can only come to
Mr. Jiang for help.

650
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,620
Mr. Yu.

651
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,810
This Task Force is
stirring things up big time.

652
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,770
The whole of Dongping is on edge.

653
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,620
I think

654
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,980
we need to consider a backup plan.

655
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,660
If we turn them in now,

656
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,620
and the Task Force really
digs something out of them,

657
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,570
at least they'll be already gone.

658
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,380
What do you mean?

659
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,140
You want someone to take the blame?

660
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,380
Then these people

661
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,010
might never come back.

662
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,140
I'm just saying in case.

663
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,570
We need a fallback.

664
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,860
What if things really go south,

665
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,090
and we can't get out?

666
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,180
Listen closely.

667
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,700
These people have been
with me for years.

668
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,220
Don't you start telling me what to do.

669
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,900
I wasn't trying to.

670
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,050
But if he really gets arrested,

671
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,810
are you sure he won't name you?

672
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:53,900
I know.

673
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,980
You treat them like your students,

674
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,530
but do they treat you as the teacher?

675
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,490
Have you forgotten

676
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,220
how he challenged you?

677
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,490
Did he show any loyalty to you then?

678
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,940
Mr. Yu,

679
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,140
we can't afford to be soft now.

680
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,490
When it's time to cut, cut.

681
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:12,730
And how do we cut?

682
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,980
Which part can be cut?

683
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,140
Who can we cut ties with?

684
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,460
Don't try to fan the flames with me.

685
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,250
Do you know

686
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,730
my relationship with these people?

687
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,090
Jingming.

688
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,330
I

689
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,940
understand how you're feeling now.

690
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,180
However, Hong Liang

691
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,530
is the deputy leader of the Task Force.

692
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,140
There are many things
he can't decide on his own.

693
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,220
Right.

694
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,530
But no matter what,

695
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,660
our goal is still the same.

696
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,770
To create a good business environment

697
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,010
in Dongping,

698
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,050
clean up the society,

699
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,980
and safeguard the city's
economic and social

700
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,900
development.

701
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,010
Jingming,

702
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,010
let me remind you that

703
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,940
the more turbulent the situation is,

704
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,420
the more we must remain calm.

705
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,980
Trust your colleagues,

706
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,570
avoid using this as an excuse

707
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,460
for personal revenge

708
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,860
or mutual accusations.

709
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,940
Some people

710
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,460
just start blindly ratting others out

711
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,730
at the first sign of trouble.

712
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,570
All just to protect themselves, right?

713
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,420
We've seen plenty of that before.

714
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,620
Hong Liang,

715
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,140
Ms. Lan

716
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,770
is your former leader

717
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,010
and senior.

718
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,090
she watched you grow up.

719
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,380
She's basically

720
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,900
your family in Dongping.

721
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:47,700
Yes.

722
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,220
Right?

723
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,620
So in the future, if anything happens,

724
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,010
you should

725
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,140
consult her more, report to her,

726
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,770
and support her work.

727
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,980
I'll do my best.

728
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,300
Hong Liang,
you must be tired coming back.

729
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,530
Go get some rest.

730
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:15,980
It's alright.

731
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,820
I'm gonna leave now,

732
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,490
okay, goodbye, sir.

733
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,570
Okay, Hong Liang.

734
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:19,900
I...

735
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,690
Min's waiting for you.

736
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,260
All right.

737
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:21,780
Okay.

738
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,170
Go. I'll walk Ms. Lan out.

739
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,610
Go on.

740
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,210
Okay.

741
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,010
No need to see me off, sir.

742
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,740
Let's go.

743
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,530
You go handle your stuff.

744
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,610
Don't come out.

745
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,170
You should put on another layer.

746
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,610
Okay.

747
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,490
Okay.

748
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,300
Hong Liang, bye, then.

749
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,780
Go home safe.

750
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,420
Goodbye.

751
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,780
Don't...

752
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,690
Jingming.

753
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,380
This time,

754
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,300
the situation is complicated,

755
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,650
I'm afraid I can't help you.

756
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,210
I might even

757
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,900
cause you trouble.

758
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,210
Don't say that.

759
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,860
How could you cause me trouble?

760
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,900
If anything, I'm the one troubling you.

761
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,050
To be honest,

762
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,740
I think a storm is coming

763
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,380
for Dongping's
political and legal system.

764
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,050
Two have already been taken in.

765
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,530
I don't dare imagine

766
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,820
who might be next.

767
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,210
If the Wan Hai case
was really mishandled,

768
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,820
I'd be doomed.

769
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,490
But you

770
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,460
mustn't panic
just because of the rumors.

771
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,090
You need to

772
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,530
hold the line, unite everyone,

773
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,940
and not be

774
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,900
too pessimistic.

775
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,380
I'll take my leave now.

776
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,210
This is Yuan.

777
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,740
Auntie Lan.

778
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,170
Jiang Yuan.

779
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,300
Are you leaving?

780
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,050
Yes.

781
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,210
I just had something
to report to Xudong.

782
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,980
You've grown into a fine young man.

783
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,010
I've spoken to Liu Yun
about your project.

784
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,570
Just go talk to her.

785
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,530
Thank you, Auntie.

786
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,010
Yun is very kind to me.

787
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,650
Don't bother Auntie Lan.

788
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,050
It's no trouble.

789
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,010
I'm happy to see its success.

790
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,340
His project is excellent.

791
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,820
If it goes through,

792
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,900
it'll be a great thing for Dongping.

793
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,690
Okay, it's getting late.

794
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,490
You still have to get back to Dongping.

795
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,900
Tell the driver to be careful.

796
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,210
Okay.

797
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,780
Stay safe.

798
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,860
Okay, goodbye.

799
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,460
- Okay.
- Bye.

800
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,130
Bye, Auntie.

801
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,050
Jiang Yuan.

802
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,740
I need to have a few words with you.

803
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,490
Still mad at me?

804
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,740
All right.

805
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,050
I was being irrational that day.

806
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,130
I apologize.

807
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:22,980
You don't have to.

808
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,740
It's all over.

809
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,010
Jiang Yuan.

810
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,820
I'm worried about you the most now.

811
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,460
I haven't felt this way for a long time.

812
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,690
I remember

813
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,820
the last time was the year
your mother passed away.

814
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,650
I was doing a temporary assignment
in the county,

815
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,650
overwhelmed with work.

816
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,380
After her funeral,

817
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,820
I returned to the county
that same night.

818
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,940
Just two days later,

819
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,210
your sister called

820
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,690
and said you refused to go to school.

821
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,420
I didn't have time to come back.

822
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,690
I was so anxious

823
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,010
that I couldn't sleep every night.

824
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:11,740
Dad.

825
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,530
I'm grown up now.

826
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,130
You don't need to
worry about me anymore.

827
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,420
I am sleepy.

828
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,460
Let's go to sleep.

829
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,170
Dad.

830
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,460
Are you gonna tell me
not to go to Dongping again?

831
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,570
You have to believe

832
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,300
everything I say

833
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,980
is for your own good.

834
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,490
Don't do good to me,

835
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,980
stop doing things "for me", okay?

836
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,570
Be honest with yourself.

837
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,170
You're doing this for you.

838
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,300
For your own reputation...

839
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,820
If you really care about me,

840
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,300
then think from my perspective.

841
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,090
Just because I'm your son,

842
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,690
I can't start a business in Dongping?

843
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,780
Isn't that ridiculous?

844
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,490
This is...

845
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,420
I don't want to argue with you.

846
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,650
Let's drop this now.

847
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,260
Okay?

848
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,490
Let me get you some water.

849
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,980
Let's both calm down.

850
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,300
Okay?

851
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,530
No need for water.

852
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,610
Can you sit down?

853
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,130
I know

854
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,300
I wasn't there

855
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,530
for you

856
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,420
growing up.

857
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,380
But seeing what you've achieved,

858
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,610
I'm proud.

859
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,530
You've got talent and good education.

860
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,210
I believe

861
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,300
you can succeed anywhere.

862
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,090
But again,

863
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,740
you can't go to Dongping.

864
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:48,900
Dad.

865
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,940
We have invested
hundreds of millions there.

866
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,460
It's not something I can stop.

867
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,860
It's not just about money anymore.

868
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,980
There's still a chance
if you pull out now.

869
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,490
Otherwise...

870
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,780
Why should I pull out?

871
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,530
I'm running a legitimate business.

872
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,820
What do I have to back out from?

873
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,610
Have I done anything immoral?

874
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,980
Do you know how serious
things are in Dongping now?

875
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,090
Do I need to?

876
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,530
A Task Force
is investigating Dongping.

877
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,090
Don't get involved in this mess, okay?

878
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,340
Yuan, you're back.

879
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,210
Go to bed early.

880
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,860
Tough day, huh?

881
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,610
There's more in the fridge, want some?

882
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,380
I used the machine gun.

883
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,340
You, come help me.

884
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:42,740
Took it.

885
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,210
Number three...

886
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,260
Come and help me.

887
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,300
Help me out.

888
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:49,690
Where are you?

889
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,820
Where are you? Come on.

890
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,090
Why don't you come?

891
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,490
Handling cases
is about having enough evidence

892
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,860
to prove legal truth.

893
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,570
As long as the facts are not clear

894
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,380
The facts are not clear for a day

895
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,170
and the evidence is not conclusive,

896
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,300
the Wan Hai case cannot be prosecuted.

897
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,340
If Wang Yu's problematic,

898
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,780
this whole Wan Hai case falls apart.

899
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,690
It doesn't matter
what happens to Xie Hongfei.

900
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,460
It doesn't matter
what happens to Qiao Zhenxing.

901
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,090
What matters most to you
is the Wan Hai case.

902
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,490
Because once that case is wrapped up,

903
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,980
hat "acting" title gets removed.

904
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,650
You'll be Prosecutor-General
Li Renjun.

905
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,690
You *bastard!

906
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,570
it's because you handled
the Wan Hai case so well

907
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,380
that you were brought into the circle.

908
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,460
What does Eleventh Division
of the provincial office do?

909
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,740
They're all here.

910
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,130
Isn't it obvious
what they're investigating?

911
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,530
Don't betray me.

912
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,900
Why do you betray me again?

913
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:37,900
Here's more.

914
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,900
I could have hit someone.

915
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,860
Sun Da, don't betray me.

916
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,210
I got a high score in the exam today.

917
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,940
Mom said

918
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,900
I get to play an extra hour tonight.

919
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,860
Nice. You did well.

920
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:00,980
You bet I did.

921
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,610
Here, try this. It's really good.

922
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,570
Always showing off
when people praise you.

923
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,570
Son,

924
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,130
let me ask you something.

925
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,130
Let's imagine, if

926
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,820
a few

927
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,010
of your best friends in class

928
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,090
sneaked into the teacher's office

929
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,570
and peeked at the test questions.

930
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,530
You weren't part of it,

931
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,460
and they didn't tell you either,

932
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,740
but

933
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,090
they gave you

934
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,650
a hint,

935
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,170
told you a few important questions.

936
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,570
So you ended up scoring high.

937
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,300
And later, you found out
what really happened.

938
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,610
Would you tell the teacher?

939
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,320
