25
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,585
Father,

26
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:08,825
I found Moshang.

27
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:10,704
This is great.

28
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:13,544
The Dragon God
has blessed the sanctuary.

29
00:02:13,545 --> 00:02:14,345
Where is he?

30
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:15,424
Where is he now?

31
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:16,826
Why hasn't he returned?

32
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:18,400
At the Feng family in the mortal realm.

33
00:02:18,865 --> 00:02:20,465
When I found him,

34
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:22,065
I realized

35
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:25,826
his sigil was on a bumpkin's hand.

36
00:02:26,186 --> 00:02:28,785
How did it land on a bumpkin?

37
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:29,864
I know

38
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:32,065
the importance of the sigil to Moshang.

39
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:33,745
I wanted to take it back,

40
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:35,865
but Moshang

41
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:37,826
recklessly revealed

42
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:39,865
his dragon lineage in front of everyone

43
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:42,546
to protect that bumpkin.

44
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:46,865
Sentimental fool!

45
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:48,544
No matter his reasons,

46
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:50,465
how will he protect himself

47
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,905
against the Demons without it?

48
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:56,305
Father,

49
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:57,345
I can't just stand by

50
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:59,065
and watch Moshang continue this mistake.

51
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,146
Please ask him to return.

52
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:09,185
Is there something else
you're not telling me?

53
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,464
I found out

54
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:17,424
that Moshang has confessed

55
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:18,945
to that bumpkin,

56
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:20,465
and they are living together.

57
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:23,226
Summon him.

58
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:24,666
I want him to return now.

59
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:26,625
He owes me an explanation!

60
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:27,745
Yes.

61
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:31,105
Mr. Lenghou,

62
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:32,785
what has brought you here?

63
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:35,400
(Lenghou Ye, Head of Lenghou Family)
Feng Zhilou developed a spiritual root.

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,744
And with the Feng family's
unique medical skills she knows,

65
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:39,704
her engagement with my son
should proceed.

66
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:40,505
We can hold it

67
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:41,864
in three days.

68
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:43,345
What do you think?

69
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:48,785
Mr. Lenghou,
I'm sure you've already heard.

70
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:52,105
I have no right to decide

71
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,625
who Feng Zhilou wants to marry.

72
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:55,706
That's ridiculous.

73
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:58,785
The alliance between our families

74
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:00,426
isn't a joke.

75
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:02,226
It seems you're set

76
00:04:02,305 --> 00:04:04,506
on calling off the engagement, Mr. Feng.

77
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:08,065
Yunqiao is the family's heiress.

78
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,584
She's no physician but a decent fighter.

79
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,905
There is mutual affection
between you and her.

80
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:15,385
Why not change the engagement?

81
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:16,264
This way,

82
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:18,024
both families

83
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,225
will still benefit.

84
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,385
Feng Qingfeng,

85
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:22,305
are you joking with me?

86
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:23,985
The engagement

87
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,946
can't be changed on a whim!

88
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,386
Lenghou Zong!

89
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:29,985
You...

90
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:32,225
You jerk!

91
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,905
Was that promise all a joke to you?

92
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:36,344
I'm telling you.

93
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:37,745
If you wrong me,

94
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:39,946
I'll kill you today!

95
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:44,506
Feng Yunqiao,

96
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,465
have you no dignity?

97
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:48,505
It's a marriage alliance.

98
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:49,825
Of course we'd pick the woman

99
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,505
who will bring the greatest benefit.

100
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:52,505
You...

101
00:04:52,506 --> 00:04:54,465
You honestly think
you're in that league?

102
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:56,066
Mr. Lenghou,

103
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:58,425
one mustn't be too harsh
in their dealings.

104
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:00,345
So what if we are?

105
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,104
Don't you know

106
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,305
the weight your family carries?

107
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:06,425
I'm just here to notify you today.

108
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:14,946
Father.

109
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:19,266
You're so useless.

110
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:26,306
It seems a storm is brewing above us.

111
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:29,425
So...

112
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:31,024
you both are his subordinates?

113
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,465
- Are you part of the Dragons too?
- Of course.

114
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:35,266
Are you dragons too?

115
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:36,746
They are birds.

116
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:38,826
They serve the Dragons.

117
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:41,290
But not anyone can hope
to serve Young Master even if they want to.

118
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,266
The competition is intense.

119
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:49,425
Do the Dragons

120
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:50,866
have meals?

121
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:51,865
When you eat,

122
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:54,280
is it the same as us?
Food cooked in a big pot over firewood.

123
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,344
Do you eat rice?

124
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:56,905
Or do you not eat at all?

125
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:58,905
Do you sleep too?

126
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:00,545
Where do you sleep?

127
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:02,224
Do you sleep on a bed?

128
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:03,264
That's not right.

129
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:05,345
There probably aren't beds underwater.

130
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:06,904
Do you still need to drink water

131
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:08,186
since you live underwater?

132
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:11,144
I have one more important question.

133
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:12,746
Why do you have so many questions?

134
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:17,065
Do you hear all of our prayers to you?

135
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,985
With so many people praying,

136
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:19,945
can you remember them

137
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,024
and finish answering them?

138
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:22,144
Also.

139
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:23,224
Do you get to eat

140
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:24,425
the fruit offerings I brought?

141
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,225
I spent a lot on them.

142
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:39,305
I'm so amazing.

143
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:42,066
I'm actually hanging out
with three dragons.

144
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:47,105
Young Master actually smiled.

145
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:48,866
He's never smiled before.

146
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:53,186
I have an even more important question!

147
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:57,584
I heard the Dragon Prince

148
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,506
often slay demons and monsters.

149
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,224
Tell me.

150
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:02,425
Will I get the chance

151
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:04,464
to fight beside him?

152
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,905
That has been my biggest dream
since I was young.

153
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:08,866
Your dream is grand.

154
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:10,144
Miss Zhilou,

155
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:11,585
let's talk about business.

156
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:13,104
The sigil on your hand

157
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:16,425
was forged using Young Master's
reverse scale over 81 days and nights.

158
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:17,464
If it sustains any damage,

159
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:18,385
our Young Master

160
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:19,706
will suffer unpredictable harm.

161
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:21,826
So we can't leave now.

162
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:24,626
We must protect the sigil
and ensure it remains intact.

163
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:26,825
What should I do then?

164
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:27,305
You...

165
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:28,784
Every time I touch you,

166
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:30,865
my Yang poison seems to ease a little.

167
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:32,146
So from now on,

168
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:34,985
you must stay by my side at all times.

169
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:38,506
I have an idea.

170
00:07:38,546 --> 00:07:39,306
What is it?

171
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:43,905
It's what I told you before.

172
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:45,746
Fake a marriage with me.

173
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,706
Take me away from the Feng family.

174
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:50,105
We'll find an expert
to remove the sigil.

175
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:52,025
I swear.

176
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,224
Before the sigil is returned to you,

177
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:55,784
I won't leave your side
even for a second.

178
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:57,386
Is this the only way?

179
00:07:57,986 --> 00:07:58,904
Miss Zhilou,

180
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:00,385
the marriage isn't happening no matter

181
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:01,306
if it's real or fake.

182
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:05,264
Outsiders won't know

183
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:06,985
it's a fake marriage.

184
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,826
They'll think you've married me.

185
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:10,465
This isn't a small matter

186
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:11,826
for women.

187
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:14,585
I cannot agree to such

188
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,104
an irresponsible matter.

189
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:17,545
Yes.

190
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:19,105
You're right.

191
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:21,545
But I...

192
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:26,866
I was foolish.

193
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:29,025
I'll think of something else.

194
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:39,226
That darn Feng Zhilou!

195
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:46,584
Such a small matter.

196
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,425
Why are you so angry over it?

197
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:51,905
Who are you?

198
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,266
Who let you in?

199
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:59,586
Do you want revenge
on Feng Zhilou's wild man?

200
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:02,425
I can help you?

201
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:05,425
You, of all people?

202
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:12,586
He's got the Yang poison.

203
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:14,586
I can lend you a hand.

204
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:28,226
Zhilou.

205
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:31,506
Zhilou.

206
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:38,545
Zhilou.

207
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:40,145
What is it?

208
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,945
You said you wanted to leave.

209
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:43,945
Is it because you found someone
you want to marry?

210
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:46,545
Was it the man in your room?

211
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:53,665
Was it the man in your room?

212
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:56,866
How far have things progressed
between you two?

213
00:09:58,426 --> 00:09:59,506
Uncle Qingyun.

214
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:25,586
So what if you're a dragon?

215
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:28,586
You're kneeling before me right now.

216
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:33,425
Chu Moshang.

217
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:35,626
If you beg me now,

218
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:37,825
perhaps I'll be nice

219
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:39,986
and spare your life

220
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:41,626
Beg me.

221
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:43,825
Beg me!

222
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:46,905
Chu Moshang.

223
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:49,386
Beg me.

224
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:12,346
What does this mean?

225
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:17,506
Is Chu Moshang in danger?

226
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:27,665
Chu Moshang!

227
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:35,628
(The sigil allows me
to sense his location.)

228
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:37,106
He should be nearby.

229
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:39,466
Chu Moshang!

230
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:52,586
Chu Moshang!

Don't be scared.

234
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:16,504
I'm fine.

235
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:17,185
I'm not.

236
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,266
We have the sigil.

237
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:19,864
He came prepared.

238
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,145
I'm severely wounded.

239
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:23,984
The sigil might not last long.
You need to leave now.

240
00:12:23,985 --> 00:12:24,824
Stop talking nonsense.

241
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:27,866
I can't keep having you protect me only.

No wonder Young Master
could survive for so long.

254
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,665
She has...

255
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:22,065
Extreme Yin body.

256
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,224
There's extreme Yin energy in her body.

257
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:25,945
That's the best counter
to the Yang poison.

258
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:28,305
She is Young Master's antidote.

259
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,266
What do you mean?

260
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:41,226
I willingly submit to the will
of the Wujing Saintess.

00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,305
I heed your summoning.

262

Hear my call.

00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:47,386
I will come to you.

What...

265
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:03,905
What is this place?

266
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,624
The space in the sigil.

267
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,785
Canglong Pavilion.

268
00:15:06,985 --> 00:15:08,106
This...

269
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:11,506
is the space within the sigil?

270
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:15,545
How did I get in?

271
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:18,386
The sigil merged with you.

272
00:15:18,426 --> 00:15:21,305
It seems to also create
a connection between our souls.

273
00:15:22,026 --> 00:15:23,945
Soul connection?

274
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:26,146
Just like in the legends

275
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,146
where the Saintess
fought alongside the Dragons

276
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:30,545
and sealed a life-and-death soul pact?

277
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:32,825
I don't know
if it's a life-and-death pact.

278
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:34,624
The sigil

279
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,466
still holds many secrets I don't know.

280
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:38,586
But this...

281
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,425
was my private space.
