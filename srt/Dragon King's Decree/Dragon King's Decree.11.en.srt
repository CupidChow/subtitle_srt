This place...

26
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:06,139
I feel like I've been here before.

27
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:10,059
Maybe it was in that illusion.

28
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,618
Who's there?

29
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:15,779
Why are you sneaking around?

30
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:18,859
Zhilou?

31
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,980
Uncle Qingyun?

32
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:21,979
I finally found you.

33
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,099
Where did you go?

34
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,058
Are you alright?

35
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,259
Did you get hurt?

36
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,259
I'm fine.

37
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,659
Patrols are everywhere.

38
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,099
I just saw a group

39
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,099
forcing a bunch of girls

40
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,178
onto a carriage.

41
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:32,618
Their cries sounded awful.

42
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,420
Should we help them?

43
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,659
Did they head
toward the cave in the back?

44
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,778
I heard

45
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:40,339
they were
taking some mountain path to Wujing.

46
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:41,779
Wujing?

47
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:43,219
What's going on?

48
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:44,859
Zhilou,

49
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,139
something's off.

50
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,460
We need to split up.

51
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,659
Fei Yuan, Bai Lu,

52
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,738
go with my uncle and stop that carriage.

53
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,860
I'll check the cave with Chu Moshang.

54
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:54,699
Zhilou,

55
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,819
that cave is dangerous.

56
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,219
I won't allow you to go.

57
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,338
Uncle Qingyun,

58
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:00,338
I'm not that useless girl I used to be.

59
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:01,460
Don't worry.

60
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:02,980
I'll keep her safe.

61
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,898
Even through the barrier,
I can feel the chill coming from inside.

62
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,700
Looks like this is the Frigid Zone.

63
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,499
Feng Zhilou,

64
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,980
your body can't stand it.

65
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,260
We're already at the entrance,
and you're trying to stop me?

66
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,778
I know

67
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,339

to fight alongside the Dragons.

What did you feed me just now?

85
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,259
A dragon pearl.

86
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,420
A dragon pearl?

87
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,738
This sacred land was formed

88
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,459
from a thousand-year frozen spring.

89
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,860
It's the Frigid Zone.

90
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,498
Without the dragon pearl protecting you,

91
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:28,979
you'd freeze solid like a block of ice

92
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,579
in just a few minutes.

93
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,139
But the dragon pearl

94
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:35,258
is the foundation of your cultivation.

95
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:36,099
If you gave it to me,

96
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,579
what about you?

97
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:39,738
I'm a Dragon.

98
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,860

This has nothing to do
with the dragon pearl.

102
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,019
Then what's going on with your body?

103
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,459
I already cleared the poison.

104
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,100
Why do you still have internal injuries?

105
00:05:58,299 --> 00:05:59,619
I made a mistake.

106
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,619
Being punished is what I deserve.

107
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,540
It's my fault.

108
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,498
You came back

109
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,619
and I didn't even check on you.

110
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:09,859
I didn't notice

111
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,059
how badly you were injured.

112
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,258
I always thought

113
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,139
nothing could really harm the Dragons.

114
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,499
Once we get out of here,

115
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,779
I'll be fine

116
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,340
in a few days.

117
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:28,100
I can't take off my sigil right now.

118
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,899
I've sealed the Icebound Sword away.

119
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,220
And this dragon pearl...

120
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,220
No.

121
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:35,180
I need to figure out how to get it out.

122
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,459
Once the pearl circulates
through your body for a day,

123
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:49,979
I'll remove it for you.

124
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,939
And what about you?

125
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:55,259
If I get cold,

126
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,740
just keep me warm.

127
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,259
Don't let me freeze to death.

128
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,740
You really know how to joke now.

129
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,619
So this is the Sacred Ancestor Cavern?

130
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,379
Feng Zhilou, you're scared of nothing...

131
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:26,660
except this?

132
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,259
These are human bones.

133
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,539
Do you think these bones

134
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,980
could belong to those innocent girls?

135
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,980
Doesn't look like it.

136
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:53,219
Someone actually

137
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,980
came all the way in here
to bring me food?

138
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,220
Stop hiding

139
00:07:58,619 --> 00:07:59,900
and show yourself!

140
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:01,819
Ignorant brat!

141
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:04,300
I am of the Dragons' Sacred Ancestors.

142
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:06,298
Only a sacred being like me

143
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:08,698
can survive in the Frigid Zone.

144
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,100
You trespass in my territory

145
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:12,939
and still dare speak disrespectfully?

146
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:14,819
He's a Dragon?

147
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,618
Just a flood dragon.

148
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:17,939
So what?

149
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,300
Give me a few more years,
and I'll be a true Dragon.

150
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:21,780
Funny.

151
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,459
You're almost a Dragon,

152
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,859
but he's a true Dragon.

153
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,819
- Better come out and pay your respects.
- How dare you underestimate me?

154
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,498
All bark and no bite.

155
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:33,019
I'll meet this Sacred Ancestor.

156
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,579
- Why don't you take a seat over there?
- Okay.

157
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,339
You...

158
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:06,557
(Hunbao, Sacred Lord of the Serpents)

159
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,099
You nasty woman, how dare you bully me?

160
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:20,778
At your age and acting like this?
Call me a nasty woman?

161
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:23,059
- Who taught you that?
- You hit way too hard!

162
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,179
I'm the great Sacred Ancestor of the Serpents.
No one's ever laid a hand on me!

163
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,859
A few more hits will do him good.

164
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,339
Spill it!

165
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,219
Why did you use such cruel methods

166
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,459
to force the entire Serpents

167
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,898
into worshipping you?

168
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:46,979
I nourished the Serpent Forest
with my power.

169
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,099
They served me

170
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,579
and kept me satisfied.

171
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,739
How is that cruel?

172
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,480
You consume human blood
and flesh to power your cultivation.

173
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,819
And you're saying you're not cruel?

174
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,739
Pah!

175
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,018
Human blood is disgusting.

176
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,018
I'd never drink that.

177
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,939
I only eat the livestock they offer me.

178
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,939
How dare you lie to me?

179
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,538
Roast chicken.

180
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:05,500
I love roast chicken the most!

181
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,939
This is embarrassing.

182
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,939
I've completely lost my pride.

183
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,299
I said I don't eat humans, and I mean it.

184
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,258
The Serpents

185
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:14,459
have always fed me livestock.

186
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,699
See it for yourself.

187
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,538
Here's a goat.

188
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:18,939
Here's some roast chicken.

189
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,459
Maybe a bit too much,

190
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,579
but I love roast chicken.

191
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,420
There are no human bones here.

192
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:32,778
How do you explain the Serpents

193
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:33,898
offering you live humans?

194
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,418
That's just a rumor!

195
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:38,018
I've been trapped here for centuries.

196
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,020
I've never seen anyone
bring living sacrifices.

197
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,219
So you're trapped here?

198
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:43,658
That barrier

199
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,018
allows entry but no exit.

200
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,538
Both of you are stuck here too.

201
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:47,658
I know this place inside out.

202
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,219
With me, the Sacred Ancestor, here,

203
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,780
you won't be short of food or shelter.

204
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,299
Drop the "Sacred Ancestor" title,
will you?

205
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,219
You can't leave

206
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,219
because your cultivation is too weak.

207
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,099
But

208
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,420
he's different.

209
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,260
He's about to freeze to death.

210
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,180
Chu Moshang!

211
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,059
Chu Moshang, wake up!

212
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,179
Don't scare me.

213
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,099
This place is full of frigid energy.

214
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,138
If he stays too long,

215
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,339
he'll freeze to death.

216
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,540
What should I do?

217
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:20,420
You both carry the Dragons' energy.

218
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,018
Do you have a dragon pearl inside you?

219
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,819
Your warmth could keep him alive.

220
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,780
You're right.

221
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:33,299
Miss,

222
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,699
are you kidding me?

223
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:38,099
You have to hold him.

224
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,299
Stay close and share your breath.

225
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,380
That's the only way
the dragon pearl will work.

226
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,939
Hurry up.

227
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,699
Stop hesitating.

228
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,300
If not, none of us are getting out.

229
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,260
Then turn around.

230
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,059
Hurry up.

231
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,219
Take your clothes off.

232
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:56,339
You're not even human.

233
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,699
Don't you have any shame?

234
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:00,780
This is called
being upfront with each other.

235
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,258
I asked for ten girls.

236
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:21,500
Why are there only a few?

237
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:24,300
Everyone wants sons now.

238
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,140
When a girl is born,

239
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,620
she's either sold or given away.

240
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,579
They're getting rarer and rarer.

241
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,179
Keep in mind.

242
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,059
Mr. Wang and Mr. Liu warned

243
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,979
that if they don't get enough people...

244
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,020
I'll think of another way.

245
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:43,339
You mortals are way too complicated.

246
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,540
Do it now.

247
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,579
Let's go.

248
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,459
Let's go.

249
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,059
What's wrong?

250
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,000
- Let's go now.
- My legs are numb from squatting.

251
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,020
You're really good for nothing.

252
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:54,979
Who are you?

253
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,939
By seniority,
you should call me great-grandpa.

254
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,179
And I'm your great-grandma.

255
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,780
Just call me Mr. Feng.

256
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,018
We can't let them get away!

257
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,018
Let them run a few miles.

258
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:03,859
Save the kids first.

259
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,900
Come on.

260
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,300
Come.

261
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,099
Take it slow.

262
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:18,819
Take these children somewhere safe.

263
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,380
I'll check again.

264
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,099
Let's go.

265
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,180
(You've finally come.)

266
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:39,138
Who?

267
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:40,300
Who's talking to me?

268
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,500
Where am I?

269
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:51,780
(I'll defend this sacred ground
to my last breath!)

270
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:56,339
(No demon from the nether realm
will dare harm my kind!)

271
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:06,059
You're awake.

272
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,380
Did you rest well?

273
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,339
How about you?

274
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,739
Are you okay now?

275
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,618
You already
returned the dragon pearl to me.

276
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:23,819
Of course I'm fine.

277
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:27,219
Don't overthink it.

278
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:29,500
I just didn't want you
to freeze to death here.

279
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,939
Do you

280
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,059
feel anything unusual in your body?

281
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,180
Right.

282
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,579
After I returned the pearl to you,

283
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,819
I felt my body

284
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,420
filling with power.

285
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,380
I had a dream just now.

286
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,260
I feel even more clarity in myself now.

287
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,020
I feel different

288
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,579
from before.

289
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,618
That means the dragon pearl

290
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:57,059
was working on your body.

291
00:14:58,259 --> 00:14:59,260
Are you saying

292
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,140
you gave me the dragon pearl

293
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,140
to strengthen my cultivation?

294
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:06,900
Wujing is full of danger.

295
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:08,979
I just wanted you

296
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,939
to have a stronger way
to protect yourself.

297
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:18,099
He's awake!

298
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,859
He's still alive!

299
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,898
Can we leave now?

300
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:21,219
Take me out of here!

301
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,579
Aren't you the Sacred Ancestor?

302
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,059
This is your domain.

303
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,378
Why do you want to leave?

304
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:27,339
Sacred Ancestor my foot.

305
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,579
I'm just a weak, helpless flood dragon.

306
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,859
It's been nine hundred years.

307
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,378
Countless beasts and venomous creatures
tore each other apart.

308
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:34,258
In the end,

309
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:36,939
I'm the only pitiful thing left.

310
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,819
I'm begging you.

311
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,459
Please take me out of here.

312
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,859
Don't leave me locked up here alone.

313
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,859
You really have no idea

314
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,260
where the sacrificed girls were taken?

315
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,258
Miss,

316
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:50,380
I swear, I honestly don't know.

317
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:53,859
The Serpent elders

318
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,459
must have moved them somewhere else.

319
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,420
Maybe we can find the answers

320
00:15:58,619 --> 00:15:59,780
from Fei Yuan and Bai Lu.

321
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,738
Miss,

322
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:02,540
can we please talk outside?

323
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,138
Sure.

324
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:06,658
But you have to promise me

325
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:07,778
that once we're out,

326
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:10,258
you'll help me
expose the Serpents' lies.

327
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:11,579
If not, I'll...

328
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,339
Miss,

329
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,939
I'll do whatever you say.

330
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,538
You've always treated me well.
Who else would I listen to?

331
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:17,339
I'm begging you.

332
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,059
Please take me out of here.

333
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,538
I may not have a dragon pearl,

334
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:21,738
but I still have my inner core.

335
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:22,819
I can protect you.

336
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,660
I'd risk my life for you.

337
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,900
Don't be afraid, child.

338
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:49,099
It's been nine hundred years.

339
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,299
I'm finally free.

340
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,859
Glory to the Dragons!
Long live my saviors!

341
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,140
Farewell.

342
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:04,900
I... I was wrong.

343
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,140
Serpent tribesmen,

344
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,059
this foreign man attacked us

345
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,380
and ambushed our people.

346
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,140
He even
freed the Saint Ancestor's offering

347
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:19,420
and has deeply offended our Ancestor.

348
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,099
For this crime,

349
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,499
we will bury this foreign man

350
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,259
and the mother and daughter

351
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,939
alive as an offering

352
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,059
to soothe the Saint Ancestor's spirit.

353
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,938
That's right.

354
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:30,779
Bury him!

355
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,658
Bury him!

356
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:34,340
He must be buried alive!

357
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,658
Let me go!

358
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:37,180
What are you doing?

359
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,219
Stop it!

360
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:43,820
Elder Luo,

361
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,739
you're killing innocent people.

362
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,180
Who do you think you are?

363
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:49,820
How dare you
defy the Saint Ancestor's will?

364
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,420
Is this truly the Ancestor's will,

365
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:54,739
or just your decision?

366
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:57,459
You're in on it too?

367
00:17:57,899 --> 00:17:58,739
Someone!

368
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,698
Tie her up!

369
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:00,900
She'll be buried with them!

370
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:18,339
Serpent tribesmen,

371
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,660
please listen to me.

372
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,380
Who is she?

373
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:39,836
