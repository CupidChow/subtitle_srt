How dare you harm someone I protect?

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,518
You've really got some nerve.

29
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,478
This is a matter
between our two families.

30
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,839
You have no right to interfere.

31
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,279
Zong!

32
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,839
Aren't you going
to take your woman back?

33
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,798
How are you?

34
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:10,920
Are you alright?

35
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,519
I'm fine.

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,320
I must protect my sigil.

37
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,999
Stop using your energy.

38
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:20,519
Leave this to me.

39
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,519
As long as we fight side by side,

40
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,399
we can unleash limitless potential.

41
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,480
Why are you still stunned?

42
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,119
Since young,
you've achieved nothing at all.

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,918
You can't even protect your own woman.

44
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,640
You're just a loser!

45
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,119
Having a son like you

46
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,320
is simply my shame!

47
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,999
Useless thing.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,040
Loser!

49
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,160
Loser!

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,399
I'm not a loser.

51
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,519
I'm not a loser.

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,399
Give me back my woman!

53
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:13,160
Zong!

54
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,358
Zong!

55
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:16,320
Zong.

56
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,719
Zong.

58
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,320
Father.

59
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,638
Someone!

60
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,919
Prepare the carriage!

61
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,519
Zong.

62
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,359
Zong.

63
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,200
(I didn't expect the power
to be this strong.)

64
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,598
Quick!

65
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,120
Faster!

66
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,158
Father.

67
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,119
Zong.

68
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,719
I'm cold.

69
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,800
Zong,

70
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,240
do you feel warmer now?

71
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,120
Zong?

72
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,038
Zong!

73
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:56,440
Don't fall asleep, Zong.

74
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,278
Wake up!

75
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:57,838
Zong!

76
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,080
Father...

77
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,719
I...

78
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:06,800
I've disappointed you again.

79
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,479
Zong!

80
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,519
I'll kill the entire Feng family!

81
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,240
Thank you for helping us so many times.

82
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,039
Since both of you
have already expressed your feelings,

83
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,039
after the wedding at Feng Manor,

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,440
take her away.

85
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:32,039
My wish has been fulfilled.

86
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,399
No!

87
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:34,919
Wait...

88
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,200
You chose him.

89
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,999
Why not?

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,919
Who said we're getting married?

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,719
You...

92
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,559
You guys are already so close.

93
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,800
It's unreasonable

94
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,599
to not get married.

95
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:47,638
Zhilou,

96
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,718
leave it to us.

97
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:51,200
How can a marriage

98
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,279
be one-sided?

99
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,599
You all don't need to worry about it.

100
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:02,839
Why are you still sitting here?

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's go.

102
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,680
Qingfeng,

103
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,439
this time, we've truly offended

104
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,240
the Lenghou family.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,398
What's been destroyed

106
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,879
is not just

107
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,680
the alliance between the two families.

108
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,440
What should we do next?

109
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,839
Proceed with the wedding as planned.

110
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,599
I...

111
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:48,839
I...

112
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,320
Uh...

113
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,599
Just pretend it never happened.

114
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,880
I know you're unwilling.

115
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,399
I can't force you.

116
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,239
Look, Young Master

117
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,640
is starting to act more human now.

118
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,959
And you're starting
to act nonchalant now.

119
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,999
Miss Zhilou, the drinks will be completely
free of charge.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,559
Consider it free advertising
for our shop..

121
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,598
Miss Zhilou!

122
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,759
Miss Zhilou,

123
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,679
congratulations!

124
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,919
Congratulations, Miss Zhilou.

125
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,638
You're going to be a bride soon.

126
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,038
You must wear clothes
that match your status.

127
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,038
- Miss Zhilou...
- No...

128
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:31,119
Let's shop for some clothes.

129
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,759
- Miss Zhilou, come to my house...
- Miss Zhilou!

130
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,718
The clothes first.

131
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:34,638
Miss Zhilou...

132
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,080
Shop for some clothes!

133
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,598
Hold on.

134
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,959
Actually, you guys...

135
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,598
Miss Zhilou!

136
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,359
Wait, Miss Zhilou!

137
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,838
Over here, Miss Zhilou. Come.

138
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,439
Wait, no. No need, really.

139
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,640
Someone!

140
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,638
Bring over the newly made

141
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,119
phoenix wedding robe.

142
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,078
Quickly.

143
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,759
Let Miss Zhilou have a look at it.

144
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,598
Miss Zhilou,

145
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,838
this is made overnight
by the most skilled

146
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,679
embroiderer in our shop.

147
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,559
Look.

148
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,479
Brilliant crimson. Gold threads embroidered
with hidden python patterns.

149
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,999
Lovebirds and pomegranate designs.

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,879
A peacock-embroidered misty shawl.

151
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,640
This is the finest material.

152
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,320
I...

153
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,799
I don't think it suits me very well.

154
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,439
It suits you.

155
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,719
Boss!

156
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:17,479
Boss,

157
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,279
I'm here to collect my wedding dress.

158
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,680
Why is my wedding dress with her?

159
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,760
Miss Yunqiao,

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,039
this was prepared for Miss Zhilou.

161
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,080
If you like it, just take it.

162
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,999
This material is great.

163
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,278
Miss Zhilou, please be understanding.

164
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,558
My groom will definitely like it!

165
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,678
Miss Yunqiao

166
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,959
seems a little unstable lately.

167
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,680
She's acting somewhat insane.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,920
This one...

169
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:57,920
No.

170
00:08:58,439 --> 00:08:59,119
This one won't do.

171
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,599
This color won't do.

172
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,959
This one's good!

173
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,160
Hey, Feng Yunqiao!

174
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:07,038
This one's good!

175
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,239
Miss Yunqiao!

176
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,239
- Miss Yunqiao.
- I finally found you.

177
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,680
- Why are you here?
- Feng Yunqiao.

178
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,798
Who are you?

179
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,879
Are you crazy or something?

180
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,518
Miss Yunqiao, let's go home.

181
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,959
Go home, okay?

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,879
I'm not going home!

183
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,440
- Go home, okay?
- I'm not going home!

184
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,520
- Miss Yunqiao?
- Catch me!

185
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,239
Catch me!

186
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,999
Miss Yunqiao!

187
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,440
Come catch me!

188
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,239
Young Master!

189
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,359
I'll go find Feng Zhilou.

190
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,320
Wait.

191
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,680
You don't look well!

192
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,719
I'll be fine after a bit of rest.

193
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:57,560
Quickly go.

194
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,240
I really don't understand
what Young Master is thinking.

195
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,200
It'd be best
to get Feng Zhilou cure him.

196
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,599
Why must we obey

197
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,599
the wishes of mere mortals
and even stand up for her?

198
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,680
Truly ridiculous.

199
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,038
Miss Zhilou's life is her own.

200
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,518
Whether she wants to cure Young Master

201
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,038
is naturally her own decision as well.

202
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,079
But if Young Master dies
from the Yang poison,

203
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,359
we will reclaim the sigil,

204
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,719
and she won't live long either.

205
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,839
Fei Yuan...

206
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,038
Young Master has defended you
in every way.

207
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,920
What will it take for you
to cure his poison?

208
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,879
Are the minions of the Dragons
always this overbearing?

209
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,359
If I don't cure your Young Master,
are you going to kill me?

210
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,239
Fine.

211
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,678
Go ahead

212
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,119
and kill me right now.

213
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,638
Anyway, I'm just a loser
who only knows a bit of medicine.

214
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,479
If I die,

215
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,719
your Young Master will suffer

216
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,719
an explosive death too.

217
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,080
That way, I won't lose anything at all.
Kill me!

218
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,359
I've never met

219
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,079
a woman as unreasonable as you!

220
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,479
You're about to kill me.
I don't have to be reasonable!

221
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,239
Young Master's Yang poison
has never been cured.

222
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,520
Yesterday, for your safety,
he disregarded himself completely.

223
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,640
Now, he's giving up
on his own life just for you!

224
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,400
- I...
- Fei Yuan.

225
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,119
Young Master,

226
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,558
don't forget your mission.

227
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,400
Young Master,

228
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,479
Miss Zhilou is your last chance.

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,199
How did it become this serious?

230
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,520
You still have the nerve to ask?

231
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,318
Young Master broke

232
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:21,918
into Nie Rongzhi's barrier
to look for you.

233
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,839
For the sake of you,

234
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,460
his energy must have been damaged.

235
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,680
After dragging it on this long,

236
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,999
his body has already
been suffering severe pain.

237
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,119
It's getting weaker and weaker.

238
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:34,798
Why won't you, a mere mortal,

239
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,199
save Young Master?

240
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,278
Do you know who he is?

241
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:37,759
Shut up,

242
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,639
Fei Yuan.

243
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:41,359
Don't forget,

244
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,678
you're protected by the sigil

245
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,959
because of Young Master.

246
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,199
The sigil was formed
from his most important reverse scale.

247
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,959
Actually,

248
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,759
Young Master's power is protecting you.

249
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,759
That's enough.

250
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,639
Whether I can
cure the Yang poison or not,

251
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:56,320
don't make things difficult
for Feng Zhilou.

252
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,239
If anything happens to me,

253
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,359
the sanctuary...

254
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,639
Enough, Young Master.

255
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:04,560
If you won't save him,

256
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,359
we'll find a way ourselves.

257
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,680

Thank you, Miss Zhilou.

284
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,200
You and the sigil have an agreement.

285
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,638
Now, only you and I

286
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,160
are the masters
of the Canglong Pavilion.

287
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,599
Unless we die.

288
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,639
That's why

289
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,879
you value the sigil so much?

290
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:31,080
Now that my Yang poison has been cured,

291
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,160
I must return to the sanctuary anytime.

292
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,520
From now on,

293
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,639
you can rely on martial cultivation.

294
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,040
My spiritual roots...

295
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,800
Your nine spiritual roots
have manifested.

296
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,839
They will activate at the right time,

297
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,479
but that depends on you.

298
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,080
For humans,

299
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,839
having spiritual roots
is only the beginning.

300
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,359
Next comes

301
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:04,200
persistent martial cultivation.

302
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,959
Only through martial cultivation

303
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,959
can you discover your true potential

304
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,280
and unleash it infinitely.

305
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,400
Chu Moshang.

306
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,119
Thank you.

307
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,520
Everything that has happened
these past days

308
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,280
feels like a dream.

309
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,959
It's as if the day before,

310
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,040
I was just a useless person with no

311
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,839
spiritual roots and martial cultivation
within my family.

312
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,119
I was used,

313
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,119
despised,

314
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,320
and mocked.

315
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,280
But now,

316
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,520
because I'm going
to marry into the Dragons,

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,560
the drinks for the wedding are free,

318
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,560
and I can get the wedding dress easily.

319
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,239
It's a treatment I've never

320
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,759
had before.

321
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,280
But what they see

322
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,599
is not me. They only

323
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,080
see the bride of the Dragons.

324
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,239
You don't need to care.

325
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,400
Just be yourself.

326
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,879
I want to become strong.

327
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,599
I want martial cultivation.

328
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,599
I want the world

329
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,720
to all look up to the name Feng Zhilou.

330
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,320
I must go to Wujing.

00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:17,757
