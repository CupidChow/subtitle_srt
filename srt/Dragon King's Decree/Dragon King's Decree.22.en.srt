=Episode 22=

25
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,350
Father,

26
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,830
you took my dragon pearl.

27
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,149
Are you trying to kill me?

28
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,630
From now on,

29
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,510
I'll hold onto your dragon pearl

30
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,110
and seal it.

31
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,510
So you can cool off,

32
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,949
get your head straight,

33
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,870
and go marry Liluo.

34
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,390
Moshang,

35
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,029
you'd give up the throne

36
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,750
just for Feng Zhilou.

37
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,470
Is it worth it?

38
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,110
Someone

39
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,710
like you who only knows
how to use people

40
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,470
wouldn't understand

41
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,190
what's worth it.

42
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,630
Right.

43
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,150
I don't get love,

44
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,630
and I don't need to.

45
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,390
All I know

46
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,270
is Father chose me.

47
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,190
That

48
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,710
is what really matters.

49
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,070
Growing up,

50
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,830
he always took your side

51
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,470
and ignored me.

52
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,470
It felt like he was ripping out
my dragon scales.

53
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,910
Now you finally feel

54
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,230
that kind of pain too.

55
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,669
Miss,

56
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,869
what's wrong?

57
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,789
I don't know what's up with me.

58
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,190
I'm just always tired.

59
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,190
And I sleep badly,

60
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,510
always dreaming.

61
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,548
But when I wake up,

62
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,110
I forget everything.

63
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,429
Everyone's sluggish year-round.

64
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,070
Being sleepy is normal.

65
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,670
You actually make sense.

66
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,310
But the only one who's sleepy

67
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,309
year-round is you.

68
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,710
One word.

69
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,229
Lazy!

70
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,430
Hey!

71
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,910
Miss, eat something.

72
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,269
Since the Young Master's out,

73
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,470
I'll take good care of you.

74
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,429
This chicken leg smells amazing!

75
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,950
Come have one.

76
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,230
Miss,

77
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,750
why aren't you eating?

78
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,389
I'm just not hungry.

79
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,830
Not hungry?

80
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,150
Want to walk around town?

81
00:04:59,310 --> 00:04:59,910
Let's go!

82
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,270
Moshang's never suffered like this!

83
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,990
I have to save him!

84
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,389
Save him?

85
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,349
You?

86
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,470
With what?

87
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,749
Your big courage?

88
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,830
Then what?

89
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,110
There's no way.

90
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,670
This barrier was set by Father.

91
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:24,909
You can't break it.

92
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,750
Young Master,

93
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,230
you've suffered.

94
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,910
Good thing you're here.

95
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,110
I need you two to handle something.

96
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,709
Young Master, don't worry.

97
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,349
I'd risk my life

98
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,749
to get you out!

99
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,870
Head to Wujing.

100
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,910
Find Zhilou.

101
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,230
I'm worried Nie Rongzhi
will mess with her.

102
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,830
Look out for her for me.

103
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,509
Young Master, really?

104
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,469
You're still thinking about Miss Zhilou?

105
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,190
I...

106
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,470
You talk too much.

107
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,469
Young Master, don't worry.

108
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,030
We won't fail you.

109
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,790
Let's go!

110
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,830
Bai Lu.

111
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,790
Don't let Zhilou worry about me.

112
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,310
Got it.

113
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,950
We'll keep it quiet.

114
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,790
Young Master,

115
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,070
you're on your own from here
in the sanctuary.

116
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,309
Miss, does this look cute?

117
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,029
Does it sound nice?

118
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,990
So childish.

119
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,429
Those pastries we bought were amazing!

120
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,909
Right?

121
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,830
- Come by my place and try some!
- Sure!

122
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,550
Xiaoyu,

123
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,869
take whatever you like.

124
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,350
I'll buy it all for you.

125
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,230
Why are you crying?

126
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,270
You're still the same,
always tearing up.

127
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,149
You should smile more.

128
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,950
You look the best when you smile.

129
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,950
I look great smiling too!

130
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,829
Miss,

131
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,829
let's go listen

132
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,229
to some stories.

133
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,989
Let's relax.

134
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,549
Okay.

135
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,990
Let's go then.

136
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,629
Today's tale is a legend about a beast.

137
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,429
I love stories about beasts!

138
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,390
Miss, listen!

139
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,390
Two humans marry.

140
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,150
Their kid's human.

141
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,110
But if a human marries a beast,

142
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,949
and they're really together,

143
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,509
their child

144
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,869
could be anything.

145
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,509
Makes sense.

146
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,430
So this beast, Man Yi,

147
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,150
turned into human form.

148
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,629
He became a handsome young guy.

149
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,190
He walked in the fields

150
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,109
and met a village girl, Yun.

151
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,229
Love at first sight,

152
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,789
then second sight,

153
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,990
and by the third, they decided to marry.

154
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,989
Yun went home

155
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,590
and told her family

156
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,629
she wanted to marry Mr. Yi.

157
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,830
Her family saw him.

158
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,109
Handsome,

159
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,549
polite,

160
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,749
and well-spoken.

161
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,509
So,

162
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,509
they agreed.

163
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,829
After their wedding night,

164
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,829
Yun found herself pregnant.

165
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,509
Then if she is pregnant,

166
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,230
is the baby human or beast?

167
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,789
When Yun became pregnant,

168
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,869
her symptoms

169
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,309
weren't like ours.

170
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,669
How so?

171
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,070
Human mothers

172
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,469
usually deal

173
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,429
with nausea,

174
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,630
throwing up,

175
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,110
and cravings.

176
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,469
But Yun's belly

177
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,710
kept

178
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,830
jumping.

179
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,230
Thump.

180
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:18,789
Thump!

181
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,910
Thump!

182
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,029
Like something inside
was actually dancing.

183
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,749
Dancing?

184
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,749
Beasts lay eggs, and their young

185
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,190
hatch from them.

186
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,789
Miss, what's wrong?

187
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,909
It's nothing like us.

188
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,629
Tell me what it is when it's born!

189
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,790
Okay.

190
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:38,589
Even without us,

191
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,948
Hunbao will look

192
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:41,269
after Miss Zhilou.

193
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,910
Carrying a beast fetus

194
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,550
makes you feel awful every day.

195
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,669
Sounds about right!

196
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,029
After all that thumping,

197
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,149
a few days later...

198
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,189
Where's Feng Zhilou?

199
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,510
Yun's family noticed something was off.

200
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,309
It was...

201
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,230
What are you two doing here?

202
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,109
Well...

203
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,709
You tell them.

204
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,349
Elder,

205
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,029
why aren't you two in the sanctuary?

206
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,149
Why did you come here?

207
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,029
That's a good one.

208
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,309
We're here to drag you back.

209
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,230
Let's go.

210
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,909
Hear that? They're dragging us...

211
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,390
No!

212
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,070
Miss.

213
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,190
Miss, what's wrong?

214
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,150
Did you have a nightmare again?

215
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,830
Miss, your belly...

216
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,150
Move!

217
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,869
Wait, I remember now.

218
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,149
This is exactly
like that storyteller's tale.

219
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,269
You're pregnant!

220
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,390
Don't talk nonsense!

221
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,149
Pregnant or not,

222
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,910
a physician can check.

223
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,189
I am a physician.

224
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,670
Why would I see one?

225
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,870
Go to bed now.

226
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,669
Miss,

227
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,829
if you end up giving me
a dragon child to play with,

228
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,469
I'll finally have connections!

229
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,990
I'd finally have some pull
around the sanctuary!

230
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,470
Say that again,

231
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,309
and I'll...

232
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,909
Okay! Just sleep!

233
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,950
I'm leaving!

234
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,430
With things like this,

235
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,750
how am I

236
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,030
supposed to hold on until your wedding?

237
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,710
Mother,

238
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,469
even though the prince

239
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,750
called off our engagement in public,

240
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,269
the sanctuary sent word saying

241
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,190
they'll send me the battle robe
in three days.

242
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,030
So,

243
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,150
you want me dead right now?

244
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,790
Mother,

245
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,869
I'm not going to push you that far.

246
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,270
In this whole city,

247
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,869
there isn't a single decent person

248
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,430
who can walk me down the aisle.

249
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,750
If we want to keep you alive,

250
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,829
catching Yue or Feng Zhilou

251
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,429
is our best chance.

252
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,110
Where's your brother?

253
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,270
He won't send you off?

254
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,470
My brother?

255
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,150
He's still alive?

256
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,790
He might as well be dead.

257
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,029
He already knows

258
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,429
what we did to Yue and Feng Zhilou.

259
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,990
Now,

260
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,310
he hates us to the bone.

261
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,230
If he doesn't expose us at my wedding,

262
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,470
I'll count myself lucky.

263
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,790
I planned for years,

264
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,270
set everything up

265
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,710
so you'd have a future here
in Wujing City.

266
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,350
Didn't think

267
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,190
you'd ruin it this badly!

268
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,869
You really...

269
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,030
You really are useless!

270
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,190
I'm telling you this

271
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,790
because I still see you as my mother,

272
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,950
not so you can lecture me.

273
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,830
You're pregnant.

274
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,550
Mother!

275
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,309
When I was pregnant,

276
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,830
I was just like this.

277
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,189
Qingfeng was so annoying.

278
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,350
He kept asking who the father was.

279
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,630
And the elder wouldn't stop nagging.

280
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,470
Only Qingyun was sweet,

281
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,790
always making me tonics.

282
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,350
Mother,

283
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,230
do you miss Feng Manor?

284
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,910
Of course.

285
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,470
Out of all Wujing City,

286
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,150
Feng Manor was always my favorite.

287
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,350
Maybe because

288
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,590
the ancient Wujing Saintess

289
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,950
was born there.

290
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,990
Maybe.

291
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,630
Or maybe because

292
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,270
I dreamed of Qingfeng last night.

293
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,070
He told me

294
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,710
it's time to wake up.

295
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,950
Mother,

296
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,510
actually,

297
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,910
I've been wanting to ask you
a lot of things.

298
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,990
Back then,

299
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,950
why did you come to Wujing City alone?

300
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,710
Why

301
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,550
did you leave me behind at Feng Manor?

302
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,030
Who am I?

303
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,069
What does being

304
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,830
the Wujing Saintess mean?

305
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,990
What about the baby's father?

306
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,390
Is he good to you?

307
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,150
How's his family?

308
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,830
Yes.

309
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,430
Mother,

310
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,910
he's really good.

311
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,270
He's the kind of guy

312
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,630
who looks

313
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,350
grumpy on the outside.

314
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,230
Cold, even.

315
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,390
But deep down,

316
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,430
he's incredibly kind.

317
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,350
He always sticks up for the weak.

318
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,830
He took me,

319
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,990
someone everyone called useless,

320
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,270
and helped me grow stronger.

321
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,030
He always protects my pride.

322
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,990
And he's always on my side.

323
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,990
Silly girl.

324
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,870
Alright.

325
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,350
He does sound great.

326
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,430
Where is he now?

327
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,830
He...

328
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,909
Right now,

329
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,030
he's dealing with something important.

330
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,230
But I know

331
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,950
he's thinking about us.

332
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,190
Feng Manor,

333
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,830
Feng Qingfeng...

334
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,590
Qingfeng

335
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,710
really thought ahead.

336
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,430
Back then,

337
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,350
he didn't want you to feel burdened.

338
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,029
He held you as a baby every day.

339
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,550
Murmuring to you,

340
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,910
"Little one,

341
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,550
I wish you were just an ordinary child,

342
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,070
so you could stay here in Feng Manor

343
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,910
and be happy

344
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,910
for the rest of your life."

345
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,470
Feng Manor,

346
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,270
Qingfeng...

347
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,630
I really miss them.

348
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,510
Zhilou, you there?

349
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,549
I did everything I could.

350
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,189
I don't think you'll see more clearly

351
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,510
than this.

352
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,270
It's fine.

353
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,750
This is how it should be.

354
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:26,390
Young Lord,

355
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:29,590
any news from the sanctuary?

356
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,190
Even if there is,

357
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,470
Mother would tell Liluo, not me.

358
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,030
Zhilou,

359
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,910
I didn't call you here today
to treat my eyes.

360
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,550
I called you to give you this.

361
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,390
This book was protected
by every Wujing City Lord.

362
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,110
It's our greatest treasure.
