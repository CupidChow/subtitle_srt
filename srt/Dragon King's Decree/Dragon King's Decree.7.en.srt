25
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,839
Young Master's Yang poison
should be cured this time, right?

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,440
Let's wait and see.

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,039
Someone is coming.

28
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,559
Mr. Nie, I wonder
what brings you here?

29
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,599
I heard Moshang isn't cured
from the Yang poison yet.

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,159
I am deeply concerned.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,040
So,

32
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,040
I came to visit him.

33
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,398
Mr. Nie, you and Young Master

34
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,999
truly share a deep brotherly bond.

35
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,958
But it's late now.

36
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,320
Young Master is already resting.

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,959
You need not to worry about him.

38
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,638
Young Master,

39
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,559
you're alright now.

40
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:14,838
Thank you,

41
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,040
Miss Zhilou.

42
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,240
Rongzhi,

43
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,200
you must be disappointed.

44
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:34,360
Moshang,

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,159
what do you mean by that?

46
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:39,080
I couldn't be happier

47
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,320
to see you healthy now.

48
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,679
Since you

49
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,399
are alright,

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,240
I will return to the sanctuary
to report to Father.

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,959
Moshang, take care.

52
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,679
He is also one of the Dragons?

53
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,040
Are the two brothers on bad terms?

54
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,678
Young Master's poison

55
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,200
was precisely his doing.

56
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:07,078
With Lenghou Zong's abilities,

57
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,999
he couldn't have injured Young Master.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,479
It was all Nie Rongzhi's doing.

59
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,358
That day,

60
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:12,599
it was him who set up the barrier

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,399
to stop us from saving you.

62
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,600
I see.

63
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,479
Well, sometimes,

64
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,520
our siblings want us dead.

65
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,559
I've thought about it.

66
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,759
Now that your poison has been cured,

67
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,759
there's no need for me
to hold back anymore.

68
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:00,318
To be frank...

69
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,679
Are you sure about this?

70
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,758
If we go through

71
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,720
with a fake marriage,

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,920
everyone will just assume
you've really married me.

73
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,280
For a woman,

74
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,399
this is no small matter.

75
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,280
I want to leave this place

76
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,519
and see the world outside.

77
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,319
I want to try my luck in Wujing City.

78
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,840
And,

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,319
I want to fight alongside you Dragons.

80
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,679
No,

81
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,319
what I mean is we

82
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,998
can go our separate ways

83
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,318
after I leave Feng Manor

84
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,839
and arrive in Wujing City.

85
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,439
Don't feel burdened.

86
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,800
I promised you

87
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:42,040
I would take you away.

88
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,079
Young Master,

89
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,800
it's time to return to the sanctuary.

90
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,160
See you at the ancestral hall tomorrow.

91
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,279
Hurry up.

92
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,439
Everyone is waiting.

93
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,798
Watch out.

94
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,599
It's crooked.

95
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,479
Adjust it now.

96
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,358
Go.

97
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,159
We need to use it.

98
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,959
They're waiting.

99
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,719
Watch your step. Don't fall.

100
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,758
Listen carefully.

101
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,798
The marriage alliance
with the Dragons today is crucial.

102
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,400
No mistakes are allowed.

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,358
Miss Yunqiao,

104
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,479
why have you come out?

105
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,198
Today

106
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,240
is my wedding day.

107
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,438
Miss Yunqiao!

108
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,039
Go get her!

109
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,758
Now.

110
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,960
That lantern is crooked.

111
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:33,670
(Happy Wedding)

112
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,839
The time is approaching.

113
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,160
Why is the groom still not here?

114
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,159
Could it be

115
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,878
that something has gone wrong?

116
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,558
But,

117
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,079
the Dragon Prince doesn't seem

118
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,439
like someone
who would break his promise.

119
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:35,959
What time is it already?

120
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,639
Why hasn't the groom arrived yet?

121
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,878
Indeed,

122
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,480
how long must our bride keep waiting?

123
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
(Shang,)

124
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,879
(are you really not coming?)

125
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,879
(I thought you
were different from them.)

126
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,399
He's here!

127
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,399
The groom is here.

128
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,319
He's finally here.

129
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:42,399
The Dragon Prince

130
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,279
is truly remarkable.

131
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,558
Miss Zhilou is finally married off.

132
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,519

I've come to marry you.

155
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,519
Let's welcome the newlyweds.

156

First bow to Heaven and Earth.

157
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,480
Second bow to the parents.

158

Who is that?

160
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:04,639
I'll check it out.

161
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,119
Alright.

162
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,399
What a lively event.

163
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,840
Why haven't you returned yet?

164
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,840
If I had returned to the sanctuary,

165
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,519
I would have

166
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,600
missed your joyous occasion

167
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,838
in taking a human girl as your wife.

168
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:37,200
I will explain this to Father.

169
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,240
Your input isn't needed.

170
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:51,879
Indeed.

171
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,960
I suppose this is beyond my jurisdiction anyway.

172
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:56,598
Controlling the winds and rains

173
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:57,958
was never my role to play.

174
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,440
You've already told Father?

175
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,919
I'll see you at the sanctuary,

176
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,399
my dear brother.

177
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,239
Zhilou,

178
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,999
I must return to the sanctuary

179
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,840
and explain this to my clan.

180
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,519
Nie Rongzhi is causing trouble again.

181
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,919
Innocent people may be harmed.

182
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,798
The Icebound Sword

183
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,240
is inside the sigil.

184
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,598
You can summon it yourself when needed.

185
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:34,480
You're entrusting me

186
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,958
with such a treasure?

187
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:37,159
Let it protect you

188
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,438
while I'm away.

189
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,039
I will protect myself.

190
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,999
I'll wait for your return.

191
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,039
Young Master,

192
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,279
it's really time to go.

193
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,200
I will keep my promise.

194
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,759
Wait for me to return.

195
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,359
Father, please calm down.

196
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,119
Moshang has received your calling.

197
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,720
I believe he should return soon.

198
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:28,720
Moshang,

199
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,320
you've finally returned.

200
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,798
I believe you must have had a reason

201
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,119
for marrying that human girl.

202
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,759
Why

203
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,119
don't you explain it to Father

204
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,399
and beg for his pardon?

205
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,960
Father,

206
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,759
I married Zhilou

207
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,678
to repay her

208
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,399
for curing my Yang poison,
thus saving my life.

209
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,560
The Yang poison?

210
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,519
It's the Demons' poison.

211
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,558
Only someone

212
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:54,200
with extreme Yin energy could cure it.

213
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,919
If not, the victim's blood vessels
will rupture and they will die.

214
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,519
If I hadn't met Feng Zhilou,

215
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,999
who possesses an extreme Yin body,
in the mortal realm,

216
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:02,279
I would have

217
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,560
been dead by now.

218
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,558
And the Yang poison in my system?

219
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,840
It was the result

220
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,799
of a sneak attack by Nie Rongzhi.

221
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:15,320
Zhi,

222
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,320
is this true?

223
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,600
Father,

224
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,598
when we Dragons duel,

225
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,078
we always spare no effort

226
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,519
to prove our strength.

227
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,320
It's inevitable that Moshang
and I would injure each other in a duel.

228
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,639
But I would absolutely never
use such despicable methods.

229
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,879
If I had intended
to deal a deadly blow,

230
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,159
Moshang would

231
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,478
not have been standing here

232
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,840
safe and sound.

233
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,840
So you admit

234
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,440
that you fought me

235
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,840
in the mortal realm?

236
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,478
Father,

237
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,799
I was wrong.

238
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,080
I shouldn't have hidden this from you.

239
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,960
Moshang is destined

240
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,159
to ascend as the next Dragon King,

241
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:57,320
and our relationship

242
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,480
would inevitably become one
of ruler and subject.

243
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,480
It was this thought

244
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,799
that led me to strike out
at him on a momentary impulse.

245
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,879
But I never thought the Demons

246
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,759
would seize the opportunity
to savagely assault him,

247
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:10,759
leaving him in critical peril.

248
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,639
That day,

249
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,440
I was also ambushed by the Demons.

250
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,039
Moshang, if you

251
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:22,680
don't believe me still,

252
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,320
I will atone for this with my life.

253
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,720
Nie Rongzhi.

254
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,119
The agony of this is nothing

255
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,799
compared to the suffering
you endured from the Yang poison.

256
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,480
If it were possible,

257
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,999
I would have taken that poison for you.

258
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,560
So please, Moshang,

259
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,999
do not forsake Father's expectations

260
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,119
or the mission of the Dragons.

261
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,400
Guys!

262
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,559
Mr. Lenghou is here with his men!

263
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,278
Go

264
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:23,440
into the council hall now.

265
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,599
This happened because of me.

266
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,880
I will take responsibility.

267
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,440
Your spiritual roots are newly awakened,

268
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,200
and your understanding
of martial cultivation is still shallow.

269
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,240
What do you

270
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,880
think you can possibly do?

271
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,359
Zhilou,

272
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:42,079
don't you understand yet?

273
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,718
Without the Dragons' protection,

274
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:44,879
we're nothing.

275
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,399
So stay out of this.

276
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,559
I'll face whatever punishment
or fight that is coming.

277
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,480
How could I let you bear it?

278
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,120
In your eyes,

279
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,079
all these years,

280
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,079
it's been my weakness and incompetence

281
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,319
that dragged our whole family down

282
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,960
and made us a laughingstock.

283
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:08,359
I just never wanted
to sink to their level.

284
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,079
I believed in keeping the peace.

285
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,319
But instead, I became a pushover
everyone walks all over.

286
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,279
I was wrong.

287
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,120
I should have learned
to play by their rules long ago.

288
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,440
Kindness should only

289
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,400
be given to those who deserve it.

290
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,518
Zhilou,

291
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,839
there are still so many things

292
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,680
that I haven't
had the chance to tell you.

293
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,160
For all these years,

294
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,200
I have caused you a world of pain.

295
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:44,680
You must have hated me for a long time.

296
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:47,640
Today is your wedding day.

297
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,599
I can't
keep making these mistakes anymore.

298
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,519
Don't hate me.

299
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,480
From now on,

300
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:00,120
no one is allowed to harm you again.

301
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,240
For the last time,

302
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,359
do as I say.

303
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:16,518
Surround them!

304
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,720
