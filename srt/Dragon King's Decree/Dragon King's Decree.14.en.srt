It's her!

26
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,929
She's the one who brought

27
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,410
the girl you're looking for here!

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,049
Search the place!

29
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,459
Say that again.

30
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,699
I dare you!

31
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,780
You've got some nerve!

32
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,049
Hiding City Lord's physician?

33
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,809
Delaying Her Lordship's treatment?

34
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,250
That's a crime!

35
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,580
Guards,

36
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,089
drag all of them to the dungeon!

37
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,250
Hold it.

38
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,340
They're my people.

39
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,089
Which dungeon are you

40
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,650
planning to throw them into?

41
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,180
Ah, Young Master.

42
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,369
My apologies.

43
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,089
I was just worried about Her Lordship.

44
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,740
We're desperate to find help for her.

45
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,970
Please let it slide.

46
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,410
Just hand over the girl we need.

47
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,060
May I ask

48
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,179
who exactly you're barging in

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,739
to find?

50
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,850
Chu Xiaoyu.

51
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,340
She's here.

52
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,019
But this afternoon,

53
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,970
she was beaten
by the apothecary's physicians.

54
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,180
She's badly hurt.

55
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,620
She's recovering now.

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,180
She can't treat anyone.

57
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,019
That's not your concern.

58
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,650
In a city this big,

59
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,579
is she really the only physician?

60
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,020
Young Master,

61
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,530
I'm taking her!

62
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,699
So this is how the Wujing City Lord

63
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,459
asks for medical help?

64
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,370
Yes. Got a problem?

65
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,459
Xiaoyu!

66
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,859
Take her!

67
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,850
Yes.

68
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,220
(I'm fine.)

69
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,060
(Thank you for saving me.)

70
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,060
Move!

71
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,220
Chu Xiaoyu!

72
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,060
Young Master,

73
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,090
you may be noble,

74
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,579
but this is still

75
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,940
Her Lordship's territory.

76
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,220
Please keep your people in line.

77
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,730
Good day.

78
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,090
If the whole city

79
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,729
is after her,

80
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,490
she must matter a lot to Wujing City Lord.

81
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,850
She'll be fine.

82
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,410
They're abusing their power!

83
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,059
I'm worried Xiaoyu

84
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,899
might get hurt again.

85
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,220
She's already so weak.

86
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,380
I'll look at the medical texts she left.

87
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,340
Maybe they'll help her.

88
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,090
Young Master,

89
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,530
looks like the Wujing City Lord
has been sick for a while.

90
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,340
And it's only getting worse.

91
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,459
Will this mess up
the Wujing Saintess' blood ritual?

92
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,209
Young Master,

93
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,460
should we report this to the sanctuary?

94
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,900
You two go back first.

95
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,940
I still have things to handle here.

96
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,019
Young Master...

97
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,329
His Highness knows what he's doing.

98
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,140
You...

99
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,730
Miss Feng, you really live here?

100
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,170
Young Lord?

101
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,290
You came all the way here for me?

102
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,089
Sorry to barge in.

103
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,209
The head of the apothecary

104
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,970
told me you're incredibly skilled.

105
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,290
I'm impressed.

106
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,970
My mother's
been battling a stubborn illness.

107
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,530
I'm here to beg for your help.

108
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,220
Please treat her.

109
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,290
You're too polite.

110
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,209
Helping people
is what we're supposed to do.

111
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,899
But what exactly is the illness?

112
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,819
Even the entire apothecary

113
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,290
couldn't fix it?

114
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,409
It's been years.

115
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,089
It's hard to explain in a few words.

116
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,409
Please come with me to the hall

117
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,530
and see her yourself.

118
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,340
No.

119
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,090
Why not?

120
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,040
The Young Lord's desperate
to save his mother.

121
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,459
He came in person to ask.

122
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,499
If I can really help her,

123
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,899
and she gets better,

124
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,700
isn't that exactly what you want?

125
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,290
Zhilou,

126
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,970
you're not an official physician
from the apothecary.

127
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,850
If you treat her

128
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,849
and she recovers,

129
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,410
that would be great.

130
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,410
But if anything goes wrong,

131
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,220
what will they pin on you?

132
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,090
Since I came myself,

133
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,459
I'll vouch for her
as the Young Lord of Wujing City.

134
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,140
I'll make sure she's safe.

135
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,820
(Butterfly Pavilion)

136
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,780
Young Master,

137
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,780
now that you're at Miss Feng's side,

138
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,290
who exactly are you to her?

139
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,220
Young Lord,

140
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,850
stop worrying

141
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,970
about things that aren't yours.

142
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,409
(Take Zhilou with you.)

143
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,290
(Bring her back unharmed.)

144
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,610
(That's what you should worry about.)

145
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,209
Yes, don't worry about it.

146
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,940
I'll be right back. Come on.

147
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,260
Mother,

148
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,729
you already took Chu Xiaoyu's medicine.

149
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,260
Are you feeling any better?

150
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,260
You've been exhausted all day.

151
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,020
Go rest first.

152
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,730
Have everyone else clear out.

153
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,610
I need quiet.

154
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
Yes.

155
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,290
My lord,

156
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,059
the Young Lord brought a physician.

157
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,730
He says she's here to treat you.

158
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,699
It's

159
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,410
Feng Zhilou.

160
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,820
Let her in.

161
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,220
I want to see

162
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,610
what she's really like.

163
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,700
Yes.

164
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,379
Everyone, step out.

165
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,700
Chu Xiaoyu stays.

166
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,130
So you're the physician Yan mentioned?

167
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,370
I'm flattered.

168
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,180
I'm Feng Zhilou.

169
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,940
Greetings, my lord.

170
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,610
At first glance,

171
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,010
you look a lot like someone
I used to know.

172
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,820
How old are you?

173
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,490
Born in the Year of the Serpent.

174
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,820
(Same year as Liluo.)

175
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,940
My lord.

176
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,420
This is?

177
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,859
Feng Qingfeng personally said

178
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,010
that child already passed.

179
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,890
It's been confirmed?

180
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,689
There really was a plague in Feng Manor.

181
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,019
A lot of children died.

182
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,010
Their bones were buried outside
the village.

183
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,569
From what I saw,

184
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,289
after that plague,
Feng Manor never again

185
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,379
raised a child the way
they did Qingfeng's.

186
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,580
There was a concubine's daughter

187
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,940
who was treated like a disgrace.

188
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,250
If she were really hers,

189
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,250
Feng Manor and Feng Qingfeng

190
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,180
would never have cast her aside.

191
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,890
I heard

192
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,130
you almost married into the Dragons

193
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,540
and awakened the nine spiritual roots.

194
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,730
Those are just rumors.

195
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,940
I'm only here to treat your condition.

196
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,010
Straightforward, I like it.

197
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,420
Come closer.

198
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,890
May I ask,

199
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,099
when it flares up,

200
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,460
what does it feel like?

201
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,420
It hurts.

202
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,420
Feels like a thousand needles
stabbing me.

203
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,169
What I hate most

204
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,219
is my face

205
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,499
looking old

206
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,700
and ugly.

207
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,130
Then I'll be blunt.

208
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,940
I've seen

209
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,339
a strange illness like this

210
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,610
in an old medical text.

211
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,289
It's a type of poisoning.

212
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,529
It started with a tonic meant

213
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,339
to boost longevity.

214
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,289
But that tonic

215
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,409
didn't agree with your body.

216
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,940
So, it backfired.

217
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,809
The more you took,

218
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,169
year after year,

219
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,850
the stronger the toxin became.

220
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,219
Eventually,

221
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,540
it seeped into your bones.

222
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,940
The pain became unbearable.

223
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,300
It's worse than death.

224
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,049
How do we cure it?

225
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,610
At its core,

226
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,700
this illness comes from obsession.

227
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,289
If someone is fixated on living forever

228
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,490
or staying young,

229
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,940
even miracle pills

230
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,300
won't save them.

231
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,180
What are you implying?

232
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,769
Aging and illness

233
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,300
are part of life.

234
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,490
We humans

235
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,289
aren't dragons or demons.

236
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,660
We don't live forever.

237
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,540
Trying to fight fate

238
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,529
and taking those longevity tonics

239
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,340
only drains the body

240
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,220
and speeds aging.

241
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,769
I never believed

242
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,929
in fate.

243
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,970
I refuse to accept aging.

244
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,809
It's hurting again!

245
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,499
It hurts!

246
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,970
It's starting again!

247
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,180
It hurts so much!

248
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,850
Chu Xiaoyu, you idiot!

249
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,610
Bring me the pain medicine now!

250
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,610
Xiaoyu!

251
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,300
It hurts!

252
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,540
Hurry!

253
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,940
Help me!

254
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,379
What are you doing?

255
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,379
Your lord is poisoned

256
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,499
down to the bone.

257
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,130
Xiaoyu's done everything she can!

258
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,460
You talk too much!

259
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,460
It hurts!

260
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,259
It hurts so much!

261
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,569
Help me!

262
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,739
Please help me!

263
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,460
Please, I'm begging you!

264
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,890
Her blood's boiling now.

265
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,499
The more upset she gets,

266
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,739
the worse the toxin reacts!

267
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,099
If you don't move,

268
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,850
she'll die from the pain!

269
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,890
Please help me!

270
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,339
It hurts.

271
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,660
Follow my lead.

272
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,580
Steady your mind.

273
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,660
Feng Zhilou,

274
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,850
you're seriously something.

275
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,580
Your medical skill and martial skill

276
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,010
both

277
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,090
are on another level.

278
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,060
No wonder the Dragons back you up.

279
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,820
Saving lives

280
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,660
is my duty.

281
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,300
It has nothing to do with them.

282
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,490
Well said.

283
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,820
But

284
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,180
you still can't cure me!

285
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,130
So you're still getting punished!

286
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,540
Who said I can't?

287
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,090
I'll give you three days.

288
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,859
Half a month.

289
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,739
No way.

290
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,130
Not even a day less.

291
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,739
Chu Xiaoyu's medicine

292
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,610
do help.

293
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,420
But to fix it for good,

294
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,540
I need time to find the cure.

295
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,769
If the dose

296
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,739
is even a little off,

297
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,420
it'll get worse.

298
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,730
Half a month.

299
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,490
Not one day less.

300
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,940
If you don't cure Her Lordship,

301
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,610
you won't leave Wujing alive.

302
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,339
Let's go.

303
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,180
Hold it.

304
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,730
She's not going anywhere.

305
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,580
She stays to help with the pain.

306
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,010
My lord,

307
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,049
I need Chu Xiaoyu

308
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,569
to assist me

309
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,730
for the cure.

310
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,220
So, please have someone
send her safely back to my place.

311
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,660
In half a month,

312
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,180
we'll meet again.

313
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,180
I'll wait for you.

314
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,420
(Don't worry. I'll come back.)

315
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,700
(Longevity Hall)

316
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,970
My lord,

317
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,339
she's way too full of herself.

318
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,460
We can't let her stay.

319
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,660
Do you think

320
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,300
she might be Yue's daughter?

321
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,899
Her look,

322
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,219
her eyes,

323
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,610
and that infuriating arrogance!

324
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,660
She's like her.

325
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,890
Too much like her.

326
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,130
Then

327
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,890
I'll kill her now!

328
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,420
Let her cure me first.

329
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,379
We can kill her after.

330
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,460
Yes.

331
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,340
Miss Feng.

332
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,409
I want Chu Xiaoyu

333
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,739
home safe and sound.

334
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,289
Don't worry.

335
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,460
I'll make sure of it.

336
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,739
Miss Feng,

337
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,660
is there a way to cure my mother?

338
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,610
It's tough,

339
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,049
but not hopeless.

340
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:07,059
No matter how nobles here

341
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,770
treat the common folk,

342
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,180
I gave my word.

343
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,620
I'll give it everything I've got.

344
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,140
But in this world,

345
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,728
physicians heal,

346
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,770
and patients rely on them.

347
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,689
If physicians aren't respected,

348
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,539
who's left to save anyone?

349
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,859
You're compassionate,

350
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,220
and I'm grateful.

351
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,689
But I don't understand

352
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,770
what you mean.

353
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,489
Do you know how Chu Xiaoyu
gets treated normally?

354
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,169
And how she was treated

355
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,729
when she cured Her Lordship?

356
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,409
Do you know that the moment

357
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,100
I refuse to treat her,

358
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,220
their archers will let loose?

359
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,490
Is this how you're trying to force me?

360
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,689
I, Feng Zhilou,

361
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,490
don't bow to anyone.

362
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,660
You misunderstand.

363
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,010
I meant no harm.

364
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,899
Please, Young Lord,

365
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,490
don't waste my time.

366
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,730
I've already sworn to Her Lordship.

367
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,570
If I can't find the cure,

368
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,050
both Chu Xiaoyu
and I will lose our lives if I fail.

369
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,620
Remember this.

370
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,180
I want Chu Xiaoyu

371
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,620
back safe and unharmed.

372
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,620
Thank you.
