25
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:04,876
Father,

26
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:05,916
this time,

27
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,996
I really can't cover
for Moshang anymore.

28
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:10,037
He broke through

29
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,595
the barrier you set

30
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:13,117
just to see Feng Zhilou.

31
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:16,317
I tried to convince him
to come back to the sanctuary,

32
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,516
but I never imagined

33
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:19,676
he would team up with Feng Zhilou

34
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:23,197
and use the sigil
to injure me this badly.

35
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:24,956
Where's Shang now?

36
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:27,116
He has to be with Feng Zhilou.

37
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,475
He's completely blinded by love.

38
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:32,676
We kept waiting for Prince Shang
to come to his senses,

39
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:35,795
but instead he betrayed us.

40
00:02:35,796 --> 00:02:39,477
Just who is Feng Zhilou?

41
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:43,997
How could she drive a wedge
between two dragon princes?

42
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:46,676
She's vicious!

43
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:48,075
She's practically a demon!

44
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:49,116
Your Majesty,

45
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:52,276
we went to the mortal realm
to meet Feng Zhilou

46
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:54,716
to help Prince Shang
break that obsession.

47
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:56,595
Feng Zhilou is the illegitimate daughter

48
00:02:56,596 --> 00:02:57,836
of the Feng family.

49
00:02:57,837 --> 00:03:01,080
Before she met Prince Shang, she had
no spiritual root and couldn't cultivate at all.

50
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,876
She made a pact with the sigil.

51
00:03:02,877 --> 00:03:05,195
Her extreme Yin body
can cure the Yang poison.

52
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:07,676
That's how she bonded with Prince Shang.

53
00:03:07,677 --> 00:03:09,836
In terms of ability and character,

54
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:11,437
she may be mortal,

55
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:13,276
but she's far better suited

56
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,635
than Princess Liluo

57
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:16,437
to become Dragon Queen.

58
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:19,556
Your Majesty,

59
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:21,317
things are not as Prince Zhi
described them

60
00:03:21,557 --> 00:03:23,276
Prince Zhi fought Prince Shang.

61
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:26,276
Prince Shang has lost his dragon horns
and without the dragon pearl to heal him,

62
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:27,595
his organs are severely damaged.

63
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:29,236
That's why he hasn't returned.

64
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:30,595
Even without the dragon pearl,

65
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:32,355
Prince Shang forced his way
to the mortal realm

66
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:33,595
because he sensed Feng Zhilou

67
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:36,157
and the dragon child were in danger.

68
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:39,236
What?

69
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:41,636
Bai Lu,

70
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,956
what did you just say?

71
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,916
You said Feng Zhilou's
carrying a dragon child?

72
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:50,035
Your Majesty, it's true.

73
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:52,757
After a thousand years,
you're finally going to have a grandson.

74
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:59,276
Shang always acts like

75
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:00,836
he has no interest in anything.

76
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:02,437
He finally came to his senses.

77
00:04:03,997 --> 00:04:05,836
How did he suddenly come to his senses?

78
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:06,676
Elder,

79
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:07,156
hurry up.

80
00:04:07,157 --> 00:04:09,276
Read my grandson's future.

81
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:10,156
Alright.

82
00:04:10,157 --> 00:04:11,956
Your Majesty, how could
an ordinary woman

83
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:13,515
conceive a dragon child so easily?

84
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:16,195
What Prince Shang said is true.

85
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:18,276
Princess Liluo
isn't the Wujing Saintess.

86
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:20,075
Feng Zhilou is the real one.

87
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:21,075
Fei Yuan,

88
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:22,716
don't try to mislead us.

89
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:26,116
An ordinary woman
can bear a dragon child too.

90
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:28,156
It's just that when the child is born,

91
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,437
both mother and child are likely to die.

92
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,877
Until the child is born,

93
00:04:33,117 --> 00:04:35,356
nothing is certain.

94
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:36,275
Your Majesty,

95
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,476
Prince Shang is barely holding on.

96
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:39,796
I beg the sanctuary to show mercy

97
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:42,317
and save Prince Shang and his child.

98
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:44,916
We're willing to risk our life

99
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,437
to plead for Prince Shang
and Feng Zhilou.

100
00:04:47,677 --> 00:04:48,635
Your Majesty,

101
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:51,195
even if you hold a grudge
against Feng Zhilou,

102
00:04:51,196 --> 00:04:54,916
we can't leave Prince Shang
and his child in the mortal realm.

103
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:57,317
We'll go with you to the mortal realm.

104
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:16,315
No matter what,

105
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,877
bring Shang back.

106
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,476
I want to hear him explain everything.

107
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:34,836
Follow me.

108
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:36,236
They should be over there.

109
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:38,036
You must capture them for me.

110
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:38,877
Hurry up.

111
00:05:38,956 --> 00:05:39,797
Keep up.

112
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:42,635
You two, search over there.

113
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:43,636
Yes.

114
00:05:45,117 --> 00:05:46,076
Let's go. Hurry up.

115
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:00,636
Search carefully.

116
00:06:00,716 --> 00:06:01,956
Yes.

117
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:07,156
Nothing.

118
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,317
Nothing here either.

119
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:10,836
Nothing.

120
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:20,476
Keep looking.

121
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:22,237
You must find Yue, Feng Zhilou

122
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,877
and Prince Shang.

123
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:25,556
They couldn't have run far.

124
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:26,437
Yes.

125
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:30,116
I'm a nine-hundred-year-old
flood dragon.

126
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,715
Mortals like you

127
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:34,117
will never find the barrier I set.

128
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:42,917
Zhilou and Prince Shang, please be safe.

129
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:44,917
Chu Moshang,

130
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:47,276
the child and I need you.

131
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:49,636
You have to wake up.

132
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:52,276
You think I'll remember you forever?

133
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:55,197
Let me tell you.

134
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:57,437
That's not going to happen.

135
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:00,636
Your sigil,

136
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:02,317
your heart-guard scale,

137
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:04,237
your Icebound Sword,

138
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:06,516
everything that belongs to you...

139
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:08,357
If you die,

140
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:10,357
I'll throw them all away.

141
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:12,117
I won't keep anything.

142
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:13,357
If

143
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:16,757
Fei Yuan and Bai Lu can't
bring back your dragon pearl,

144
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,877
I'll stay right here.

145
00:07:19,117 --> 00:07:20,797
I'll stay by your side.

146
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:22,917
I'll stay with you

147
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:25,395
until our child is born.

148
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:27,676
Then I'll use my own death

149
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:28,796
to tear off this cursed sigil

150
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:30,317
and give it back to you.

151
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:36,476
You have to wake up.

152
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:38,997
You're the Dragon God.

153
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:40,437
Every creature in this world

154
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,317
needs your protection.

155
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:33,036
Zhilou,

156
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:34,635
what you're seeing now

157
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:35,836
is my soul.

158
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:38,476
The heart-guard scale holds
a fragment of my soul.

159
00:08:38,516 --> 00:08:39,917
That's how I can appear before you.

160
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:41,037
But

161
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:43,317
I can only stay for a moment.

162
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:44,917
Chu Moshang,

163
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:47,637
I know everything

164
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:49,076
you've done for me.

165
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:50,836
Why are you so foolish?

166
00:08:51,276 --> 00:08:52,956
You gave me every precious thing

167
00:08:52,957 --> 00:08:53,996
you have.

168
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:55,596
Ever since I was born,

169
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,876
there's been only one voice in my ear.

170
00:08:58,396 --> 00:08:59,917
As the Dragon Prince,

171
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:01,716
the heir to the sanctuary

172
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:03,037
and to the Dragon King,

173
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:05,716
I had to become stronger.

174
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:07,596
Only with enough power

175
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:10,637
could I protect the sanctuary
and the mortal realm.

176
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:13,317
That duty was carved into my bones.

177
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:14,836
I never

178
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:17,716
complained about it.

179
00:09:18,396 --> 00:09:19,317
I never gave up.

180
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:21,076
I never questioned it

181
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:24,197
until I met you.

182
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:26,716
It's almost funny.

183
00:09:26,837 --> 00:09:28,035
To everyone else,

184
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:30,956
the high and mighty,
all-powerful Dragon God

185
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,116
is nothing more than a man
betrayed by his own family,

186
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:36,356
tortured by the Yang poison,

187
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,520
and a pitiful wretch
who has disappointed his father.

188
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:40,917
But it was those moments

189
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:43,876
of weakness and pain

190
00:09:44,997 --> 00:09:46,397
that made me feel

191
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:48,517
truly alive.

192
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:50,356
Thank you, Zhilou.

193
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,677
You're the one who showed me

194
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:54,397
that I can protect the world

195
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:57,157
yet still fail to protect myself.

196
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,037
I regret nothing.

197
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:00,996
Everything I've done

198
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:02,797
was to keep you safe.

199
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:04,277
Take our child

200
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:06,756
and live a good life.

201
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:09,157
If only one of us

202
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:11,037
could survive,

203
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:12,397
I want it to be you.

204
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:14,116
That's why

205
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:16,517
I gave you the heart-guard scale.

206
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,596
It feels strange

207
00:10:25,237 --> 00:10:26,716
to see myself like this.

208
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:33,197
Even if there's only a glimmer of hope,

209
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:36,157
I won't give up.

210
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:52,199
Let's think about something happy.

♪The rust-stained sword

212
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,397
I was thinking

213
00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:59,799
that once everything is resolved,

214
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,037
we could go back
to the Feng Manor together.

215
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:04,596
If you plan

216
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:06,611
to take the child back to the sanctuary,

00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:18,356
living at the Feng Manor,

222
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:19,437
free,

223
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:20,956
growing up wild and strong.

224
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:22,699
More than having a son,

225
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:25,116
I actually hope for a daughter.

226
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:26,677
I believe you'd

227
00:11:27,237 --> 00:11:28,716
help her grow into someone

228
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:30,917
extraordinary at the sanctuary.

229
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:31,911
Alright.

what happens to a Dragon after death?

00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:48,599
I see.

237
00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:51,637
Human lives are short.

238
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,536
In the end, we all return to dust.

239
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,596
We're not so different.

240
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:02,557
In the near future,

241
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:07,716
we'll meet again

242
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:09,956
somewhere close.

243
00:12:14,237 --> 00:12:15,677

To possess such skill
at such a young age,

248
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:08,277
you're truly incredible.

249
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:10,275
Xiaoyu studied medicine
under Physician Chu.

250
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:12,560
She's more than qualified to be
the head of the apothecary.

251
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,476
I remember the only person
in Wujing City

252
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,716
with such skill was Physician Chu.

253
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:19,836
He's a stubborn old man.

254
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:20,836
He always said

255
00:13:20,837 --> 00:13:23,716
he'd only pass down his craft
to someone he approved of.

256
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,716
He clearly made the right choice.

257
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:30,277
I miss Zhilou.

258
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:33,197
I want to hold her like this every day.

259
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:34,476
When you see her again,

260
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:36,157
you'll be able to hold her
just like this.

261
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:40,397
Xiaoyu,

262
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:41,876
it's almost time.

263
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:43,037
We have to go.

264
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:48,756
Zhilou hasn't visited me lately.

265
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,116
Be honest with me.

266
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:53,637
Is she in danger?

267
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,517
Ms. Yue,

268
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:06,157
Zhilou and Prince Shang love each other.

269
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:09,716
But because Liluo
was promised to him first,

270
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:12,515
Prince Shang gave up
his Dragon God power

271
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:14,476
and his dragon pearl to be with Zhilou.

272
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:16,956
Recently he was injured
during an ambush.

273
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,917
We're waiting for them to return too.

274
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:20,435
Do you know why Liluo

275
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:22,397
was able to become the Wujing Saintess?

276
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:24,517
Zhilou and I

277
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:26,797
are the descendants
of the Wujing Saintess.

278
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:28,637
The Feng Manor

279
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,716
is her homeland.

280
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:34,037
No matter what trick your mother pulled,

281
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:36,317
Zhilou and Prince Shang

282
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:38,397
still found each other
at the Feng Manor.

283
00:14:38,717 --> 00:14:40,437
It's fate.

284
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:42,836
They're a match made in heaven.

285
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:46,076
I'm sorry, Ms. Yue.

286
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:47,716
I don't blame you.

287
00:14:48,156 --> 00:14:49,476
I'm alright.

288
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,797
Whatever happens between Zhilou
and Prince Shang

289
00:14:51,997 --> 00:14:53,677
is written by destiny.

290
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:55,435
Every hardship they face

291
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,277
is a trial they must overcome.

292
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,035
Only by surviving them

293
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:01,236
can they begin anew.

294
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:03,996
The Dragon God and the Wujing Saintess

295
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:05,716
will protect them.

296
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:06,795
Back then,

297
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:07,915
I let my role as a mother

298
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,917
cloud my judgment.

299
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:14,716
How did I end up
with a daughter like Liluo?

300
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:32,880
I've caused you so much trouble, Xiaoyu.

301
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:41,836
Xiaoyu,

302
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,277
your willingness to look after me

303
00:15:44,396 --> 00:15:45,876
touches me deeply.

304
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:48,116
Even though I can't see you well,

305
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:50,996
I can feel you here with me.

306
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:52,596
Thank you

307
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:54,557
