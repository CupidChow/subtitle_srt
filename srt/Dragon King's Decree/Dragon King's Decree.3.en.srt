They're demons!

188
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,668
Demons!

189
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:55,188
Feng Yunqiao,

190
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:56,590
shut your mouth!

191
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,509
You made a mess in front of the Dragons

192
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,788
and still refuse to own up to it?

193
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:02,909
You!

194
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,509
Are you trying to drag us down

195
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,269
with you?

196
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,749
What a shameful sight.

197
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:14,989
You old, disrespectful fool,

198
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,788
your conscience

199
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:18,070
is no cleaner than hers.

200
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,869
Who are you to judge her?

201
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,989
Feng Zhilou,

202
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,428
don't get carried away.

203
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:22,989
That's right.

204
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,470
What are you talking about?

205
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,869
I'm talking about you, old man!

206
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,788
You're full of talk about family honor
and meddling in everyone's affairs,

207
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:31,828
but all you do is use your power
to boss people around.

208
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:32,588
What's it?

209
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:33,668
Just because you're old,

210
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,188
no one can challenge you?

211
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:35,869
You!

212
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,668
Honestly,

213
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,828
you're the biggest
troublemaker in this family!

214
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:39,950
You!

215
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:44,470
And you too.

216
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:46,989
You abandoned your aging father at home

217
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,908
and treated your wife like nothing.

218
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:49,828
If your mother knew

219
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:51,349
how you turned out,

220
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,428
she'd be rolling in her grave!

221
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:54,269
You!

222
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:56,308
Your son is a treasure to you,

223
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:57,908
and your daughter is disposable.

224
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,548
You worked her to the bone

225
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:01,629
and forced her
to marry an old man as a concubine.

226
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:04,029
She ended up
throwing herself into the river.

227
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,068
If I were her,

228
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:06,229
I'd come back as a ghost

229
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,790
and drag you down with me!

230
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,269
Feng Qingfeng,

231
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:23,909
surprising, isn't it?

232
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,908
The person you were so eager
to see executed

233
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:28,229
is standing here alive.

234
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:30,310
Are you disappointed?

235
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,229
Feng Manor

236
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:38,269
may have given me life,

237
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,029
but it never raised me.

238
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,308
I may be a girl

239
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,509
without a spiritual root,

240
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,710
but I never deserved death.

241
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:48,909
You framed me
and pinned false charges on me.

242
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,190
You even tried to drown me.

243
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,670
I've already repaid the life

244
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,710
you gave me.

245
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,190
From today on,

246
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:59,149
we have nothing to do with each other.

247
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,109
Zhilou,

248
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,389
you've misunderstood.

249
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,269
Zhilou,

250
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,670
you're a daughter of the Feng family.

251
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:12,948
You should follow our traditions

252
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,790
and do your duty.

253
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:17,629
If you want to leave,

254
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,590
the only way is through marriage.

255
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:20,989
Otherwise,

256
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,350
you can never step out of this place.

257
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:24,909
I'm...

258
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,989
the Feng family head.

259
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:29,869
I will stop you

260
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,470
with my life.

261
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,190
What a grand, mighty family head.

262
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:38,749
It's just marriage, isn't it?

263
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,269
Fine, I'll do it.

264
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:41,710
But I decide

265
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,109
who I marry.

266
00:12:56,562 --> 00:13:02,336
♪Like petals fall, gone with the clouds♪

267
00:13:02,337 --> 00:13:08,332
♪Like stars fade fast in open skies♪

268
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:14,148
♪Like snowflakes melting softly
in the evening haze♪

269
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:20,473
♪Like your fleeting glance
that gave me one brief dream's grace♪

270
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:26,407
♪Like fireflies flicker
through wild grass, fleeting light♪

271
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:32,144
♪Like evening breeze
that stirs soft hair in twilight♪

272
00:13:32,424 --> 00:13:38,148
♪Like fleeting thoughts
that surge and then unwind♪

273
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:44,086
♪Chance meetings fade,
just empty rooms left behind♪

274
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:49,719
♪You brought a wave
that stirred a wild, restless sea♪

275
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:55,894
♪Light as a feather,
yet it sank an island deep in me♪

276
00:13:56,074 --> 00:14:02,632
♪In that one moment,
life's grip I couldn't break or sway♪

277
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:08,394
♪Leaving me lost in memories,
small and fading away♪
