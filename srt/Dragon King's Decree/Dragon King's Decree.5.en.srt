25
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,418
This is the outbreak of the Yang poison.

26
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:07,120
Young Master has become a stick.
How should we explain this at the sanctuary?

27
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:09,140
Be careful. Young Master might bite you.

28
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:10,780
He doesn't look like Young Master.

29
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,659
Young Master isn't that ugly.

30
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:15,979
He's not as ugly as you anyway.

31
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:20,780
Young Master has turned into a stick.
Why didn't Feng Zhilou?

32
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,459
Could she be the antidote

33
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,060
and was eaten by Young Master?

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,180
We need to offer him up.

35
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,979
Some more fruit offerings.

36
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,139
Fruit offerings...

37
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,740
And the incense too.

38
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,778
This bow

39
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:52,939
is my longing for you, Young Master.

40
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,699
The second bow is for yearning.

41
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,340
The third bow is for mourning.

42
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,900
Pretty sweet.

43
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:13,740
Staying here

44
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:15,659
can help restore your energy.

45
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:22,099
Why did you bring me here?

46
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,659
The extreme Yin energy
that Fei Yuan and Bai Lu mentioned...

47
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,299
Could I really save you?

48
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,259
Yes.

49
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,538
So I'm not completely worthless.

50
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,780
The Feng family couldn't
detect your spiritual roots.

51
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:52,900
Maybe because the extreme cold Yin energy
lies within your body.

52
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,259
You're saying

53
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,740
that I have spiritual roots?

54
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,620
I'm not useless?

55
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:02,060
Not only that,

56
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,859
you have nine spiritual roots.

57
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:18,938
Even if you wanted to trick me
into helping you expel the poison,

58
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,979
you didn't have to make
such a big joke about it.

59
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,499
Once I help you dispel

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,099
the extreme cold Yin energy
in your body,

61
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,658
you'll know whether what I said

62
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:27,020
is true or false.

63
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,800
If there's such a good thing,
why didn't you say it earlier?

64
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,619
Expel it!

65
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:32,579
Right now?

66
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,658
What are we waiting for?

67
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:34,739
Right now.

68
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,218
What...

69
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:14,419
What are you doing?

70
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,340
What are you doing?

71
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:19,259
You...

72
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,340
What are you doing to me?

73
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,220
Didn't you want to help me
cure the Yang poison?

74
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,920
Didn't you want to help me
expel the cold energy?

75
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,858
What's the difference?

76
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:26,700
You...

77
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,220
But you didn't tell me
this is how you'd expel it!

78
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:31,140
We have gender differences.

79
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:33,299
All physical appearances are illusions.

80
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,499
Gender differences

81
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,099
exist only for the sake of reproduction.

82
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,099
Also, let's be clear.

83
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,220
You asked me to help you
dispel the extreme Yin energy.

84
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,619
This is also the only way
to cure the Yang poison.

85
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:45,619
I want to go out.

86
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,538
Where exactly has Young Master gone?

87
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:55,380
Did anything happen?

88
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,819
Young Master,

89
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,939
you finally came back.

90
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,580
Where did you transform to?

91
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,900
The sigil space.

92
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,139
I see.

93
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,418
Truly eye-opening.

94
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,419
This wood carving is so miraculous.

95
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,380
Has the poison been cured?

96
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,899
What's wrong?

97
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,939
Miss Zhilou,

98
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,858
did curing the poison harm your energy

99
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:20,059
and make you feel unwell?

100
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,019
The harmonization of Yin and Yang

101
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,820
shouldn't bring such consequences.

102
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,418
So you all actually know

103
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:31,260
about the harmonization of Yin and Yang?

104
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,299
Otherwise?

105
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,940
You guys really have no shame.

106
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,780
Young Master,

107
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:50,059
what happened?

108
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:52,619
The poison wasn't cured.

109
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,140
She changed her mind.

110
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,778
It seems that humans

111
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:01,659

We have gender differences.

118

Why does it look like
Young Master's cheeks are flushed?

123
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,418
Have you noticed

124

that Young Master has been
acting strangely lately?

clearly enjoying it.

Look.

He's smiling again.

131
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,538
Have you seen him smile once
in the past?

132
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,340
He even smiled twice.

You sure have a leisure life.

Something serious happened
at Feng Manor,

137
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,859
yet you were completely unaware.

138
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,739
What do you mean by that?

139
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,859
Yesterday,

140
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,859
my son was injured by Feng Zhilou

141

at Feng Manor territory.

142
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:44,619
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

143
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:46,139
Hurry up and bring her out.

144
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:48,778
Please calm down.

145
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,418
Once I investigate this matter,

146
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,899
I will certainly
give you an explanation.

147
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,739
Your empty words

148
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,538
are useless to me now.

149
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,099
I'm not someone
who causes trouble for no reason,

150
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,458
but you must

151
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,540
give me an explanation now.

152
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,298
I'm going to tell Zhilou.

153
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,578
I need to tell Zhilou.

00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,180
I need to tell her.

155
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,178
When that shameless couple are together,

156
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:29,979
their spiritual power will multiply.

157
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:32,940
There's still a long stretch
of time ahead.

158
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,779
I have plenty of methods.

159
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,220
Since being together doesn't work,

160
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,580
then I'll separate them.

161
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,139
Moshang,

162
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:05,019
just rest inside the barrier

163
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,619
I set up.

164
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,619

165
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,658

Jia Yu,

167
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,418
what's wrong? Speak slowly.

168
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:12,658
Those two bad guys...

Lenghou Zong

170
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,219
came looking for you again.

171
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,259
He said you hit him.

172
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,259
You should run.

173
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:21,979
So annoying.

174
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,219
Then don't blame me

175
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,938
for taking action against Feng Manor.

176
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:28,580
If you have something,
come at me instead!

177
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,979
You're taking responsibility bravely.

178
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,058
Who gave you the courage

179
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:40,700
to injure my son?

180
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:46,739
Why are you

181
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,259
acting pitiful here?

182
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,099
You sneak-attacked me first.

183
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,298
Couldn't I even fight back?

184
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:52,700
Utter nonsense!

185
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:54,139
My family

186
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,660
would never commit such cowardly deeds.

187
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,220
Zhilou,

188
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,499
we were meant to be a perfect match.

189
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,178
Why let a few misunderstandings

190
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:03,979
delay our lifelong union?

191
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,139
Since we've cleared the misunderstandings,
let our engagement continue.

192
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,259
Is that okay?

193
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,099
How could I possibly

194
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,220
marry someone like you?

195
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:12,578
Or do you think

196
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,420
I don't know
what scheme you're plotting?

197
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,619
Feng Qingfeng,

198
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:21,938
forgive my bluntness,

199
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:23,139
but your daughter

200
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,058
is truly rude.

201
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,019
From her behavior,

202
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,779
I see no trace of etiquette or shame.

203
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,099
If not for my son's affection for her,

204
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,460
this marriage

205
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,859
would not be able to continue.

206
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,979
Father!

207
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,058
My heart is set on Zhilou.

208
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:38,220
It's only her.

209
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:39,979
I don't care about auspicious dates.

210
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,540
Today, I want

211
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:43,499
to marry her right here.

212
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,979
Bring the chairs!

213
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,220
Isn't this a bit rushed?

214
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,180
The way you mentioned

215
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,499
etiquette and shame really

216
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,460
disgusts me.

217
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,298
I'm

218
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:59,458
not arrogant,

219
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:00,658
foolish,

220
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:01,859
or greedy.

221
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,379
I will not marry into your family

222
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,019
just because I'm
an illegitimate daughter,

223
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,938
nor will I knowingly

224
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:07,619
collude with you for Uncle Qingyun's

225
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,219
medical skills,

226
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,940
selling marriage for profit.

227
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:12,899
If you want me to marry Lenghou Zong,

228
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:14,739
there is only one possibility.

229
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,220
Take my corpse

230
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,139
and have

231
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,180
a posthumous marriage.

232
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,139
Allowing you to speak before me

233
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,420
is already giving you
the highest courtesy.

234
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,019
Don't take advantage of it.

235
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,578
Once the ceremony

236
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:10,859
has been performed,

237
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,220
you'll be a member of our family.

238
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,379
Zong!

239
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,779
The wedding ceremony starts!

240
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,940
First, pay respect to heaven and earth.

241
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:45,499
Fei Yuann, Bai Lu,

242
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,540
do you feel anything?

243
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:50,259
Young Master,

244
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,259
what's wrong?

245
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:53,660
No, I don't feel anything.

246
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:07,379
The barrier...

247
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,899
It's Mr. Qingyun's barrier.

248
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,778
It seems the barrier has cut

249
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,379
the connection between me and her.

250
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:24,859
Young Master, the Yang poison is spreading!

251
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,340
Stop talking nonsense.

252
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:47,940
Second, pay respect to your parents.

253
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:04,540
The couple gives each other a bow.

254
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:16,499
No...

255
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:39,649
♪Like petals fall, gone with the clouds♪

256
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:45,645
♪Like stars fade fast in open skies♪

257
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:51,461
♪Like snowflakes melting softly
in the evening haze♪

258
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:57,786
♪Like your fleeting glance
that gave me one brief dream's grace♪

259
00:15:57,787 --> 00:16:03,720
♪Like fireflies flicker
through wild grass, fleeting light♪

260
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:09,457
♪Like evening breeze
that stirs soft hair in twilight♪

261
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:15,461
♪Like fleeting thoughts
that surge and then unwind♪

262
00:16:15,462 --> 00:16:21,399
♪Chance meetings fade,
just empty rooms left behind♪

263
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,032
♪You brought a wave
that stirred a wild, restless sea♪

264
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:33,207
♪Light as a feather,
yet it sank an island deep in me♪

265
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:39,945
♪In that one moment,
life's grip I couldn't break or sway♪

266
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:45,707
♪Leaving me lost in memories,
small and fading away♪
