=Episode 13=

25
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,739
I saw everything you did

26
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,849
back there.

27
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,010
Your character and skills

28
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,340
both impressed me.

29
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,419
You flatter me, Young Lord.

30
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,690
We're heading home.

31
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,489
Go report to Lord Dhuta

32
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,209
the man with Miss Feng

33
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,609
is the Dragon Prince Chu Moshang.

34
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,780
Yes.

35
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,500
When you meet the Dragon Prince,

36
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,810
mind your manners.

37
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,489
Don't worry, Mother.

38
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,740
I'll make sure he's pleased.

39
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,850
The Dragon Prince has arrived!

40
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,820
(Longevity Hall)

41
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,139
Wujing City Lord

42
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,740
and Princess Liluo

43
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,609
welcome the Dragon Prince.

44
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,220
Welcome, Dragon Prince.

45
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,780
Rise.

46
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,609
I came here

47
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,859
to finish the ritual

48
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,410
for the Wujing Saintess.

49
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,049
It's my duty

50
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,900
to serve the sanctuary.

51
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,060
Prepare everything within three days.

52
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,740
We'll complete
the inspection ritual then.

53
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,370
Sooner is better.

54
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,809
Your marriage with Liluo

55
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,419
can move forward.

56
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,929
Once it's done,

57
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,019
the Dragon King

58
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,690
will handle the rest.

59
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,460
The Young Lord has arrived!

60
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,579
Greetings, Mother.

61
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,859
I brought a gift for Liluo.

62
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,020
Sorry I'm late.

63
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,179
You must be the Dragon Prince.

64
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,460
I'm Li Yan.

65
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,900
It's an honor to meet you.

66
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,620
If that's all,

67
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,850
I'll take my leave.

68
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:19,340
Please wait, Young Master.

69
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,650
Would you join us for lunch

70
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,849
to spend more time with Liluo?

71
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,090
No need.

72
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,410
Safe travels, Young Master.

73
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,730
Have you seen her?

74
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,170
No.

75
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,490
Seen this woman?

76
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,940
No idea.

77
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,649
Sir.

78
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,379
Nope, never seen her.

79
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,730
Have you seen her?

80
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,850
Miss, have you seen her?

81
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,579
No.

82
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,020
(Finding one person in Wujing City)

83
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,000
(is like searching the ocean
for a single needle.)

84
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,170
(So many years have passed, )

85
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,170
(and with only a single sketch, )

86
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,260
(how could I possibly
find out where Mother went?)

87
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,410
Mother,

88
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,209
I want the Dragon Prince
to think about me nonstop

89
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,850
and never forget me.

90
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,850
Why does it matter
what he feels about you?

91
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,970
What matters is he can't refuse
this marriage.

92
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,340
We've got everything under control.

93
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,850
No need to panic.

94
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,619
You all may go.

95
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,780
Yes.

96
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,580
My lord,

97
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,529
we've been watching the girl

98
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,289
who was supposed to marry the Dragons.

99
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,700
The village girl, Feng Zhilou.

100
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,650
The one she was meant to marry

101
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,209
is the Dragon Prince
of the sanctuary, Prince Shang.

102
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,580
What?

103
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,900
It's true.

104
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,410
Mother,

105
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,490
I saw them yesterday.

106
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,209
So, her name is Feng Zhilou.

107
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,170
She's brave and righteous.

108
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,409
Prince Shang
is fiercely protective of her.

109
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,220
There's something between them.

110
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,649
Dark Dhuta.

111
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,579
Yes!

112
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,090
You know what to do.

113
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,970
Understood!

114
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,409
The inspection ritual is coming up.

115
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,209
Where did this girl even pop out from?

116
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,410
A village girl thinks she
can marry the Dragon Prince?

117
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,170
Marry him?

118
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,459
Miss Feng is the prince's...

119
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,700
Nonsense!

120
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,409
It was just some trivial

121
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,340
nonsense they never even finished.

122
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,530
Liluo,

123
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,460
don't get jealous

124
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,090
and lose your composure.

125
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,820
Mother,

126
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,610
I'm the only one
who can be the Dragon Queen.

127
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,410
Yan.

128
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,410
Yes.

129
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,780
Mother,

130
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,700
I caught a glimpse of fate.

131
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,699
Liluo and the prince

132
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,340
will get through the ritual.

133
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,969
Liluo,

134
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,730
you will be the Dragon Queen.

135
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,410
Did you hear that?

136
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,579
She's just a village girl.

137
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,020
A nobody like her

138
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,460
will never get in our way.

139
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,380
Mother,

140
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,700
why is this happening?

141
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,769
It shouldn't be.

142
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,900
The youth-preserving tonic
should still be working.

143
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,209
Youth-preserving tonic?

144
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,409
You're still using those tonics

145
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,940
that go against nature?

146
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,769
Mother,

147
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,699
please listen to me.

148
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,900
You can't keep hanging onto this!

149
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,259
Liluo,

150
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,699
you're her favorite daughter.

151
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,939
Why bend over backwards

152
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,340
doing these shady treatments
just to please her?

153
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:56,939
Liluo...

154
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,209
Liluo, bring the tonic!

155
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,140
I... I can't let others
see me like this!

156
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,780
Bring it now!

157
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,290
Mother!

158
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,290
Wujing City really is something.

159
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,460
Top-tier herbs smell different.

160
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,649
An apothecary?

161
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,529
Get out!

162
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,259
(Apothecary)

163
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,600
You mute idiot! Do you even know
how to write a prescription?

164
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,849
You'll kill someone,
and you couldn't even pay off the debt!

165
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,969
Chu Xiaoyu,

166
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,530
if you don't get it,
kneel here and learn!

167
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,780
Get up!

168
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,660
(Chu Xiaoyu,
Imperial physician of Wujing City)

169
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:34,859
You hit her?

170
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,340
Mind your business.

171
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,250
Take your useless papers and go!

172
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,370
They're medical texts.

173
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,409
Stop acting like you know anything.

174
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,580
Are you the physician, or am I?

175
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,460
You're a physician here?

176
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,929
Did they bully you so much

177
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,890
that you're scared to say who you are?

178
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,490
You're saying someone inside
is poisoned?

179
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,130
(Prescription)
The prescription looks fine.

180
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,700
Hold on.

181
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,449
Judging by the symptoms,

182
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,689
I'd say it's blocked circulation.

183
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,540
His organs are way out of balance.

184
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,569
Cutting him open is risky,

185
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,700
but it's the only way to find the cause.

186
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,090
Who... Who are you?

187
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,619
How dare you!

188
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,010
Who let you in?

189
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,219
Who swapped the orchid leaf?

190
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,090
Don't waste our time!

191
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,660
You call

192
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,220
yourselves physicians?

193
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,730
Another one barging in?

194
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,619
Get out.

195
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,610
Women aren't welcome here!

196
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,890
Since I walked in,

197
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,660
then I must have the skills
to back it up.

198
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,899
With treatment like this,

199
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,219
he'll drop dead

200
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,970
in a few minutes.

201
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,219
If you make him throw up now,

202
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,610
you can still save him.

203
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,730
How...

204
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,220
How dare you cause trouble here!

205
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,859
Go by Chu Xiaoyu's prescription.

206
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,060
Add eight more units of vitalis.
It works faster.

207
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,890
If you delay the treatment,

208
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,220
the guards will drag
every last one of you away!

209
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,660
I'll go prepare the medicine now.

210
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,049
This is the Wujing City apothecary,
and only the girl at the door,

211
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,409
the one you all look down on,

212
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,080
is the only one who knows
what she's doing.

213
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,130
Chu Xiaoyu!

214
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,370
Who is it?

215
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,180
Why are you here?

216
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,610
It's been days,

217
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,770
and we still haven't talked properly.

218
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,090
Does Zhilou know who you really are?

219
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,099
You dumb water snake!

220
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,300
Watch your mouth!

221
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,499
You dumb bird!

222
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,970
Learn some manners!

223
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,499
You useless lizard!

224
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,019
Out.

225
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,619
Out!

226
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,940
You get out!

227
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,340
Greetings, Dragon Prince.

228
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,610
Did Zhilou...

229
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,700
Did she find out?

230
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,499
I know you're hiding it on purpose.

231
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,580
I just don't know why.

232
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,820
After all,

233
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,340
you even gave her
your lifesaving dragon pearl.

234
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,060
What I'm doing is complicated.

235
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,850
Zhilou came to Wujing City

236
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,460
with her own mission.

237
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,700
I don't want her dragged into mine.

238
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,769
So, we're basically

239
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,250
teaming up to lie to her?

240
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,090
Fine, I admit it.

241
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,580
But I need you

242
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,859
to keep this quiet

243
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,090
for now.

244
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,619
If I ever need

245
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,529
to tell her who I am,

246
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,580
I want

247
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,580
to say it myself.

248
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,940
Alright.

249
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,219
You're a dragon.

250
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,739
I'm supposed to bow.

251
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,619
Relax.

252
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,259
I'll keep it to myself for now.

253
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,379
But I think

254
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,700
you're going

255
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,460
to regret this one day!

256
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,890
(How do I tell Zhilou)

257
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,130
(I'm the Dragon Prince)

258
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,610
(and that I'm supposed to marry Liluo?)

259
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,660
Miss, you're back!

260
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:04,979
Miss,

261
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,340
where'd you find this poor girl?

262
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,019
She's a mute physician.

263
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,890
One of the male physicians
hit her today.

264
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,099
Her pulse is unbelievably weak.

265
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,340
Feels like she's been abused
for a long time.

266
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,610
She wasn't born mute.

267
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,649
Someone poisoned her.

268
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,169
That's awful!

269
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,730
Who would do something that cruel?

270
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,619
I'm keeping her here a few days

271
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,730
to treat her

272
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,610
and help her recover.

273
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,770
Zhilou,

274
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,610
I need to talk to you.

275
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,890
The tonics are wearing off more often.

276
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,770
Mother,

277
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,540
when I become the Dragon Queen
and head to the sanctuary,

278
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,730
I'll find a cure for you.

279
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,169
Why's the medicine wearing off so fast?

280
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,370
Get the physician!

281
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,180
Impossible!

282
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,809
Your Grace,

283
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,449
Physician Chu showed up
at the apothecary today!

284
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,540
Then...

285
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,820
Then...

286
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,010
She vanished!

287
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,689
Get out!

288
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,180
Get out now!

289
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,250
Dark Dhuta,

290
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,569
with Mother like this,

291
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,859
how's she supposed
to do the blood ritual with the Dragons?

292
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,929
Search the whole city for Chu Xiaoyu!

293
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,019
She's the only one who can help Mother!

294
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,219
If you can't find her,

295
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,809
you're dead too!

296
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,850
Got it!

297
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,700
Mother!

298
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,700
Any news on your mother today?

299
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,180
She's been missing for eighteen years.

300
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,529
My dad and Uncle Qingyun searched

301
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,730
for years and still found nothing.

302
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,460
I knew coming to Wujing City

303
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,610
to look for her wouldn't be easy.

304
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,730
You can't rush it.

305
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,820
Right now,

306
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,730
I need to settle down

307
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,090
in Wujing City.

308
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,499
Once I do,

309
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,529
I can keep

310
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,370
looking for her long-term.

311
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,929
I went to Wujing City's
apothecary today.

312
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,049
Those so-called physicians
were all talk.

313
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,370
Back at Feng Manor,
I was already practicing medicine.

314
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,569
So,

315
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,180
I want to keep practicing medicine here.

316
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,460
Zhilou,

317
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,090
you already offended them today.

318
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,090
Opening your own apothecary

319
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,379
won't be easy now.

320
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,049
They might even come after you.

321
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,460
This is Wujing.

322
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,250
Not the Feng Manor.

323
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,970
What's so special about this place?

324
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,809
It's nothing special!

325
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,529
Wujing City

326
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,529
is just Feng Manor

327
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,049
on a bigger scale.

328
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,300
Worst case, I'll just fight them!

329
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,460
You've been through so much already.

330
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,610
Can you stop being so naive?

331
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,409
Back home, you could risk everything.

332
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,580
But what did you get?

333
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,730
Your family
and the Lenghou family fell apart.

334
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,300
Your families turned on each other.

335
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,820
And you lost your father.

336
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,540
So, you're saying

337
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,660
I'm selfish?

338
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,250
That's not what I meant.

339
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,139
I just want

340
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,139
you to be

341
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,970
a little more careful.

342
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,010
Did I do something wrong?

343
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:05,449
Should I not have helped Xiaoyu?

344
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,819
Was I supposed to just watch

345
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,059
her get bullied?

346
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,248
You can help her

347
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:11,010
and ignore those idiots.

348
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,490
But did you think about her future?

349
00:17:16,249 --> 00:17:17,840
She doesn't
have the nine spiritual roots.

350
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,819
She's mute and alone.

351
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,380
If she goes back,

352
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,819
she'll suffer even worse.

353
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,929
Then don't send her back!

354
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,860
And what will you use to keep her here?

355
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,970
Your medical skills?

356
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,449
Use what you're good at.

357
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,929
Level up your martial skill.

358
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,099
Get strong enough to protect people.

359
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Not stay weak like before,

360
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,660
and letting anyone

361
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,860
walk over you.

362
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,010
You sound more and more

363
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,570
like my father.

364
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,139
Young Master,

365
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,970
the Wujing City Lord has fallen ill.

366
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,539
They're searching everywhere
for a female physician.

367
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,859
It's chaos out there.

368
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,779
Except for Hunbao,

369
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,970
the whole city's up.

370
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,770
A female physician?

371
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,050
Could it be Xiaoyu?

372
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,539
If it's the girl

373
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,689
Miss Feng saved,

374
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,010
that's trouble.

375
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:48,629
♪Like petals fall, gone with the clouds♪

376
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:54,630
♪Like stars fade fast in open skies♪

00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,439
