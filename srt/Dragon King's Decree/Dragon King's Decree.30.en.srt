00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,619
You have to return to the sanctuary
and give His Majesty

63
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,260
an explanation on this matter.

64
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,338
You have an extreme yin constitution

65
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:49,098

67
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,978
you are the real Wujing Saintess.

68
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,619
Please come back with us
to the sanctuary.

69
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,419
Now you acknowledge me

70
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:02,340
because you're in danger.

71
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:06,619

73
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:12,179

is still ongoing.

00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:13,220
Young Master,

75
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,020
we should hurry back to the sanctuary.

76
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,580
She was right.

77
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,379
The Dragon King's Decree prophecy

78
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,179
can't save the sanctuary.

79
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,539
I'll wait for you here.

80
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:48,340
Shang,

81
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:51,340
you were right.

82
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:53,979
Marrying the Wujing Saintess

83
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,979
can't save the sanctuary
from this disaster.

84
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:01,020
We were all wrong.

85
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,099
We were all wrong.

86
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,659
Is this the end of the sanctuary?

87
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,419
Is this the end of the sanctuary?

88
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,580
Your Majesty,

89
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,459
Prince Zhi has always known

90
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,139
Liluo isn't the true Wujing Saintess.

91
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,499
How should he be punished?

92
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,220
When a Dragon makes mistakes,

93
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,539
it's never just simple lectures.

94
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,140
With the Black and White Envoys here,

95
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,780
I believe they'll carry out
the fairest execution.

96
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,418
Winner takes all.

97
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,739
I accept the consequences.

98
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:30,979
I have nothing more to say.

99
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,978
Prince Zhi angered the Dragon God.

100
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:35,260
His crime is unforgivable.

101
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,858
He's sentenced to endless torment,

102
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:39,459
repeating forever

103
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,460
until he earns
the Dragon God's forgiveness.

104
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,460
Father,

105
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,859
even till the very last moment,

106
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,780
you never cared about me.

107
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,580
I'll make sure you regret

108
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,619
the decision you made today.

109
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:04,299
Mother.

110
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:05,580
Zhilou.

111
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,499
Wujing Saintess, congratulations

112
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,020
for reclaiming everything
that belongs to you.

113
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,299
But...

114
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:18,739
what if it's all been a mistake?

115
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,059
What if I'm not really
the Wujing Saintess?

116
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,139
Zhilou,

117
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,218
even if you're not the Wujing Saintess,

118
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:25,218
to us,

119
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:26,940
you'll always be one.

120
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:30,139
The Wujing Saintess' coronation
never requires proof.

121
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,580
Only the world's acceptance.

122
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,178
To me, our Dragon Queen

123
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:35,499
is incomparable in the world.

124
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,780
You're the best.

125
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,900
Zhilou,

126
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,020
you deserve to be the Wujing Saintess.

127
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,338
Feng Zhilou!

128
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:44,059
Why did you wear my battle robe?

129
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,739
You witch.

130
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
I can't kill you
no matter how hard I try.

131
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:49,538
I can't escape you
no matter where I hide.

132
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,940
And now you even dare
to wear my battle robe?

133
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,178
I'm the real Wujing Saintess!

134
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:55,978
I'm the future Dragon Queen!

135
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,499
It's me!

136
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,820
Her blood poisoning is flaring up.

137
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,700
My hair.

138
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,780
My face!

139
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,139
Why is this happening?

140
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,499
Why is this happening?

141
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,978
Karma is catching up.

142
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:19,899
I don't want this.

143
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,619
I...

144
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,418
I don't want this.

145
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,658
I don't want to become like my mother.

146
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:24,579
No way.

147
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,139
Mother,

148
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,379
please save me.

149
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,020
To become the Dragon Queen,

150
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,700
she didn't even get to see
her mother one last time.

151
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:31,580
No!

152
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,340
No!

153
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,139
The sanctuary.

154
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,379
I'm going to the sanctuary.

155
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:44,580
I can't just die like this.

156
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,859
Zhilou,

157
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,099
go on.

158
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:33,859
Shang,

159
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:35,899
what are you doing?

160
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,298
He's sacrificing himself.

161
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:41,360
He's transferring his life force to the Tree
of Life to protect the sanctuary's barrier.

162
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,619
Saving the sanctuary
has always been our duty as people

163
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,700
of the sanctuary.

164
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,940
His life force isn't enough.

165
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,180
We'll do our part too.

166
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,619
This is the real power
of the Dragon King

167
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,460
and the Wujing Saintess.

168
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:58,019
Yes, it worked.

169
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,259
This is great.

170
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,940
Honey,

171
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,420
help me gather these herbs.

172
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:17,578
It's basically a miracle.

173
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:20,220
His lordship actually regained his sight

174
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,099
and opened the apothecary to us.

175
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,580
My stomach feels a bit off.

176
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,698
That's nothing.

177
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:28,660
His lordship's wife
is blessed by the Dragon God.

178
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:31,540
Even her muteness is cured.

179
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:32,499
Yeah.

180
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,658
It's a miracle.

181
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,180
A real miracle.

182
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,899
Xiaoyu.

183
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,540
Is this...

184
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,420
You forgot already?

185
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,940
I just told you yesterday.

186
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,698
This is poria.

187
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:55,940
And this is codonopsis.

188
