25
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,079
The Sacred Ancestor's birthday
is approaching.

26
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:09,320
(Luo Weijie, the Serpents' Leader)
Are the sacrifices ready?

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,719
Chief Luo,

28
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,239
we always offer young girls

29
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,080
during the Sacred Ancestor's birthday.

30
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,558
We don't have girls

31
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:20,479
who fit the criteria
in the village anymore.

32
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:22,479
Besides,

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,120
must we continue

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,359
(Zhang Lingling, Elder of the Serpents)
such a wicked tradition?

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,280
How dare you!

36
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:29,359
Offering young girls
to the Sacred Ancestor

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,999
is the only way to protect us!

38
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,280
Elder Zhang,

39
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,118
you have repeatedly raised objections.

40
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:38,159
Are you trying to rebel?

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,800
The clan is already short of women.

42
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,719
If this goes on,

43
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:46,398
the clan will become extinct!

44
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:46,959
You!

45
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,560
Elder Zhang,

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,599
you worry the clan
will have no more women,

47
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:56,599
but are you not afraid
of the Sacred Ancestor's wrath

48
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,599
that could wipe the clan out?

49
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,360
Since

50
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
we can't find a suitable sacrifice,

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,759
I think

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,719
we should follow custom.

53
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,599
Release the spirit.

54
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,039
It will decide.

55
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,560
Go.

56
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,879
The Sacred Ancestor's messenger.

57
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,759
Come in.

58
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,240
Don't be scared.

59
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:51,678
Mei, I'm here.

60
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,840
Give her to me.

61
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,278
Give her to me!

62
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:55,039
- No!
- Let go!

63
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,678
Give her to me!

64
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:56,398
I'm begging you!

65
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,519
If we don't give her up,

66
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,158
we all have to die!

67
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,398
Please!

68
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,719
It's our honor to offer her
to the Sacred Ancestor.

69
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,438
Mother.

70
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,639
- Thank you, Sacred Ancestor.
- Mei!

71
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,039
Farewell, Elder.

72
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,039
- Mei!
- Thank you.

73
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,759
- My daughter!
- Thank you, Elder.

74
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,879
What's the point

75
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,439
of protecting a home like this?

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Elder Zhang,

77
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,919
our informant reported

78
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,879
that a outsider male

79
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,639
has fallen into our forest trap.

80
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,199
He's locked in the dungeon now.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,320
Let's take a look.

82
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:39,918
I have questions.

83
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,039
Don't you shout.

84
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,400
Outsider,

85
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,880
why are you in the Serpents' territory?

86
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,439
I didn't intend to barge in.

87
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,918
We were just on our way to Wujing City

88
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,479
and merely passing through.

89
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,159
Merely passing through?

90
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,598
But I heard

91
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:59,280
someone caused a big disturbance
in the forest yesterday.

92
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,038
We were attacked in the forest

93
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,559
and had to defend ourselves.

94
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,760
He's a top assassin from Wujing,

95
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,080
and you escaped unscathed.

96
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,879
It's all thanks to my niece,
Feng Zhilou,

97
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,239
that we're still alive.

98
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,199
We got separated somehow,

99
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,679
and I stumbled into your trap.

100
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:15,838
Please.

101
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,918
Do you know where my niece

102
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,760
is right now?

103
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,559
You're from Feng Manor?

104
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,679
Yes.

105
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,119
Elder!

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,559
I have no ill intentions!

107
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,479
Elder!

108
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Elder!

109
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,719
Elder!

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,280
Elder!

111
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
Elder!

112
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,079
Find a time.

113
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,200
Elder!

114
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,239
Elder!

115
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,440
(What's going on?)

116
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,119
An offering to sir.

117
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,799
An offering to sir.

118
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,400
An offering to sir.

119
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
An offering to sir.

120
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,639
Zhilou.

121
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,840
Chu Moshang.

122
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,320
Zhilou.

123
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,880
Zhilou.

124
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,559
What just happened?

125
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,760
The forest miasma causes people
to lose their senses

126
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,960
and fall into the nightmare
of their deepest fear.

127
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,559
I'm late.

128
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,119
Sorry I made you worry.

129
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:50,400
So you know you were late.

130
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,520
Why did you take so long?

131
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,238
You already have nine spiritual roots

132
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:59,038
and all sorts of weapons,

133
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,000
yet you still managed
to put yourself in danger.

134
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,840
Way to go.

135
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,840
Why're you mocking me again?

136
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,239
Uncle Qingyun's missing.

137
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,718
The miasma in this forest
is especially evil.

138
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,918
You'll fall into an illusion
if you're not careful.

139
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,559
I saw a group of girls

140
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,838
trapped together just now.

141
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,559
Chanting they were to be offered.

142
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,239
The Serpents have a mysterious cave

143
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,039
where a Sacred Ancestor
who's never shown his face resides.

144
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,599
He watches over this territory

145
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,440
which is why the Serpents
have been safe until now.

146
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,039
The miasma just now

147
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,799
was probably generated
to ward off enemies.

148
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,280
Young Master.

149
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,999
We finally found you.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,959
Fei Yuan, Bai Lu,

151
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,158
look for Mr. Qingyun.

152
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,838
Yes.

153
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,119
Leave it to me!

154
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,520
Let's wait here for a moment.

155
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,440
When do you think the Young Master
will retrieve the sigil?

156
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,798
If he cant' bear to do it,

157
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,440
we can help him.

158
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,959
Young Master has his own plans.

159
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,719
It's not your place to interfere.

160
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,440
Mr. Qingyun!

161
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:24,760
Mr. Qingyun!

162
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,679
I feel like you've changed

163
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,159
compared to before.

164
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,839
But I've always looked like this.

165
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,159
I'm not talking about your appearance.

166
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:47,959
It's that you...

167
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:49,760
look

168
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,439
more like human.

169
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,120
You sure know how to give praises.

170
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,118
What happened

171
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,878
to that brother of yours
who keeps trying

172
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,000
to kill you?

173
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,120
He has received his punishment.

174
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,358
I never knew

175
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,838
you were so articulate

176
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,439
in front of Father.

177
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,600
Moshang, what're you talking about?

178
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,520
I don't understand.

179
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,000
Father isn't here.

180
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,959
Drop the kind act.

181
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,399
If I hadn't

182
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,280
experienced your hatred myself,

183
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:35,159
and your talent for stabbing people
in the back,

184
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,319
I would really doubt

185
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,319
if my memory was flawed.

186
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,760
If you're envious,

187
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,439
try to be like me the next time
you make a mistake.

188
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,760
You still show no remorse

189
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,679
even now.

190
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,480
I was outmaneuvered this time.

191
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,600
I didn't expect someone

192
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,120
like Feng Zhilou to appear.

193
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,319
I just came to tell you

194
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,760
that no matter which of us
becomes the Dragon King,

195
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,120
you will always be my brother.

196
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,720
This

197
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,240
will never change.

198
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,638
Don't act

199
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,480
all high and mighty to lecture me.

200
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,319
In Father

201
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,720
and the whole clan's eyes,

202
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,400
I don't even have the right
to compete with you.

203
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,640
They only have eyes for you.

204
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,319
I don't need your pity,

205
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,959
and I certainly

206
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,959
don't need this brotherly affection.

207
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,079
So did you manage

208
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,480
to find the solution
to retrieve the sigil?

209
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,400
Kill Feng Zhilou.

210
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,120
Retrieve the sigil

211
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:43,439
and marry the Wujing Saintess.

212
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,640
This is all you can do

213
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,039
right now.

214
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,640
Young Master.

215
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,399
How is it?

216
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,799
Did you find my uncle?

217
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,199
Miss Zhilou,

218
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,280
we didn't see any signs of Mr. Qingyun.

219
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,478
But don't worry,

220
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,679
we didn't find traces
of struggle either.

221
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,480
Is someone there?

222
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,159
Save me.

223
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,878
Young Master,

224
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,199
there's a cry for help there.

225
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,679
Is someone there?

226
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,839
Where?

227
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,240
Please save me.

228
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:16,120
Save...

229
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:18,280
Save me.

230
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,760
Are you alright?

231
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,758
Don't be scared.

232
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,319
We won't hurt you.

233
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:34,878
What happened to you?

234
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,559
I...

235
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:38,718
was chosen as a sacrifice
to the Sacred Ancestor.

236
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,120
I just managed to escape.

237
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,118
Please.

238
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,280
Help us.

239
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,998
She has a veil.

240
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,520
She must be from the Serpents.

241
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:47,518
Us?

242
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,039
Are you saying

243
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,518
there are other girls?

244
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,039
Many of them are much younger than me.

245
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,118
They...

246
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,679
are still children

247
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,839
but have to be offered as well.

248
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,319
Why is that?

249
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,520
It's the Serpents' tradition.

250
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,559
At every birthday
of the Sacred Ancestor,

251
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,559
he...

252
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,358
he eats people.

253
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,439
What?

254
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,480
Could Mr. Qingyun have been eaten?

255
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,679
The Sacred Ancestor has a preference

256
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,199
and only eats young girls

257
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,679
chosen by the spirit
among the villagers.

258
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,600
Heavens.

259
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,199
Where's that wretched creature now?

260
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,079
In the cave behind the altar.

261
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,159
Let's go now.

262
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,679
It's...

263
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,959
terrifying there.

264
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,600
Don't you fear death?

265
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,118
Fei Yuan, Bai Lu,

266
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,480
send her home first.

267
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,400
Yes.

268
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,880
Leave it to me.

269
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,079
This way.

270
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,600
To be raised...

271
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,880
only for procreation

272
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,640
or to be fed

273
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,199
to the Sacred Ancestor.

274
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,679
This reminds me of the women
in the Feng Manor.

275
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,280
No freedom,

276
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,199
and at the mercy of others.

277
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,998
To me, this behavior

278
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:16,319
is akin to the Demons.

279
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,240
If that Sacred Ancestor

280
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,118
must use this method

281
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:22,520
to demonstrate his power,

282
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,000
then he is the evil incarnate.

283
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,839
This is unforgivable.

284
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,520
A lot have happened

285
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,000
after you left.

286
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,600
Father...

287
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,959
sacrificed himself

288
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,079
to save Feng Manor.

289
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,319
I want to look for Mother
in Wujing City,

290
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,679
but Uncle Qingyue

291
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:58,280
has gone missing.

292
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,240
I still want to save those girls,

293
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,880
but I don't know

294
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,839
what to do now.

295
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,120
Don't worry.

296
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,240
I'm right here with you.

297
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,799
The heavens might not
do anything for you,

298
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:21,199
but they will listen
to your most sincere prayers.

299
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,319
It'll be a miracle

300
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,720
if you manage to resolve the issue
with your brother.

301
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,919
I didn't mean to blame you for leaving.

302
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,919
What if...

303
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:43,000
I really am the Dragon God?

304
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,720
Just like you said.

305
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,600
The heavens might not
do anything for me,

306
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,319
so...

307
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,880
I should make myself stronger.

308
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,720
Besides,

309
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,319
you always show up immediately

310
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,199
