=Episode 15=

25
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,340
Look at you.

26
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,979
It's been hard for you.

27
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,139
Now you know

28
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,020
Wujing can't compare
to Feng Manor, right?

29
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:23,659
You're right.

30
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:26,620
One wrong step,

31
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,780
and your head might roll.

32
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,620
It's not that serious.

33
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:37,179
Are you saying

34
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,020
a bumpkin like me

35
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,899
have the Dragons behind my back?

36
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,180
What I mean

37
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:44,300
is that they won't be your match.

38
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,259
I will be with you no matter

39
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,220
where you go from now on.

40
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,220
Well.

41
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,658
Can I ask Fei Yuan and Bai Lu
to help me with something?

42
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:05,979
Anything at all.

43
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,460
Ask away.

44
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,460
I need their help

45
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,099
to find some precious herbs.

46
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,620
As you wish.

47
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:33,539
Mother,

48
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,338
what did Liluo's physicians

49
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:36,139
do to Xiaoyu

50
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,699
and Zhilou?

51
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,139
What did they do?

52
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,180
If those physicians can't cure mother,

53
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,859
they're better off dead.

54
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,419
You're the Wujing Saintess.

55
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,020
Your every action
represents Wujing City.

56
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,939
How could you treat human lives
like dirt?

57
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,960
If the Dragons find out,

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,818
how will they trust that a marriage alliance
with you can save the world?

59
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:58,900
Enough.

60
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:02,139
Are you questioning your sister

61
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,778
or me?

62
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:04,579
Mother.

63
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,899
If Liluo can't become the Dragon Queen,

64
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,780
I can't be cured!

65
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,379
You've been eating the whole way
and you're still at it.

66
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,940
You're so annoying.

67
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,619
You're going to eat yourself
to death one day.

68
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,619
In ancient times,
Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs.

69
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:40,179
Now, you have me who can eat anything.

70
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,700
It's nice!

71
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,298
Here, Xiaoyu.

72
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:53,539
Eat more.

73
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,858
Darn you, Xiaoyu.

74
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:56,020
Taking Zhilou all to yourself!

75
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,418
(Thank you)

76
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,139
(for doing so much for me.)

77
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,340
(I can never repay you.)

78
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:09,059
There's no need to thank me.

79
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:10,459
Besides, I still need your help

80
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,338
to figure out a cure

81
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:13,780
for City Lord.

82
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:14,899
After all,

83
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,739
you know her condition the best.

84
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,619
I read

85
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,298
all your medical texts
the past few days.

86
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:20,780
They're very detailed.

87
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:21,619
The solution's

88
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,780
right in there.

89
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,260
(What's the solution?)

90
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,019
Her Lordship's poison

91
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,619
has entered her core.

92
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,299
To save her live,

93
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:33,619
we must purify her blood.

94
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:42,780
She's unwilling?

95
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:46,979
What if she will die?

96
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:51,459
Right, Zhilou.

97
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,098
I've been meaning to ask.

98
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:54,098
How can you understand

99
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:55,418
what Xiaoyu is saying

100
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:56,859
with her hand waving around like that?

101
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,098
My uncle and I have treated
a family born deaf and mute.

102
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:01,658
I learned it back then.

103
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,019
As expected of you.

104
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,299
You can do anything.

105
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:07,780
You have some more too.

106
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:08,900
Here.

107
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,299
Have a thigh.

108
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,780
Thank you.

109
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,338
(Youyun Pavilion)

110
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:27,539
Look, Xiaoyu.

111
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:30,900
Is this the medicine for Her Lordship?

112
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,659
You can't just eat this stuff.

113
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:05,179
Stop eating it.

114
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,218
I told you to stop.

115
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,020
What am I going to use to treat Her Lordship?

116
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:16,899
I hope you understand, Dragon Prince.

117
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,659
Illnesses vary in severity and urgency.

118
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,299
You needn't worry.

119
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:23,220
I am here merely
to check on your condition

120
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:24,419
and to inform you

121
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:26,778
that the Saintess' inspection ritual
can be postponed

122
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,659
until you've recovered.

123
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:31,659
Thank you for understanding, Prince.

124
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
Wishing you speedy recovery.

125
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,979
I'll take my leave.

126
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:38,220
Your Highness, wait.

127
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,340
Your Highness,

128
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,780
would you care to have lunch with me?

129
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,659
To be honest,

130
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,460
I'm very worried

131
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,780
about Mother's sudden illness.

132
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,299
I would love to have your advice.

133
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,020
(Apothecary)

134
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,280
This is a restricted area.
Unauthorized entry is forbidden.

135
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,720
We have been ordered to treat Her Lordship
and need to go inside to brew the medicine.

136
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,260
You're not a physician.

137
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:09,658
(We really are here)

138
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:11,499
(to treat Her Lordship.)

139
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,940
Insolence!

140
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:19,899
How dare you obstruct
Miss Feng and Physician Chu?

141
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,820
Young Lord.

142
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,940
I waited here for you

143
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:27,940
to give you this token.

144
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:30,820
If you run into any trouble
in Wujing City,

145
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:32,499
my token will be useful.

146
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,180
Thank you.

147
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,180
Xiaoyu,

148
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,820
how are you feeling?

149
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,899
Liluo was just worried about Mother,
and her temper flared up.

150
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:56,259
You suffered because of it.

151
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,060
Let's go.

152
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:20,660
I'm worried

153
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,219
if Mother's illness drags on,

154
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,899
will the inspection ritual have
to be postponed endlessly?

155
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,739
It is an important ritual.

156
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,700
The Wujing City Lord must be present.

157
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:33,259
I also hope that Mother

158
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:35,019
can watch me become the Saintess

159
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,460
and walk hand-in-hand with Your Highness

160
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,700
from War God's Hall to the sanctuary.

161
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:42,460
These two matters

162
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,899
have kept me up at night.

163
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,940
I don't know what to do.

164
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,379
The world's best physicians

165
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:50,580
are working tirelessly to cure Her Lordship.

166
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,700
She will surely recover soon.

167
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,779
If there is nothing else,

168
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,660
I'll take my leave now.

169
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:02,339
Quick!

170
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,779
Summon Chu Xiaoyu.

171
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,458
Yes.

172
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,778
And Feng Zhilou too.

173
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,940
Bring both of them to me now!

174
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:11,019
Quick.

175
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:12,700
Your Highness.

176
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,139
This is a century-old sandalwood,

177
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,979
and inside is a sachet I made myself.

178
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:23,938
I was worried

179
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,499
Wujing is too crude

180
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,619
and can't compare
to the beautiful sanctuary.

181
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,019
If it has affected your sleep
or appetite,

182
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,580
you can place this by your bed.

183
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,499
It has a calming effect.

184
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,420
Your Grace, you have been worried.

185
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:38,300
You should keep it for yourself.

186
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,499
I was presumptuous.

187
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,300
The Dragon Prince

188
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,220
wouldn't need something like this
of the humans.

189
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,499
Your Grace, her lordship's
illness struck suddenly.

190
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,560
She's in unbearable pain
and coughed up a lot of blood.

191
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,060
This way.

192
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,178
It hurts.

193
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:01,460
Quickly.

194
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:03,298
Quickly.

195
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:04,339
Quick.

196
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,619
It hurts so much!

197
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:06,660
Quick.

198
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,178
My lord, this new medicine
that Feng Zhilou prepared is said

199
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:26,019
to neutralize the toxins in your blood

200
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,300
and ease the pain.

201
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,460
How do you

202
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:29,940
feel right now?

203
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:34,779
It does feel much better.

204
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:37,619
It worked.

205
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:40,060
The medicine Fei Yuan found
really worked.

206
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,460
We're on the right track.

207
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,379
Mother,

208
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,460
the Dragon Prince has come to visit you.

209
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,379
Greetings, Your Highness.

210
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,340
Your Grace,

211
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,019
her lordship feels much better

212
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,460
after having the new medicine.

213
00:11:57,939 --> 00:11:59,899
Dragon Prince,

214
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,019
thank you

215
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,538
for your trouble

216
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:05,460
in coming in today.

217
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:07,899
This is great, Mother.

218
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,178
It seems the medicine

219
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,779
is effective.

220
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:12,938
This way, my wedding with Prince Shang

221
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:14,460
won't be delayed for too long.

222
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,340
Your Highness,

223
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,979
the worry in my heart

224
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,259
has finally eased.

225
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:26,499
I wish Mother

226
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,259
can recover tomorrow,

227
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,379
and we can hold
the inspection ritual the day after.

228
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,460
So I can become your bride

229
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:33,499
and help you

230
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:35,820
with your worries and troubles.

231
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:58,379
Zhilou.

232
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:00,859
Who are you?

233
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,739
The Wujing Princess.

234
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,499
The Saintess.

235
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:07,019
Your Highness?

236
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,700
Prince Shang?

237
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:11,460
If I'm not mistaken,

238
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,660
you're not a normal dragon.

239
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,540
You're the supreme,

240
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,139
unmatched prince

241
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,859
of the Dragons.

242
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,019
You and the daughter
of the Wujing City Lord,

243
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,540
Princess Liluo,

244
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,298
have long been betrothed.

245
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:31,380
♪You brought a wave
that stirred a wild, restless sea♪

246
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:37,140
♪Light as a feather,

247
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:43,860
♪In that one moment,

248
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,220
Miss,

249
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,460
who is this?

250
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:04,180
My mother.

251
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,300
She has beautiful eyes.

252
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:09,180
I've been here for so long

253
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:11,660
but haven't found any news of her.

254
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:13,660
Miss,

255
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,779
don't be sad.

256
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,778
I think

257
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,820
the Young Master
looks at you differently.

258
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,458
Don't you humans

259
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,339
call it a white lie?

260
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,099
He must have a reason
to hide his identity.

261
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,578
Don't fight with him.

262
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:26,298
Don't be mad.

263
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,899
Don't break up, okay?

264
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,139
I only like seeing you
with the Dragon God.

265
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,940
Hunbao,

266
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,899
the lie may be false,

267
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:41,060
but if it touched the heart,

268
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:43,019
it's no different from the truth.

269
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,019
So

270
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,300
whether if it's a white lie

271
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,940
or a malicious one,

272
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:51,259
it still hurts the sincere heart.

273
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,420
Perhaps

274
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,859
the high and mighty Dragons

275
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,899
are never at fault.

276
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,499
Miss,

277
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,259
I don't understand.

278
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,899
Can you explain it plainly?

279
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,499
It's my fault.

280
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,820
Zhilou.

281
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,139
I know you're still up.

282
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:18,340
I want to talk to you.

283
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,580
Miss,

284
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:20,818
if you don't want to see him,

285
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,139
I'll chase him out.

286
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,779
Miss,

287
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:31,700
you're the strongest woman
I've ever met.

288
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,580
And how many have you met?

289
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,619
What is it?

290
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,099
What're you doing?

291
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,940
You...

292
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,420
Chu Moshang,

293
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,779
you kept me from treating City Lord

294
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,220
because you were afraid
this would happen, weren't you?

295
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,499
Afraid that one day I would

296
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:10,420
see your true colors.

297
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:11,499
I was wrong

298
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,139
to lie

299
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,300
and hide my identity.

300
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:15,339
But I severely injured

301
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,418
when we first met,

302
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:17,940
and my sigil was with you.

303
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:19,458
We were mere strangers,

304
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,619
and I was in danger.

305
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,820
How could I reveal my identity easily?

306
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,619
Mere strangers?

307
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,300
I thought after all we've been through,

308
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,578
we could talk about anything

309
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:31,739
and have no secrets.

310
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,019
That's not what I meant.

311
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:36,259
You had so many chances

312
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,139
and the time to tell me

313
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,058
your true identity.

314
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:40,619
You could've told me

315
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,099
you came to Wujing City

316
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,458
to fulfill your marriage

317
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:44,899
with the Wujing Saintess,

318
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:47,180
but you kept silent the entire time!

319
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:53,060
You're right.

320
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:54,899
I hesitated.

321
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,739
I didn't know how to tell you.

322
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,180
Fine.

323
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:00,540
I'll tell you

324
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:03,019
why exactly.

325
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,299
It because I, Feng Zhilou,

326
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,180
am a loser illegitimate daughter

327
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:08,579
while you

328
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,019
are the Dragon God I worshipped.

329
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,900
It was my honor

330
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:15,579
to just have met you.

331
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,900
The difference between us

332
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,539
is night and day!

333
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,899
I never once thought of you

334
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,380
as a lowly illegitimate daughter.

335
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,218
Do you truly believe that?

336
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:25,420
Or do you

337
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,100
just view our relationship
as a contract?

338
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,779
I treated your poison.

339
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,660
You opened my spiritual root.

340
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:33,460
It's a win-win situation.

341
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:34,458
Great.

342
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:35,900
Most importantly,

343
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,819
I'm probably

344
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,978
just a temporary jewelry box

345
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:40,779
for you to store the sigil.

346
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,899
The sigil was forged
with my reverse scale.

347
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,059
It's not as simple

348
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:46,100
as wearing jewelry on your hand.

349
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:48,059
Then you must think

350
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,019
you're the Dragon Prince.

351
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:51,220
In the future,

352
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,059
you'll marry the Wujing Saintess.

353
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,698
You both will become one

354
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,738
while I am just

355
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:59,218
a passerby who shamelessly pursued you
and insisted on a fake marriage.

356
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:00,259
That's not it.

357
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,180
You're incredibly important to me.

358
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,059

I can never reach

363
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,739
You actually had no obligation

364
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,299
to tell me who you are.

365
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,019
I shouldn't be angry.

366
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,140
I was only angry

367
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,059
because I realized my absurdity

368
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:33,900
