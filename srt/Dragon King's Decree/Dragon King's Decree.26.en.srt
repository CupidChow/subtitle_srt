=Episode 26=

25
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:05,620
Xiaoyu.

26
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,818
The young master is getting weaker.

27
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,778
I saw them going
into Canglong Pavilion again.

28
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:16,139
If he falls in there,
Zhilou won't have the Dragon God power.

29
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,818
She'll be trapped inside

30
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,180
and never return again.

31
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,218
What do we do?

32
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:21,938
It's going to be too late. It's too late!

33
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:22,938
Hunbao, don't panic.

34
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:25,299
In the Dragon King's Decree,
there was once in the past

35
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,058
when humans summoned the Wujing Saintess

36
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:29,099
as she was in danger.

37
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,259
The Dragon King's Decree

38
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,739
could summon the Wujing Saintess

39
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,419
back to a Saintess Altar

40
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,340
in Wujing.

41
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:43,580
That means

42
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,778
we can summon Zhilou

43
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,220
and the young master.

44
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,818
The Saintess Alter of Wujing

45
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,020
is in the War God's Hall.

46
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:50,699
Go with Xiaoyu.

47
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,180
Take my token and the book.

48
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,099
While no one's around, go.

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,960
(Dongming)

50
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:01,939
Don't worry.

51
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,139
I'll stall Liluo and my mother.

52
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:07,099
Let's go.

53
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:19,859
You fool!

54
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,538
If these useless tonics worked,

55
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:24,780
would I need to drink Yue's blood?

56
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,859
Where is Yue?

57
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,180
Where is Feng Zhilou?

58
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,819
Have you caught them?

59
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:32,459
She's outside the city
with the Dragon Prince.

60
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,859
It's impossible for them
to return before tomorrow.

61
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,019
Before every thing's done,

62
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,659
don't say it's impossible.

63
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:41,900
What if Feng Zhilou returns?

64
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,900
What if the prince doesn't return?

65
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,618
If he returns,

66
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:48,060
would he even willingly lead you
to the sanctuary?

67
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:51,938
You really are my mother.

68
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,899
Since you've thought of it,

69
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,580
I would've too.

70
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:58,259
Come back!

71
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,979
Just what are you thinking?

72
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,500
That has nothing to do with you.

73
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:10,019
This tonic is expensive.

74
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,060
I'm giving it to you

75
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,139
only because I don't want you

76
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,819
to die before I enter the sanctuary.

77
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,739
Come back here!

78
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:25,260
Look.

79
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,739
Even if you gained the right
to enter the sanctuary,

80
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,419
other people still think

81
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:33,340
that you were abandoned by Chu Moshang.

82
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,178
For Feng Zhilou's sake,

83
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:37,179
he'd risk his life to return.

84
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,099
Why?

85
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,338
Why would Chu Moshang

86
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:43,340
rather die than choose me?

87
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,619
Look.

88
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,340
What's this?

89
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,179
You've killed him.

90
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,220
This is my gift.

91
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:56,619
The Wujing Saintess

92
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,140
must be my wife.

93
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,179
Alright.

94
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,659
Once I'm the Dragon Queen,

95
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,459
I'll kill Feng Zhilou

96
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,059
and everyone in Feng Village.

97
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:09,179
No one can stand in my way.

98
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:14,659
It'd be better if Chu Moshang
is included as well.

99
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,499
Whether it's the throne

100
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,580
or the Wujing Saintess,

101
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:23,619
they're all mine.

102
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,700
They can only be mine.

103
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,020
That's because

104
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,780
only the victors

105
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,659
can write history.

106
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:37,299
You're right.

107
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,299
We really are the same.

108
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,980
(War God's Hall)

109
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,259
Li Yan proves helpful even now.

110
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,859
Thank goodness we have his token.

111
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:07,499
Wind, fire, thunder, lightning.

112
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,940
Swift as the wind,

113
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:10,419
striking like lightning.

114
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,899
Wujing Saintess, hear my call.

115
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,859
Come to me!

116
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:19,760
I knew it!
The Dragon King's Decree lies.

117
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,059
Everything written here is a lie!

118
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,040
If anything happens to Zhilou
and the young master,

119
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,859
I'll eat those two vile women!

120
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:33,700
Wind, fire, thunder, lightning.

121
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,098
Swift as the wind,

122
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:36,380
striking like lightning.

123
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:39,539
Wujing Saintess, hear my call.

124
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,460
Come to me!

125
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,620
(Dragon King's Decree)

126
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,059
Xiaoyu!

127
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:55,859
Xiaoyu, are you okay?

128
00:06:57,859 --> 00:06:59,459
I just saw Zhilou.

129
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,140
What do we do now?

130
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,020
(No matter what, we can't give up.)

131
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,459
Miss Zhilou,

132
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,220
We're here with the Black
and White Envoys.

133
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,579
He's weaker again.

134
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,218
Where is he?

135
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:21,859
Where is he?

136
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,859
Based on what you've said,

137
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,940
since Prince Shang is heavily wounded,

138
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,939
it'll be hard for him to recover

139
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,260
even with his dragon pearl.

140
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:33,899
You old coot!

141
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,459
What are you saying?

142
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,259
He just can't recover
without the dragon pearl.

143
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,700
He would never die!

144
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:53,778
His Highness' reverse scale
turned into the sanctuary's sigil.

145
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,260
No one can touch it now.

146
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,379
It defends and heals him

147
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,858
from the attack's damage.

148
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:00,658
But the sigil is now

149
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:03,859
with Feng Zhilou.
It can't be taken away.

150
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,820
His Highness refuses
to kill Feng Zhilou,

151
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:10,019
so he can only be healed
with the dragon pearl.

152
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,099
His soul is now
in the heart-guard scale,

153
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:14,819
but it's still with Feng Zhilou.

154
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,419
Now that she's gone,

155
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:17,859
how can we heal him?

156
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,059
The moment he
lost the heart-guard scale,

157
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,499
His Highness was likely

158
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,338
prepared to die.

159
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:25,699
He never thought
his dragon pearl would return.

160
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,460
Enough.

161
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,499
What's the use of saying that now?

162
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,460
His Highness is dying!

163
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,300
How can we fulfill Prince Shang's
and Miss Zhilou's wishes?

164
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,859
This is what you wanted.

165
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,099
We only wish to protect the sanctuary
and the mortal realm

166
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,379
against the Demons' invasion.

167
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,139
Since everything is set in stone,

168
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:44,739
our task at hand now is

169
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,578
to deliver the Wujing Saintess'
battle robe to Wujing

170
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:51,099
to complete the union
with the Wujing Saintess.

171
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,259
However, the groom must
be someone else now.

172
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:57,379
There's no use

173
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,859
in keeping Prince Shang's
dragon pearl.

174
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,340
Please hand it over
to the Dragon King.

175
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,259
After millennia
of living up high in the sanctuary,

176
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:08,019
you're not just cold-hearted.

177
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,499
You're heartless!

178
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,058
The dragon pearl must stay here.

179
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,779
It must stay here.

180
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,580
If the young master dies
and the world suffers,

181
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,700
Bai Lu and I will deliver it
back to the sanctuary.

182
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,779
No matter how slim the chances,

183
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,060
no one can take it away now.

184
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,540
Fei Yuan!

185
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,300
Do you want to die?

186
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,739
Leave the dragon pearl here!

187
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,700
Fei Yuan!

188
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,580
You can keep the dragon pearl.

189
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,298
Since you want
to wait for a miracle,

190
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,259
you can wait here.

191
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,379
Remember.

192
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:51,460
Don't forget your duties.

193
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,420
The marriage with Wujing
is important.

194
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,219
You two must be there

195
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,899
to help out.

196
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,820
Fei Yuan.

197
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,580
The young master
really can't be saved.

198
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:22,180
No.

199
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:23,979
There must be a way.

200
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,099
We haven't seen Feng Zhilou
since returning.

201
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,180
She won't take him away for nothing.

202
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,379
If there's any hope at all,

203
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,460
we can't give up.

204
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:36,779
Fei Yuan,

205
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,099
you're unexpectedly reliable.

206
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,340
The young master has
always been so capable.

207
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,460
It's normal for me

208
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,060
to be careless.

209
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,300
In the future,

210
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,259
I'll protect you.

211
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,859
Your Majesty,

212
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,339
when we checked on the young master,

213
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,099
it was already too late.

214
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:04,340
Nothing can be done for him.

215
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:10,538
Come,

216
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:11,499
my oldest son.

217
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,178
Father.

218
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:14,019
You're the Dragons' heir.

219
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,460
If the sanctuary's barrier is broken,

220
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:19,339
you must find the Dragon King's Decree
in the mortal realm

221
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,658
and marry the descendant
of the Wujing Saintess

222
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:24,700
to restore the barrier

223
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,739
and save the Dragons and the humans.

224
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:29,458
I will

225
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,019
carry out my duty.

226
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:55,259
Shang was burdened
with too much since he was born,

227
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,859
but he has never asked for anything

228
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,259
other than

229
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,778
in the marriage
with the Wujing Saintess.

230
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,379
For this,

231
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,979
he defied me for the first time.

232
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:08,979
That's why I took his dragon pearl out
as punishment.

233
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,259
But I never gave up on him.

234
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:13,499
That's because

235
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,099
I think he's the best choice
for Dragon King.

236
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:20,820
Your Majesty, the mistake is done.

237
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,298
We should get ready for what's next.

238
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:26,339
Take the Wujing Saintess' battle robe

239
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,818
to Wujing.

240
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:31,779
Just tell them the second prince
of the Dragons will be the groom

241
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,298
and welcome the Wujing Saintess
to the sanctuary.

242
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,619
The throne of the Dragon King
will go to Zhi.

243
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,300
He and the Saintess
will be the new king and queen.

244
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,058
The barrier is weakening.

245
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,979
Where have you gone?

246
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,499
What a rare view.

247
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,540
Father, you care about where I've gone.

248
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,300
I...

249
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,420
Don't you know your brother's dying?

250
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,339
Don't you feel guilty?

251
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,619
Guilty?

252
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:14,180
Why would I feel guilty?

253
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,778
Moshang gave up on the throne.

254
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,219
He was irresponsible,

255
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,178
foolish and weak.

256
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:20,700
As for you,

257
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:23,859
you cruelly took his dragon pearl.

258
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,818
Don't you know

259
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:27,220
how important it is to a dragon?

260
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:29,739
You and Moshang caused this.

261
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,940
You don't feel guilty, so why should I?

262
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:33,538
You wretched brat!

263
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:35,580
You're cold-hearted!

264
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,739
Cold-hearted?

265
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:42,499
Isn't that good?

266
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,058
A dragon bears a heavy duty.

267
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,700
One should
discard those useless emotions.

268
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,580
Father,

269
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,979
you usually only care about Moshang.

270
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,778
Even if he kept defying you,

271
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,060
you didn't care.

272
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,099
But me?

273
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,658
I'm always by your side,

274
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,578
yet you never look at me.

275
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:03,298
How insolent!

276
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:04,458
What's with that attitude?

277
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:06,139
I'm talking to Father. Don't interrupt!

278
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,220
Listen up.

279
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,859
The important duty of the Dragons

280
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,019
is now on my shoulders.

281
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,300
Only I

282
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,899
can become Dragon King.

283
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:24,820
Only I can

284
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,739
marry the Wujing Saintess.

285
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,219
Shang has gone through and done a lot.
You don't have the same experience.

286
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,480
You might not be able to do it!

287
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,300
Father,

288
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,660
do you have any other choice?

289
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,340
I am the only one left.

290
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,099
You have no choice.

291
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:47,700
Yes.

292
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:49,460
Yes.

293
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,099
All of this was

294
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,139
caused by me.

295
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:58,099
Fix your disgraceful look

296
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,259
and head to Wujing's War God Hall.

297
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:03,658
I, Nie Rongzhi,

298
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:05,859
will carry out my duty.

299
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,960
(War God Hall)

300
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:13,460
This is Wujing's War God Hall.

301
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:15,060
Why are we here?

302
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,900
(War God Hall)

303
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,899
You were alone in Feng Manor.

304
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,859
Now, there are many who wait for you.

305
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,940
You're the Wujing Saintess they chose.

306
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,259
Even if someone pretends
to be the Saintess by drinking blood,

307
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,660
they can't be summoned
by the Dragon King's Decree.

308
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,099
The Dragon King's Decree
has already recorded down

309
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,240
(Dragon King's Decree)
how to verify the true Saintess.

310
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,499
Who are they?

311
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,139
