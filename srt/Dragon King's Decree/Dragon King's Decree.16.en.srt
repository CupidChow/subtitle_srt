What now?

31
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,180
Do the Dragons always
have to be this overbearing?

32
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,979
Are you planning

33
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,539
to give up your Icebound Sword too?

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,340
Anything I give stays with the person

35
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,180
unless I decide to take it back.

36
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,580
No one else gets to return it for them.

37
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,340
Then wait until the day I die miserably

38
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:55,979
or live out my years,

39
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,658
and you may

00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,699
reclaim each of your treasures.

00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,098
Only my death

Feng Zhilou,

45
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,740
do you have to be this cruel?

46
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,020
Dragon God,

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,379
we were strangers to begin with.

48
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,538
Let's end it here.

49
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,699
You go your way, and I'll go mine.
No more mixing fates.

50
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,739
That's how it should be.

51
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,180

Liluo?

00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,380
Liluo!

59
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,859
Mother,

60
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:23,059
what am I supposed to do?

61
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,020
What happened?

62
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,499
It's my fault for being useless.

63
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,539
You've suffered so much because of me.

64
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,858
The sacred marriage alliance
was our last hope.

65
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,859
But now

66
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,580
a woman has
suddenly appeared at Feng Manor,

67
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,140
and she has feelings for Prince Shang.

68
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,140
I don't know

69
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,460
when I'll ever be able to get you out.

70
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:54,820
Liluo,

71
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,499
my sweet girl...

72
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,299
Everything I've done for you
has been worth it.

73
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,220
As long as
the Dragon King's decree stands,

74
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:11,979
the sanctuary will recognize you
as the Wujing Saintess.

75
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,979
There's no way Prince Shang

76
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,140
will marry anyone else.

77
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:19,220
But...

78
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,499
Her Lordship just drank your blood,

79
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,539
and her illness has flared up again.

80
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,700
She's forcing me
to come to you for the cure.

81
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,778
I hate this, Mother.

82
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,820
But I really have no choice.

83
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,700
It seems

84
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,260
Feng Zhilou's medicine

85
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,700
really works.

86
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,419
Feng Zhilou

87
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,299
has not only awakened her spiritual root

88
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,059
but also mastered good medical skills.

89
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,658
I'm afraid

90
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:50,220
she could become a real threat to me.

91
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,538
After all,

92
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:54,978
your youthful appearance

93
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,739
is entirely sustained
by the Saintess' bloodline.

94
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,020
However,

95
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,260
Yue's bloodline

96
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:04,059
was passed down

97
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,020
to her daughter.

98
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:07,700
I never expected

99
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,858
Feng Qingfeng would fool me

100
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:12,059
back then.

101
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,780
Not exactly.

102
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:16,780
Yue has grown weaker

103
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:18,220
these past days.

104
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,299
Her Saintess bloodline

105
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,979
is fading.

106
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,459
That's why drinking her blood

107
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,260
no longer works for you.

108
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,179
If a borrowed bloodline

109
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,820
can help Liluo
pass the Dragons' inspection,

110
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,940
why not

111
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:35,820
use Feng Zhilou's blood?

112
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,340
You're right.

113
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,298
Millennial Elk Blood
can take control of a person's body.

114
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,820
If we trick Feng Zhilou into drinking it

115
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:51,460
and keep her firmly under our control,

116
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,738
nothing will stand in your way.

117
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,059
I'll start preparing immediately.

118
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:08,020
Mother,

119
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,940
is Feng Zhilou really Yue's daughter?

120
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,340
I underestimated her.

121
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,418
Chu Moshang has been so cold to me.

122
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,580
He nearly married
that little wretch at Feng Manor.

123
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,178
If he finds out

124
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:23,260
she's really Yue's daughter,

125
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:25,538
how could I ever become Dragon Queen?

126
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,700
Don't panic.

127
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,819
Look at her today.

128
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,019
She just discovered the man by her side

129
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,538
is Prince Shang.

130
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,940
Not to mention,

131
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,180
she'll eventually learn about Yue.

132
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,220
What matters most right now

133
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,938
is passing the Saintess bloodline test.

134
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:47,019
But I am not the real Saintess.

135
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,979
How could my daughter

136
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,859
ever be superior to Yue's?

137
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,580
The positions of Wujing City Lord

138
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:01,698
and the future Dragon Queen

139
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:04,060
are ours alone.

140
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:05,139
And you...

141
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,940
carry the bloodline of Wujing Saintess.

142
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:11,019
That's the absolute truth.

143
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,940
I want to be alone.

144
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,580
Zhilou,

145
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,899
give me some time.

146
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,859
I'll take care of everything.

147
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:37,340
Miss,

148
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,578
I've been looking for you everywhere.

149
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,739
That insane city lord
sent people after you again.

150
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,619
She said your medicine

151
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,859
made her feel much better.

152
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,180
She wants you at the palace
for the antidote.

153
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,700
Wait for me here.

154
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,578
(Butterfly Pavilion)

155
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:53,820
I'll go with you.

156
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:56,220
As what?

157
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,739
Miss, please be careful.

158
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,739
Where is Her Lordship?

159
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:36,019
Xiaoyu!

160
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,099
Feng Zhilou,

161
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,700
she's in my hands now.

162
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,499
I suggest you behave.

163
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,580
What exactly do you want from me?

164
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,019
What is this?

165
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,259
This is just some elk blood.

166
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,060
It's very nourishing.

167
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,580
Take it and drink.

168
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,019
Do you think
you're in any position to bargain?

169
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,220
Can you let Xiaoyu go now?

170
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,940
(Find the Dragon King's Decree.)

171
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:42,219
(The mortal realm
and the sanctuary need you.)

172
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,019
Mother?

173
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,379
(Find the Dragon King's Decree.)

174
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:46,820
(The mortal realm
and the sanctuary need you.)

175
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:56,580
Her power is really that strong?

176
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,698
She's the one!

177
00:11:58,699 --> 00:11:59,580
Grab her!

178
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:00,538
Hold her down!

179
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:01,538
Draw her blood now!

180
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:02,859
Don't let her get away!

181
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:07,099
With her blood,

182
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,340
I can finally be cured.

183
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,540
What happened?

184
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,660
Yan,

185
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,660
hand Feng Zhilou over to me.

186
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:54,259
Mother,

187
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:55,458
I've seen the signs of fate.

188
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:56,578
What signs?

189
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:57,818
There's no time to waste.

190
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,178
You can't fight destiny.

191
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,619
You cannot harm Zhilou at all.

192
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,820
Enough.

193
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:08,420
Feng Zhilou

194
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,220
will destroy your sister,

195
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,379
ruin you,

196
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,099
and even ruin everything
I've built in this lifetime.

197
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,899
My lord!

198
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,619
Mother!

199
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:23,139
Mother!

200
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,058
My lord!

201
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:25,379
Mother!

202
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:30,660
Liluo.

203
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:34,619
Did you give Mother

204
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,420
anti-aging tonics
from some shady place again?

205
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:39,739
Shady place?

206
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,060
Li Yan,

207
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,340
you're ridiculous.

208
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,619
You'd turn on us

209
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,660
over some village girl.

210
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,379
Since you're so desperate
to know the truth,

211
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,379
I'll just tell you.

212
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,660
My dear brother,

213
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,698
your eyes

214
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,499
were never yours to begin with.

215
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:07,259
If you don't want them,

216
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,580
then give them back to me and Mother.

217
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,019
I won't let anyone stand in my way.

218
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,099
Not even my own brother.

219
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:36,060
If your eyes can't serve me,

220
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,180
then you can stay blind.

221
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:54,060
What's going on?

222
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,499
This is how the Wujing Saintess
carry herself?

223
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,979
You're utterly vicious,

224
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:34,139
harming the innocent
and even those closest to you.

225
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,979
No, Young Master.

226
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,139
That's not true.

227
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:41,058
Feng Zhilou,

228
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:42,700
I'm not done with you!

229
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:07,619
Young Master, this is bad!

230
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,779
There's demonic energy
spreading in the western outskirts.

231
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,219
Zhilou,

232
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,820
you're stable now.

233
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,899
I have to contain the demonic energy.

234
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,580
Wait for me to return.

235
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,820
Miss, you're awake.

236
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,499
Hunbao,

237
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,779
what happened to me?

238
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,458
That awful city lord
made you drink the elk blood.

239
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,259
It carries a blood curse
meant to control you.

240
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,458
Luckily, Young Master saved you in time.

241
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:48,739
He said your war-god constitution kept you safe.

242
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:51,658
Miss!

243
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:52,859
Where's Chu Moshang?

244
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,460
Young Master

245
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,339
stayed by your side all day,

246
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,058
but just now

247
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,300
he rushed out with Fei Yuan and Bai Lu.

248
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:02,739
They said disasters
broke out outside the city again.

249
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,019
There's demonic energy
gathering everywhere.

250
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,819
Demonic energy everywhere?

251
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,339
Then isn't he in danger?

252
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:09,979
Miss!

253
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,099
You can't get out of bed.

254
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,139
Young Master told me

255
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,619
it's my job to watch over you.

256
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,178
If he comes back and finds you gone,

257
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,899
he'll punish me
and turn me into a mudfish.

258
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,178
Please, I'm begging you.

259
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,180
I hate mudfish the most.

260
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:22,579
Alright then.

261
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,658
Is that you,

262
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:35,579
Xiaoyu?

263
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:44,460
I knew it was you.

264
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,018
Only you

265
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:48,700
would bring me medicine
and tend to my eyes everyday.

266
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:58,339
You don't need
to trouble yourself anymore.

267
00:17:59,499 --> 00:18:01,579
I can't see a thing now.

268
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,140
Why are you crying?

269
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:13,779
Xiaoyu,

270
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:16,620
I was born blind.

271
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,299
I didn't see light until I was three.

272
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:21,660
I gained the power to glimpse fate.

273
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,940
Now I'm simply back where I started.

274
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:26,940
There's nothing to be sad about.

275
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:31,900
How serene you sound now.

276
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,779
Do you think
that ability came from yourself?

277
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,698
You're blind now,

278
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,418
yet you've forgotten how sick Mother was

279
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:40,178
before you lost your sight?

280
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,180
Liluo,

281
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,498
hasn't it been obvious

282
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,059
how Prince Shang feels about you?

283
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,299
I already saw

284
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,218
that the one
wearing the Wujing Saintess robes

285
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:49,539
was Feng Zhilou.

286
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:53,220
And you saw my coronation
as Dragon Queen too.

287
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:55,498
If I could choose,

288
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:57,739
I'd rather have stayed blind forever.

289
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:02,180
Then stay here and stay blind forever.

290
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:04,180
I'm going to save Mother.

291
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:06,059
Chu Xiaoyu,

292
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:07,539
come with me.

293
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,099
I want her here

294
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,579
to treat my eyes.

295
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:17,380
You really think
your eyes can be treated?

296
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,099
A blind man

297
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,660
and a mute girl

298
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,100
make the perfect pair.

299
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:42,394

00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:48,390
