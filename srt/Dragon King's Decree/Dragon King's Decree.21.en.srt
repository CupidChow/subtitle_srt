25
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:15,717
Are you not going
to treat my mother, Physician Chu?

26
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:18,515
Feng Zhilou seems

27
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:20,236
to quite like you.

28
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,277
Xiaoyu,

29
00:02:23,796 --> 00:02:27,236
you should be my most loyal dog.

30
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:31,197
Take your shoes off.

31
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:33,396
I'll be waiting in the bedchamber.

32
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:29,635
Xiaoyu, I'll help you

33
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:30,916
no matter what you want to do.

34
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:33,477
Just like how you helped me.

35
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:49,716
You always carry the fragrance
of various herbs

36
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:51,236
from the apothecary.

37
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:54,396
It's a soothing scent.

38
00:04:01,796 --> 00:04:02,755
Xiaoyu,

39
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,595
life will be very hard
in the days to come.

40
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:05,956
Maybe even miserable.

41
00:04:06,076 --> 00:04:06,997
But

42
00:04:07,157 --> 00:04:08,195
you must also remember.

43
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:09,515
You are a physician.

44
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,355
You can cure others,

45
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:12,877
and you can cure yourself too.

46
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:29,236
Do you really think

47
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:32,516
I'd forgive a dog that betrayed me?

48
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:34,155
How dare a mute like you

49
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:37,275
desire what doesn't belong to you!

50
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:40,237
You'd plot with Feng Zhilou
behind my back.

51
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:42,797
No wonder people say

52
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:44,797
that barking dogs

53
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:46,237
seldom bite.

54
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,796
(Apothecary)

55
00:05:08,797 --> 00:05:09,596
What is it?

56
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:11,317
For some odd reason,

57
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:13,917
I've been feeling uneasy

58
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:16,677
since last night.

59
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,835
Xiaoyu was summoned to Longevity Hall.

60
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:20,636
Why hasn't she returned yet?

61
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,757
Why don't we talk to Li Yan

62
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:27,357
so that Chu Xiaoyu is no longer responsible
for treating Li Yue's blood poisoning?

63
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:29,996
Not only that,

64
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,396
but Li Yue's illness is also incurable
in the first place.

65
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:36,396
Oh?

66
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,796
Have you not learned from last time?

67
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:39,117
You've misunderstood.

68
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:41,557
We'd never attack a bride
of the Dragons,

69
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:43,836
the wife of Prince Shang.

70
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:45,197
However,

71
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:46,635
Her Grace just took care

72
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:48,476
of a dog.

73
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:52,437
Please come to collect the corpse.

74
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,440
(Apothecary)

75
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:08,476
You're here.

76
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:09,797
Come in.

77
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:12,197
Take your trash away too.

78
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:15,357
How filthy.

79
00:06:15,437 --> 00:06:16,997
She's an eyesore.

80
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:28,076
Xiaoyu.

81
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:29,997
Xiaoyu, wake up.

82
00:06:30,997 --> 00:06:32,036
Wake up.

83
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:45,716
Are you mad?

84
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,076
No way.

85
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:49,315
Do you want to kill me

86
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:51,677
to avenge that mute?

87
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:53,997
What to do?

88
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:56,476
I'm the princess of Wujing

89
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:58,596
and of the Wujing Saintess' bloodline.

90
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:00,437
Dare you kill me?

91
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:26,956
Xiaoyu,

92
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:29,836
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:32,076
I was late.

94
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:34,516
I failed to protect you.

95
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:36,956
To the outside world,

96
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:40,716
I'm the fearless Feng Zhilou.

97
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:44,437
But in Xiaoyu's eyes,

98
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:47,876
I'm the friend

99
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:49,516
she needed to take care of.

100
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,197
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:01,836
What happened?

102
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:04,236
Princess Liluo,

103
00:08:04,237 --> 00:08:05,356
your dear sister,

104
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:06,716
sure is a kind woman.

105
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:08,755
She took advantage of the mute

106
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,437
and illiterate physician serving her

107
00:08:10,477 --> 00:08:11,955
who's unable to spill her secrets,

108
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:13,317
ordering her around.

109
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:14,835
She even went as far

110
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,797
as to kill Chu Xiaoyu to make a point.

111
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:20,917
Xiaoyu?

112
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:22,797
Where is Xiaoyu?

113
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:23,916
Zhilou,

114
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:24,955
was he telling the truth?

115
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:25,715
Come here!

116
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:27,677
Check out what your sister did!

117
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:32,237
Xiaoyu.

118
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:34,557
Xiaoyu.

119
00:08:37,437 --> 00:08:40,157
Wujing is full of treachery.

120
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,677
Only you treat everyone with sincerity.

121
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,356
You just arrived into my life.

122
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:48,917
How could you be gone just like that?

123
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:58,437
Young Lord,

124
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:00,277
no need to put on an act.

125
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:02,557
Do you really care for Xiaoyu?

126
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:05,116
Are you really upset over her?

127
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:07,996
All you care about
is why Xiaoyu hasn't gone

128
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:10,197
to treat your eyes today.

129
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,157
Leave now.

130
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:23,157
Congratulations, your grace.

131
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:26,917
Prince Rong sent a message
on the sanctuary's behalf.

132
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:28,356
In three days,

133
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:30,635
Prince Shang of the sanctuary

134
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,395
will deliver the Wujing Saintess' robe

135
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:34,675
and hold the ceremony

136
00:09:34,676 --> 00:09:36,716
to welcome you to the sanctuary.

137
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:40,637
Feng Zhiluo isn't dead yet.

138
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:42,756
How am I meant to rest easy?

139
00:09:42,877 --> 00:09:44,596
Do you want Prince Shang to marry me

140
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:46,037
with her still on his mind?

141
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:47,996
Furthermore, we both know

142
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:49,836
about the Wujing Saintess' bloodline.

143
00:09:51,477 --> 00:09:53,795
The sanctuary fully believes
in the results

144
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:55,596
of the ceremony.

145
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:57,317
Everything is ready.

146
00:09:57,636 --> 00:09:58,756
Now is the time

147
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:02,076
to root out the problem.

148
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:05,236
Darn it.

149
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:07,076
Prince Shang is always

150
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:08,476
hanging around Feng Zhilou.

151
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:09,635
How am I meant to do it?

152
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:10,596
Liluo!

153
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:12,797
Young Lord.

154
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:16,476
Why did you kill Chu Xiaoyu?

155
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:20,316
You make a scene

156
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:23,236
and question me merely
over her death.

157
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,076
Just how cruel are you?

158
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:28,716
You speak of taking lives with ease

159
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,356
like they're worth nothing!

160
00:10:31,036 --> 00:10:32,317
How noble you are.

161
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:33,876
How graceful.

162
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:35,397
Li Yan,

163
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:37,557
you call me cruel,

164
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:40,035
but when you and Feng Zhilou
steal Yue away,

165
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:42,275
you will not only get Mother
and me killed,

166
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:44,996
you will have also
killed the innocent civilians of Wujing.

167
00:10:44,997 --> 00:10:46,236
Which of us is more cruel?

168
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:48,557
What do you mean by that?

169
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:53,116
Do you know that in order

170
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:55,437
to restore your eyesight,

171
00:10:55,516 --> 00:10:57,277
Mother took full responsibility

172
00:10:57,636 --> 00:11:00,116
so that you won't feel guilty

173
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:02,356
and can become the noble gentleman

174
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,555
everyone speaks of?

175
00:11:03,556 --> 00:11:06,756
You're now
the esteemed young lord of Wujing,

176
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:09,517
yet what did you do in return?

177
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:11,076
You wish to destroy my future

178
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:13,157
and everything we've done.

179
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:15,797
Mother and I are like this now

180
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:17,035
all because of karma.

181
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:18,637
Of course, there's a price to pay.

182
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,437
But the true price is

183
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:24,116
the status as Wujing City Lord

184
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:25,756
and the Dragon Queen!

185
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:32,996
My dear

186
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:34,635
and beloved brother.

187
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:36,756
You're actually crazy

188
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:38,635
and bloodthirsty monsters.

189
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:40,397
How are you any different
from the Demons?

190
00:11:41,156 --> 00:11:42,596
And you still think

191
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:44,197
you can marry into the Dragons.

192
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:47,317
Every day, Xiaoyu had
to witness your filthy deeds

193
00:11:47,597 --> 00:11:49,557
yet can't speak of them.

194
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:51,037
She had no one to confide in

195
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,236
and nowhere to plead for justice.

196
00:11:54,077 --> 00:11:56,356
Oh, how much Xiaoyu suffered.

197
00:11:58,036 --> 00:11:59,476
My dear brother,

198
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:02,917
you're a kid still
living the dream Mother created.

199
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:04,316
You forever fantasize

200
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:06,316
that the world is fair

201
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:07,677
and beautiful.

202
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:10,437
You should be glad

203
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:13,037
that you're under my control now.

204
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:16,157
If we weren't blood related,

205
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:18,517
I wouldn't bother to keep you alive.

206
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:19,677
Get lost!

207
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:24,677
I don't have a sister like you.

208
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:11,797
Xiaoyu,

209
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,437
they say that in Wujing,

210
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:15,956
the souls of dead children

211
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:18,596
transform into fireflies.

212
00:13:20,156 --> 00:13:21,956
With them by your side,

213
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:24,756
you won't be lonely.

214
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:08,037
Thinking of Xiaoyu?

215
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,596
I'm reminded of how I was always bullied

216
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:13,876
in Feng Manor.

217
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:18,476
But I had my father,
secretly protecting me.

218
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:21,956
Uncle Qingyun silently supported me.

219
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,557
What about Xiaoyu?

220
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,596
The physicians of the apothecary,

221
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,116
Li Yue,

222
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:31,317
Liluo,

223
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:34,517
and the so-called nobles of Wujing

224
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:37,236
all abused and humiliated her.

225
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,996
She was already battered all over,

226
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:44,037
yet she was kind enough to heal them

227
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,317
and try her best to live on.

228
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:49,356
She was just a simple girl,

229
00:14:50,997 --> 00:14:53,637
yet there was nowhere to shelter her.

230
00:14:58,837 --> 00:15:00,037
Zhilou,

231
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:03,076
these are all meant
to help you grow stronger,

232
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,157
to find more like Chu Xiaoyu

233
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:07,157
and have them come to you.

234
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:08,677
You'll protect them,

235
00:15:09,516 --> 00:15:11,236
save them from future abuse,

236
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:13,797
and create a bigger home for them.

237
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:15,277
As for me,

238
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:17,876
I'll always be with you.

239
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:22,716
Nie Rongzhi has

240
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:24,356
come all the way here from the sanctuary

241
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,557
and declared I must continue
to marry Liluo.

242
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,517
I have to settle this matter.

243
00:15:30,317 --> 00:15:31,637
There's no need

244
00:15:31,837 --> 00:15:33,277
for explanations between us.

245
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,076
I'll always wait here for you.

246
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:39,277
Keep yourself safe here.

247
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:41,076
Wait for my return.

248
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,116
Prince Shang,

249
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:16,557
you're here.

250
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:18,716
Do you regret it?

251
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,996
Tonight is a gorgeous evening.

252
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:24,996
Doesn't it make me look even prettier?

253
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:27,677
Tell me.

254
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:31,116
Am I a hundred times more beautiful

255
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,996
than Feng Manor's bumpkin?

256
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:40,917
You are the Wujing Saintess,

257
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:50,157
yet your dress

258
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:52,677
is too plain and bland.

259
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:55,236
It's like you're mourning.

260
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:58,116
The great Wujing Saintess

261
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:01,116
should be dressed in bold colors

262
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:03,596
to compliment your bold ambitions.

263
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,356
You've delivered the message
on the sanctuary's behalf,

264
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:07,836
so leave already.

265
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:12,637
What is it?

266
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:15,437
Can I not make a detour

267
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:18,316
to admire the Wujing Saintess?

268
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:23,556
I think

269
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:26,917
that even if it's to be the Dragon King,

270
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:30,556
you don't actually want
to win my favor.

271
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:36,117
You should know

272
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:37,956
that the princes of the sanctuary

273
00:17:38,117 --> 00:17:40,756
still have the right
to choose our own wives,

274
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:43,516
even if we don't

275
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:46,117
marry the Wujing Saintess,

276
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,516
no one can threaten our authority.

277
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:51,837
Are you mocking me?

278
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,077
That's just a fact.

279
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,556
Without the Dragon King's Decree,

280
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:00,276
you are just

281
00:18:00,277 --> 00:18:02,397
a human princess.

282
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:05,996
But everyone wants

283
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:08,397
to be the Dragon King and Queen.

284
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:14,637
Alright.

285
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:17,796
I'm going to kill Feng Zhilou anyway

286
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,276
while you want to take
Prince Shang's place.

287
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:23,837
Keep Chu Moshang away from Feng Zhilou,

288
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:26,316
and I'll consider your suggestion.

289
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:28,116
Finally, you have

290
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:29,837
proposed a good idea.

291
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:31,796
I merely think that the true victors

292
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,675
are those who can fight to the end.

293
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,556
The process doesn't matter,

294
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:40,716
but I must be the Dragon Queen.

295
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:49,076
Father, please retract the decree
arranging the marriage with Wujing.

296
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:50,356
You don't want to watch

297
00:18:50,357 --> 00:18:52,397
as I refuse to marry in public, right?

298
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:56,276
Father,

299
00:18:56,277 --> 00:18:58,756
I've delivered your decree to Wujing.

300
00:18:58,757 --> 00:19:01,637
We only await the delivery
of the Wujing Saintess' battle robe.

301
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:03,476
Nie Rongzhi,

302
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:05,197
there's no need

303
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:06,956
for you to worry about my affairs.

304
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:09,996
Everyone, dismissed.
