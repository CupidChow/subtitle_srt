=Episode 12=

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,899
People of the Serpents,

26
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,220
listen to me!

27
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,820
Who is this?

28
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:08,380
Who is she?

29
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:12,580
Zhilou!

30
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,100
Who are you people?

31
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:16,219
How dare you put out the sacred fire?

32
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:17,860
The tradition of offering

33
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,898
young girls to the Sacred Ancestor

34
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:21,659
is a lie.

35
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,099
From start to finish,

36
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:24,939
it was all fabricated!

37
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,979
It's true!

38
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,618
Chief Luo gathered girls

39
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:29,338
and sold them to merchants.

40
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:31,939
He was only after profit!

41
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,338
We intercepted his carriage

42
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,020
and freed some of them.

43
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:37,738
But the last girl and I

44
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:38,898
couldn't escape.

45
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:41,219
It was all a scam!

46
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,899
A scam?

47
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:44,139
Then...

48
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,539
Then where is my child?

49
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,018
Where is my child?

50
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:48,419
You said they were freed.

51
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,619
Where is she?

52
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,578
They lied!

53
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,338
Do not trust these outsiders!

54
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,379
Do not listen to them!

55
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,259
Yes, they are lying!

56
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,859
They are lying!

57
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,659
We cannot be fooled!

58
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,578
Yeah.

59
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,499
Liars!

60
00:02:57,619 --> 00:03:00,099
They are trying to deceive us.

61
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,499
Elder Zhang,

62
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,859
you're involved, aren't you?

63
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,300
How dare you, people of the Serpents!

64
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,618
I protected you for nine hundred years,

65
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:10,779
and now you tarnish my name!

66
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,898
Today,

67
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:13,939
all of you fools

68
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,700
will be wiped out!

69
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,700
Please calm down, Sacred Ancestor!

70
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,738
Please calm down, Sacred Ancestor!

71
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,178
Stand up!

72
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:23,860
Everyone, get up!

73
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,778
Why would the Sacred Ancestor
leave the cavern?

74
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,980
Stop pretending.

75
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:33,260
Is it?

76
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:39,458
The Sacred Ancestor is just a boy?

77
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:40,778
Do you really believe it?

78
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:41,498
No.

79
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:43,779
How dare you pretend

80
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,779
to be the Sacred Ancestor?

81
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,379
The Sacred Ancestor has truly appeared!

82
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,859
Anyone still doesn't believe me?

83
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,778
Ridiculous!

84
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:11,219
They accuse me of eating people.

85
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,379
I only eat roast chicken.

86
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,939
Do not forget that.

87
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,860
We will remember.

88
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,499
Mei!

89
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,899
Mei, are you alright?

90
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,939
You scared me.

91
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:27,259
I was wrong!

92
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,859
Please spare me!

93
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,138
I only

94
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,499
tried to survive.

95
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:35,099
My sister,

96
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,058
my tribe.

97
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:37,138
So many girls

98
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,900
were sold by you!

99
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,259
And now you ask for forgiveness?

100
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,459
Come.

101
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:43,779
Take him to the dungeon!

102
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,220
He will never see daylight again!

103
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,139
Wretched merchant!

104
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,139
Wretched merchant!

105
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,180
People of the Serpents,

106
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:57,139
the Sacred Ancestor is here,

107
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,819
and the villains are gone.

108
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,300
Fear is

109
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,019
not natural.

110
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:04,379
It is imposed on you,

111
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,540
like the hoods

112
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,618
on men

113
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:11,340
and the veils on women.

114
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,540
They are nothing

115
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,980
but tools to control you.

116
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,138
A woman's veil

117
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,259
hides more than her face.

118
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,540
It hides her smile,

119
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,259
her spirit,

120
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,379
and her kindness.

121
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:29,100
From today on,

122
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,138
no one will use sacrifice

123
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,459
to control others.

124
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:34,740
Women

125
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,180
will lift their veils

126
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:39,059
and reclaim their freedom.

127
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:40,378
Well said!

128
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,219
Bravo!

129
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,979
Wonderful!

130
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,980
Good!

131
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:14,660
Let's remove ours too.

132
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,219
Xu's child will recover soon.

133
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,900
A few days of rest will be enough.

134
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,938
As for Wang Youde,

135
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:31,178
his leg...

136
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:32,219
I don't have time

137
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,298
to treat it fully.

138
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:35,059
He is not to travel in the rain.

139
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,138
Oh.

140
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,019
There is also

141
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,618
a poisonous flower in the forest.

142
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:41,258
Remove its center and brew it.

143
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:42,579
It purifies the body.

144
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,660
I've written

145
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:45,339
the method

146
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,019
for the physicians.

147
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:51,138
Chu Moshang,

148
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,980
wait for me in the carriage.

149
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,699
Did you hear everything clearly?

150
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,780
Thank you.

151
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,619
Uncle Qingyun,

152
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,740
I think...

153
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,019
you should stay here.

154
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,178
Even if you leave,

155
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,698
your heart will stay here,

156
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,899
always thinking of her.

157
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,779
I...

158
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,900
Zhilou, what are you talking about?

159
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,340
Uncle Qingyun,

160
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:29,138
you're not young.

161
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:30,498
Think of yourself.

162
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,058
Listen to her.

163
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:33,099
Stay,

164
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,939
tend the wounded,

165
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,258
and help Elder Zhang
rebuild the Serpents.

166
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:37,938
Yes.

167
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:39,178
Please stay.

168
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:40,498
Please stay.

169
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:41,619
Zhilou,

170
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,219
I don't feel good

171
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,938
about you going to Wujing alone.

172
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:45,779
What is there to fear?

173
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,659
I am here

174
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,180
to protect her.

175
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,019
Uncle Qingyun,

176
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,379
don't worry.

177
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,498
With Chu Moshang and Hunbao,

178
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:55,780
nothing bad will happen.

179
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:56,819
Besides,

180
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,899
I am no longer a weakling

181
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,378
without martial skills.

182
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,818
Once I reach Wujing City

183
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:01,938
and find my mother,

184
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,259
I'll make a name for myself...

185
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:05,419
and return to honor your wedding!

186
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,058
Hey...

187
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:06,579
Let's go.

188
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,499
Zhilou!

189
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:08,699
I...

190
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,860
She's always playful.

191
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,300
Young Master,

192
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:21,378
the dragon pearl is vital to your life.

193
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,058
You risked

194
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:24,258
crossing the barrier

195
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,258
to give it to Feng Zhilou.

196
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,740
It was dangerous.

197
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,258
Her journey to Wujing

198
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,420
is full of danger.

199
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:31,939
The dragon pearl can
awaken her potential

200
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,900
and help her survive there.

201
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,298
Unexpectedly...

202
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,980
What is it, Young Master?

203
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,738
It triggered

204
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:41,420
the War God Constitution in her.

205
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,099
The War God Constitution?

206
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,380
How is that possible?

207
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,219
Isn't it exclusive

208
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,979
to the Wujing Saintess?

209
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:51,059
This must remain secret.

210
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:52,939
Perhaps she's destined

211
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,819
for something greater.

212
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:00,500
Let's go.

213
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,099
Next,

214
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,179
we meet with the Wujing City Lord.

215
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,498
Until Liluo confirms
the Wujing Saintess bloodline,

216
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:10,939
should we keep Zhilou away

217
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,620
from Young Master?

218
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,738
He has his plan.

219
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:16,378
Do not reveal his identity,

220
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:17,900
especially to that flood dragon.

221
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:21,540
That flood dragon...

222
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:24,299
Where is Mr. Feng?

223
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,179
Oh no!

224
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,778
We left him behind!

225
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:27,939
Stay calm.

226
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,979
He stayed behind

227
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,418
to fulfill his life mission.

228
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:31,898
What mission?

229
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:34,339
She mentioned it.

230
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:35,939
You wouldn't understand.

231
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,738
Hey, kid.

232
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:38,620
Call me Ancestor.

233
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,339
(Wujing City)

234
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,979
Zhilou, have we arrived at Wujing City?

235
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,140
(Mother, I've finally made it.)

236
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:06,380
Mother,

237
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:07,900
your youth-preserving tonic.

238
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,059
May you stay young forever.

239
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,579
You've always understood me

240
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,260
and known my heart.

241
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,979
I've always

242
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,380
been your good daughter.

243
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:26,979
My lord,

244
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,898
Feng Zhilou,
the Feng family's second daughter,

245
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,099
rumored to have connections
with the Dragons,

246
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,059
has entered the city.

247
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,900
The bumpkin who killed
the Lenghou father and son?

248
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,660
I'm incompetent.

249
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,258
I don't know how she did it,

250
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,540
but she even killed the scouts I sent.

251
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,018
She tamed the Serpents

252
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,939
who refused to obey.

253
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,498
She made it out of the Serpent Forest.

254
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,138
You couldn't even stop a bumpkin!

255
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:52,819
What use do I have
for you in Wujing City?

256
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,020
My lord, please calm down!

257
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,498
My scouts reported

258
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:57,339
that Feng Zhilu was just lucky.

259
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,900
(Elder Baiyue, Wujing City Priest)
She found the Dragons'

260
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,260
stranded troops,
which sparked her spiritual root.

261
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,260
The marriage to the Dragons

262
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,739
never actually happened.

263
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:13,658
True

264
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,339
or not,

265
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:19,500
for Liluo to claim
the title of Dragon Queen,

266
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,979
we must leave no loose ends.

267
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,059
Mother,

268
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:25,378
we still have Elder Baiyue

269
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,260
and General Dhuta.

270
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,658
They are your strongest allies.

271
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,059
There is nothing to fear.

272
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,258
But the moment to confirm

273
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,979
your identity
as the Wujing Saintess is close.

274
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:37,939
I don't want anything to go wrong.

275
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:39,459
Dark Dhuta,

276
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,380
you have three days.

277
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:42,778
Track her carefully

278
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,180
and make no mistakes.

279
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,540
Wait.

280
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:50,939
Tell the servants

281
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,138
to treat

282
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:54,380
that bumpkin properly.

283
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,219
Show proper hospitality.

284
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,859
As expected of the Dragons.

285
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,059
You even have estates in Wujing.

286
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,979
Where should Zhilou and I stay?

287
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:06,738
Hunbao,

288
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,059
you will stay with me.

289
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:08,738
No,

290
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:10,260
I will stay with Zhilou.

291
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,699
No,

292
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,018
men and women apart.

293
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,699
Men and women?

294
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,059
Why are you talking like humans?

295
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,699
We only have males and females.

296
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,618
Males are still men.

297
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:20,380
But I'm still a child.

298
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,260
A nine-hundred-year-old child?

299
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:24,579
Young Master,

300
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,778
let me stay with them

301
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,299
in the west wing.

302
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,658
There are plenty of empty rooms.

303
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:29,979
Let Fei Yuan stay with you

304
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,300
to keep an eye on you.

305
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:33,299
Fine.

306
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,418
I lived in a thatched hut
for over ten years.

307
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:36,738
This place feels

308
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,380
like a palace.

309
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:39,738
Hunbao,

310
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,658
let's go into town
and get some daily necessities.

311
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:42,099
Okay.

312
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,819
Let's go.

313
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:48,859
Young Master,

314
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,859
why

315
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,620
can't you sit still?

316
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,979
Humans have a seasoning

317
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,859
called vinegar.

318
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,099
It tastes sour.

319
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:00,819
Absurd.

320
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:03,219
I am a Dragon.

321
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,979
Why would I
be jealous of a flood dragon?

322
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,620
Especially a child.

323
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:09,979
A nine-hundred-year-old child.

324
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:15,579
Young Master,

325
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,778
time is short.

326
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,378
Tomorrow, you must
meet the Wujing City Lord

327
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:20,739
to discuss verifying
the Wuijng Saintess' bloodline.

328
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,979
Should we

329
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,260
keep this from Feng Zhilou?

330
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,099
Zhilou!

331
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,500
Look at this.

332
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,020
I think

333
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:32,219
before the verification,

334
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,180
it is better to keep outsiders away.

335
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:37,138
Feng Zhilou saved you.

336
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:37,898
This is nice.

337
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:38,738
But you

338
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:40,620
have already repaid her.

339
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:43,780
Fei Yuan, hold your tongue.

340
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:45,538
Be decisive.

341
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,819
That is the best way.

342
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:49,538
Hunbao, look at this.

343
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:50,739
It is time to pay!

344
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,180
Please,

345
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,179
I have no money for taxes.

346
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,618
Give me two more days.

347
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:57,900
No money?

348
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,378
Then you lose your stall!

349
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,540
Leave now!

350
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:17,339
Gaining a spiritual root
really changed her.

351
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,059
Apologize to them!

352
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,780
Do you know who I am?

353
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,059
I don't care.

354
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,420
If you don't apologize,
you can kneel here forever!

355
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,020
That is already lenient.

356
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,299
It's only a minor injury.

357
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,380
Nothing serious.

358
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,898
This is premium wound medicine.

359
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:32,738
Apply it twice a day

360
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:33,898
and keep it dry for five days,

361
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,579
or it may scar.

362
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,939
Miss,

363
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,738
are you a physician?

364
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:38,778
More than a physician.

365
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,339
She is a miraculous healer.

366
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:41,859
Thank you.

367
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,018
Help!

368
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,099
Someone is
being bullied in broad daylight!

369
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:48,179
Sir,

370
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,780
arrest this woman!

371
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,658
Are you a mad dog that bites

372
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:52,780
whoever you see?

373
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,500
Do you know who my father is?

374
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,258
I am

375
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:58,738
a relative
of the Wujing City Young Lord!

376
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,579
Even so,

377
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,339
you can't treat people like this!

378
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:03,699
Everyone,

379
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,020
it was our fault.

380
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,459
Our fault.

381
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,059
Take her away.

382
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,459
What?

383
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,618
You treat everyone
in Wujing City like this?

384
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,020
Of course not.

385
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:16,819

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,658
Young Lord,

400
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:51,979
I am innocent!

401
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,219
