=Episode 17=

25
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:00,739
Young Master,

26
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,858
the demonic energy invasion
is far worse than before.

27
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:03,978
You fought on your own.

28
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:05,539
Your wounds are serious.

29
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:07,240
You should return
to the sanctuary to heal.

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,060
I'm fine.

31
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,818
Zhilou will treat me here.

32
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:10,618
Zhilou again.

33
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,338
She's all you ever think about.

34
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:13,139
Is that a problem?

35
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,859
Do you expect him to think about you?

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,299
Young Master has his own plans.

37
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:16,859
Plans?

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,019
This is what you call plans?

39
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,899
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you blaming me?

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,979
I would never blame you.

41
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,460
- Watch your attitude.
- I...

42
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,840
- It's all your fault.
- It's all your fault.

43
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,580
Young Lord.

44
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,419
Just call me Li Yan.

45
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,658
The salve Xiaoyu made for you

46
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,859
slowly formed

47
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,139
a protective layer
over your eyes over the years.

48
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,938
Using Xiaoyu's medical texts,

49
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,579
I looked over your past condition

50
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,139
and wrote this prescription.

51
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,098
As long as you keep using it,

52
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,220
perhaps one day
you'll see the light again.

53
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:57,818
Thank you, Zhilou.

54
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,058
You know my mother's temper
is unpredictable.

55
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:02,699
Yet, you still risked your life
to treat her.

56
00:03:02,779 --> 00:03:05,139
And now you're
trying to restore my sight.

57
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,780
I don't know how to repay you.

58
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,659
You owe me nothing, Young Lord.

59
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,859
(I wonder)

60
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,020
(when he'll finally see again.)

61
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,139
All I can say is
he may regain some vision.

62
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,859
But I'm not sure how much.

63
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,819
He...

64
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,259
may not fully recover.

65
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:33,900
How much will I be able to see?

66
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,099
Only what's right before you.

67
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,900
It's okay.

68
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,340
If that's the case,

69
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,659
I can see the one standing before me.

70
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:59,179
Dragon God, it has only been a day.

71
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,019
How are you already this drained?

72
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,818
Where's Feng Zhilou?

73
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,378
We need her to treat Young Master.

74
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:05,538
She's treating Young Lord's eyes.

75
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:06,899
She's very busy.

76
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,419
Bai Lu,

77
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,819
go fetch Feng Zhilou.

78
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:11,620
I'll go.

79
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:15,939
Don't disturb Feng Zhilou

80
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,179
while she's treating patients.

81
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:19,259
You're injured and still have

82
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,459
the energy to get jealous?

83
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,939
What do you know, kid?

84
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,338
Hey, I'm 900 years old.

85
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:25,460
What 900-year-old
plays with a bamboo-copter?

86
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:27,418
It's called experiencing the mortal way.

87
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,539
Have you even tried it?
You stupid bird.

88
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:30,558
You're the stupid bird.

89
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:32,019
- You stupid flood dragon.
- You're stupider.

90
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,459
You're worse.

91
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,778
- Stupid!
- Stupid!

92
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:34,619
You overgrown snake!

93
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,099
Childish.

94
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,900
You stupid overgrown snake.

95
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,099
Your Grace,

96
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,299
our situation is becoming dire.

97
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,218
Yue is growing weaker by the day.

98
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,139
Her blood

99
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,059
barely sustains Her Lordship now,

100
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,859
let alone you.

101
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:53,259
Taking blood from Feng Zhilou

102
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,700
is not possible.

103
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,539
Chu Moshang will
keep a tight watch on her.

104
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:00,299
That makes Yue's blood
even more precious.

105
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,940
If that day really comes,

106
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,739
the only one
I can look out for is myself.

107
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,979
The most important thing now

108
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,178
is to have the sanctuary
confirm my identity.

109
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:18,418
So Yue will willingly cling to life

110
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,340
until my wedding day.

111
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,978
Your Grace,

112
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:23,499
once you begin,

113
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,580
you'll end up just like Her Lordship.

114
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,539
Do I even have a choice?

115
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,179
The only person

116
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:34,979
I can rely on is myself.

117
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,419
Only by becoming the true Dragon Queen

118
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,059
can I gain real power and status.

119
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,780
(Yingyue Palace)

120
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,940
(Youyun Pavilion)

121
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:04,858
Miss Zhilou,

122
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:07,098
Young Lord and Chu Xiaoyu
have already left.

123
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:08,739
May I speak with you?

124
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,260
Go on.

125
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,139
It was wrong of us
to hide Young Master's true identity.

126
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,659
But he's injured now.

127
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,619
Could you set aside your grievances

128
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,260
and help treat him?

129
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,820
How is...

130
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,619
your wound?

131
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:23,580
How do you feel?

132
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,619
Better.

133
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:27,900
Then rest early.

134
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,978
Zhilou. There's something I want to tell you.

135
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,580
What more is there to say?

136
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,380
After I was wounded by the Demons,

137
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,139
I remembered the first time

138
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,780
I held the Icebound Sword

139
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,739
and accidentally cut myself.

140
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,979
Back then, my father did not comfort me.

141
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,899
He told me

142
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,419
that as his eldest son,

143
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,900
guarding the sanctuary

144
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,739
was a duty I was born with.

145
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,338
If the sanctuary ever falls

146
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:57,659
and the Demons invade,

147
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,700
I shouldn't hesitate

148
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,380
to give my life.

149
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:03,299
And if I want to become Dragon King,

150
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,099
I'll have to follow
the Dragon King's Decree.

151
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,220
Marry the Wujing Saintess.

152
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,059
Back then,
I treated it only as an order.

153
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,780
I doubted it

154
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,220
but didn't know how to resist.

155
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:20,780
You think of everyone else,

156
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,020
except yourself.

157
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,900
Heaven showed me mercy

158
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:28,419
by letting me meet you
when my life hung by a thread.

159
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,140
Zhilou,

160
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,340
I am fond of you.

161
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,660
You're the only one I wish

162
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,340
to spend my life with.

163
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,300
There's no affection
between me and Liluo.

164
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,420
If we marry blindly,

165
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,820
it wouldn't

166
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:43,979
be fair

167
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:45,458
to you, me,

168
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,578
or even her.

169
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:46,899
But...

170
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,139
I will complete the task
my father assigned.

171
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,779
I will attend the Wujing Saintess'
inspection ritual.

172
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,220
But after the ritual ends,

173
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,779
I will report to my father

174
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,940
to dissolve the betrothal with Liluo.

175
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,259
I know what you're worried about.

176
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:03,619
But don't you think...

177
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:06,658
entrusting the safety of the world

178
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,259
to a political marriage

179
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,259
is absurd?

180
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,899
Even without this marriage,

181
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:13,578
I am still a Dragon.

182
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,779
Ever since I took up the Icebound Sword,

183
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,259
guarding the sanctuary

184
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:19,300
has been my purpose in this life.

185
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:23,300
But if you do that,

186
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:26,220
your path will only become harder.

187
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,420
People only care about the outcome.

188
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,139
They never see the struggles

189
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,779
you faced along the way.

190
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:34,979
They will only scold you

191
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:37,580
for forsaking your duty

192
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,340
for a human girl.

193
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:41,940
You'll be insulted as well,

194
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,580
possibly even more than me.

195
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:50,259
I, Feng Zhilou,

196
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:53,139
grew up under people's contempt.

197
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,379
I'm not afraid.

198
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:56,859
Then if one day,

199
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,060
the Demons invade,

200
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:00,979
will you stand with me against them?

201
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,779
That was already my dream

202
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,460
before I met you.

203
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,460
If I cannot even protect the one I love,

204
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:14,540
how could I
protect all life in the world?

205
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:36,899
Li Yue

206
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,099
has a face far older than her years

207
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,578
and is riddled with sickness.

208
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:41,418
Her voice

209
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:43,300
sounds like that
of a 100-year-old woman.

210
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:44,818
Not only that,

211
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:46,660
her skin and body

212
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,058
are like withered wood,

213
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:49,340
far too aged.

214
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,458
I noticed this condition

215
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,259
in the Demons during my recent

216
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,899
demon hunt as well.

217
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,658
When demonic energy invades humans,

218
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,259
it causes rapid demonization.

219
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:58,899
If they don't drink human blood in time,

220
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,259
they wither like dead branches

221
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,619
and suffer excruciating pain.

222
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,739
This is why the Demons

223
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,499
could wipe out human villages.

224
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:08,700
So you're saying

225
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,139
she was never taking

226
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,940
any life-prolonging tonic,

227
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:14,859
but human blood?

228
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,178
The blood she drank

229
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,259
couldn't fuse with her own,

230
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,779
so it poisoned her from within.

231
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:24,339
Did Li Yue

232
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,619
keep a human blood vessel

233
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,060
just to feed her blood needs

234
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:28,259
and keep herself young?

235
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:30,739
That is horrifying.

236
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,660
(I remember something. Come with me.)

237
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,479
(Li Yue isn't
of the Saintess bloodline.)

238
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
(She must drink
the Saintess' blood to stay young.)

239
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,499
Those who drink blood
inherit its powers,

240
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,938
but long-term use

241
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:15,538
causes backlash,

242
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,899
leading to blood poisoning.

243
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,099
In the end,

244
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,460
they die violently.

245
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:22,538
That old fiend is close by.

246
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:23,739
Search every corner!

247
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:25,379
Xiaoyu,

248
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,899
I can't escape this time.

249
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,298
No.

250
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:29,019
- Stay hidden here.
- No, Grandpa.

251
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,099
Come out when it's quiet outside.

252
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,219
Remember the medical texts

253
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,099
and prescriptions I left you.

254
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,859
Remember every single word.

255
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:39,180
This is the final hope

256
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,818
I passed down to you.

257
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:41,499
Grandpa!

258
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,259
Don't go.

259
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,538
Let's go together.

260
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:44,540
Xiaoyu,

261
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,339
life will be very hard

262
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,619
in the days to come.

263
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,460
But

264
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:49,698
you must also remember.

265
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:50,739
You are a physician.

266
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,660
You can cure others,

267
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,259
and you can cure yourself too.

268
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,178
Keep searching!

269
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:55,778
Yes.

270
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:56,219
No.

271
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,818
Hurry!

272
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:57,859
Grandpa!

273
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,739
Go in.

274
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,820
Grandpa.

275
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,499
Can a green hand

276
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,540
really treat my headache?

277
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,019
Mother,

278
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,938
she's the apprentice

279
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:30,379
that old quack left behind.

280
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,298
We were going to kill her with him.

281
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:34,578
But she turned out to be an orphan,

282
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:36,180
and she knows medicine well.

283
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:37,859
I figured

284
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,220
she might be more useful
than that old man.

285
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:45,379
Can you read and write?

286
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,739
I can only read

287
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:48,739
the labels in the apothecary,

288
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,099
but I can't write.

289
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,379
Because...

290
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:54,580
they won't let me write prescriptions.

291
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,259
Without a voice,

292
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,300
she can't speak out.

293
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:17,499
Xiaoyu,

294
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:19,859
don't be afraid.

295
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,899
With me here,

296
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,259
no one will ever bully you again.

297
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,460
Good thing you secretly learned to write

298
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,979
and recorded everything.

299
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,340
Otherwise,

300
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,220
what they did to you

301
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,220
would never be known.

302
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,178
The Wujing City Lord

303
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:38,578
and that Dark Dhuta beside her

304
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,019
are truly vicious.

305
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:42,658
I must report this to my father.

306
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:44,220
Don't act rashly yet.

307
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:45,739
Find evidence first.

308
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:48,859
No.

309
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,339
I'm not worried about the ritual

310
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,619
or the engagement.

311
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,619
I just don't want to spook them.

312
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:55,979
I don't want to endanger

313
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,820
the poor soul giving Li Yue her blood.

314
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:02,739
Zhilou,

315
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,139
welcome back.

316
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:05,779
Hunbao?

317
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,899
Zhilou,

318
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,298
why didn't you have Young Master

319
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:09,899
wipe out those villains
in Longevity Hall

320
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,180
all in one go?

321
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,379
Are you still mad at him?

322
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,779
Of course not.

323
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,339
The inspection ritual

324
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,259
for the Wujing Saintess
is about to begin.

325
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,418
No matter how many

326
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,139
cruel things Li Yue has done,

327
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,219
the Saintess exists

328
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,458
to protect the sanctuary

329
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,340
and the mortal realm.

330
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,139
I don't want to trouble Chu Moshang.

331
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,499
In the end,

332
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,300
you're still thinking for Young Master.

333
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,499
Those villains

334
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,340
should just be
bitten to death by vipers.

335
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,859
No, wait.

336
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,460
We snakes wouldn't want to bite her.

337
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,658
One day, I'll reveal the truth

338
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:44,779
about the blood poisoning

339
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,340
and give justice

340
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:47,660
to the victims.

341
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:48,979
Zhilou,

342
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,778
to support you,

343
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:50,859
I'll give you a treasure.

344
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,820
What treasure?

345
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,058
This was formed from the century-old

346
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:59,619
snake skin I shed.

347
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:01,899
Why are you disgusted?

348
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,660
It'll help you big time.

349
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,580
Zhilou, my cloak is magical, right?

350
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:10,379
With this on,

351
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,979
we can slip right in.

352
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,859
Hunbao,

353
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,818
you're unbelievable.

354
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:16,339
Zhilou,

355
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,458
how do we find the person

356
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,220
who provides blood for Wujing City Lord?

357
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,940
The inspection ritual is about to begin.

358
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,219
Li Yue may feel better after taking

359
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,658
the new tonic I made.

360
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:31,420
But if she wants her youth back,
she'll have to drink blood again.

361
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,139
She'll definitely

362
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,938
entrust such secret matters

363
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:36,619
to her most trusted daughter, Liluo.

364
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,460
We'll just

365
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,099
wait for them to act.

366
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:02,300
Wait here.

367
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:08,819
Liluo.

368
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:10,498
Is that you?

369
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:11,379
Mother, it's me.

370
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,379
Zhilou,

371
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,579
it's your mother.

372
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,259
It's been days.

373
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,660
Did they do anything to you?

374
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,100
No.

375
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:22,100
It's almost the Wujing Saintess'
inspection ritual.

376
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:24,299
Her Lordship wouldn't dare harm me.

377
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:25,938
Once my identity is confirmed,

378
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,498
I can get you out of here.

379
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:29,019
That's wonderful.

380
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,259
Liluo,

381
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,259
it's all my fault.

382
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:36,018
I made you

383
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,900
suffer with me
in Wujing all these years.

384
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,660
Soon it will all be over.

385
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,979
Mother,

386
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:48,940
you've suffered worse.

387
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,979
Liluo.

388
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,380
Mother,

389
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:25,180
I'll take my leave now.
