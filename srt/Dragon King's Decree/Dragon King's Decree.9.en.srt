(Amity Hall)

00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:14,995
(Plaque of Feng Qingfeng, head

00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:28,619
Miss Zhilou,

28
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,460
Mr. Feng and Miss Yunqiao have passed.

29
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,219
You are the Mr. Feng's last bloodline.

30
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,379
(Plaque of Qingfeng and Yunqiao)
We hope you'll become the head

31
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,860
and continue to protect Feng Manor.

32
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,099
I have never thought

33
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:45,819
this would happen.

34
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:49,260
Zhilou,

35
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,659
it's time

36
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,099
for you to learn about the family.

37
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:25,140
Is she...

38
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,779
my mother?

39
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,140
About your birth,

40
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:43,540
Mr. Feng's last wish,

41
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,980
and the future of Feng Manor.

42
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,059
You should decide

43
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,420
if you want to bear the responsibility

44
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,300
of these truths.

45
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,779
(Zhilou,)

46
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,561
(my dear daughter.)

47
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:00,738
(Yue, Feng Zhilou's Mother)

48
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,740
(I have no choice but to leave you)

49
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,219
(and head to Wujing.)

50
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:09,219
(I must seal the spiritual root
in your body.)

51
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,619
(This is the only way)

52
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,980
(to hide your true bloodline.)

53
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,700
(Only by becoming an ordinary person)

54
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,259
(can you)

55
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,059
(avoid the biggest disaster
in your life.)

56
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,420
(Zhilou,)

57
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,699
(don't blame me.)

58
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:31,180
(Please stay safe.)

59
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,180
Where's Yue?

60
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,419
She knows your feelings for her,

61
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,900
and that you would stop her.

62
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,420
This is her portrait.

63
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,569
(Dark Dhuta, Wujing City's Guardian )
The Wujing City Lord

64
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:44,019
has ordered to bring back the baby

65
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,100
who was born here not too long ago.

66
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,740
Please hand the baby over now.

67
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,540
Please forgive me.

68
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,139
A while ago,

69
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,938
we had an epidemic.

70
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:59,100
The baby

71
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:02,100
has died.

72
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,059
Died?

73
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,540
The baby had high fever for several days

74
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,900
and skin sores oozing pus.

75
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,819
Even their organs were rotting.

76
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:18,819
Their entire body was rotten.

77
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,459
Even their clothes...

78
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,100
We burned all their clothes too.

79
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,180
I was afraid the sickness would spread.

80
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,980
Men.

81
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,699
Sir,

82
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,300
this is all that's left.

83
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,100
My condolences.

84
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:02,139
Safe travels, sir.

85
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,259
Qingyun,

86
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,420
from this day on,

87
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:12,100
tell outsiders

88
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,340
that Yue was my mistress.

89
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,498
She ran away

90
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:19,220
with another man.

91
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,499
This child has no spiritual root,

92
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,939
but she will be my flesh and blood.

93
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,459
She will live a difficult life

94
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,699
and become your disgrace.

95
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,660
She will be scorned
by the entire Feng family,

96
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:39,259
and she will hate you.

97
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,779
As long as I can protect Yue's child,

98
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,259
this kind of sacrifice

99
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,499
is nothing.

100
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,499
Dear child,

101
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,819
you will face many hardships,

102
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,860
but I

103
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,900
and Qingyun

104
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,740
still hope you grow up healthy.

105
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,579
One day,

106
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:20,139
you will soar freely.

107
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:32,920
(Plaque of Feng Qingfeng,
head of Feng Manor)

108
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:43,579
I've hated him for so many years

109
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,819
yet didn't know anything.

110
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,739
The family doesn't have a lot of power.

111
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,059
We were afraid the person
trying to harm your mother

112
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,819
would find out about you.

113
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:00,219
So your father had
to hide your identity.

114
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,339
Uncle Qingyun,

115
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,579
I understand

116
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,739
your selfless efforts.

117
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,979
It's been so many years.

118
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,260
Thank you, Uncle Qingyun.

119
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,059
If you hadn't taught me medicine,

120
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:21,859
I wouldn't be able to grow up safely
in Feng Manor.

121
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,780
Before Lenghou Ye died,

122
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,380
he sent a letter to Wujing City

123
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:29,778
claiming

124
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,778
that we called off the engagement

125
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,180
to ally with the Dragons.

126
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,219
But now

127
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,500
you've killed Lengou Ye.

128
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,859
I'm afraid

129
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,500
we can't avoid this trouble.

130
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,020
I will explain

131
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,739
what happened to Wujing City.

132
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,699
If there is punishment,

133
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,658
it is what I should bear too.

134
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:52,140
The crux of the matter
isn't self-justification,

135
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,699
but whether the Wujing City Lord
is willing to let you off.

136
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,179
She must know

137
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,258
that you didn't disrupt the alliance
between the Saintess and the Dragons

138
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,900
for this matter to be resolved.

139
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,540
The arrangement between me

140
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:07,140
and Chu Moshang was just a deal.

141
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:08,979
Besides,

142
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:11,018
our fake wedding

143
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:12,459
was never completed.

144
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,380
What do you plan on doing now?

145
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,180
Mother said

146
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,339
she'll return

147
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:22,739
after her business in Wujing,

148
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,579
but she's lost contact

149
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,500
for so many years.

150
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,420
Tell me.

151
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:31,859
Did something happen to her,

152
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,979
or is she...?

153
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,778
Now that I know the truth,

154
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,300
I cannot just sit by and do nothing.

155
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,540
I must go to Wujing City

156
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,939
and find my mother.

157
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,219
Have you thought this through?

158
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,219
Wujing

159
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:48,140
holds grave danger.

160
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,459
Compared to dying in a cage,

161
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,780
I rather fall when flying.

162
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:58,500
At least I got to see the sky.

163
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,082
(Wujing City)

164
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:15,195
(Li Liluo, Wujing City's Princess)

165
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,380
Hello, Mother.

166
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:25,579
Very good.

167
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,620
However, you are still missing an outfit

168
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:29,339
that is fitting for the status

169
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,260
of the Wujing Saintess.

170
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,498
You love me the most, Mother.

171
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:39,339
Those are merely superficial gestures
for the sanctuary.

172
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,180
What's important is
the inspection ritual in a few days.

173
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,900
I am the Wujing City Lord.

174
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:48,660
I cannot show any undue favor
toward you.

175
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:50,500
But...

176
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:55,260
I will give you the best things
in this world.

177
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,099
I know you want the best for me,

178
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,380
but I heard

179
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:02,859
a woman

180
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,299
from the Feng family

181
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,819
married a person impersonating
the Dragon Prince.

182
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,819
They want to ruin my plan.

183
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,939
This is the exact expression.

184
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,459
You must make
the world's most noble man,

185
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,180
the future Dragon King,

186
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,579
to pity you.

187
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,300
Remember.

188
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,658
Your target is to become
the most supreme woman

189
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:30,819
in this world,

190
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,620
the Dragon Queen.

191
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:36,219
Only in this way

192
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,300
can we both

193
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,859
truly achieve eternal life.

194
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,819
Greetings, my lord.

195
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,939
Investigate the Feng Manor situation
as quickly as possible.

196
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,378
I will not let anyone

197
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,219
ruin my daughter's plans.

198
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,020
As you command.

199
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:03,699
Miss Zhilou,

200
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:05,739
I don't have much to give you.

201
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,620
You can drink this Huodiao wine

202
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,099
on the road.

203
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,339
Miss Zhilou,

204
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:12,380
thank you so much for your help.

205
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,498
I prepared some everyday clothing.

206
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:16,180
I hope you don't mind
the simple quality.

207
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,618
Miss Zhilou,

208
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:18,618
the road is long,

209
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:20,059
and dangers abound.

210
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,059
Although you possess great skills,

211
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,339
there is always someone greater

212
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,658
out there.

213
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:25,898
You must be careful.

214
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:27,540
Yes, be careful.

215
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:44,900
Thank you

216
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,420
for the kind words.

217
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,180
Everyone,

218
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,778
I will do my utmost

219
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,380
for the trip to Wujing.

220
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,660
I also hope that you all

221
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,018
will take good care of yourselves

222
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,739
and Feng Manor.

223
00:13:58,619 --> 00:13:59,538
Don't worry.

224
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,660
Zhilou!

225
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:02,658
Zhilou.

226
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:03,699
Uncle Qingyun.

227
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,939
What are you doing?

228
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,418
Your journey to Wujing City

229
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:10,299
will bring you
through the Serpent Forest.

230
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,900
That place is full of dangers.

231
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,300
Let me come with you.

232
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:16,459
I can't let you go alone.

233
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,179
Young Master,

234
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,579
only the surface injuries have healed

235
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,219
from the lighting wound you suffered.

236
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,339
The internal injury

237
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,660
requires you to use your dragon pearl
to nurture it.

238
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:18,538
You can't use large amounts of energy.

239
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:21,018
Young Master, the three-day deadline
given by His Majesty is up.

240
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,859
We should set off for Wujing.

241
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,699
We must take the sigil back.

242
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,900
We don't have much time left.

243
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,900
What do you mean, Young Master?

244
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,660
Has Feng Zhilou

245
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,258
left the Feng Manor?

246
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:36,099
Yes, she has.

247
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,260
She will pass by the Serpent Forest
on her way to Wujing City.

248
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,538
Wujing City received the news

249
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:45,780
you and Lenghou Ye sent.

250
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,378
I'm afraid you're too late.

251
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,819
Lenghou Ye was killed by Feng Zhilou.

252
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,498
He died

253
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:54,020
because of his incompetence.

254
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:57,140
I'm leaving the remaining matter

255
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,219
to you.

256
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,900
Remember.

257
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,620
You can only report to me alive.

258
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,140
If Feng Zhilou doesn't die,

259
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,898
then you...

260
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,819
must die.

261
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,080
This is the Serpents' territory.

262
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,880
Don't let this seemingly
normal forest fool you.

263
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,339
It's filled with poisonous plants.
You must be careful.

264
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:19,459
We can't see the sky here

265
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,979
and must rely on the leaves'
growth direction to get our bearings.

266
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,498
If we don't have a local guide,

267
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:26,140
we'll get lost easily.

268
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,140
I stumbled into this place
while gathering herbs years ago

269
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:31,739
and only got out with someone's help.

270
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:36,059
Careful, Uncle Qingyun.

271
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,779
Jia Yu?

272
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,660
Jia Yu,

273
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,180
you finally dropped the act.

274
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,100
All these years, it must've been exhausting
for you to put up an act in the Feng Manor.

275
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:41,340
Feng Zhilou,

276
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:43,459
when did you find me out?

277
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:45,660
When you tried to ruin my reputation.

278
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:47,380
Your pulse

279
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,420
wasn't one of a fool.

280
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:53,219
Let go.

281
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,140
You came

282
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,499
to stop us from going to Wujing City.

283
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:02,620
Why is that?

284
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:04,458
Who exactly are you?

285
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,938
That doesn't matter.

286
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:07,178
What matters is

287
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:10,019
Wujing City wants you dead!

288
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:12,459
Careful, Zhilou!

289
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:27,739
I have nine spiritual roots now.

290
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,900
Your meager skill

291
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:30,140
can't stop me.

292
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,459
Wujing has taken notice of you now.

293
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,779
Zhilou,

294
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,459
when you reach Wujing,

295
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,060
you must not

296
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,539
easily reveal anything
about your mother.

297
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:04,539
Uncle Qingyun.

298
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,499
Uncle Qingyun.

299
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:09,660
Uncle Qingyun, where did you go?

300
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:13,340
Uncle Qingyun.

301
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,620
Uncle Qingyun!
