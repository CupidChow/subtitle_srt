11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,660
Manager.

12
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,870
Please, you have to help me out this time.

13
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,040
I'm begging you, please?

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,740
My mom just had surgery.

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,009
If you can just adjust this one dispatch for me,

16
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,880
I'll work straight through without any days off.

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,149
I'll handle all the fare deposits, too.

18
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,379
You know I'm good with mental math...

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,180
Forget it!

20
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,180
I don't need you to handle the fare deposits.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,390
We already don't have enough conductors.

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,389
Manager, just this once...

23
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,529
Manager, my foot. I told you, the answer is no!

24
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,729
Think about it.

25
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,659
If I made an exception for every sob story,

26
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,960
how could I possibly run this company?

27
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,829
If you want to leave a hole so bad, why don't you just quit?

28
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,200
Just make a clean break of it.

29
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,710
The only hole I see is the one in your sock.

30
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,339
So who mends that holey sock of yours for you?

31
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,379
Your poor old mother has to, right?

32
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,249
Since you still haven't managed to get married.

33
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,119
If you're not going to mend it, then keep your mouth shut.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,519
And it's a mother just like her...

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,150
who had to be cut open and stitched back up.

36
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,289
And you're just brushing her daughter off like that?

37
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,990
That's just heartless!

38
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,959
We'll cover for Yeong Rye.

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
So that should work, right?

40
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,630
Guys...

41
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,170
Look at you all, putting on this little show?

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,740
What an impressive display of friendship!

43
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,910
But too bad.

44
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,410
You girls alone aren't enough to cover it.

45
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,150
So, am I going to approve this or am I not?

46
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,090
Ms. Koh! Do I approve it, or do I not?

47
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,060
Then I'll cover the shift, too.

48
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,060
With three of us covering, we should be able to manage.

49
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,370
Jong Hee.

50
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,440
Aren't you all pushing yourselves too hard for me?

51
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,410
It'll be exhausting working without any days off.

52
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,750
Hey, now.

53
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,250
What are friends for?

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,450
Now, you're starting to hurt my feelings.

55
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,650
That's right.

56
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,460
To be blunt,

57
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,090
if we were in your shoes,

58
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,990
you'd do the same for us, wouldn't you?

59
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,899
Exactly.

60
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,570
That's what friends are for. Right?

61
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,140
But how long are those two going to keep this up?

62
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,810
It's making us uncomfortable just watching.

63
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,520
All because of one stupid player.

64
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,020
A friendship flimsier than tissue is torn to shreds.

65
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,320
Tell me about it.

66
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,190
They used to be inseparable, for goodness' sake.

67
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,460
I don't get it either.

68
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,330
There are plenty of fish in the sea. Why act like this over a guy?

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,190
Here.

70
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,530
Could you give this to Seo Jong Hee for me?

Loser, moron, airhead, simpleton.

75
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,789
- Loser, moron, idiot. - Is that all you've got?

76
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,820
Hit it harder.

77
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,390
Idiot!

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Hey.

79
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,699
You know, if I had a time machine?

80
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,970
I'd go straight back to the exhibition match.

81
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,999
Then I'd cut Deok Gu off at the pass...

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,770
and knock him out with an uppercut.

83
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,670
Then Yeong Rye would be like,

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,539
"Oh, my. Sang Cheol."

85
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,410
"How can you be so manly and amazing?"

86
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,610
"I think I've fallen head over heels for you."

87
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,750
That's what she'd say, right?

88
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,980
You lunatic.

89
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,090
Right? I'm a lunatic, like you said.

90
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,890
What is wrong with me?

91
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,300
Now that I know it's too late,

92
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,500
I find myself missing her even more.

93
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,740
If it's that bad, why don't you visit her in the hospital?

94
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,100
Visit her at the hospital?

95
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,670
Who?

96
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,850
For goodness' sake, what's all the fuss?

97
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,620
I said, just go already.

98
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,390
Good grief. You're so stubborn.

99
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,390
You're as stubborn as a mule.

100
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,090
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

101
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,600
My coworkers said they'd cover my shifts, I told you.

102
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,460
In that case,

103
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,030
you should visit our home.

104
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,140
Check on the kids,

105
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,940
do the laundry, and make some side dishes, okay?

106
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,740
Yeong Sik can't handle all that by himself.

107
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,710
With all his studies and tutoring, he's already struggling as it is.

108
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,179
Goodness.

109
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,180
Mom.

110
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Even in a time like this, all you care about is Yeong Sik?

111
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Of course. He's the pillar of this family.

112
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,790
Then what does that make me?

113
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,120
You're...

114
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,730
You're my daughter. My eldest daughter.

115
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Right.

116
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,930
I'm the eldest daughter.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,800
The one who has to earn money and take care of her siblings.

118
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,639
When my own mother treats me so thoughtlessly,

119
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,009
who in the world would ever cherish me? Right?

120
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,580
Good grief, this girl.

121
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,350
Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed?

122
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,150
Why are you being so prickly?

123
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,250
I don't know.

124
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,920
That's just how the words are coming out today.

125
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,730
Look who's here, the pillar of the family.

126
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,030
I'm going to go look after the kids, do laundry, and make some food.

127
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,900
So you, Mr. Pillar, can take care of Mom.

128
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,700
And don't just wolf down the canned peaches by yourself.

129
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,040
Make sure Mom gets some, too.

130
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,510
- What's going on with her? - I don't know.

131
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,880
Maybe something happened at work?

132
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,779
Stomp.

133
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,320
- Get clean. - Get clean.

134
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,779
- Jong Hee. I'm good at this, right? - Yes? You're the best.

135
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,119
- Me too, right? - The best!

136
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,820
- Harder! Stomp. - Jong Hee.

137
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,119
- Yeong Rye! -Yeong Rye!

138
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
You're here?

139
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,260
What are you doing here without telling me?

140
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,600
When did you get here?

141
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,760
A little while ago.

142
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,530
Over there.

143
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,540
I know you couldn't make it to class yesterday.

144
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,210
You know I don't normally take notes, right?

145
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,240
But I took really detailed notes with the fountain pen you gave me.

146
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,810
And don't get on my case if it looks like a bunch of chicken scratch.

147
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,820
I really did my best.

148
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,190
Stomp!

149
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,789
What are you waiting for? We need to feed the kids, right?

150
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,499
They've been working really hard, so I bet they're starving.

151
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,359
- Yes. - Right? You're hungry, aren't you?

152
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,470
- Yes! - Yes!

153
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,200
All right.

154
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,940
I'll go make some food right away.

155
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,860
I love the flowerbed at your house.

156
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,760
The flowers are so pretty,

157
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,470
and your vegetable garden is great, too.

158
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,380
Your mother's doing okay now, right?

159
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,010
Yes.

160
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,650
But...

161
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,550
I won't let her leave the hospital until she's fully recovered.

162
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,749
I'm worried she'll try to go right back to work.

163
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,190
Yes, that sounds exactly like your mom.

164
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,390
I was so shocked when I heard she was going into surgery.

165
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,930
I nearly fainted.

166
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,199
That can't ever happen again.

167
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Yes.

168
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,870
Here.

169
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,179
Jong Hee.

170
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,250
Yes?

171
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,260
Here.

172
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,790
What is it?

173
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,100
On the day my mom collapsed,

174
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,540
I ran into Han Jae Pil on the street.

175
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,840
Han Jae Pil?

176
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,080
(Han Jae Pil)

177
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,950
I was desperately trying to catch a cab,

178
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,580
and he gave me a ride to the hospital...

179
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,419
in his family's car.

180
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,520
Really?

181
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,450
That was really nice of him.

182
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,930
He...

183
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,560
asked me to give this to you.

184
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,060
- Me? - Yes.

185
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,200
You know how he invited us to the boxing gym?

186
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,370
I guess he did that for you.

187
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,780
And I had no idea.

188
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,110
I totally jumped the gun and got my hopes up.

189
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,650
Really?

190
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,820
What a strange guy.

191
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,490
I don't know about that.

192
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,160
But anyway, I gave it to you.

193
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,290
Mission accomplished!

194
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,830
What about you?

195
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,630
I thought you were into him.

196
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,370
Me?

197
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,439
No, I thought he was the one who was into me.

198
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,279
So I decided to give him a chance.

199
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,309
You know, something like that.

200
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,980
No, I'm not.

201
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,250
He's not even my type.

202
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Really?

203
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,610
Why?

204
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,380
You don't like him?

205
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,510
It's not about liking him or not.

206
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm not interested in dating.

207
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,650
I don't have the energy for it either.

208
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,490
Besides,

209
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,230
he knows nothing about me.

210
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,570
I'm going to get more snacks.

211
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,830
You want some too, right?

212
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,019
Wait. Really?

213
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,850
You just ran into her on the street by chance?

214
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,790
Yes.

215
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,920
That should've been me!

216
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,830
I should've given you a ride, even if I had to borrow a truck.

217
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,160
Maybe I should visit her in the hospital.

218
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,760
Go ahead.

219
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,929
I don't know if she'll be happy to see you, though.

220
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,500
Hey, come with me!

221
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,170
You're the one with an excuse to go, since you gave her a ride.

222
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,570
I may have an excuse...

223
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,840
but no desire to go. Why should...

224
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,739
"Why should..."

225
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,810
What?

226
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,780
Let's go.

227
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,250
Let's go. I'll come with you.

228
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,060
Really?

229
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,860
Gosh. I'm so excited.

230
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,730
Should I get something like flowers or fruit?

231
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,230
I'm getting the hiccups. Look.

232
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,370
Hi.

233
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,040
Hey.

234
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,010
Hi.

235
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,180
Well, I heard from Jae Pil and...

236
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,019
If I hadn't heard, that's one thing, but I can't pretend I don't know.

237
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,990
It just didn't feel right, as a friend.

238
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,459
I mean, we're not exactly friends, but we're not exactly strangers.

239
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,820
It's a really hard relationship to define.

240
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,459
What? Did you say something, Jae Pil?

241
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,199
He said you must be sick of the hospital food.

242
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,269
- Right. - Yes.

243
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,200
You see, Sang Cheol's parents run a stall at the market.

244
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,799
Right.

245
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,599
A little something in the food business.

246
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,570
It's a pretty big operation for a market stall.

247
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,910
They sell pickled vegetables and fermented seafood.

248
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,440
And business is surprisingly good.

249
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,149
Not to brag,

250
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,610
but everyone around here says it's the real deal.

251
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,780
Everyone loves their food, right?

252
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,860
Right. This is for you.

253
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,629
Thank you.

254
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,790
- Yes. - I'll enjoy it.

255
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,899
How's your mom doing? Is she feeling a lot better?

256
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,600
She is, thanks to you.

257
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,270
Actually, she was just asking who the friend was that drove her.

258
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,639
She said to tell you thank you.

259
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,080
It was nothing.

260
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,650
Of course. I was happy to do it.

261
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Hey.

262
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,790
Can we have a moment?

263
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,030
What?

264
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,640
Well...

265
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,780
Yes?

266
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,450
About that note from the other day...

267
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,050
Oh, right.

268
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,390
It got to her, right?

269
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,930
What'd she say?

270
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,530
Well...

271
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,100
Jong Hee's not really...

272
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,030
in a place to be seeing anyone right now.

273
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,940
Oh, is that right?

274
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,910
Then why did she even come on the group date?

275
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,710
Was she just there for fun?

276
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,480
I mean, that can happen.

277
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,180
That can happen, sure.

278
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,879
Sorry for making things awkward for you.

279
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,590
I feel bad bothering her now, with her sick mom.

280
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,560
No, don't worry. It's fine, really.

281
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,829
(Wonhwa Jaeil Hospital)

282
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,099
Gosh. So much for acting uninterested in the group date.

283
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,499
You were so stoic, playing hard to get.

284
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,530
Knock it off.

285
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,540
When did that all happen, you sly cat.

286
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,240
I said knock it off. Say one more word.

287
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,480
Come on. When did you fall for her?

288
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,210
Was it at the roller rink? When Jong Hee took her jacket off?

289
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,380
Or was it when she was trying to hold you back?

290
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Don't tell me it was love at first sight.

291
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,889
You wouldn't let it go when I was crushing on Yeong Rye.

292
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,019
And here you are, up all night thinking about Jong Hee.

293
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,489
So that's what's been going on!

294
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,959
All right! I'll stop!

295
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,259
- Didn't I say knock it off? - I said I'll stop!

296
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,299
Jae Pil! I'll stop!

297
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,999
I'll stop, all right?

298
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,269
What's gotten into you?

299
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,470
Jae Pil.

300
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,139
Tell me whatever you want to eat.

301
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,670
To celebrate you getting shot down, I'll pay for everything.

302
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,809
I'm paying, I said. What's wrong?

303
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,140
I said I'm treating!

304
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,400
When did you get here?

305
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,769
You must not be a light sleeper. You can just fall asleep anywhere.

306
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,970
I am a light sleeper.

307
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,240
I often sleep in places like this. I've gotten used to it.

308
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,070
Kids, your brother is here.

309
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,810
What? Yeong Sik.

310
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,680
Yeong Sik.

311
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,179
Did you two have fun and play nicely?

312
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,180
- Yes. - Yes.

313
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,380
Yeong Sik. Look at this.

314
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,320
Jong Hee drew this for me. She did a great job, right?

315
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,359
Gosh. She's not much of an artist, is she?

316
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,520
Agreed.

317
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,460
You don't have to be good at everything.

318
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,060
Let's go play inside.

319
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,100
You haven't eaten yet, right?

320
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,799
Yeong Rye made kimchi stew and side dishes.

321
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,539
- Do you want me to serve you some? - No, it's all right. You should go.

322
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,569
You need to get some rest, too.

323
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,970
It's tough when you don't rest on your day off.

324
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,380
I thought you had tutoring later. Are you leaving the kids all alone?

325
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,680
Yeong Mi said it gets even scarier at night.

326
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
I'll figure it out.

327
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,180
- Thanks for everything. - Gosh.

328
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,220
I'm just trying to do a good deed, so why do I feel kicked out?

329
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,320
You just smiled.

330
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,230
So you do know how to smile.

331
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,500
I was starting to think you were allergic to smiling.

332
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,300
Aren't you leaving?

333
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,800
- I'm going. - Okay.

334
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,839
- This is totally my style. - Oh, that's pretty.

335
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,909
Hey, look at this.

336
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,109
- This is prettier. - I know, right?

337
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,450
- But I think this suits you better. - Really?

338
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,180
This one.

339
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,870
This is no fun by myself.

340
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,770
I miss Koh Yeong Rye.

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
Hey.

343
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,990
Isn't that her?

344
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
Seo Jong Hee?

347
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,730
When did he get here?

348
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,710
- Yeong Sik! - Is it good?

349
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,010
All right, let's go over this again.

350
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,150
Until I'm back from my tutoring, what are you supposed to do?

351
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,980
We wait here quietly.

352
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,050
And we don't move a single step.

353
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,350
That's right.

354
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
- Yeong Bae, take good care of her. - Okay.

355
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,660
And if you need the bathroom, tell the lady at the market.

356
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,560
- I've already spoken to her. - Okay.

357
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,559
When I'm done later, I'll come back and buy you an even better treat.

358
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,830
An even better treat? Like jjajangmyeon?

359
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,330
That sounds delicious.

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,070
- Oh, Mr. Koh. - Hello.

361
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,710
And who are these two?

362
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,880
Your siblings?

363
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,250
- Hello. - Oh, hello.

364
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,050
But why are your siblings here?

365
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,049
Oh, my. Don't tell me you're making them wait out here?

366
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,389
Yes, my mother's in the hospital, so I didn't really have a choice.

367
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,390
I see.

368
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,529
Oh, dear. You really shouldn't. In this day and age,

369
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,459
leaving the kids out here all by themselves...

370
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,729
They look like they're my Sae Ri's age.

371
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,100
And she looks even younger than her.

372
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,690
Stop it.

373
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,130
What's wrong?

374
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,030
Goodness.

375
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,670
You two haven't eaten dinner, right?

376
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Here you go.

377
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,980
I hope you like omelette rice.

378
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,079
It's one of my Sae Ri's favourites to eat.

379
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,309
Do you like it?

380
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,949
- I do. - Good. I'm glad.

381
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,650
Go on, eat up.

382
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,850
Dig in.

383
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,030
Her name is Ju Ju.

384
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,870
My dad brought her back for me from a business trip to Paris.

385
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,710
I'm the one who named her Ju Ju.

386
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,810
She's five years old.

387
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,390
This is from my dad's business trip to Finland.

388
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,559
That's where Santa Claus and Rudolph live, you know?

389
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,290
Oh, yes.

390
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,770
Here.

391
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,110
Gosh.

392
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,380
It's called a music box.

393
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,950
- Do you like it? - Yes.

394
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,550
Then it's yours.

395
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,920
It's my gift to you.

396
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,580
- Really? - Yes!

397
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,590
She told her she could have it.

398
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,560
I would hide a single rainbow candy so Yeong Mi wouldn't ask for it.

399
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,830
With a beautiful smile, just like a princess,

400
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,640
she told her she could have this expensive gift.

401
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,850
Finish these by our next session.

402
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,150
And mark the ones you get stuck on.

403
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,620
Okay.

404
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,289
Don't just mark them without trying first.

405
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,530
I can always tell.

406
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,630
Sure.

407
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,130
Yes, sir.

408
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,200
Is something wrong? You seem so out of it.

409
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,370
You couldn't focus the whole time, too.

410
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,940
When have I ever been motivated...

411
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,270
to study?

412
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,350
Mr. Koh.

413
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,610
Have you ever been shot down before?

414
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,520
If shot down means confessing and getting rejected,

415
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,520
then no, not even once.

416
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,360
You know you sound very obnoxious, right?

417
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,530
I know.

418
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,970
I mean, what is it that women...

419
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,969
find attractive in a guy?

420
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,939
Do you have to be smart like you, for starters?

421
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,009
Like all intellectual? And wear shirts like this?

422
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,140
Who is she?

423
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,380
I'm not talking about me.

424
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,019
I was just curious, that's all.

425
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,319
Class is over, so you should go. Your siblings are waiting.

426
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,890
And I have to get to the gym.

427
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,270
(Giant Boxing Gym)

428
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,540
Hey, Han Jae Pil!

429
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,010
You made it.

430
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,149
Greetings, my senior.

431
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,480
- You made it. - Yes.

432
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,650
I've got some juicy information you're going to love.

433
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,490
Guess who I saw earlier when I was on my way to my mom's store?

434
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,120
Who'd you see?

435
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,489
I don't know.

436
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,089
Should I tell you or not?

437
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,559
Should I tell you or not?

438
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,429
Don't. I don't care. Stop.

439
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,030
You're going to regret this. Seriously.

440
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,570
I saw Seo Jong Hee earlier!

441
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,350
Who's that?

442
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,279
Am I supposed to know her? I've never heard that name before.

443
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,750
Is this a pride of a man or something?

444
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,219
Well...

445
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,730
She went to Vivaldi Music Cafe, where we had that group date.

446
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,890
Seeing as she was going in alone, she must be a regular.

447
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,330
You don't need to try ten times, but you can at least try once.

448
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,570
No? Are you giving up? Just like that?

449
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,640
You're giving up?

450
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,409
Why is there so much dust on this? Hold that.

451
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,440
What?

452
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,810
I'm going to go change.

453
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,810
Are you giving up?

454
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,250
Fine.

455
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,290
(Vivaldi Music Cafe, 2nd Floor)

456
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:30,080
(Vivaldi Music Cafe, 2nd Floor)

457
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,440
Darn it.

458
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,280
It held up for so long, but it finally gave out.

459
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,520
What am I going to do?

460
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,000
Come on.

461
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,030
What are you going to do about yours, then?

462
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,100
Me?

463
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,040
I can stay like this.

464
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,380
Then give that to me.

465
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,749
No, I'm the one with the broken slippers.

466
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,220
Just wear it.

467
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,690
You came out to go to the supermarket, right?

468
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,750
I can just go back inside like this.

469
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,360
No, it's fine. That would look ridiculous.

470
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,560
You've got an image to maintain.

471
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,470
You wench.

472
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,740
I'm sorry, Hae Ja.

473
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,550
I don't know what came over me.

474
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,920
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

475
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,420
Your hair is already so thin, and I went and pulled it.

476
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,959
Without you, I have no one to hang out with...

477
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,860
and no one to talk to.

478
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,999
You can have Driver Kim.

479
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,799
No, you have him. He's a much better match for you.

480
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,099
No, I insist. You take him.

481
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,809
No, you have him.

482
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:43,079
No, I'm letting you have him. Driver Kim is all yours.

483
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,449
Hae Ja.

484
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,579
- You take him. - No, you take Driver Kim.

485
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,780
It's you! You're a much better match for him.

486
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,360
This substitute gig is no joke.

487
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,030
Oh, my. This is tough.

488
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,400
I couldn't do all this even if there were two of me.

489
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,600
Oh, my gosh.

490
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,270
Are you filling in for Ms. Koh today, Ms. Choi?

491
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,940
- Yes. - That explains it.

492
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,170
I had a dream last night.

493
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,210
You know, Ms. Choi.

494
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,550
Looking at you up close,

495
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,520
your eyes are so clear.

496
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,750
Like the ocean shimmering in the moonlight,

497
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,360
they just sparkle.

498
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,029
Hae Ja, by any chance,

499
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,200
have you ever heard of the word "yoonseul?"

500
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,170
Spare me the poetry.

501
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,839
What's with the buttery voice?

502
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,910
Let's get going. I'm crazy busy today.

503
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
All clear.

504
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,950
Right, we should go.

505
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,150
Let's go.

506
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,900
Get in.

507
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,440
What's with the car? I thought you only cycled.

508
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,880
It's my mom's. She was junking it, so I took it.

509
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,050
By the way, how's your mom doing?

510
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,620
I've been meaning to go see her.

511
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,320
It's fine. It's a six-bed ward, so there's no room anyway.

512
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,460
Are the hospital bills sorted out?

513
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,819
Yes, I explained my situation to the family I tutor for...

514
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,560
and they gave me a three-month advance on my pay.

515
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,860
That's a relief.

516
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,559
So, are you heading to the hospital now?

517
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,000
No, I was at the hospital overnight, so Yeong Rye is there today.

518
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,570
I need to go home and see the kids.

519
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,170
Really?

520
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,579
- Get out. - What?

521
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,579
Take the bus. Something just came up.

522
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,690
Hurry up and get out.

523
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,790
There you go.

524
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,230
Okay.

525
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,100
What's with this guy? First he says get in, then get out.

526
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,040
Seriously, what an odd guy.

527
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,580
Catch me!

528
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,309
Don't let it get away.

529
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,580
Out of the way!

530
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,390
- Grab him! - Let go of me!

531
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,859
Oh, my.

532
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,530
Seeing those boys reminds me of my little brothers back home.

533
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,559
I miss my siblings.

534
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,499
Alright. Who's the best kicker here?

535
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,400
- He is! - Okay. Show me what you've got.

536
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,840
Not bad. Now watch this.

537
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,670
I'll kick it so high, it won't come down.

538
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,410
Now that's how you kick.

539
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,750
- One more time! - One more time?

540
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,079
- Just once more. - Please.

541
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,350
No, you guys go on and play. Okay?

542
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,590
He's good. Jun Ho was good, too.

543
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,630
They just reminded me of my siblings back home.

544
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,130
They're right around that age.

545
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,340
Driver Kim, are you the eldest son?

546
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,670
The firstborn?

547
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,070
- Yes. - Let go.

548
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,180
I'm the oldest daughter, too.

549
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,140
You, too, Ms. Choi?

550
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,550
- The fumigation truck! - The fumigation truck!

551
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,050
- Let's follow it! - Let's follow it!

552
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,310
Well...

553
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,010
Thank you.

554
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,999
What's this? Did you get hurt at work?

555
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,099
No, it's nothing like that.

556
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,500
Just hold still.

557
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,699
Are you going to use that medicine or just look at it?

558
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,700
Are you going to build...

559
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
Hey.

560
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,670
My goodness. You're only so young!

561
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,580
You have the hands of a woman who's done chores for years.

562
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,080
Give me your hand. Come on.

563
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,120
- You don't have to do that. - Goodness.

564
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,590
Since when have you ever cared about my hands?

565
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,560
No. Well...

566
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,759
Hey, Ugly.

567
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,130
Oh, you're here?

568
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,230
Yes.

569
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,030
Mom's over there.

570
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,939
- I'm here, Ms. Park. - Okay.

571
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,180
Hello.

572
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,780
Here you go.

573
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,680
How are you feeling?

574
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,880
- I'm doing okay, but... - Yes?

575
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,490
But I don't know what's gotten into her lately.

576
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,060
Maybe she's going through a late puberty or something.

577
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,370
Hey, Ugly!

578
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,770
Aren't you cold?

579
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,240
What are you doing out here?

580
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,780
- Is something wrong? - No.

581
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,480
Just because.

582
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,390
Because...

583
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,500
I hate myself.

584
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,170
Come on.

585
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,800
What's there to hate about you?

586
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,710
You're a good person and a diligent worker.

587
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,079
You take good care of your siblings, and you're devoted to your mother.

588
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,680
See? No matter how I look at it, I see nothing to dislike about you.

589
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,080
Except for your face.

590
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,620
Hey, Ugly.

591
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,360
You know, in our constitution,

592
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,600
there's a clause on the very first page.

593
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,730
"All citizens have the right to pursue happiness."

594
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:24,269
But that clause doesn't mean the state...

595
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,740
is promising to make everyone happy.

596
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,380
Then what?

597
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,880
Happiness is subjective, you know.

598
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,010
So however we define happiness,

599
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,280
it means the state will support our efforts to achieve it.

600
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,460
That's why it's the right to pursue happiness, not be happy.

601
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,990
So what I'm saying is,

602
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,900
Happiness is ultimately...

603
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,830
something you have to pursue for yourself.

604
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,200
If you want to do something, do it.

605
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,270
If there's something you want,

606
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,410
you have to go after it.

607
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,980
Work up the courage.

608
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,190
And I don't know what's making you hate yourself,

609
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,160
but you need to pursue what...

610
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,330
- Hyeon. - Yes?

611
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,370
I...

612
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,240
I have to be somewhere.

613
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,009
Thanks for the advice.

614
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,910
Hey, Ugly.

615
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,210
Koh Yeong Rye?

616
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,150
Something tells me it's related to romance.

617
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,420
Maybe I shouldn't have given that lecture.

618
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,330
(Mini Supermarket)

619
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,840
Hello?

620
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,050
Hello?

621
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,820
Excuse...

622
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,549
Excuse me, I was wondering...

623
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,189
is Han Jae Pil there?

624
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,459
Jae Pil?

625
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,690
He's not home from school yet. He has a seventh period class today.

626
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,360
May I ask who's calling?

627
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,640
All right.

628
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,940
What was the Jeongrang of the Ministry of Personnel?

629
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,950
In the Ministry of Personnel, the Jeongrang and...

630
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,620
The western faction...

631
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,960
came to be known as the Westerners.

632
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:09,360
Okay, we'll continue with Joseon's factional politics next class.

633
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,760
Class dismissed.

634
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,830
Thank you.

635
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,969
Hey, don't you find Korean History a drag?

636
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,639
It puts me right to sleep.

637
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,280
Hey, wait a minute. Jae Pil, where are you going?

638
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,250
We haven't had homeroom yet.

639
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,310
(Vivaldi Music Cafe, 2nd Floor)

640
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,500
Sir.

641
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,340
Here's the Vienna coffee you ordered.

642
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,940
- Enjoy. - Thanks.

643
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,580
Koh Yeong Rye?

644
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,380
Hey.

645
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,080
Hey, what brings you here?

646
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
Well...

647
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,520
Are you alone?

648
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:14,889
Where's Han Jae Pil?

649
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,160
Jae Pil?

650
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,789
As soon as the bell rang, he took off like a shot.

651
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,290
He must have had somewhere urgent to be.

652
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,400
I see.

653
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,260
Anyway, what brings you here?

654
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,530
Don't tell me you came here to see me.

655
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,040
Well...

656
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,380
- Watch out. - Right.

657
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,210
Thanks.

658
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,280
You're a lifesaver.

659
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,690
- Enjoy. - Thanks.

660
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,260
Hi.

661
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,500
What are you doing here?

662
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,230
Well...

663
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,629
I'm actually a regular here.

664
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,729
I see.

665
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,170
Since our group date,

666
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,400
I come here sometimes to clear my head.

667
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,440
Really? That's surprising.

668
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,440
Here. This is on the house.

669
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,610
I hope to see you here often.

670
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,430
It's not like we're strangers. Mind if I join you?

671
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,860
Sure.

672
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,100
Be my guest.

673
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,280
(Vivaldi Music Cafe, 2nd Floor)

674
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,000
So I see you like this song?

675
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,970
I like it, too.

676
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,170
Yes.

677
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,270
Yeong Rye loves it, so it kind of grew on me.

678
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,110
This song is really popular right now, isn't it?

679
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,640
It sure is.

680
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,249
Those brothers are amazing.

681
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,179
They passed the preliminary round for the College Music Festival,

682
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,519
but they were disqualified because they were graduates,

683
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,550
not students.

684
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,889
And look how famous they ended up becoming.

685
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,320
That was Sanulrim.

686
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,920
Plus, this is Songolmae.

687
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:06,360
- Oh, really? - Yes.

688
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,790
I got them mixed up.

689
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,299
But the vocalist is great. That's Bae Chul Soo, right?

690
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,740
The vocalist is Koo Chang Mo.

691
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,340
Bae Chul Soo's on guitar.

692
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,270
You don't listen to much pop music, do you?

693
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,109
This isn't really your thing, is it?

694
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,540
What? No, it is.

695
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,410
I do like it.

696
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,380
I'm just all mixed up today.

697
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,480
You are?

698
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,690
Then stay and listen a bit longer.

699
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:33,920
I've got something to do.

700
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:38,620
- Leaving already? - Yes.

701
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,660
Here's mine. Just pay it all at once.

702
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,480
I'll pay now.

703
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,120
Wait, hold on.

704
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,030
Have a meal with me.

705
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
"A meal?"

706
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,870
Well...

707
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,340
Today's my birthday.

708
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,640
I just don't want to eat alone.

709
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,810
Please, just have a meal with me.

710
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,849
Oh, eat up.

711
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,020
My lifesaver.

712
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,030
But since you saved my life, you're responsible for me forever.

713
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,659
Hey.

714
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,030
I'm just kidding. Why are you so shocked?

715
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:54,330
Thanks.

716
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,010
So I guess you and Jae Pil come here a lot.

717
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,710
Oh, this place?

718
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:05,910
Of course.

719
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:09,850
You could say this is where Jae Pil and I get all our meals.

720
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,389
Does Jae Pil like this kind of food?

721
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,990
Yes, of course. He loves it.

722
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:17,320
But he can't really handle spicy food.

723
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,430
One bite of this and he'd chug a lot of water.

724
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,160
- Pretty surprising, right? - Yes.

725
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,900
What else?

726
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,399
What else does he like?

727
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,500
Who? Me?

728
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,839
No, Jae Pil.

729
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,370
- Jae Pil? - Yes.

730
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,939
Jae Pil? Well...

731
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,439
Jae Pil.

732
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,840
Well, for music, he mostly listens to rock.

733
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,880
And he's good at basketball.

734
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,120
He's what you would call a natural athlete.

735
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,920
And I hear his IQ is pretty high, too.

736
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,020
Not that I've seen proof of it or anything.

737
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:51,690
But...

738
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,230
Aren't you curious about me at all?

739
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,000
You?

740
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,600
Well...

741
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,440
Do you have any siblings?

742
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,339
That's what you were curious about?

743
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,339
- Right. - I'm an only son,

744
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,249
and my father's the youngest of four brothers.

745
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,479
So you'll never have to worry about those big family obligations.

746
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,950
And on top of that, in my family, the women don't have to do a thing.

747
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,790
The men do everything.

748
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,820
Gosh. This looks delicious.

749
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,930
I should come back with Yeong Rye.

750
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,600
You two must be really close. All you talk about is Yeong Rye.

751
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,940
What about me? I mean...

752
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:39,770
So, no questions for me?

753
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,070
You?

754
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:43,980
Let's see.

755
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,280
Are you a regular here?

756
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,150
- Well... - Mom.

757
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,090
This? What about some corn?

758
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,620
I used to come here often with my mom.

759
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,390
It's been a while for me, too. Let's eat.

760
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,560
Yes, let's eat.

761
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:33,790
Eat up.

762
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,270
So why haven't you been here in a while?

763
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:45,870
Did your mom get sick of this place?

764
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,340
No.

765
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:50,610
She's not around anymore.

766
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,689
- Are you okay? - I'm sorry.

767
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,699
No, it's fine.

768
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,900
Here, let me get that.

769
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,070
- Just leave it. - Your shirt.

770
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,900
- Are you okay? - Yes.

771
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,580
There.

772
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:33,650
Let's hurry up and go.

773
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:35,290
What? Where?

774
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,020
There's somewhere I want to take you.

(1982 Dongin Department Store Double Bonus Mega Sale)

778
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,079
Why are we here?

779
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,250
You said it was your birthday.

780
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,550
You bought me lunch. It's the least I can do.

781
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,089
Pick something out. I'll get you a gift.

782
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,449
No, you don't have to get me anything.

783
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,050
I'm not taking no for an answer.

784
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,620
I have money.

785
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,030
Come on.

786
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,260
What would look good on you?

787
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,400
A jacket?

788
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,170
- How about a jacket? - I like it.

789
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,000
That looks great on you.

790
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,470
Right.

791
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,670
- You don't like it? - What?

792
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,110
Something else?

793
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,080
What about a sweater? This one looks good.

794
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,350
What's with the lukewarm reaction?

795
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,189
I'm trying to buy you a gift here. Could you show a little enthusiasm?

796
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:43,389
No, it's just that they're both nice.

797
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,460
I'm fine with either one. Let's hurry.

798
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,890
- Which one... - Hey!

799
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,060
Get down!

800
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,260
What is it?

801
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:53,930
What?

802
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,140
What?

803
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,840
Why does the window display look so tacky?

804
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,850
Don't you know that display is everything in a department store?

805
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:11,450
There's no highlight in this display!

806
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:13,450
Is this what I pay you for?

807
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,820
I'll fix it right away, sir.

808
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:17,160
For goodness' sake.

809
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:40,650
So...

810
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,650
The CEO of this department store is your dad?

811
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:51,690
And it's not even your birthday?

812
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,429
If I'd known sooner,

813
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:04,600
I would've been getting a gift, not buying one.

814
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:11,680
Well, one thing's for sure.

815
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,550
Of everyone I know, you're...

816
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,860
You're the richest kid.

817
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:26,289
Gosh.

818
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,360
Rich.

819
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,730
Right. Okay.

820
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,760
I guess I'm rich,

821
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,900
but my father is the one with the money, not me.

822
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,800
But it'll all be yours eventually, right?

823
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,540
So...

824
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,470
Why were you trying so desperately to hide?

825
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:45,580
What if you ran into him? Would he beat you up or something?

826
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,620
So even a department store CEO beats his own son.

827
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:00,890
Well...

828
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,000
That's a new one.

829
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,469
He's always had a temper,

830
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,970
but he wasn't always this violent.

831
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,610
Not until my mom passed away.

832
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:18,610
His self-control has been...

833
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,749
You know...

834
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,320
Your typical sob story.

835
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,330
I mean, I'm used to it by now, so I'm fine.

836
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,200
But when you were there with me,

837
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,770
it was just a little...

838
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:52,080
You're not okay either, though.

839
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,880
You don't have to act so tough.

840
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,460
If you always pretend you're fine, you'll just fall apart all at once.

841
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,960
It's better to admit when you're hurting.

842
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,800
Yes.

843
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,840
How do you know that so well?

844
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,870
Because I've been there.

845
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,880
Acted tough, and then just...

846
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,350
Call me sometime.

847
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,050
We could go to the library this weekend or something.

848
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:11,160
You already gave me your number, and I shot you down.

849
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,360
I know.

850
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,760
Since I've already been shot down once,

851
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,300
I figure a second time will be less of a shock.

852
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:26,770
I...

853
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:38,050
I...

854
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,720
I want to be with you.

00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,320
- Here you go. - Gosh. Thank you.

857
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,190
- I hope that was enough. - Not at all.

858
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:18,159
- Thank you. - You take care now.

859
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,160
Okay.

860
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,570
- Good grief. - Oh, my gosh.

861
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,980
Are your eyes just for decoration? How could you possibly miss this?

862
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,180
You startled me.

863
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,079
You're still up?

864
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,250
Here.

Slather it on every time you wash your hands.

It's that hand cream all the young people are using.

00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:25,060
Did you...

868
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:29,159
buy this for me, Mom?

869
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,230
Of course I did. Did you think it fell from the sky?

870
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,070
Your youth is more precious than gold.

871
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:37,940
You need to start using this thing while you're still young.

872
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:41,210
Otherwise, your hands will end up a wrinkly mess like your mother's.

873
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:45,740
Gosh. What's gotten into you, buying something like this?

874
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,880
It smells nice.

875
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,689
Goodness. Don't be stingy with it.

876
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,759
- I'll buy you more when you're out. - It feels like a waste, Mom.

877
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,730
What's there to waste? I said I'll buy you more.

878
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,360
It feels so soft.

879
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,360
- Do you like it? - Yes.

880
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:07,969
Let's put some on you too, Mom.

881
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,569
- No, I'm okay. - Come on, let me.

882
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:10,770

Yes?

885
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:28,620
Do you think my face looks any lighter?

886
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,959
No, it's the same.

887
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,960
Dark.

888

- Yeong Bae. - What?

889
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,630
That omelette rice was so good, right?

890
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:41,929
It was so yellow and fluffy.

891
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:43,030
It really was.

892
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,739
And there was meat inside, right?

893
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,740
Yes, there was.

894
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:47,269
Don't you want to have it again?

895
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:48,340
I do.

Oh, my. What brings you two here?

- Hello. - Hello.

899
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,589
Sae Ri invited us to come over again.

I see.

01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,600
But what's this?

902
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,999
Mom said when you visit someone's house,

903
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,670
you shouldn't show up empty-handed.

904
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,070
Okay.

905
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:20,770
- This is for you. - Okay.

906
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,410
Oh, dear.

907
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:25,310
All right. Take your shoes off and come on in.

908
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:27,009
Yeong Bae! Yeong Mi!

909
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:28,110
Sae Ri!

910
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:29,980
Hi.

911
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,950
It's the pumpkin from Cinderella!

912
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:36,660
Yes, it is.

913
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,569
You said you saw her, you punk.

914
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,399
When and where did you see her, you punk?

915
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,400
I did see her at Yeonpung Intersection,

916
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,370
but I was pretty wasted myself.

917
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,639
So I didn't get the bus number.

918
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,809
You punk.

919
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:58,010
I wasn't sure at first because of the conductor's uniform.

920
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:01,950
But I'm sure of it. It was definitely your sister.

921
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,220
"A conductor's uniform?"

922
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,690
That wench is working as a bus conductor?

923
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:53,330
Like you could've gone far.

924
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:31,400
- Yeong Rye! - Hey!

925
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,410
Hey!

926
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,509
My goodness. It's been a few days, but it feels like ages.

927
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:42,809
I almost forgot what you look like.

928
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:43,980
Have you been well?

929
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:46,220
I made things hard on all of you, didn't I?

930
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:48,690
Hey, Koh Yeong Rye.

931
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:50,420
It's been a while.

932
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,130
Ta-da!

933
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,470
Looks delicious.

934
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,600
Let me get that for you. Hang on.

935
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:10,340
Here, eat up.

936
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:17,180
Anyone would think you're the patient.

937
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:19,420
You've lost more weight.

938
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,950
I've been trying to eat properly.

939
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,959
Finish this and have some more. I'll make another bowl.

940
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:26,960
Okay.

941
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:31,660
Here, for dessert.

942
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:33,230
Thank you.

943
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:42,140
I ran into Han Jae Pil yesterday.

944
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,350
I guess he somehow found out that Vivaldi is my usual spot.

945
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,850
He was waiting for me.

946
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:54,690
It was his birthday, so we ate.

947
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,550
Then we went gift shopping.

948
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,160
You know Dongin Department Store, right?

949
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:00,960
It turns out his family owns it.

950
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:03,630
He saw his dad and tried to hide from him.

951
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,530
I think his father is kind of abusive.

952
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:08,070
And his mother passed away.

953
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:12,170
I guess money really can't buy happiness.

954
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,240
Right.

955
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,439
Then he gave me his number...

956
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,050
and asked me to go to the library with him on the weekend.

957
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:30,360
And?

958
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,490
What about you?

959
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:35,190
What?

960
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:37,100
Are you still...

961
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,730
not interested in him?

962
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,270
Not at all?

963
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:44,470
I don't know.

964
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:48,610
There's something about him.

965
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,940
On one hand, it seems like he has everything,

966
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,550
but on the other, it's like he has nothing.

967
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:57,380
He seems lonely.

968
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,720
He does get on my mind, strangely enough.

969
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:11,600
So why not give him a chance?

970
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,730
A guy who asks me to the library on a date?

971
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,970
No way. That's so lame.

972
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,640
The fact that he doesn't really know who I am,

973
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:29,880
and the fact that I'm not being honest with him...

974
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,550
I don't like either one.

975
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,630
Don't you think it's because...

976
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,560
you're starting to have feelings for him?

977
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:48,470
Otherwise, you wouldn't be so upset about it.

978
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,270
Is that right?

979
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,810
I don't even know how I feel.

980
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,150
But there's one thing I know for sure.

981
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:08,490
I think I have to see him one more time.

982
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:11,920
I should probably start by being honest.

983
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:15,290
That I'm not a student, and I'm a bus conductor.

984
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:19,530
And I'll just figure out the rest after that.

985
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:23,330
I mean, we'll either see each other or we won't, right?

986
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,840
Oh, right.

987
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,310
I have a full shift that day.

988
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,110
So I didn't even have time anyway.

989
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,190
I'll cover your shift.

990
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:54,200
You covered for me before.

991
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:56,400
- Really? - Yes.

992
01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:59,570
You'd really do that?

993
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:01,270
Yes.

994
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:08,580
Okay.

995
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,250
All right, then.

996
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:15,090
I'm going to go make the call.

997
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,289
You finish this up, and just tidy up a little.

998
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:18,290
Okay.

999
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,290
Yes, hello?

1000
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:00,000
Hello?

1001
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,470
Hello?

1002
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:09,910
If you're going to call, at least say something.

1003
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,540
Who is this?

1004
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,509
Who are you, you punk?

1005
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:16,150
This little brat. Who are you, making a prank call?

1006
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:17,650
Who are you, you punk?

1007
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:21,090
Unbelievable.

1008
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,359
Anyway, people like this should all be rounded up and jailed.

1009
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,390
These little punks.

1010
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:30,260
The laws in this country are way too lenient.

1011
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,150
Hello?

1012
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:50,350
Hey.

1013
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,850
It's me, Seo Jong Hee.

1014
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,220
Hey.

1015
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:56,990
What?

1016
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:59,890
I'm at a payphone, and I'm down to my last dime.

1017
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:01,960
I'll make this quick, so listen up.

1018
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:04,300
Okay.

1019
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,260
Meet me in front of Vivaldi on Sunday at 1pm.

1020
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,700
There's something I need to tell you in person first.

1021
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,940
No, it's not something I can say over the phone.

1022
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:17,310
Right.

1023
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:20,980
It was bound to end up like this anyway.

1024
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:24,880
More than my three fated encounters with him,

1025
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:30,090
their one encounter was a stronger and more powerful destiny.

1026
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,290
So...

1027
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:39,630
I'm taking back my claim to happiness.

1028
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,630
Because...

1029
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:53,850
You also have the right to pursue your own happiness.

1030
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,350
And...

1031
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:01,520
The person I want to be happy, second only to myself,

1032
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,830
is you.

1033
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:32,550
Yes.

1034
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:48,330
That's nice.

1035
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:50,229
But why the pumpkin porridge all of a sudden?

1036
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:52,599
The tutor's younger siblings brought it over.

1037
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,770
- His siblings? - Yes.

1038
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:56,709
His little brother is around Sae Ri's age,

1039
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:58,940
and his sister is a couple of years younger.

1040
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:01,379
I guess the tutor is the eldest son.

1041
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:03,179
Their father passed away young...

1042
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,079
There's no need to be...

1043
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,590
so nosy about other people's family business.

1044
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,719
He's not a stranger.

1045
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,019
- Sae Ri, come on. - Yes, Sae Ri.

1046
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,190
- Have a seat. - Come sit here.

1047
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,959
- Eat your porridge. - That's a good girl.

1048
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,129
- It's hot, so make sure... - Eat up.

1049
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,130
You blow on it before you eat.

1050
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:18,330
- Okay. - Okay.

1051
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,600
Is it good?

1052
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,140
- Mom. - Yes?

1053
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:30,540
Where's my Cinderella pumpkin?

1054
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,610
I put it over there, but it's gone now.

1055
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,780
I wanted to keep it in my room.

1056
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:36,909
That one?

1057
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,820
Mommy made it into porridge.

1058
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,150
You just ate it, Sae Ri.

1059
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,720
- Can I have another bowl? - Sure.

1060
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:53,059
My Cinderella pumpkin!

1061
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,999
- Why did you eat it? - I'm leaving now.

1062
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,669
I was supposed to make a carriage!

1063
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:58,339
- Have some porridge before you go. - I hate you, Mom!

1064
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,140
It's Saturday, so you have no lunchbox.

1065
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,669
No, I'm fine.

1066
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:04,010
- I'm leaving now. - My Cinderella pumpkin!

1067
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,850
Are you back from your route already?

1068
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:13,350
You're quick today.

1069
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:16,950
Yes, it was pretty quiet out there because it's Saturday.

1070
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:25,860
Why?

1071
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,370
Just because.

1072
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,030
You're so pretty.

1073
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:31,440
Of course.

1074
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,770
I'm one of the prettiest faces here at Cheongah Bus.

1075
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:37,510
You really are.

1076
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,510
Even now.

1077
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:45,820
Right.

1078
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,320
You're going to tell him tomorrow, right?

1079
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:51,060
I have to.

1080
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,560
- I'm off then. - Okay.

1081
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,200
Jong Hee!

1082
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:10,340
Seo Jong Hee! You forgot your hat.

1083
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:11,640
Darn it.

1084
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:13,639
I mean, if there's a spot check from HQ,

1085
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:16,010
she'll get in trouble for a dress code violation.

1086
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:17,750
Here, let me.

1087
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:19,619
- I'll run it over to her. - What?

1088
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,790
The bus has already left. How can you possibly catch it?

1089
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,150
Are you okay? You're not hurt, are you?

1090
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,460
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

1091
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,430
The tire suddenly went flat.

1092
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,800
I'm afraid you all need to get off and take the next bus.

1093
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,830
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

1094
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,030
- Please get off. - I'm sorry.

1095
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,769
Everyone, please exit. I'm sorry.

1096
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:12,770
Oh, come one.

1097
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:14,940
That was a close call.

1098
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,340
I'm sorry.

1099
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:18,680
I'm sorry.

1100
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,480
I'm sorry.

1101
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:24,150
I'm sorry.

1102
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:46,840
If I'm late, I'm on cleaning duty again.

1103
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,970
I'll take the next bus, and...

1104
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,010
Would it be faster if I can transfer?

1105
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:38,680
(A Hundred Memories)

1106
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:59,869
Weren't you planning on telling him anyway?

1107
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:00,870
I know.

1108
01:18:00,871 --> 01:18:04,069
But letting him know myself and getting caught is different.

1109
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:05,239
It doesn't matter to me.

1110
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,409
It does for me.

1111
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:07,480
Don't come looking for me again.

1112
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,110
Let me ask you one thing.

1113
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:11,419
Is there a bus conductor named Seo Jong Yeon here?

1114
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:15,319
A strange man came looking for someone called Seo Jong Yeon.

1115
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,619
What's going on, Jong Hee?

1116
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:17,960
- We can't stop. - Stop!

1117
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,519
We have to go faster.

1118
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,760
- Stop! - Please, leave me alone.

1119
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:24,900
I'm already embarrassed as is, that everyone knows.

1120
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,099
Let go!

1121
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,100
Let me stay by your side, even just as a friend.
