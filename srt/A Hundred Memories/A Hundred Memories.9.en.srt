(A Hundred Memories)

7
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,939
Thank you so much.

8
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,370
Thanks to you, it was so comfortable...

9
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,769
Hey, it is you, isn't it?

10
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,970
You're from back then...

11
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,770
You're Yeong Rye's friend. Your name was Seo...

12
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,340
Seo Jong Hee.

13
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,970
That's right. Jong Hee.

14
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,680
I can't believe we ran into each other here.

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,150
It's so good to see you.

16
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,300
Are you okay?

17
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,740
If you fell off a horse, you should listen to Jae Pil.

18
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,709
You need to get a proper check-up...

19
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,710
I'm fine.

20
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,840
It's just a simple bruise.

21
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,180
You should worry about your hiccups.

22
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,380
Try holding your breath or something.

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,560
Here, drink this. It'll stop your hiccups.

24
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,990
Thanks.

25
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,710
Here, let me get that for you.

26
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,740
There.

27
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,860
I think they're gone now.

28
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,630
That's a relief.

29
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,200
Come to think of it, we haven't been together in a while.

30
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,270
The last time was seven years ago, outside the police station. Right?

31
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,809
We looked so young back then.

32
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,079
Now we're all getting old together.

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,640
You've both grown into such fine young women.

34
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,180
You seem to be the only one who hasn't changed.

35
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,820
You're just as cheerful as you've always been.

36
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,650
You think so?

37
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,720
For some reason, that doesn't sound like a compliment.

38
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,160
Am I just being sensitive?

39
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,230
- Jong Hee. - Mom.

40
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,230
Are you okay?

41
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,740
Are you... Are you really okay?

42
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,840
Yes, I'm okay.

43
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,140
I heard what happened from Mr. Jeong,

44
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,750
and my heart was pounding so hard... I don't even know how I got here.

45
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,320
Jong Hee, honey.

46
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,949
Mom, I'm fine.

47
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,520
Nothing's wrong with me.

48
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,460
- Please, calm down. - Okay.

49
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,660
Goodness, what a mess. This is so upsetting.

50
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,300
I'm really not hurt enough to be hospitalized.

51
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,500
I feel so fine that this is embarrassing, Mom.

52
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,140
What's there to be embarrassed about?

53
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,470
Just think of this as a chance to get some rest for a few days.

54
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,210
I was going to have you get a full check-up anyway.

55
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,350
I've been so busy. I've been neglecting you.

56
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,520
Seung Yeon used to get one once a year...

57
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,890
Anyway, let's get you checked out while you're here, okay?

58
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,020
Okay.

59
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,740
A few days ago...

60
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,840
Jong Hee came by the shop.

61
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,080
She was with her adoptive mother, the one we just saw.

62
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,340
- Oh, she did? - Yes.

63
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,820
I was going to tell you, but I never found the right time.

64
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,690
Really. When I came by to drop off your clothes and things.

65
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,590
It's okay.

66
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,290
You don't have to explain yourself. Why would you need to?

67
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,230
Are you sure you're okay?

68
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,930
You must have been surprised, right?

69
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,170
Well, a little.

70
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,670
For a second, I wasn't sure it was really her.

71
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,240
Isn't that just so like Seo Jong Hee?

72
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,880
Disappearing just like the wind...

73
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,350
and then suddenly showing up out of nowhere.

74
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,650
Right? That's so her.

75
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,490
Oh, there's my bus.

76
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,119
I've got to go. You should head inside.

77
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,789
- Okay. - Okay, thanks. I'll see you.

78
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,160
- Get home safe. - Okay.

79
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Go on.

80
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,150
Go.

81
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,630
Any dizziness or nausea?

82
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,300
No.

83
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,469
As you may know, at your guardian's request,

84
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,469
we'll be running a series of tests.

85
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,010
But it's too late for tonight.

86
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,770
So we'll likely start...

87
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,740
first thing in the morning.

88
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,310
Okay.

89
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,480
We know you have a fear of needles, so you don't need to worry.

90
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,420
If you feel uncomfortable at all, just press the button for a nurse.

91
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,790
Do you have any other questions?

92
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,660
Yes, I do.

93
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,360
How have you been?

94
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,540
Good.

95
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,370
As you can see.

96
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,280
Yeong Rye told me you became a doctor,

97
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,879
but seeing you now in this doctor's coat,

98
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,350
it's just so strange.

99
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,260
The way I remember you,

100
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,960
you're in uniform or boxing gloves. That's it.

101
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,860
You must have studied really hard.

102
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,070
It was the only thing I could do.

103
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,910
But what about you? How did you...

104
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,510
I'm going to check your blood pressure now.

105
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,620
Okay.

106
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,640
Here.

107
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,710
Hey, if you wanted to grab a drink, we could've just gone to a bar.

108
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,350
This place is a little unusual for me.

109
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,220
Once you're a judge, buying you drinks might look bad.

110
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,790
So I wanted to treat you now.

111
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,560
So drink up. My treat.

112
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,670
What's wrong? Is something going on?

113
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,100
Oh, something's going on, all right.

114
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,510
It's just...

115
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,880
I feel like things are about to get very interesting.

116
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,920
You know that feeling of suspense?

117
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,690
Like that strange quiet right before a storm?

118
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,290
The sky is full of dark clouds,

119
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,230
the wind starts to howl,

120
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,269
and the rain hasn't started yet, but it looks like it'll pour.

121
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,299
The whole sky just looks so majestic.

122
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,070
Hey, just say what you mean. Be direct.

123
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,380
You really don't get the humanities, do you?

124
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,649
What do you know besides the law, anyway?

125
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,419
Dude, I'm swamped with law books. When do I have time for any of that?

126
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,619
Law school is in the humanities, you fool.

127
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,290
You should read more. We can barely hold a conversation.

128
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,230
So for who is this "calm before the storm," anyway?

129
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,500
Let's see.

130
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,440
Yeong Rye, Jae Pil, and Jong Hee.

131
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,940
And maybe...

132
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,010
us?

133
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,960
I used to think that of the people who come into our lives,

134
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,500
those who leave are fated encounters,

135
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,000
and those who stay are destined.

136
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,110
So then, for someone who has returned...

137
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,910
Are they a fated encounter or are they destiny?

138
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,650
Or...

139
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,820
is it just a coincidence?

140
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,760
(Episode 9: Fated Encounter That Had Left)

141
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,030
(Destiny That I Kept)

142
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,400
(Yeonseo University Hospital)

143
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,090
Are you done eating?

144
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,590
Should I take this away?

145
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,560
Yes, please.

146
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,900
I'm not a patient, so I don't have an appetite for hospital food.

147
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,419
But still. It's such a shame to waste it.

148
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,780
She barely ate a thing.

149
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,350
Oh, what a waste.

150
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,500
Hey, let's go grab a quick bite.

151
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,160
I skipped breakfast, and now I'm starving.

152
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,570
Okay.

153
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,940
Gosh, what in the world is happening?

154
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,409
The one and only Go Yeong Rye slept through her alarm?

155
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,439
I was counting on you! I was even having a good dream.

156
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,679
Oh, man, what are we going to do?

157
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,649
Hey, even if we leave right now, we're definitely going to be late.

158
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,550
Sorry. I studied and didn't sleep until the crack of dawn.

159
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,850
Yeong Rye, get in.

160
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
You...

161
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,730
Get in.

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,370
Were you really just passing by?

163
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,499
Somehow, I don't think so.

164
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,809
Gosh, you've gotten so suspicious, Yeong Rye.

165
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,209
Just trust me, okay?

166
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,639
I was just driving by, and I thought,

167
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,539
"Hey, isn't that Go Yeong Rye? What a coincidence!"

168
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,250
So I pulled over. It's the truth.

169
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,150
Oh, come on. That's ridiculous. How could...

170
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,319
If he says that's what happened, then that's what happened, okay?

171
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,059
Why do you keep questioning him?

172
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,559
We were running late, and he swooped in to save the day.

173
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,329
I couldn't be more grateful.

174
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,559
Exactly.

175
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,100
That's our Jeong Bun.

176
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,940
What is this? When did you two get so buddy-buddy?

177
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,499
You're the one who said it.

178
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,010
That my car feels like heaven compared to the crowded bus.

179
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,279
So I figured I'd play chauffeur before I start my new job.

180
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,310
- You silly goose. - Oh, come on.

181
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,179
That was just something to say.

182
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,749
I didn't actually mean for you to drive me to work...

183
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,090
I know that, silly.

184
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,060
I'm doing it because I want to.

185
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,060
Besides, I like driving.

186
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,130
I love going for drives. I really do.

187
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,959
Plus, I get to drive pretty ladies in the morning.

188
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,669
What could be better?

189
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,269
My goodness. All that time you spent abroad...

190
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,800
really turned you into a smooth talker.

191
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,040
You really know just what to say.

192
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,580
Oh, stop.

193
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,950
Thank you.

194
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,720
- Thank you. - Thanks.

195
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,530
Let's dig in.

196
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,339
Excuse me, ma'am?

197
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,940
Could we get one more tonkatsu to go, please?

198
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,680
It looked like you skipped breakfast.

199
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,550
An empty stomach could affect the rest of your test results.

200
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,820
Even if you don't feel like it,

201
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,820
you should probably have a few bites.

202
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,930
Wait. Just a second.

203
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,170
Could you stay with me just while I eat?

204
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,540
I don't want to eat alone.

205
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,620
Why's that?

206
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,860
I don't know.

207
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,960
It just reminds me of the old days.

208
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,400
I thought you'd changed so much,

209
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,500
but you still eat port cutlet the same.

210
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,740
I guess you're right.

211
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,310
My mom hates when I eat like this, so I try not to.

212
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,250
But with you here, I guess I slipped back into an old habit.

213
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,080
It tastes so much better this way, though.

214
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,050
Back then...

215
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,290
I'd honestly never seen anything like it.

216
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,330
Can I tell you a secret?

217
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,430
The truth is,

218
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,170
I was really nervous that day.

219
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,200
I mean, it was my first time in a fancy restaurant like that.

220
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,440
You have no idea how hard I tried to act like I belonged there.

221
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,879
You were?

222
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,080
Yes.

223
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,980
I couldn't tell at all.

224
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,650
You were so poised and confident, Seo Jong Hee.

225
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,730
Now that's the Han Jae Pil I remember.

226
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,670
When you smile like that.

227
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,040
And you're finally starting to look like the Seo Jong Hee I remember.

228
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,040
I am?

229
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,140
Have I really changed that much?

230
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,510
I can't really tell.

231
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,420
There's something I've been wanting to ask you.

232
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,060
Something I decided I'd ask if I ever saw you again.

233
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,400
Back then...

234
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,600
When you broke up with me...

235
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,840
Why did you do that?

236
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,280
After that,

237
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,410
I went to Vivaldi...

238
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,250
and saw the note you left.

239
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,219
I ran with it to Cheongah Bus,

240
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,290
but you were already gone.

241
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,890
So, why did you do it?

242
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,940
Well...

243
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,040
I don't really remember.

244
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,140
It was so long ago.

245
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,050
You know how impulsive I am.

246
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,930
So, what about you?

247
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,799
You and Yeong Rye seem pretty close.

248
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, I guess so.

249
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,900
She's a friend I can't imagine my life without.

250
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,400
Just like Sang Cheol.

251
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,540
So...

252
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,740
just a close friend?

253
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,640
What?

254
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,610
Never mind.

255
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,420
This pork cutlet is so, so good.

256
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,130
Want some?

257
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,630
- Go on, you eat it. - Okay.

258
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,139
No, he's just not around.

259
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,510
He was never in the picture.

260
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,980
That fool, Choi Jeong Bun.

261
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,520
She should've just met a nice guy and settled down.

262
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,220
What can she do? Having a baby all on her own without a father?

263
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,700
This is really bugging me.

264
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,360
While Seo Jong Hee was in the hospital,

265
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,000
I was planning to go out and meet some girls, but...

266
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,470
(Juri Beauty Salon)

267
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,830
Ta-da! Surprise!

268
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,240
Jong Hee, what are you doing here?

269
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,640
I busted out of the hospital.

270
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,540
I can't believe how thrilling it was.

271
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,410
My heart is still pounding.

272
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,680
Hey!

273
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,250
You scared me! Seriously, what were you...

274
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,449
Did I scare you?

275
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,920
Want an even bigger surprise?

276
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,360
Ta-da!

277
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,030
Han Jae Pil?

278
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,700
I'm here too, Go Yeong Rye.

279
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,060
This is delicious.

280
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,429
I was feeling a bit queasy, but this totally hits the spot.

281
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,629
- It's good, right? - Yes.

282
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,630
I found this place two years ago.

283
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,200
Ho Suk and Jeong Bun love the tteokbokki here too.

284
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,399
They say it'll knock a cold right out of you.

285
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,469
We even call it our "cure-all tteokbokki."

286
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,410
Right. Anything this delicious has to be good for you.

287
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,350
Jae Pil, how come you're not eating?

288
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,380
You didn't have dinner either.

289
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,850
Actually, he can't handle spicy food.

290
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,590
He can't?

291
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,089
Really? I don't remember that.

292
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,489
When we were younger, he always tried to hide it.

293
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,830
Manly pride.

294
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,570
Hey, hey.

295
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,870
What are you talking about?

296
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,440
I don't prefer it, but I can eat it. I could finish it all if I wanted.

297
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,210
Go on, eat it then.

298
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,410
Watch me.

299
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,320
Gosh, no, no, don't.

300
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,790
Should I?

301
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,370
Gosh!

302
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,170
It's delicious.

303
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,940
This place is really good. Want some more?

304
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,039
Excuse me, could we get one more order of this?

305
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
You got it.

306
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,479
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

307
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,819
This place is a lot spicier than the other spots.

308
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,190
Yeah, I'm fine.

309
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,760
I have no idea why I couldn't handle this stuff before.

310
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,220
I just don't get it.

311
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,659
You should eat up too, Yeong Rye.

312
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,930
We have to eat fast if we want to order another round.

313
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,130
Okay.

314
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,770
Let me find some rice cakes.

315
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,950
Gosh, hey! Are you okay?

316
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,420
Here, drink some water! Quick, water!

317
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,660
Here.

318
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,430
Hi there.

319
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,370
You're Jeong Bun's daughter, right?

320
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,470
Your name was...

321
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,510
Su Jin, right?

322
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,810
Su Jin, time for a snack...

323
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,650
Wait a minute. Oh my gosh!

324
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,420
You're from Cheongah Bus, right?

325
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,090
- You're Ms. Im. Im Ho Suk! - That's me!

326
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,790
- I knew it! You look just the same. - That's right!

327
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,259
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it. It really is a small world.

328
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,930
I can't believe I'm running into you of all people, Mr. Kim.

329
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,929
I know, tell me about it.

330
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,599
It's so good to see you. You really haven't changed at all.

331
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,939
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

332
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,739
Let me go ask my mom real quick. Don't go anywhere!

333
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,610
Oh, okay. Sure.

334
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,450
I can't believe she looks exactly the same.

335
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,750
What's this you're drawing? A rainbow?

336
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,489
You're a really good artist.

337
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,690
You're so pretty. You take after your mom.

338
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,190
Here you go.

339
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,000
You know what money is?

340
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,500
Go buy yourself some candy.

341
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,039
It's okay.

342
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,979
Think of me as your mom's friend and go ahead and take it.

343
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,210
It's okay to take it.

344
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,250
There you go.

345
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,520
What do you think you're doing here?

346
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,820
I told you never to come here again. How many times do I have to say it?

347
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,390
And what's this about you giving her money?

348
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,329
Do we look like beggars to you?

349
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,200
No, it wasn't like that. I just think she's so adorable.

350
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,500
Don't give me that garbage.

351
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,400
Now get out of here. You hear me?

352
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,909
We're not serving you, so find somewhere else to eat.

353
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,839
Why are you getting so worked up? I just...

354
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,379
Go on! Didn't you hear me?

355
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,509
- Go on, get out! - But Ho Suk said I could eat...

356
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,250
- Shut up and get out! - Hey, what's your problem?

357
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,650
Seriously?

358
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,550
Why...

359
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,650
Why are you being like this?

360
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,360
Wait a second. Let go of me.

361
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,629
What's wrong with you? This is too much.

362
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,429
What is? What's "too much?"

363
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,999
I mean, was all this really necessary?

364
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,499
Look, I was happy to run into everyone,

365
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,599
but I also felt kind of bad. That's why I came in here.

366
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,499
Is me giving your daughter a little spending money...

367
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,610
really a reason to get this upset?

368
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,840
Oh, save the big speech.

369
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,450
Who do you think you are, giving my daughter cash? My daughter?

370
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,250
I'm...

371
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,750
only going to say this one more time,

372
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,250
so you better listen well.

373
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,689
Never show your face here again. Understand?

374
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,989
There's nobody here who wants to see you, got it?

375
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,990
Seriously, why are you doing this to me?

376
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,030
- What are you, a goldfish? - A goldfish?

377
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,329
It hasn't even been ten seconds...

378
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,969
since I said I wouldn't say it again.

379
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,200
That was seven years ago, all right?

380
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,640
Is all this really necessary?

381
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,869
Let's be honest.

382
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,940
You said awful things, then left.

383
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Awful things?

384
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,420
And you still have no idea why I did what I did back then.

385
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,420
There's nothing more to say.

386
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,720
Let go of me, okay?

387
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,489
I said, let go!

388
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,389
Then why'd you do it? Tell me.

389
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,760
- Let go! - Then why?

390
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,560
Didn't you hear her?

391
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,530
She said to let go of her.

392
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,470
What's going on here?

393
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,570
What gives you the right to butt in?

394
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,700
Me?

395
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,380
I'm her boyfriend. You got a problem with that?

396
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,430
Why did you say that back there?

397
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,140
Why would you say you're my boyfriend?

398
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,810
Go on, explain yourself.

399
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,680
I knew you liked to stick your nose in other people's business,

400
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,580
but how could you just spout that kind of nonsense?

401
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,150
What if people get the wrong idea?

402
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,490
That man...

403
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,250
He's Su Jin's dad.

404
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,330
But you don't want him around.

405
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,260
Anywhere near you.

406
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,370
That's why.

407
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,670
You should use me.

408
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,360
Hey!

409
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,229
Seriously, you guys? Is this really that funny?

410
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,169
What? It is funny.

411
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,899
I mean, what's so embarrassing about not being able to eat hot food...

412
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,569
that you had to keep forcing it down like that?

413
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,739
I swear, I thought he'd drink all the water in the place.

414
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,410
Your stomach must be sloshing. All that water you drank.

415
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,920
Oh, this is hilarious.

416
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,250
Laugh it up.

417
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,590
If my suffering brings you all this much joy,

418
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,090
then I'm happy to oblige. Go on, laugh.

419
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,690
Hey, hold on. Look at that.

420
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,059
Let's play that to help us digest. We haven't done it in a while.

421
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,729
Oh, I didn't know they had one of these here.

422
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,430
You should try it, Jae Pil. You used to box a little, right?

423
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,310
Hey, are you sure about that?

424
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,639
Ever since you started your internship,

425
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,940
you've avoided boxing so you don't hurt your hands, right?

426
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,810
This much is okay.

427
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,729
What's with this thing?

428
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,870
My footwork is so...

429
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,369
off.

430
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,600
What was that, Han Jae Pil?

431
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,899
Hey, Yeong Rye, you give it a shot.

432
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,170
- Me? - Yes.

433
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,940
Give it to me.

434
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,649
Why are you taking it so seriously? What score are you aiming for?

435
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,249
Let her be. You know how she is. She gives it her all no matter what.

436
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,690
- Here I go. - All right.

437
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,890
One, two.

438
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,690
Gosh!

439
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,390
Bam!

440
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,629
Gosh, she beat it! She beat Han Jae Pil!

441
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,940
I won!

442
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,000
I won.

443
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,469
My footwork just kept getting tangled up.

444
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,610
Come on, Jae Pil, step it up.

445
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,110
His ego is totally crushed right now.

446
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,250
I know, right?

447
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,279
So, what are you doing on your day off?

448
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,820
Let's hang out when I get discharged.

449
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,750
Shall we? I'd like that.

450
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,889
There's so much I want to do with you.

451
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,890
Really?

452
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,199
No, really. You don't have to get me a gift.

453
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,269
My mom says...

454
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,600
that your underwear should be prettier than clothes.

455
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,469
How's this?

456
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,909
This one's pretty too.

457
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,870
No, really, I'm fine.

458
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,309
All right, you pick one out too. It's on me.

459
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,510
Really?

460
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,250
Okay, then I'll...

461
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,549
What do you think? Sexy?

462
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,590
It's pretty.

463
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,020
The star of that movie will be jealous of you.

464
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,490
Then I'll take this one.

465
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,570
Oh, welcome.

466
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,500
- Just a blowout today? - Yes.

467
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,610
- You can sit there. - This way, please.

468
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,450
Are you wearing it? The gift I got you.

469
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,580
Yeah, I'm wearing it.

470
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
Here, here.

471
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,620
- Want me to show you mine? - What?

472
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,050
- Hey! - Jong Hee.

473
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,489
Are you comfortable?

474
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,690
Yes.

475
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,289
If you need anything, just let me know.

476
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,500
Okay.

477
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,270
Hey, what are we supposed to do then?

478
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,170
Stop it.

479
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,110
I'm home.

480
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,880
- You're home? - Hey!

481
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,660
I must've had a lucky dream. We've had three big parties already.

482
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,560
You two, wash your hands and come help me.

483
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,189
When we're done, I'll treat you all to pork belly.

484
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,400
- Pork belly? - Pork belly?

485
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,340
Ma'am, a bag of rice is by the door. Should I bring it in?

486
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,510
I heard about you from Jae Pil.

487
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,780
I finally get to meet you.

488
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,509
Ma'am.

489
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,750
What's with the formal talk all of a sudden?

490
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,250
How've you been, Ma Sang Cheol?

491
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,790
- Is it good? - Yeah!

492
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,730
Gosh, Mom.

493
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,760
This is really delicious.

494
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,370
What did you do to this pork belly? It's magical! Gosh!

495
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,929
Give me a break.

496
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,200
Hey, save the sweet talk for your customers.

497
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,839
Come on, eat up. I'll keep making more.

498
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,040
- Okay. - Okay.

499
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,820
Jong Hee, eat up.

500
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,459
Yes, ma'am. It's so delicious.

501
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,090
Here, you have some too, Mom.

502
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,559
You should eat while you're grilling. Here.

503
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
No, I'm fine. You go ahead.

504
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,599
I'm so sick of the smell, I lost my appetite.

505
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,269
Come on, you'll eat it if I give you some.

506
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,530
- Here you go, ma'am. Say "ah." - I said I'm...

507
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,110
Why is it so big?

508
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,310
You know how small my mouth is.

509
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,639
Did you put raw garlic in here?

510
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,150
Of course I did. You said it's no good without it.

511
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,589
Oh, Jong Hee...

512
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,789
I'm here!

513
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,219
- Look who it is. Perfect timing. - Come on in.

514
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,419
Gosh, I smell pork belly.

515
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,759
- Hey, the silverware's over there. - Hey, sit over here.

516
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,959
Sit down.

517
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,159
- I'm starving. - You must be, right?

518
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,460
Here, I set some aside for you.

519
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,570
Thank you.

520
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,269
All right, now that Jae Pil's here, we have to have a drink!

521
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,439
- Cheers, cheers, cheers! - To a hard day's work

522
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,940
- Cheers! - Cheers!

523
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,020
So?

524
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,750
Did you find anything out?

525
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,650
What on earth has she been up to?

526
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,990
Yes, I had her followed.

527
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,530
Apparently, she's been frequenting a restaurant in Yeongeun Market.

528
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,300
A market?

529
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,360
Why there?

530
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,929
From what we've gathered,

531
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:09,200
it's run by a friend's mother from her days as a bus attendant.

532
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,910
She's been meeting this friend often and even visiting her home.

533
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
I can't believe her.

534
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,659
By the way, the doctor on duty today is Dr. Seo In Woo, right?

535
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,890
Not Dr. Han Jae Pil?

536
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,760
I think so.

537
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,369
We're not getting called from everywhere again...

538
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,530
because of that clueless doc, are we?

539
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,170
It's so much easier when Dr. Jae Pil is on duty.

540
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,470
He's great at handling emergencies.

541
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,380
Of course. He's his father's son.

542
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,750
But still, Dr. Han Jae Pil...

543
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,080
I feel bad for him sometimes.

544
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,350
Why?

545
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:56,620
You know.

546
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,990
I'm talking about his father, the patient Han Gi Bok.

547
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,989
Intern life must be hard enough as it is,

548
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,519
but he must care for his peculiar dad.

549
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
Imagine how exhausting that is.

550
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,489
He's always irritable and snapping at people.

551
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,760
If I were Dr. Jae Pil... Gosh. I wouldn't want to imagine.

552
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,799
I bet he's incredibly embarrassed around us too.

553
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,270
And he must be walking on eggshells at the hospital.

554
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,139
That's true.

555
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,669
He was readmitted almost a year ago for that stroke, wasn't he?

556
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,070
I know, right?

557
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,739
The hospital wanted him discharged because they need the beds,

558
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,380
but Dr. Jae Pil...

559
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,249
said it was too dangerous with no one at home to care for him.

560
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,350
I heard he begged and pleaded to let him stay.

561
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,320
Dr. Jae Pil is such a good guy,

562
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,290
but he has the worst luck when it comes to parents.

563
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:44,129
The young woman with the odd walk... I hear she's his stepmom?

564
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,300
Really? That explains it.

565
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,970
Oh my, are you okay?

566
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,970
Are you hurt?

567
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,640
Let me help you up.

568
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,640
- I'm... I'm all right. - Get up.

569
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,010
I'm all...

570
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,940
I'm home.

571
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,070
Mom, I'm home.

572
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,540
What in the world have you been up to?

573
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,110
Pardon?

574
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:33,609
You're always coming home late and skipping your riding lessons.

575
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,980
When I ask where you've been, you're always so vague.

576
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,689
And you've been sneaking off to, what?

577
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,319
Yeongeun Market?

578
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,789
Some place called Yeong Sik's Restaurant?

579
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,790
Mom...

580
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,159
Seeing those people from your past...

581
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,829
You know I can't stand that, don't you?

582
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,859
Your life before you met me was supposed to have been erased.

583
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,230
I told you to completely erase it, didn't I?

584
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,029
I know, but Mom...

585
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,229
You know?

586
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,870
And a girl who knows acts like this?

587
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,469
Lying to my face,

588
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,670
going to that dumpy market to hang out with those lowlifes.

589
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,210
This is why!

590
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,480
I couldn't tell you because I knew you'd react exactly like this.

591
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,980
But those people...

592
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,550
To you, it might be a dumpy place and they may be losers, but to me...

593
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,160
They're the precious people I've gotten back in my life.

594
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,430
What?

595
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,560
Honestly...

596
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,830
I'm really struggling, Mom. I'm so lonely.

597
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,669
Your absolute, unconditional love...

598
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,869
Sometimes it's too much. It's suffocating.

599
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,539
I feel like I'm just...

600
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,880
- Seung Yeon's replacement... - Shut your mouth!

601
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,380
Who do you think you are, saying her name?

602
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,310
How dare you talk about my daughter...

603
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,120
The salon looks a little slow today.

604
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,190
The director and senior stylists are out for a meeting.

605
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,489
They're determined that this year's Miss Korea will come from our salon.

606
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,360
So they're busy with outside events.

607
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,799
Why bother looking for candidates outside?

608
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,970
When you have the lovely Ms. Go Yeong Rye right here.

609
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,269
Hey.

610
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:16,939
My hand almost slipped. I nearly botched this haircut.

611
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,510
No jokes when I'm holding scissors.

612
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,020
Okay, sorry.

613
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,880
Let's get a bite after this. My treat.

614
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,520
Well...

615
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,990
I have to go to the hospital today.

616
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,690
For Jae Pil's father.

617
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,790
I see. Jae Pil again?

618
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,660
I'm really starting to dislike that guy.

619
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,069
Okay, then I'll give you a ride to the hospital.

620
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,339
No, it's okay. I can just take the bus.

621
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,539
I'm fine, really.

622
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,069
Just get in. It's on my way.

623
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,370
And I think it's starting to rain.

624
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:03,460
Gosh. It's raining out of nowhere. It wasn't in the forecast.

625
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,990
And today is when Yeong Rye comes.

626
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,130
I bet she's getting soaked again without an umbrella.

627
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,320
Seo Jong Hee?

628
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,829
Hey, you should've just bought an umbrella.

629
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:41,890
Why...

630
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,930
You...

631
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,170
Jae Pil.

632
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,610
Thanks.

633
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,340
Thanks to you, I made it here dry.

634
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,280
Here, take this.

635
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,809
I'll make sure to return it.

636
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,009
With interest.

637
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,679
There she goes, getting my hopes up.

638
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,480
I wonder what kind of interest she means.

639
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,989
Go on, I'll get going.

640
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,190
Okay.

641
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,120
Drive safe, then.

642
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,360
See you.

643
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,870
I can't just leave you like this.

644
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,280
Let's just grab a quick coffee. There's a nice cafe nearby.

645
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,139
Just 30 minutes, huh?

646
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,810
Coffee, all of a sudden?

647
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,450
Yes. and just 30 minutes. Get in.

648
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,880
Watch your head.

649
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,260
Here, drink up.

650
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,530
It'll warm you up.

651
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,560
Thanks.

652
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:11,380
That's better. I was starting to get the chills.

653
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,580
How long were you walking in the rain?

654
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,150
Since when?

655
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,590
I don't know.

656
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,420
I just kept walking and ended up here.

657
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,300
I'm a real mess, aren't I?

658
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,770
Always so reckless and impulsive.

659
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,300
Just making everyone worry sick.

660
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,739
That's part of your charm, Seo Jong Hee.

661
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,140
It's not like this is new.

662
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:49,480
Are you trying to comfort me?

663
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,960
But it's actually working.

664
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,000
You're something else, Han Jae Pil.

665
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,450
You know, Jae Pil...

666
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:29,660
I was born into a dirt-poor family and grew up without their love.

667
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,690
I thought if I were a rich girl, I'd be happy no matter what.

668
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,700
But that's not how it turned out.

669
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,470
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

670
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,780
And I'm realising that way too late. How stupid of me.

671
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,760
I...

672
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,540
I...

673
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,510
You know, I've always been envious of Yeong Rye.

674
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,480
Back then,

675
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,850
and even now.

676
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,190
Her family and friends who adore her...

677
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,460
When I see her smiling among all of them...

678
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:49,770
she's beautiful.

679
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,440
She shines so brightly, so much that I wish I could be her.

680
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,160
That's true.

681
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,560
Yeong Rye really is a person who shines.

682
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,160
She's smart,

683
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,870
thoughtful... And these days,

684
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,540
she's even developed a sense of humour.

685
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,300
I'm telling you, she's gotten even funnier.

686
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,570
But...

687
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,450
everyone has their own way of shining.

688
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,720
It's just that they're all different.

689
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,760
I hope you find what makes you shine too.

690
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,960
Like you used to.

691
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,900
Like I used to?

692
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,380
Is that even possible?

693
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,109
Of course you can.

694
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:07,550
Because you're you.

695
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,120
We should put some ointment on that cut.

696
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,360
Yeong Rye.

697
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:55,560
Yes, sir?

698
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,460
I...

699
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,100
I make people uncomfortable, don't I?

700
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:05,810
I'm difficult,

701
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,440
and I yell at the drop of a hat.

702
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,510
Why would you say that?

703
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,680
Did someone say something to you?

704
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,590
No, it's nothing. Just...

705
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,120
As I get older,

706
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,460
I find myself thinking about these things.

707
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:31,530
I know I have a short fuse,

708
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,800
so Jae Pil...

709
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:37,140
must feel awkward and be bothered.

710
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,140
With me...

711
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,709
always hanging around his workplace.

712
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,440
Not at all, sir.

713
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:50,120
I'm sure he's more at ease with you being nearby.

714
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,980
That's...

715
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,520
just him doing his duty as a son.

716
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,860
It's an obligation.

717
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,360
But Jae Pil...

718
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,360
He must be worried about what people think.

719
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:05,160
Don't you think?

720
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,330
Not at all.

721
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:11,740
You know Jae Pil and I are very close, right?

722
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:16,180
He has never once said anything like that.

723
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,549
I swear on my mom's cooking.

724
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,909
Oh, gosh.

725
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:22,520
That's quite the thing to swear on.

726
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,190
But this kid...

727
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,820
He hasn't stopped by today?

728
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,400
I know, right?

729
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,700
I guess he's not done with work yet.

730
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,250
All right, that's enough.

731
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,880
You're so thorough.

732
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,220
Put some more on before bed. I'll give you the ointment.

733
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:04,790
Okay.

734
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,430
Jong Hee.

735
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,200
Oh, hey, Yeong Rye.

736
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,770
You're...

737
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:16,400
You're soaking wet. Did you get caught in the rain?

738
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,270
And what happened to your cheek?

739
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,940
You know me. I can be a little strange.

740
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:25,710
I don't know, I just felt like walking in the rain for some reason.

741
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,450
Anyway, the doctor...

742
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,950
already gave me an earful about it,

743
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,420
so please, just let it go for today. Okay?

744
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,320
You could've at least bought a cheap umbrella.

745
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,590
Your hair is completely soaked.

746
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,460
You're going to catch a cold.

747
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,170
I was just about to head out, actually.

748
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,769
All done with my dad's hair?

749
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:56,980
Yes.

750
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:01,510
But he seems to be a little off today.

751
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,050
Really?

752
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,690
That's odd. He always perks right up when he sees you.

753
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,790
I'm not sure. You should stop by to see him later.

754
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:18,199
Make sure you go home and take a hot shower, okay?

755
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,470
Got it.

756
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,540
You've turned into such a nag, Yeong Rye.

757
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,440
Thanks for today.

758
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,379
All right, I'm off.

759
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,650
Get home safe.

760
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,060
Come on, I'll walk you to the bus stop.

761
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,299
No, that's okay. Don't worry about it.

762
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,029
If you get a chance, make sure you go check on your dad.

763
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:54,129
- I will. - He's probably sleeping. Let's go.

764
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,699
I'm fine. I said I'm fine.

765
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,200
Make sure you go see him.

766
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,439
I'll go by myself.

767
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,670
Bye. See you.

768
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,240
Get home safe.

769
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,110
Thanks again for today.

770
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,430
Okay, that's enough.

771
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,740
Put some more on before bed. I'll give you the ointment.

772
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,790
I'm sorry, Mom.

773
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,520
I guess I got a little carried away earlier.

774
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,030
It won't happen again.

775
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,460
All right.

776
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,960
I got a little too emotional as well.

777
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,330
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

778
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,000
Yes, I'm fine.

779
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,670
I'm going to head up now.

780
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:20,410
Jong Hee.

781
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:29,190
You know I love you so much, right?

782
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,960
And that I can't live without you.

783
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:35,930
I know.

784
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,230
Get some rest, Mom.

785
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,909
Hey, you should've just bought an umbrella.

786
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:22,910
Why...

787
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:28,110
Everyone has their own way of shining.

788
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,750
It's just that they're all different.

789
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,220
I hope you find what makes you shine too.

790
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,560
Like you used to.

791
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,149
It's "To You Who Can't Sleep."

792
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,080
Let me read you the next letter.

793
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,850
Today, we have many letters about crush.

794
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:18,720
This is from Dong Won from Injeong-dong.

795
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,589
"At the path where I walked with her for the first time,"

796
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:24,130
"I heard this song."

797
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:27,030
"My heart fluttered. I wonder she had felt the same."

798
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:28,530
"I want to muster up my courage,"

799
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,039
"hold her hands, and listen to this together."

800
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,610
And he requested "My Old Story" by Jo Deok Bae.

801
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:37,980
Let's listen to it together.

802
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:13,980
(Yeonseo University Hospital)

803
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,749
Dad, what are you doing?

804
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,190
What does it look like? I'm checking out.

805
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:23,859
Dad, no. Why all of a sudden?

806
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,860
Quiet.

807
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,860
I can't stand being here anymore. It's suffocating.

808
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,660
Being stuck in this tiny hospital room,

809
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,770
I hate having to share it with other people,

810
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,639
I'm sick and tired of the bland hospital food,

811
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,470
and this so-called rehab doesn't even seem to be helping.

812
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,439
I'll go home and be an outpatient or something.

813
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,379
Dad, you can't check out now.

814
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,610
You still need to be on your medication.

815
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,719
And if you leave now, you risk another cerebral haemorrhage.

816
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,149
I've already explained this to you.

817
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,049
It's my body, not yours.

818
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,590
I know my own body best.

819
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:00,630
That damn blocked artery of mine... It seems it's been cleared enough.

820
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:04,530
If I just take my medication, what's the difference if I'm home?

821
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:06,630
I've been here long enough.

822
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:09,400
This is all just a money-making scheme for the hospital.

823
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,070
Being stuck here is the perfect way to make someone depressed.

824
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,340
All right.

825
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,310
Let go! Let go!

826
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,230
The more I think about it, the more pissed off I get.

827
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:40,930
So what if he's her boyfriend?

828
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,829
Some shrivelled-up little punk who crawled out of the woodwork...

829
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:44,370
running his mouth off like that.

830
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,670
It'd be one thing if he were the father.

831
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:51,240
Just glaring with those big eyes...

832
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:57,220
All right.

833
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,420
So? Just because there's a goalie, it doesn't mean you can't score.

834
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:00,719
There's an outfielder,

835
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,890
but it doesn't mean a batter can't get on.

836
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,560
I'm Kim Jeong Sik.

837
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,190
What?

838
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,000
This little jerk...

839
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,070
Actually, can you take me to the hair salon instead of school?

840
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,000
The salon... You don't mean Juri's, do you?

841
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,740
Okay.

842
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:22,910
To Juri's we go!

843
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:32,550
You seem happy to see your old friend, Go Yeong Rye.

844
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:37,260
You know, looking back, those were surprisingly fun times.

845
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,030
Even though our manager in HR was a complete jerk...

846
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,699
Oh, by the way.

847
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,869
Did you hear all hell broke loose at Cheongah Bus after you quit?

848
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,670
The HR manager. He got into a really bad accident.

849
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:52,940
I'm telling you, we all thought he was a goner.

850
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:01,049
Guess the devil looks after his own. Maybe from the crap people gave him.

851
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,750
I transferred right after that, so I only heard about this later,

852
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,150
but apparently, because of the lingering effects,

853
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:09,789
he got fired from the company, then got fired from his next job.

854
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:11,889
And eventually, he just disappeared.

855
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,390
I'm not really interested.

856
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,460
Let's just drive in silence.

857
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:18,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

858
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:20,400
Right, you prefer it quiet.

859
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,820
All right, let's pick up the pace!

860
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:40,820
Get over there and clean that up! Gosh, this is so frustrating.

861
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,820
Come on, a little faster!

862
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:53,330
Hey, you.

863
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:56,330
We're slammed. What are you doing? Are you here on vacation?

864
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,940
Stop slacking off and get to work!

865
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,509
So damn annoying.

866
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:02,810
You want to be here all night?

867
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,980
Hurry up!

868
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,370
That wench.

869
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,600
You're smiling?

870
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,740
After dragging my life through the gutter like this?

871
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:34,629
- Welcome to Juri's Hair Salon. - Welcome to Juri's Hair Salon.

872
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,100
Oh, my gosh!

873
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:39,700
Jong Hee! You're here without an appointment?

874
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:44,670
Something came up, and I have an urgent favour to ask.

875
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:45,970
Me?

876
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,610
Do you think you can do it?

877
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:49,470
What is it?

878
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:01,089
Where are we going?

879
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,349
You said you needed a hairstylist for an event.

880
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:05,360
That was a lie, obviously.

881
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,030
There's somewhere we need to go.

882
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,390
Come on, let's go.

883
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:42,829
Wait a minute.

884
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:44,629
Wait, no. What's going on?

885
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:46,300
He was discharged?

886
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,470
Jae Pil.

887
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:48,999
- You're here? - Yes.

888
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,199
I just stopped by on my break,

889
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,099
and they told me you suddenly checked out.

890
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,209
What in the world? This is completely out of the blue.

891
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,470
So I rushed out,

892
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:58,909
but of course, I couldn't even catch a bus.

893
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:01,049
I was so close to falling back into my old ways...

894
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,910
and just grabbing a taxi.

895
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:04,979
But no, to earn back the money for that cab,

896
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,750
I'd have to sell who knows how many lotions door-to-door...

897
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,320
Wait a minute. That's not important right now.

898
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,759
So are you really okay to be out of the hospital?

899
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,760
No.

900
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,130
Dad was just being stubborn.

901
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:19,300
I'm not staying in the hospital anymore.

902
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:22,829
I'll just get outpatient care and take my medicine at home.

903
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:26,299
But still, once Sae Ri's at school, and I've gone to work,

904
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,639
there's no one home. What will you do all by yourself?

905
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:32,279
I'm booked solid with massage appointments just for today.

906
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,149
I have to head right back out.

907
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,950
What am I, a child? You think I can't be by myself?

908
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:40,249
You're treating me like I'm completely helpless.

909
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:42,290
You're not a child, but you are a patient.

910
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:46,019
Please, just stop being so ridiculously stubborn.

911
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,360
Dad, every time you act like this...

912
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:50,759
We honestly don't know what to do.

913
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,160
What did I do?

914
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,930
What have I done that's given you all such a hard time?

915
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:56,869
Okay, okay.

916
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:59,699
Then let's just take your medicine first.

917
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,109
Your lunchtime dose. You haven't taken it yet, have you?

918
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:04,139
Leave it. I'll take it on my own.

919
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:06,639
What do you mean, on your own? Just take it now while we're here.

920
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,549
I'm telling you, I have to leave right now.

921
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:10,619
Gosh, I said I'll take it on my own!

922
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,820
Why are you making such a big deal?

923
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:14,550
Dad, come on, please!

924
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:18,120
Please, get a grip already.

925
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:20,859
Because of your selfish actions,

926
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,789
have you ever thought about how much you're hurting the family?

927
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:24,129
Have you ever once stopped to think about that?

928
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:25,330
I...

929
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,230
Do you know why I took up boxing?

930
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:30,999
It was so I could become stronger than you and finally beat you.

931
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,170
Because!

932
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:35,510
Because I was weaker than you,

933
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,480
and that's why my mom...

934
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:50,150
What?

935
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,919
Dad, you're out of the hospital?

936
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,960
Sae Ri, you're home?

937
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:56,330
You're back?

938
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:58,860
Gosh.

939
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:02,270
It's been ages since we've all been together. It's awkward and nice.

940
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,170
Right?

941
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:05,570
Right, Dad?

942
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:28,990
So this is the place?

943
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:31,600
The place you said you wanted to come to with me?

944
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:33,630
Yes.

945
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:35,570
I've always wanted to come here.

946
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:38,840
Gosh.

947
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,770
How has it not changed at all in seven years?

948
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:45,140
It's amazing.

949
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,820
A date!

950
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:55,219
Gosh, you're blushing.

951
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:58,890
You're in love, you're in love!

952
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,220
Isn't this how it's done?

953
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,610
- I don't think so. - No, it is.

954
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,410
Started chewing again?

955
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,120
I thought Mom hated that.

956
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,450
Sometimes.

957
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:05,590
You can't spend your whole life just doing what Mom likes, can you?

958
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,730
Back when we used to hang out here,

959
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:12,630
what did we used to laugh about so much?

960
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:15,570
All I remember is us cracking up all the time.

961
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,970
We were just kids back then.

962
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,270
We were at that age where we'd laugh at anything.

963
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,320
You know, for the past seven years,

964
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:40,190
Whenever I was having a hard time, I had a few memories I held on to.

965
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,360
Going to school with you,

966
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,599
eating at your house, and time with Yeong Bae and Yeong Mi.

967
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,900
And...

968
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:55,040
the memories I had with Jae Pil.

969
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,050
Without those memories, I don't think I would've made it.

970
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:08,250
So...

971
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:11,360
I feel like I'm finally starting to get a little happy these days.

972
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,630
Even when things are tough with my mom,

973
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:17,300
I don't feel as lonely as I used to.

974
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,970
It feels like I finally have someone on my side.

975
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:32,380
You remember these, right?

976
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,810
The shoes Jae Pil gave me a long time ago.

977
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:40,550
I was wearing them the day I ran away.

978
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:44,290
They're the one thing I managed to save.

979
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:46,920
I couldn't grab anything else.

980
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:52,860
I've just kept them tucked away in a drawer,

981
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,740
but now I'm going to start wearing them again.

982
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,250
Starting today.

983
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:20,220
I tried so hard not to remember, but it all came flooding back.

984
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,400
How much I relied on you.

985
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,500
And how much I really, really liked Jae Pil.

986
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,080
He was my first love.

987
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,660
So anyway, Yeong Rye...

988
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,260
I want to give it another shot.

989
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,700
With Jae Pil.

990
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:07,200
You'll help me, right?

991
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:51,520
I do too.

992
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,760
He was...

993
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,000
my first love too.

994
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:07,200
Jae Pil.

995
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:13,570
He was?

996
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:17,110
Back then,

997
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:23,780
I couldn't show how I felt, so I had to watch from the sidelines.

998
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,150
And even though you're a friend I love...

999
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:32,490
No,

1000
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,660
I love you as much as my own family, but...

1001
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:39,660
Now...

1002
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,170
I don't want to hide how I feel anymore.

1003
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,840
I want to be honest.

1004
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:51,440
And I want to fight for him.

1005
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:55,910
So, Jong Hee,

1006
01:15:58,920 --> 01:15:59,920
I can't do it.

1007
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,490
I can't help you.

1008
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,660
Right.

1009
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,270
That's fair, I guess.

1010
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:25,510
Okay.

1011
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:32,450
So, what's important then...

1012
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:42,760
is what Jae Pil feels, isn't it?

1013
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:18,500
(A Hundred Memories)

1014
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:38,920
Jae Pil, make yourself clear.

1015
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,050
If you keep on hesitating, I'll just go for her.

1016
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,119
You had such a pretty girlfriend? all this time,

1017
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,359
It's not like that, man.

1018
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,689
But it's not like he's totally wrong.

1019
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:50,799
Hey, Jae Pil. You have that other girlfriend, right?

1020
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,829
And who's this?

1021
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:53,099
She's the woman I have feelings for.

1022
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,370
It's one-sided for now, but...

1023
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,570
All those moments when I felt like I wanted to die,

1024
01:17:57,770 --> 01:17:59,570
she was next to me,

1025
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:02,210
all the time.
