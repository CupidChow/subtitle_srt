Hey, lighten up.

12
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,900
We're here on a group date,

13
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,270
not at a funeral.

14
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,540
Right.

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,280
Let me borrow this.

16
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,960
There, you finally look alive.

17
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,900
Thanks.

I...

19
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,930
I feel like I'm going to be sick.

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,640
My heart's pounding so loud. Can you hear it?

21
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,370
Yes.

22
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,980
It's about to burst.

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,280
Here, chew on this.

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,150
It'll help you relax.

25
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,680
You know about mind over matter, right?

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,420

If I hadn't gone there with you,

43
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,820
what would have happened?

They say three coincidences make it fate.

45
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,900
What if I hadn't thought,

46
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,530
that maybe this person was my destiny,

47
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,800
clutched my racing heart,

48
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,970
and gotten my hopes up?

49
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,520
Alright, well...

50
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,890
I'll go first.

59
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Right?

60
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,750

I'm Seo Jong Hee.

73
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,779
It looks like we're all the same age,

74
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,819
so I'm dropping the formalities.

75
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,520
What? Okay.

76
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,950
Oh, she's fiery.

77
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,420
So instead of formalities, what should I drop? The bass?

78
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,330
That was a joke.

79
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,700

81
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,370
I just have to avoid her.

82
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,110
So, let's not waste any time. Why don't we pick partners?

83
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,510
Alright, gentlemen, please close your eyes.

84
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,519
Take an item and put it on the table.

85
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,549
Anything at all.

86
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,550
- Okay. - Okay.

87
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,460
Jae Pil, close your eyes.

88
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,290
Close them.

89
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,510
Okay, you can all open your eyes now.

90
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,220
- Pick one. - Oh, right.

91
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,360
These look good. Yes.

92
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,530
This is...

93
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,260
nice.

94
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,770
Jae Pil, you have to pick one too.

If I'd had any idea that an arrow of fate...

96
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,980
would end up grazing me that day...

97
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,750
and push me into an unexpected storm.

98
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,690
If I had only known...

99
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,490
If I had known,

100
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,560
I wonder how things would've turned out.

Bye.

104
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Right.

105
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,650
You know, your items are sort of...

106
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,250
the complete opposite of your images.

107
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,090
I figured the gum was yours,

108
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,320
and the fountain pen was yours,

109
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Why's that?

110
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,330
So, do I look like a troublemaker or something?

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,330
No.

112
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,330
That's not what I meant at all.

113
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,269
Hey, Jae Pil. Didn't you have something to tell me?

114
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,869
- You did, right? - What?

115
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,810
You did. You had to tell me something.

116
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,240
She scares me.

117
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,710
She's so intense. Just like my mom.

118
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,179
Didn't you say your ideal type was a woman like your mom?

119
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,750
You said she was resourceful and the best.

120
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,380
That's what I used to think.

121
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,690
But it turns out my mom beats up my dad.

123
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,559
Whatever. I'll just kill time and then bail.

124
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,759
You promised it would only be one hour.

125
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,530
Wait. Hold on.

127
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,400
I'll clean the gym this week. I'll do all of it.

- Sure. - Okay.

135
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,820
You're okay with it, right?

136
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,340
Are you feeling carsick again?

137
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,870
What? Yes.

138
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,080
Excuse me. I'm just going to open the window.

139
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,260

140
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,270
The roller rink is near Angang Market, so...

141
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,640
Do we need to transfer to Bus 100-1 at the next stop?

142
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,870
- I'll go ask the conductor. - No, the 100-1 doesn't go there.

143
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,369

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,209
then, it turns around.

149
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,079
It rests for five minutes and returns in reverse order,

150
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,149
heading back to the depot.

151
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,689
Gosh. You're amazing.

152
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,020
How did you memorize all that? It's not like you're the conductor.

153
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,229
Oh, she's...

154
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,459
Her hobby is memorizing bus routes. Isn't that right?

155
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,399
That's right.

156
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,069
I bet she can memorize anything she puts her mind to.

157
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,830
What else have you got memorized?

158
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,100
- Me? - Yes.

159
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,040
"The sounds of our nation's speech are different from those of China,"

160
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,380
"and so cannot be expressed by their letters."

161
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,810
"Because of this,"

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,209

Gosh. You're the best!

169
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,269
Guys, this is our stop. We have to get off here.

170
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,100
I think we have to transfer to Bus 99.

171
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,440
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

172
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,180
If you fall the wrong way,

173
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,010
you'll shatter your tailbone.

174
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,610
You'll be out for at least three weeks.

175
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,220
Thanks.

176
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,679
But...

177
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,919
But I'm fine.

178
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,220
Maybe it's because I like anchovies.

179
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,220
I have ridiculously strong bones.

180
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,190
Really?

181
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,430
But haven't we...

182
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,570
Haven't we met somewhere before?

183
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:53,980
No.

184
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,940
No.

185
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,810
No, I'm sure I've never seen you before.

186
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,750
I'm positive this is the first time we've met.

187
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,990
Hey, why so serious?

188
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,690
Your shoelace is untied.

189
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,660
What?

190
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,030
Yes.

191
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,840
Do you want me to just tie it for you?

192
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,930
All done.

193
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,070
Thanks.

194
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,050
Hey, don't you think I'm on a roll today?

195
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,820
I guess it's your first time at a roller rink.

196
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,220
Do you want me to give you some pointers?

197
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,950
No, that's okay.

198
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,090
I'll try it on my own.

199
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Okay.

200
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,260
But you have...

201
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,630
Thank you.

202
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,269
But where's Jong Hee?

203
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,370
My partner?

204
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,910
Over there.

205
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
She is flying solo.

206
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,140
Hey.

207
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,449
Hey, why aren't you guys skating?

208
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,450
Hey!

209
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,920
Are you trying out for the Olympics or something?

210
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,990
Haven't seen you guys around here before.

211
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,890
Let me guess...

212
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,490
Yeongsin Girls' High School?

213
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,990
Or...

214
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,460
- Hwaran? - I don't have to answer that.

215
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,100
And you're in the way, so move.

216
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,139
Why so feisty?

217
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,670
I can tell you're just our type.

218
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,409
Come on. Hang out with us.

219
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,610
Your type? As if.

220
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,310
Hey.

221
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,110
I said you're in the way, so get lost.

222
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,280
Darn.

223
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,350
Jong Hee!

224
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,620
My bad. Sorry.

225
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,789
See? You should've hung out with us. Why are you playing so hard to get?

226
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,860
Hey.

227
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,000
Here, play with this, you idiots.

228
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,370
Hey!

229
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,829
"Idiots?"

230
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,039
Did you just call us idiots?

231
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
Yes.

232
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,600
Do you want me to say it again?

233
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,269
Idiots.

234
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,710
- You've got a death wish. - Hey, you punks!

235
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,380
Eat this!

236
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,460
- What? - What was that?

237
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,140
- Hey. - Yes?

238
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,539
- Run! - What?

239
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,640
I said run.

240
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,840
Stop right there!

241
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,280
(Ddoddo Snack Bar)

242
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,419
- Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you.

243
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,190
- Take your time and eat up. - Thank you.

244
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,060
Her dumplings are the best. Nothing else even compares.

245
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,799
- Come on. Let's eat. - Okay.

246
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,700
Let's dig in. Go on, eat.

247
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,110
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

248
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,780
Even if it weren't for you, they would've picked a fight anyway.

249
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,180
They're just looking for trouble.

250
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,120
But...

251
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,920
You were so cool back there.

252
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,490
You threw that fire extinguisher like a grenade.

253
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,990
I don't even know how to use one of those.

254
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,930
I was interested in getting a fire safety manager certificate,

255
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,630
so I studied for it a bit.

256
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,630
A fire safety manager certificate?

257
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,570
What for?

258
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,440
Just, you know, just in case.

259
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,210
But the eligibility requirements were kind of complicated,

260
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,910
so I gave up halfway through.

261
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,480
You're so random.

262
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,180
Hey, you must've been starving.

263
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,349
Here, have this one.

264
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,680
No, it's okay. You have it.

265
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,220
It's fine. I was shaken up earlier. I don't have an appetite.

266
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,990
Have mine, too.

267
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,090
Well, we can't let it go to waste.

268
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,680
- Jong Hee. - Yes?

269
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,009
I think it's getting really late.

270
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,010
What?

271
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,880
Gosh. Look at the time.

272
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,790
Sorry, we'd better get going.

273
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,890
I had fun today.

274
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,670
- Hey, wait up! Hey! - Bye!

275
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,670
What?

276
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,980
They're just leaving like this?

277
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,909
No second date?

278
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,410
I didn't even get her home phone number.

279
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,380
Are you planning to ask them on another date?

280
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,020
I thought you said your date was scary.

281
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,819
I'm talking about your date, not mine.

282
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,050
Don't even think about it.

283
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,490
You aren't, right?

284
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,020
No.

285
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,290
Well...

286
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,630
She was actually kind of quirky and cute.

287
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,230
Yes, that's it exactly!

288
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,840
My ideal type is a quirky and cute girl.

289
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,880
(Cheongah Bus)

290
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,950
The housemother will be asleep soon.

291
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,519
Let's go in after lights out.

292
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,260
- Okay, let's do that. - Yes.

293
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,470
You're impossible.

294
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,680
I know you love it.

295
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,710
Let's see here.

296
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,290
My Ms. Kwon...

297
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,590
has such clear eyes,

298
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,220
like the sea shimmering in the moonlight.

299
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,930
Hae Ja, by any chance...

300
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,730
have you ever heard of the word "yoonseul?"

301
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,160
"Yoon Seul?"

302
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,000
Who is that girl?

303
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,000
Gosh. You're cute.

304
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,270
Yoonseul.

305
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,339
It's the shimmering of the sea in the moonlight.

306
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,310
That's how your eyes sparkle, Hae Ja.

307
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,680
Stop!

308
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,149
- I'll just pretend I don't know. - Be quiet.

309
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,619
What do you mean you'd rather...

310
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,980
Now, let's see that moonlight again.

311
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,929
Let's go.

312
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,670
Just a little longer.

313
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,209
Gosh. I don't know if this works.

314
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,640
It's just so old.

315
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,910
You have to last until the first snow.

316
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,280
Because I'm going to find you a man by then, one way or another.

317
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,490
Goodness. Let's hope so.

318
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,220
Anyway, what time is it now?

319
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,419
What's keeping the girls who went to school?

320
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,760
Gosh. That's true.

321
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,729
Hey, come over here. Come on.

322
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,759
Join us...

323
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,969
- with dying nails with balsam. - What took you girls so long?

324
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,630
Never mind that.

325
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,869
You might faint when you find out what we just saw.

326
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,509
You're going to faint.

327
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,139
- What? What did you see? - What? Tell us.

328
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,110
- What? - What did you see? What is it?

329
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,780
Hae Ja.

330
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,249
No, it's fine. Carry on.

331
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,420
Finish what you were reading.

332
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,420
Go on. Carry on.

333
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,660
What do you guys think you're doing?

334
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,990
Hae Ja must be tired. Why haven't you made her bed?

335
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,330
Hey, Youngest!

336
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,800
Ok Hui.

337
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,629
Do you think I'm helpless?

338
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,730
I can make my own bed.

339
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,070
Go on. Carry on.

340
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,710
Okay.

341
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,750
Your nails are going to look so pretty.

342
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,319
I'm sorry. Carry on with what you were doing.

343
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,420
Sorry.

344
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,860
What's up with her?

345
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,419
What's gotten into her?

346
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,429
Hey.

347
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,259
I should get my nails dyed too.

348
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,930
I'll pass.

349
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,140
(Room 3)

350
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,440
Do you want me to just tie it for you?

351
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,840
(Cheongah Bus)

352
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,720
Gosh. That cunning wench, Su Ryeon.

353
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,530
Look at her, giving Driver Kim those flirty eyes.

354
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,629
- A girl with no curves like her. - Here. Let me.

355
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,000
She wears her top so start, and she's throwing herself at him.

356
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,670
You mean tight, not start.

357
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,170
Whatever!

358
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,009
You keep a close eye on her for a while, you hear?

359
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,140
Especially...

360
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,079
If you catch her making a move on Driver Kim,

361
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,179
drop whatever you're doing and tell me right away. Got it?

362
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,180
Okay, I got it.

363
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,850
Salt. He's adding salt for her.

364
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,419
Goodness.

365
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,950
I don't think the lady got the water right today.

366
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,690
That jerk.

367
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,659
I don't know what she sees in that good-for-nothing playboy.

368
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,730
I just don't get it at all.

369
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,670
What do you mean? He's good-looking.

370
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,070
At Cheongah Bus, he's the most handsome of the bunch.

371
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,210
And he's such a smooth-talker.

372
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,539
Goodness.

373
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,379
As for me, those buttery guys...

374
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,080
You could give me a hundred of them, and I wouldn't even look twice.

375
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,710
Buttery guys aren't my type either.

376
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,720
What about you, Yeong Rye?

377
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,790
What?

378
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,220
What?

379
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,330
I prefer margarine to butter.

380
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,429
What is she talking about?

381
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,030
I think she's still half-asleep.

382
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,540
Not butter, she needs to be battered.

383
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,440
Gosh.

384
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,880
Ms. Cha, are you riding with me today?

385
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,550
I really hit the jackpot.

386
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,290
How so?

387
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,090
You're the cutest girl at Cheongah Bus.

388
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,990
You know...

389
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,600
Now that I'm seeing you up close,

390
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,800
you have such clear eyes.

391
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,970
Ms. Cha, by any chance...

392
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,810
have you ever heard of the word "yoonseul?"

393
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,240
What's that?

394
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,510
It's the sparkle on the sea at night from the moonlight.

395
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,920
They glitter just like that.

396
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,989
This can't be happening.

397
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,090
Driver Kim is Hae Ja's man.

398
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,730
Your future boyfriend is one lucky guy.

399
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,070
To have those eyes looking only at him.

400
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,480
Seriously, this is not okay. This is Driver Kim.

401
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,680
When's the last bus run for today?

402
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,220
Do you want to go catch a late-night movie?

403
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,720
(Giant Boxing Gym)

404
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,259
Gosh.

405
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,360
(Giant Boxing Gym)

406
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,100
Coach!

407
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,480
I try to save money on the sign, and this is what I get.

408
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,720
What a mess.

409
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,490
Now the hospital bill is going to cost more than the repair.

410
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,490
You're lucky it wasn't worse.

411
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,189
What if you'd hit your head?

412
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,289
Exactly.

413
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,030
But you're pinching pennies in all the wrong places.

414
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,060
Coach, you're really not cut out for business.

415
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,729
You think too small.

416
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,100
What was that, punk?

417
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Hey!

418
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,170
Do you think I'd be doing this if I had a choice?

419
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,849
Membership at this gym is down. This month,

420
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,420
it looks like I can't even make rent.

421
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,450
In this situation, how can I pay for the sign repairs?

422
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,660
What's with the sad puppy eyes?

423
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,189
You don't have to look at me like that.

424
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,229
Business has its ups and downs. That's all.

425
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,370
Besides, I already ordered some promotional flyers.

426
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,969
We'll hand those out first and see what happens.

427
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,870
If that doesn't work either...

428
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,640
Goodness. I'll just close up shop!

429
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,249
I'll just get a manual labor job...

430
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,550
and provide for my wife and kids. That's it.

431
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,380
- Coach! - What?

432
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,089
Are flyers really going to cut it?

433
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,860
If you're going to do something, you might as well go big.

434
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:47,030
I have a great idea.

435
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,360
What kind of idea?

436
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,900
We hold an exhibition match.

437
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,640
A mini-tournament hosted by Giant Gym.

438
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,969
We'll invite everyone we know,

439
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,669
promote it at local schools and on the street,

440
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,969
and after we draw a crowd, we put on a show for them.

441
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,280
Once we show them how fun and rewarding boxing is,

442
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,950
people are going to be hooked.

443
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,350
What do you think?

444
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,020
Well?

445
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,090
- Hey. - Yes?

446
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,670
So?

447
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,510
What are you up to?

448
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,980
What am I up to?

449
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,950
What are you talking about?

450
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,549
Of course, I'm up to something.

451
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,720
I'm going to invite Yeong Rye to the event.

452
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,820
Okay, sure. And then?

453
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,719
We fight. I win.

454
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,390
- You want me to lose to you? - Yes.

455
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,430
Move.

456
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,230
Hey.

457
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,799
We're in different leagues,

458
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,829
not to mention different weight classes.

459
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,369
That's the whole point.

460
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,869
The match begins, and here I am, not in your league,

461
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,200
scoring a KO.

462
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,239
If you were a girl, tell me you wouldn't fall for me.

463
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,809
And why would I do that?

464
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,979
Come on. Stop playing dumb.

465
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,750
That's throwing a fight.

466
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,249
It's completely against the spirit of sportsmanship.

467
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,919
Hey, it's not even an official match.

468
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,250
Look, for the first time in...

469
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,360
As pathetic as it is, it's my first time...

470
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,989
Anyway!

471
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,590
Your friend is trying to get a girlfriend.

472
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,830
I racked my lame brain for this one opportunity,

473
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,999
and you won't even make this sacrifice?

474
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,930
- Yes. - Is our friendship worth so little?

475
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,269
- Is it this shallow? - Yes.

476
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,900
This is about it, and I'm perfectly fine with that.

477
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,579
Don't you even think about trying to beg me.

478
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,340
Come on, Jae Pil!

479
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,320
He's so handsome.

480
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,950
Hi.

481
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,889
Hi.

482
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,260
He's so handsome!

483
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,530
- Hi. - Hi.

484
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,600
There's a handsome guy over here!

485
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,400
Do we really have to go this far? I'm leaving.

486
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,040
Hey.

487
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,269
I know I have a thick skin, but come on.

488
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,040
I can't do this alone, not in front of a girls' high school.

489
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,209
Even for two of us, this is impossible.

490
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,409
All right.

491
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,509
- Just 30 minutes. - Let go. All right, fine.

492
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,709
- It's embarrassing. Okay. - Just 30 minutes.

493
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,880
What do you have in there?

494
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Hi.

495
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,450
- I guess she's from this school. - I saw her before.

496
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,790
What?

497
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,960
Those faces look awfully familiar.

498
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,630
- Hey, what's keeping you? - It's just...

499
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,170
They're the guys from yesterday, right?

500
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,470
- What are they doing here? - Please.

501
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,240
Darn it.

502
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,510
Let's go.

503
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,680
Wait.

504
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,950
Don't all the students usually get out at the same time?

505
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,990
Did you forget?

506
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,119
They think we're day students, remember?

507
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,250
Right.

508
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,789
Everyone else is coming out in their uniforms.

509
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,390
And you want everyone to see us as the only ones in regular clothes?

510
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,459
I guess they left already. What do we do?

511
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,870
What do you expect me to do about it?

512
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,770
What?

513
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,850
- A boxing gym event? - A boxing gym event?

514
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,020
Yes. They really wanted you to come and insisted I give you this.

515
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,090
You have no idea how many times they said "insist."

516
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,959
It seems they're totally smitten with you guys.

517
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Really?

518
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,400
I don't think I even said two words with my partner.

519
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,630
Really?

520
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,370
Then it must be Yeong Rye he likes.

521
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,839
What do you mean?

522
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,300
The handsome one.

523
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,510
He must be the one with a crush on Yeong Rye.

524
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,109
No wonder.

525
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,579
He came all the way here and didn't say a thing.

526
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,350
His friend was the one doing all the talking.

527
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,050
You know how a doctor can't treat himself.

528
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,149
I'm sure it's not like that.

529
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,719
I don't know. It sure looks that way to me.

530
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,589
Gosh. You work fast, Go Yeong Rye.

531
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,990
No, that's not it.

532
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,660
We'll be late for class. Let's go. Hurry.

533
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,230
It's love!

534
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,400
You're beet red.

535
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,170
Today, we're going to learn about the definite article.

536
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,939
All right. Definite article.

537
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,839
Now, the word "definite" has the same roots as "define,"

538
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,509
meaning to point out a specific noun.

539
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,049
It's like putting a spotlight on the word...

540
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,380
to show exactly which one you're talking about.

541
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,560
"I have a cat."

542
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,200
"The cat is clever."

543
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,529
Now, "a cat" in the first sentence is the indefinite article.

544
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,969
It's just one cat out of many, right?

545
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,710
But when we mention that cat again, it becomes "the cat."

546
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,769
It means, "The cat is clever."

547
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,280
So, within a single sentence or a conversation,

548
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,279
when the same noun comes up again, you use "the" in front of it...

549
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,249
to make that noun specific...

550
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,690
What's on your mind? Are you thinking of Han Jae Pil?

551
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,290
Alright, next sentence.

552
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,830
"London is the capital of England."

553
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,429
So where is London?

554
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,059
It is the capital of England.

555
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,399
- Focus on the lesson. - "The capital of England" means...

556
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,670
the same thing, right?

557
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,700
Okay, next.

558
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,640
"I have been to the store."

559
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,140
"I have..."

560
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,250
I told you to take it easy for the rest of the week.

561
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,309
Honestly, who can stop you when you're this stubborn, Mom?

562
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,950
I'm fine.

563
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,020
You think money just falls into your lap?

564
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,520
I have to work to make a living.

565
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,890
I'll take it slow and pace myself.

566
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,730
If customers come and I'm not here, they'll just go somewhere else.

567
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,929
But still...

568
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,060
Give it a rest already.

569
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,700
I'm already all set up.

570
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,770
But in return, Ms. Park, you have to keep your promise.

571
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,439
Just three hours, okay?

572
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,699
Fine. I wouldn't work longer even if you asked me to.

573
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,770
Go on, now. You said you have a lot to study.

574
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,410
He's the one who needs to study.

575
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,809
What about you?

576
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,980
That's a given for me.

577
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,879
Yeong Bae. Do you know how to read a clock?

578
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
Yes.

579
00:34:14,881 --> 00:34:17,179
When this hand goes around three times and gets back to here,

580
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,520
tell Mom it's time to go.

581
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,490
If she insists on staying, tell her you're going to tell me.

582
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,559
You know what I mean, right?

583
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,929
Okay. I got it.

584
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,690
For crying out loud, I get it. Stop it already.

585
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,990
Just get the kids on the ride.

586
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,799
- Hurry up. - Yes, ma'am.

587
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,129
- Yeong Mi, which one do you want? - The white one.

588
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,500
The white one? You got it.

589
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,770
- Are you all set? - Yes.

590
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,840
I take a few days off,

591
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,280
and there's not a single soul in sight.

592
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,510
Gosh. Darn it all.

593
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,320
At this rate, I won't make a single sale today.

594
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,320
Oh, gosh.

595
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,330
Look. Mom, I want to try that ride.

596
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,990
- What? - That one.

597
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,570
- It does look like fun. - Right?

598
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,870
But you can't.

599
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,240
What if you get on and lose balance and fall off?

600
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,170
The horse looks a bit sketchy, too.

601
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,710
No way. Absolutely not.

602
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,979
But that looks so delicious.

603
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,749
- Right? - I do want to try the bbobki.

604
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,190
- Right? - Yes.

605
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,290
- Gosh. But I shouldn't. - Eat this.

606
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,529
No, I can't.

607
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,929
We already had cake for dessert.

608
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,629
I've had way too much sugar today.

609
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,630
It's delicious.

610
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,070
Driver Son. Let's get going, please.

611
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,869
Don't you have to get to the office later?

612
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,939
It looks like you're all settled,

613
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,969
- so I'll head out. - I want one!

614
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,169
Okay.

615
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,539
No way!

616
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,309
- Why? - Because I said so!

617
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,740
But they get to ride it!

618
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,880
For goodness' sake.

619
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,550
What was that for? Why did they even bother looking?

620
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,590
I got all excited for nothing. Darn it.

621
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,220
Oh, no. It's all burnt.

622
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,490
Darn it. I hope they get a flat tire.

623
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,660
What am I going to do with this?

624
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,570
The cassette ran all the way through.

625
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,970
I should go.

626
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,469
Well, look who it is.

627
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,940
- You're here? - Hi.

628
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,340
Oh, my gosh.

629
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:25,249
Goodness gracious.

630
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,980
It's only been a few days, but you look completely worn out.

631
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,849
Are you okay to be out and about?

632
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,820
Well, what choice do I have?

633
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,359
When you've got mouths to feed like a bunch of baby birds,

634
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,189
I have to be okay even when I'm not.

635
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,390
But business has been really slow.

636
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,330
I haven't even made my first sale of the day.

637
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:45,300
In that case, could you help me out during lunch the day after tomorrow?

638
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,540
I suddenly got a reservation for a large party,

639
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,240
and I'm short-handed.

640
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,439
So I came out here on the off chance I'd find you.

641
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,970
I'll make it worth your while.

642
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,080
- "Worth my while?" - Sure.

643
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,849
How much are we talking?

644
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,550
Very generously! Gosh.

645
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,380
Come on. Work with me.

646
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,290
(Cheongah Bus)

647
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,170
Get up.

648
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,320
Get ready. Start.

649
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,189
- One, two, three, four, - Stop nodding off and focus.

650
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,299
- That's it. - five, six, seven, eight.

651
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,300
Two, two, three, four,

652
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,440
- five, six, seven, eight. - Snap out of it.

653
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,409
One, two, three, four,

654
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,340
five, six, seven, eight.

655
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,080
Two, two, three, four,

656
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,249
five, six, seven. One more time.

657
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,879
One, two, three, four,

658
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,689
- five, six, seven, eight. - You're going today, right?

659
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,259
- Two, two, three, four, - What?

660
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,819
- five, six, seven, eight. - The boxing gym.

661
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,060
Let's check it out. I think it'll be fun.

662
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,800
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

663
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,769
- Two, two, three, four, - What? We'll see.

664
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,739
Five, six, seven. One more time.

665
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,740
One, two, three, four...

666
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,480
You don't have to go to all this trouble.

667
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,610
It's not like I'm going on a date.

668
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,920
What? I thought you said he invited you.

669
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,979
Then it's basically a date.

670
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,449
All right now, let's just sweep your hair back a little like this.

671
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,089
We have to hurry before my next bus route.

672
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,690
- Let me see. - I think the pink one looks better.

673
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,659
Don't her eyelashes look a little too droopy?

674
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,299
Where? Let me see.

675
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,859
Oh, my. They really are droopy.

676
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,730
Yes. Now that you mention it, I guess they kind of do.

677
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Oh, gosh.

678
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,740
What's that?

679
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
Do...

680
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,420
your eyes like this.

681
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,650
Yes, like this.

682
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,489
That's it.

683
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,189
This is scary.

684
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,059
It feels like you're branding me with a hot iron.

685
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,699
Just do it, and you'll be like Sophie Marceau.

686
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,669
If it doesn't work, I'll eat my hat. Okay?

687
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,800
Ta-da!

688
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,270
Oh, my!

689
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,199
You could enter a Miss Korea pageant just like that.

690
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,640
Oh, my gosh. She really could.

691
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,209
Lovely.

692
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,740
So pretty.

693
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,420
What is this?

694
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,120
I don't think this looks good on me.

695
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,030
Lovely.

696
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,630
(Giant Boxing Tournament)

697
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,699
- Hi! - Welcome.

698
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,170
Come on in.

699
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,970
(Giant)

700
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,810
Welcome!

701
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,339
- Coach. - Hello.

702
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,050
- Enjoy the match. - Thanks.

703
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,319
Ma'am, please enjoy the match.

704
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,219
Yes, this way! Over here!

705
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,389
- This is going to be so much fun. - He looks sharp.

706
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,889
Okay!

707
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,689
- Ma'am, I hope you enjoy. - Thanks.

708
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,860
- Thank you. - Thank you.

709
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,790
Wait.

710
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,730
I'll throw a jab first.

711
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,400
And then hit you with an uppercut!

712
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,439
When you get KO'd, you have to really sell it.

713
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,769
Give me a bigger reaction.

714
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,040
Why are you such a bad actor?

715
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,780
Hey, she's here.

716
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,550
Over here!

717
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,219
Hi.

718
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,190
- We keep running into each other. - Hey.

719
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,520
Thanks for coming.

720
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,130
I almost didn't recognize you out of your uniform.

721
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,130
Well, these are just my regular clothes.

722
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,730
Does it look weird?

723
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,139
No, you look beautiful.

724
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,609
You could give Sophie Marceau a run for her money.

725
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,110
I guess I can eat my words now?

726
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,950
- Hi. - Hi.

727
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,710
Hi.

728
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,590
- Should we head in? - Yes. Let's go in.

729
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,819
- Let's go. - Okay.

730
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,460
It might look a little run-down out here,

731
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,860
but it's really nice inside.

732
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,160
Yes.

733
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,259
- Did you have trouble getting here? - No, not really.

734
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,660
- Have you eaten? - Yes.

735
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,730
Good. Hope you enjoy the match.

736
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,270
(Giant Boxing Gym)

737
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,310
They're our seniors.

738
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,880
Yeong Rye, come on in.

739
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,150
So this is our gym.

740
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,689
And this is our head coach.

741
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,019
- Hello. - Hello.

742
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,160
What are we going to do?

743
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,619
Jin Tae couldn't make it. He has a bad case of indigestion.

744
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,090
I knew it when he was wolfing down that undercooked meat yesterday.

745
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,899
I told him to cut it out. That little punk. Darn it.

746
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,529
So what are we supposed to do about Jintae and Sang Un's match?

747
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,169
Well, I guess we don't have a choice.

748
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,540
For now, in a pinch, we'll match them by weight class...

749
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,140
and change the matchups.

750
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,570
Right. We have to change the matchups.

751
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,380
You're changing the matchups?

752
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,950
All right then. Starting now,

753
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:44,819
the first-ever match at Giant Boxing Gym.

754
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,090
Let's get it started! A round of applause!

755
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,700
All right. Let's introduce our fighters.

756
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,900
First up.

757
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,270
In the Red Corner!

758
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:01,439
From our very own Giant Boxing Gym,

759
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,840
the heartthrob,

760
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,150
Ma Sang Cheol!

761
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,020
You look awesome! Let's go!

762
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,330
All right. And next up is the Blue Corner!

763
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:26,529
Also from our Giant Boxing Gym,

764
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,070
our headliner,

765
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:33,840
Jang Deok Gu!

766
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,320
(Giant)

767
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,790
That one landed clean!

768
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,140
Stop it!

769
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,250
What was that?

770
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,270
Stop it.

771
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,270
Stop it.

772
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,020
Don't, please.

(Hospital Prescription Dispensing)

774
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,120
Wait!

775
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,159
Excuse me. Ointment...

776
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,330
He has a cut above his eye.

777
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,430
Could I get some ointment to put on it?

778
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,630
Yes, come on in.

779
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,700
Thank you.

780
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:41,510
Are you okay?

781
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:43,980
Why wouldn't I be?

782
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:46,720
As you can see.

783
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:51,390
Why did you do that?

784
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,530
Why did you do that?

785
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:01,130
Back there.

786
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:07,470
I was scared.

787
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,850
I thought you were going to die.

788
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,050
I was so scared.

789
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,540
(Giant Boxing Gym)

790
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,880
Jong Hee.

791
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,920
- Come on. We're late. - What?

792
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,880
I was a bit over the top back there, wasn't I?

793
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,410
No.

794
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,480
Over the top? No way.

795
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,680
So...

796
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,390
Why did you do it?

797
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,030
No reason.

798
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,060
"No reason?"

799
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,070
Maybe seeing the blood got me all worked up?

800
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,600
I mean, I usually...

801
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,340
tend to freak out when I see blood.

802
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,940
Oh, really?

803
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,210
Yes.

804
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,709
Yes, I've got something like that too.

805
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:58,249
For me, it's thin and long things, like earthworms and snakes.

806
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,390
I can't stand them.

807
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,050
- Really? - Yes.

808
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,120
I think they're kind of cute.

809
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,320
What?

810
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,030
Still...

811
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,530
I totally overreacted.

812
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,470
I made a total scene at someone else's match, right?

813
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,540
No, it's fine.

814
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,140
Hey, it happens.

815
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,340
Let's go.

816
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,549
Oh, my.

817
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,490
Gosh. This is gorgeous.

818
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,790
It's so pretty, isn't it?

819
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,030
Hae Ja. Here's your soda.

820
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,470
Sorry I'm so late.

821
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,900
Yes, you're late.

822
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,240
What took you so long? Did you make it from scratch?

823
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,539
The vending machine was acting up.

824
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,809
I put my money in, but it wouldn't come out,

825
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:03,750
so I had to kick it a few times and make a huge scene to finally get it.

826
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:06,990
Go on. Drink up.

827
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,590
You drink it yourself, you backstabber!

828
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,830
Hae Ja. What's wrong?

829
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,130
"Backstabber?"

830
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,970
Don't play innocent with me.

831
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,510
You...

832
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,280
I heard you saw a late-night movie with Driver Kim last night.

833
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,380
Jae Sook from next door said she saw you.

834
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,180
She said you two looked awfully cozy.

835
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,150
You just came from seeing Driver Kim, didn't you?

836
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,920
Right?

837
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:44,990
Hae Ja.

838
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,800
How long has this been going on?

839
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:54,969
How long have you been hitting on Driver Kim?

840
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:56,639
And to think I never saw what was right under my nose.

841
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,999
And I treated you like a sister, you sneaky little wench.

842
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,839
Hae Ja, let me go. We can talk about this.

843
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,240
Please.

844
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,010
Fine.

845
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,450
- Let's talk it out. - Yes.

846
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:12,150
Nice and slow.

847
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:14,220
Explain yourself from the very beginning.

848
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,959
You really thought that would work, you backstabbing wench!

849
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,089
How could you do this to me?

850
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,429
- Goodness. Someone stop them. - Mom!

851
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:25,060
- I can't! - You backstabbing wench!

852
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,499
That's it! It's you or me today!

853
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,199
Today's your funeral.

854
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,869
- What's going on? - You evil wench!

855
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,469
This is your last day, you hear? It's you or me today!

856
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:36,039
What's gotten into you? Hae Ja. What's going on?

857
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,679
Koh Yeong Rye. Get out of the way. She's not even human.

858
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,849
No! Please, calm down.

859
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:43,550
- I told you to get out of the way! - Don't get so worked up...

860
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,020
You!

861
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,349
Enough! Stop it!

862
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:49,519
Enough.

863
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,560
What do you think you're doing?

864
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,090
It's you or me today! Darn it!

00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:06,770
It's been a while. Should we have a drink at Daepo Pub?

867
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:09,880
While everyone else is working late.

868
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,990
That young lady's such a flirt

869
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,500
She has a flirty temper

870

That old guy is such a sneak

871
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,140
He is a sneaky temper

I've got to work all night to earn money

873
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:44,480
- I've got to... - Excuse me.

874
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,380
You're needed in Room Three right away.

875
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:49,850
Room Three? Why?

876
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,120
- Why? What's going on? - Hurry.

877
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:54,790
What is this?

878
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,019
- Hey! - Hey!

00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,930
Stop!

883
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,379
Place them carefully. Okay?

884
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,820
This isn't a field trip. This is your punishment.

885
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,960
If I see a single rat later, just you wait.

886
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,190
I'll string you all up on these glue traps myself.

887
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,630
Why are we stuck with this mess because of them?

888

Carrying around mouse traps in the middle of the night.

889
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:44,469
Tell me about it.

890
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:47,439
Anyway, I just don't get it.

891
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,139
Traditionally, with men, you know?

892
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:52,079
You don't want some pretty boy.

893
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,710
A real stud is what's best.

894
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,010
Am I right?

895
00:55:55,011 --> 00:55:58,080
Why do you think the manor's lady always fed the stable boy so well?

896
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,449
Because he had a big appetite?

897
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,120
Of course not, you baby.

898
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,989
A man...

899
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:08,289
needs his stamina for the watermill,

900
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,199
sneaking around where he shouldn't be.

901
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,260
Do I hear some rats squeaking?

902
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,899
A mouse!

903
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,600

Where is it?

00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:28,180
You got it!

907
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,020
You got it.

908
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,349
Let's go.

909
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,389
No, it didn't go in.

910
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,390
I'm home.

911
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,720
- You're home. - Jae Pil!

912
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,960
Wait a second.

913
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,299
Hold on. Oh, my gosh.

914
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,500
What happened to your eye?

915
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,369
- Are you hurt? - It's nothing.

916
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,039
What do you mean it's nothing? Let me see.

917
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,210
Oh, my gosh. What should we do? Look at your handsome face!

918
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,739
Stay here. We should at least put some ointment on it.

919
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,810
No, I'm...

920
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,550
Jae Pil.

921
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,980
Did Dad yell at you again?

922
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,150
No, it's nothing like that.

923
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,490
Let me take a look.

924
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,220
Let me see.

925
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:11,790
I'll just...

926
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,330
Okay, sure.

927
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,360
Oh, no.

928
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,730
- Thanks. - Of course.

929
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,510
I squeezed out way too much.

930
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:37,750
Jae Pil! Let me patch you up!

931
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,690
Will you now, Doctor?

932
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:44,590
Here you go.

933
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,430
All right.

934
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,100
So, where does it hurt?

935
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,970
Is it your eye?

936
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:57,670
Yes, I've got a cut right here, Doctor.

937
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,100
It hurts so much.

938
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:00,870
One moment.

939
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:10,320
Doctor.

940
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,419
The cut is above my eye. Why do you need that?

941
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,390
It's standard procedure.

942
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,190
Hold still, will you?

943
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,860
My apologies.

944
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:25,900
Stop it!

945
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,070
Don't, please.

946
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,280
Jae Pil.

947
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,180
Your heart is beating way too fast.

948
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,120
I was scared.

949
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,790
I thought you were going to die.

950
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,730
I was so scared.

951
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,000
Now it's beating even faster.

952
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:01,030
Faster.

953
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,800
Faster.

954
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,500
Faster.

955
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,520
- Take care now. - Thank you.

956
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,630
- Aren't you leaving right away? - No.

957
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,129
The engine kept stalling, so I sent it in for repairs.

958
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,970
They said it'll take 2 or 3 hours.

959
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:38,639
Lucky you. You get a break, then.

960
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,840
Take it easy.

961
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,290
(Wonhwa Jaeil Pharmacy)

962
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:01,790
Did he put some ointment on that?

963
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:05,530
It could leave a scar.

964
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,319
Right.

965
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,490
What's the harm in giving it to him?

966
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:36,330
I'll just say I passed a pharmacy and picked it up.

967
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,629
I'm going to work out.

968
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:40,730
To the boxing gym?

969
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,169
You should take today off.

970
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:45,940
We have to go to the company's anniversary field day later.

971
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,209
It's tradition for the whole family to go together.

972
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:51,079
It'll be awkward if you don't show up.

973
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,210
I'll be back soon.

974
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:54,310
What's the point?

975
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,580
We have to leave soon.

976
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,920
What's going to happen if you miss boxing for one day?

977
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,650
I wish you'd put that much effort into your studies.

978
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:01,390
Until you're glued to your chair.

979
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,820
Especially with a brilliant mind like yours.

980
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,920
I'll be back.

981
01:01:04,921 --> 01:01:05,959
If you're not back,

982
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,390
we'll go ahead and I'll send Driver Son for you.

983
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,960
Okay. Hurry back.

984
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:27,010
Hey.

985
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,080
Your arm is going to fall off.

986
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,650
Why are you trying so hard? It's just a warm-up.

987
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,150
Are you upset about something?

988
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,760
- Hey. - What?

989
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,760
Never mind.

990
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,470
Hey, listen...

991
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,170
It's just...

992
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:54,870
What is it?

993
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,050
Are you really not going to tell me?

994
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:02,979
Let's grab a bowl of udon, and I'll hear you out.

995
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,949
I told you, I have to wash up and go right away.

996
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,319
I don't even have time to wash my hair.

997
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,889
If I'm any later, my dad will kill me.

998
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,889
Before your dad has the chance to kill you,

999
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:11,760
I'm the one who wants to kill you.

1000
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,560
No.

1001
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,700
I can't.

1002
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,580
Excuse me. Oh, no.

1003
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,080
Mom?

1004
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:39,650
I'm home.

1005
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:42,590
- Yeong Rye. - Yeong Mi.

1006
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,360
Were you eating?

1007
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,520
Yes, but I really hate beans.

1008
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:48,090
But it's nothing but beans.

1009
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:50,260
You need to eat your beans.

1010
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,200
They're so good for you.

1011
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,170
Anyway, where's Mom?

1012
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:58,569
It's not even time for her to go to work.

1013
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:01,269
She's at the Mokpo Lady's restaurant.

1014
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:02,770
The Mokpo Lady's restaurant?

1015
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:04,680
Why would she be there?

1016
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,749
It looks like it's going to rain all day.

1017
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,690
At least it started after the rush, so what's the big deal?

1018
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,249
You'll be rich in no time at this rate.

1019
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,459
I would've been in big trouble without you.

1020
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,690
- Thanks, I really mean it. - Don't be silly.

1021
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,539
- Mom! - What are you doing here?

1022
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,540
Mom.

1023
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:40,879
What do you think you're doing here?

1024
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,349
You can barely manage your own shop, let alone work at a restaurant.

1025
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:47,149
Keep your voice down. Were you raised in a barn?

1026
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:48,549
For crying out loud.

1027
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:51,560
Why are you causing a scene in someone else's place of business?

1028
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,189
Mom.

1029
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:54,559
Stop being so dramatic.

1030
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,329
I'm not cut out for sitting around.

1031
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:58,800
I get antsy if I just stay home.

1032
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,540
All I ever wanted was a little rest. I had a few days off. That's enough.

1033
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,339
I'm fine. You should get going.

1034
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,510
- Here. Let me get that. - Go. I've got it.

1035
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,909
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

1036
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:14,109
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

1037
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:15,980
Why wouldn't I be okay?

1038
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:19,049
Mom!

1039
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:20,349
Mom, are you okay?

1040
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:21,950
What's happening? What's going on?

1041
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,100
Taxi!

1042
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,039
Mom, you have to stay with me.

1043
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,210
Mom, you can't pass out. Okay?

1044
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:50,420
Mom, can you hear me?

1045
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,720
Taxi!

1046
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,820
Mom!

1047
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:05,230
What's going on?

1048
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:08,330
My mom...

1049
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:10,370
My mom is...

1050
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:11,570
Get in, quick.

1051
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,500
Sir, please hurry. Please, can you go a little faster?

1052
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:48,210
Okay.

1053
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:58,820
(Wonhwa Jaeil Hospital)

1054
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,990
(Operating Room)

1055
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:35,620
Try not to worry too much.

1056
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,060
She's going to be okay.

1057
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,730
Don't you have somewhere to be?

1058
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,900
Are you sure you can stay here?

1059
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,170
Doctor, how is she?

1060
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,640
Is my mom going to be okay?

1061
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,749
Yes, the surgery went well, but...

1062
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,720
Has she, by any chance, had a fall or anything like that recently?

1063
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:09,090
A little while ago, she rolled down a hill.

1064
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:10,960
And she was injured.

1065
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,160
I see.

1066
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:15,460
She should have come to the hospital for an examination back then.

1067
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,859
The minor internal bleeding she had at the time...

1068
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:19,660
seems to have developed into peritonitis.

1069
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,729
The fact that the pain flared up, letting her get surgery quickly...

1070
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:23,840
was a real stroke of luck.

1071
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:28,040
Thank you.

1072
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:32,340
What a relief.

1073
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:37,520
What a relief.

1074
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,100
But why am I crying?

1075
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,830
I...

1076
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,940
I shouldn't be crying.

1077
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:06,480
My siblings will be here soon.

1078
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,120
If they see me crying,

1079
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:14,990
they'll get worried.

1080
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:18,860
Sorry.

1081
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:36,040
It's okay to cry now.

1082
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,900
Jong Hee.

1083
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:11,400
It was three times.

1084
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,440
Not just once or twice.

1085
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,220
How's your mom?

1086
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,760
She's doing okay.

1087
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,630
She woke up for a second, then fell back asleep.

1088
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:36,660
That's a relief.

1089
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,930
It really is.

1090
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:44,170
After bumping into him by chance three separate times,

1091
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,800
I figured it had to be fate.

1092
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,340
I guess I wanted to believe it might be destiny.

1093
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,880
After all, I've always dreamed of a love that's meant to be.

1094
01:10:58,850 --> 01:10:59,950
Thank you...

1095
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,850
Thank you so much for everything today.

1096
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,689
I know this drink is nowhere near enough,

1097
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:09,790
but it's all I have on me right now.

1098
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:11,730
Don't worry about it. This is plenty.

1099
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,280
So...

1100
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:29,650
don't you really have to get going?

1101
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:31,020
It's fine.

1102
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,350
It's my dad's company anniversary field day, but...

1103
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,260
Honestly, I didn't really want to go anyway.

1104
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:43,260
I feel terrible. It's all my fault.

1105
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,100
You know...

1106
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,140
Your friend.

1107
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,710
- Jong Hee? - Yes.

1108
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,739
Do you two live in the same neighborhood?

1109
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:00,750
Yes.

1110
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,379
Something like that.

1111
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:04,880
I see.

1112
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:10,120
You two seemed really close.

1113
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:12,420
Yes, we are.

1114
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,250
All right, then.

1115
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:41,050
I'll be on my way.

1116
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,350
Thanks for the drink.

1117
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:49,030
And so for a moment, I got my hopes up.

1118
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:55,300
And so I tried to work up the courage I didn't think I had.

1119
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,010
- Hey. - Hey.

1120
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:07,650
- You first. - No, it's fine.

1121
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:10,920
You go ahead.

1122
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:20,020
If only I hadn't insisted he go first that day...

1123
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:24,960
If only I had handed him the medicine...

1124
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,400
that carried my feelings for him first...

1125
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:36,470
So...

1126
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:38,740
Yes?

1127
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,750
Wait.

1128
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:46,820
Sir, hold on a minute.

1129
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,390
Here.

1130
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:36,530
Could you give this to Seo Jong Hee for me?

1131
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:58,220
Would our story...

1132
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:02,390
have turned out a little differently?

1133
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,400
Do you think it would have, Jong Hee?

1134
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:10,640
My dearest friend.

1135
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:23,050
(A Hundred Memories)

1136
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,169
Jae Pil. Now that I know it's too late,

1137
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:44,239
I find myself missing her even more.

1138
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,939
If it's that bad, why don't you visit her in the hospital?

1139
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:46,940
Hi.

1140
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:48,709
Hey.

1141
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,039
About that note from the other day...

1142
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,010
It got to her, right?

1143
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,180
What about you? I thought you were into him.

1144
01:15:56,380 --> 01:16:00,149
No, I thought he was the one who was into me.

1145
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:01,389
I'm not interested in dating.

1146
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:04,319
Besides, he knows nothing about me.

1147
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,790
Ugly, what's with the long face?

1148
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:08,189
Because I hate myself.

1149
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:09,289
What's there to hate about you?

1150
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:10,899
Happiness is subjective, you know.

1151
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,799
It's something you have to pursue for yourself.

1152
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,470
Wait, hold on.

1153
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,100
Let's go eat.

1154
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,069
So what about you?

1155
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:20,240
He does get on my mind, strangely enough.

1156
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:27,980
(An untold story)

1157
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:37,190
Sir, can you pull over, please?

1158
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,819
But the chairman said to bring you straight to him.

1159
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,990
- I'm afraid he'll get mad again. - I'll take full responsibility.

1160
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:46,329
I'll cover for you. I'll just say I took off.

1161
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:47,360
Please, pull over. Now.
