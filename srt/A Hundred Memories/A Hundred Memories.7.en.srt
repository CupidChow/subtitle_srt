Yeong Rye, your boyfriend's here.

8
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,670
He's a friend, not my boyfriend.

9
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,910
Come on, have a seat over here.

10
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,219
You should've gone home to sleep after your shift.

11
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,729
Did you sleep in the on-call room again?

12
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,190
I was too exhausted to go home. I just crashed.

13
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,900
I can't even remember when my last day off was.

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,829
Your last day off was last Monday.

15
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,140
It's been exactly eight days, so this is your third day off.

16
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,510
Was it?

17
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,009
Gosh.

18
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,010
And on my precious day off, I'm stuck here doing this.

19
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,479
I didn't ask you to come.

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,249
Fine. I came because I wanted to.

21
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,280
Happy?

22
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,760
Look at them.

23
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,530
If those two aren't a couple, I'll eat my hat.

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,830
I mean, he comes all this way just for her to do his hair.

25
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,370
And let's be real, can men and women just be friends?

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,670
Exactly.

27
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,340
But she says they're not.

28
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,810
- Look how sweetly he looks at her. - Hey!

29
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,810
You two!

30
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,080
Instead of gossiping back there, why not wash the towels properly?

31
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,420
These towels reek of mildew.

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,580
Scrub them clean.

33
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,990
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,219
Chirp. They just love to gossip.

35
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,560
Don't move.

36
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,230
If you move, I'll mess it up.

37
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,030
I know you won't.

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
All done.

39
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,980
Gosh.

40
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,879
I was already good-looking, but now I'm more handsome.

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,209
- Thanks. - Watch it,

42
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,050
or I'll shave this whole thing off.

43
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,779
My apologies.

44
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,120
Please, calm yourself, ma'am.

45
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,420
What time do you get off?

46
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,960
After I clean up, probably around 8:30pm?

47
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,459
Then I'll come pick you up around then.

48
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,230
You told your mom you'd be late, right?

49
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,430

Gosh, it's packed in here.

53

Did you say you need a table later? Okay, got it.

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,389
Did you get a perm?

55
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,390
Yes.

56
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,289
Gosh. That'll last you more than a year.

57
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,360
- It turned out nice, right? - Yes, it did.

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,900
Why aren't you ordering the daily special?

59
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,829
I told you you'd be dead if you bailed on me.

60
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,100
- I'm not bailing. Why would I bail? - Good grief.

61
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,370
Food's here!

62
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,510
All right, you should eat first.

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,290
(Episode 7: Destiny)

184
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,689
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

185
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,659
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

186
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,859
- Happy birthday, dear Ka Yeong - Happy birthday, dear Ka Yeong

187
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,000
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

188
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,860
- Blow out the candles! - Make a wish.

189
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,199
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

190
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,140
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

191
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,209
- Happy birthday, dear Jong Hee - Happy birthday, dear Jong Hee

192
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,280
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

193
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,050
- Blow them out! - Wait.

194
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,520
- You have to make a wish! - "A wish."

195
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,099
Happy birthday!

196
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,799
- Here's your gift. - Seriously, happy birthday.

197
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,100
- We all pitched in. - Thank you.

198
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,270
Food's here!

199
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,770
Eat up, have some more.

200
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,870
Dig in.

201
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,510
Try the hamburger, too.

202
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,379
- Is it good? - Is it?

203
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,979
- Try some! - It's on me today.

204
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,409
- For real? - Yes, order more!

205
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,719
Let's dig in!

206
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,590
Excuse me, we'll take one of everything.

207
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,090
Order it all. Try a hamburger.

208
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,790
This is delicious. I feel alive again.

209
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,970
Thank you.

210
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Hold on a second.

211
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,610
You can't just drink it like that.

212
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,410
Race you to the bottom?

213
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,420
You're on.

214
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,390
And when it comes to soda, I never lose.

215
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,290
Loser has to carry this the rest of the way. Deal?

216
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,620
Deal.

217
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,190
Go.

218
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,500
Done! I finished it!

219
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,010
Okay! I won, right? See?

220
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,580
Sorry about that.

221
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,850
(Yeonseo University Hospital)

222
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,049
- Give it here. - No, it's fine. I'll carry it.

223
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,320
I'll carry it.

224
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,850
Dad, would you like some water?

225
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,980
No, it'll just fill me up.

226
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,780
How about a soda, then?

227
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,790
A soda is just more water, isn't it?

228
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,520
Don't make me repeat myself.

229
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,660
Anyway, I'm going stir-crazy in here.

230
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,360
Lying in this sterile white room day in and day out.

231
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,570
Just discharge me.

232
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,240
Right now.

233
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,339
Dad, you're not out of the woods yet.

234
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,770
I've told you that already.

235
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,109
If you're home by yourself and there's an emergency,

236
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,479
what are you going to do all by yourself?

237
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,679
I know you're frustrated, but...

238
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,810
You're not me.

239
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,650
Have you ever been stuck in a hospital for this long?

240
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,949
Dad, please...

241
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,950
Mr. Han.

242
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,250
All right.

243
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,890
Should I take a little more off?

244
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,660
You have a great head shape, so we could definitely go shorter.

245
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,230
On second thought, I think we should stop here for now.

246
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,200
That way I'll have an excuse to come see you again, right?

247
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,940
What's there to look at? Just a sick old man.

248
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,840
What do you mean? I like seeing you.

249
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,480
Here, have some of this.

250
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,879
It's fresh-squeezed juice, so it's packed with vitamin C.

251
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,620
And it should be nice and refreshing. Here you go.

252
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,680
Come on.

253
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,420
I told you, I'm full.

254
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,730
It's not half bad.

255
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,710
- I'm home. - You're back?

256
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,110
Yeong Rye, you're here.

257
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,980
Goodness, how do you get prettier every time I see you?

258
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,220
You won't believe these women.

259
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,489
They acted like they were buying, asking about every little thing.

260
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,249
And then they just say they'll buy it later. Can you believe it?

261
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,989
After grabbing a ton of samples, of course.

262
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,390
The nerve of some people.

263
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,890
By the way, did your father have dinner?

264
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,060
- He finished all of his porridge. - I see.

265
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,860
That was Yeong Rye's magic touch again.

266
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,630
Really? I should have known.

267
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,170
That picky old man is wrapped around her finger.

268
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,339
You must be so tired from work. I feel so bad making you do this.

269
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,940
Not at all. I'm happy to do it.

270
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,510
Thanks for the favour.

271
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,220
Ever since he got sick, he's just gotten so stubborn.

272
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,850
He won't go to the hospital barber, and won't let volunteers cut it.

273
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,289
If it weren't for you,

274
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,059
he'd look like something the cat dragged in.

275
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,060
His hair...

276
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,260
There you go again, talking nonsense.

277
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,740
All right, there now.

278
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,640
Mr. Han.

279
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,970
Next time, I'll colour your hair for you.

280
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,980
It'll make you look at least ten years younger.

281
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,179
But in return, you have to keep up with your physical therapy.

282
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,650
You really do look so much better than the last time I was here.

283
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,150
All right. Now, get going.

284
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,050
You've got work in the morning.

285
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,360
Okay.

286
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,029
- I should get going. - Okay, dear.

287
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,460
- Take care now. - You too.

288
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,100
- I'll walk her home. - Okay.

289
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,970
Okay, Yeong Rye. Thanks again. Go on now.

290
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,769
Jae Pil.

291
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,409
How long are you going to leave her hanging like this?

292
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,210
You need to lock that down before some other guy snaps her up.

293
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,549
Here we go again.

294
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,109
Don't just let this go in one ear and out the other.

295
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,519
For a girl to be that pretty and also that kind.

296
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,990
Do you have any idea how rare that is?

297
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,160
You'll regret it if that ship sails. Make your move, you fool.

298
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,260
This kid...

299
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,330
It's so frustrating,

300
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,169
For a girl to be that pretty and also that kind.

301
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,969
Do you have any idea how rare that is?

302
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,770
You'll regret it if that ship sails. Make your move, you fool.

303
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,040
What?

304
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,910
What?

305
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,310
What is it?

306
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,250
What are you trying to pick on now? Why do you keep glancing at me?

307
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,690
What is it? Tell me.

308
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,560
No, it's just that you look like you must be really tired.

309
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,759
Your eyes are all red and bloodshot.

310
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,630
Really? Do I look that bad?

311
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,770
Here, let me see.

312
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,140
See? Isn't that a little better?

313
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,150
Yes, I think it actually is.

314
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,149
Keep doing that on your way home.

315
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,649
It has a warming massage effect, so it should help.

316
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,750
- Okay. - Yes.

317
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,689
Code Blue.

318
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,689
- Code Blue, surgical ward, 402. - Wait, shouldn't you be going?

319
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,259
You're right. Don't take the bus. Take a cab.

320
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,890
- I got it. Go on, hurry. - Room 402.

321
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,100
- Code Blue. - Take a taxi. I'm going to check.

322
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,000
Come here for a second.

323
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,070
Since it just rained,

324
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,970
it's chillier than you think.

325
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,440
It's cold, so make sure you're bundled up.

326
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,580
All the way up.

327
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,180
I'm off.

328
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,930
Hey, you.

329
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,499
Hey, isn't today your day off?

330
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,569
Tell me about it.

331
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,069
I guess I'm just a work magnet, right?

332
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,070
Let's go.

333
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,140
(Yeong Sik's Restaurant)

334
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,780
I'm home.

335
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,420
My goodness. What in the world happened to you?

336
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,120
Tell me about it. Someone sure did a number on me.

337
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,890
Where are the kids?

338
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:52,820
Goodness. I sent them upstairs.

339
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,759
Goodness, they were just chattering away.

340
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,400
They're no help at all. Just making a darn racket.

341
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
I guess my life isn't exactly a walk in the park.

342
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,000
My family and extra mouths to feed. It's so exhausting.

343
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,840
You can say that all you want, but you're the one who cares most.

344
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,510
Mom. Your words and your heart are two completely different things.

345
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,849
Right. That's enough.

346
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,779
Have you been inside my head? How would you know?

347
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,420
Of course, I have. I'm the one who came out of you.

348
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,750
Anyway...

349
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,759
How's that man doing?

350
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,490
- You mean Jae Pil's father? - Yes.

351
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,230
Same as ever, I guess.

352
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:34,500
It's true what they say, isn't it? How the mighty have fallen.

353
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,200
Those old sayings are never wrong.

354
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Living large and calling the shots, he probably never saw this coming.

355
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,610
That huge department store of his went bankrupt overnight.

356
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,710
And the shock of it all made him collapse.

357
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,419
But still, you know, she stuck by him through it all.

358
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,920
That woman, Man Ok, she's incredibly loyal.

359
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,950
Doing door-to-door sales while nursing him.

360
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,089
They're barely getting by now their son's an intern.

361
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,090
Goodness.

362
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:03,090
Mom, you could write a whole biography on Jae Pil's dad's life.

363
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,900
Why do you have their family history memorized down to the last detail?

364
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,729
It's because I've heard it a million times.

365
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,900
I heard it all from Man Ok herself, that's why.

366
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,969
"A biography?"

367
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,340
Goodness. That man...

368
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,710
Hey, sister.

369
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,680
Don't you think you're a bit loud for this time of night?

370
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
Fine.

371
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,060
How can you focus on your book when it's this noisy?

372
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,490
You could always go read downstairs.

373
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,360
I'd rather be here. It's cooler.

374
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,430
My room's too small and stuffy.

375
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,200
Sorry about that.

376
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,670
I'll work hard, make a lot of money,

377
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,410
and get you your own private room and a house with a big yard.

378
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,910
I'll do my best to make it happen.

379
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,150
I'm home.

380
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,819
Mom.

381
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,050
Gosh. Look at my little Su Jin. Were you eating ice cream?

382
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,919
You have some on your nose and cheeks.

383
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,159
It must've been really delicious?

384
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,230
Yes.

385
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,890
You're back?

386
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,899
You're not quite as late as usual today.

387
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,169
I thought you'd be even later.

388
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,230
And why is that?

389
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,770
Is there some reason I'm not supposed to come home early?

390
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,040
That smell.

391
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,010
When you grill that filefish jerky, I told you to open a window first.

392
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,780
Look at this. I knew it.

393
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,619
"Drinking at home is limited to twice a month."

394
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,459
Did you forget our house rules?

395
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,859
How can you chug soju all the time in a house where a child lives?

396
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,289
What kind of example are you setting for Su Jin?

397
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,290
And you, Ho Suk.

398
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,460
It was your laundry day. Did you start a load?

399
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,569
Then what's that mountain of laundry piled up in the basket?

400
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,570
Well...

401
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,770
And Jeong Bun.

402
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,139
It's been, what, two weeks since you said you would clean it?

403
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,179
All right, I get it, you nag! I'll do it.

404
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,009
Hey, I was about to do it.

405
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,050
But she insisted we have just one little nightcap.

406
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,390
Let's get our act together.

407
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,290
I scrubbed the whole bathroom this morning before I left.

408
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,300
She's really starting to take after someone we know.

409
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,770
I know, right? She's a total little Kwon Hae Ja.

410
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,540
You going to keep talking behind my back?

411
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,780
I ought to...

412
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,150
Asleep?

413
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,360
Yes, she's out.

414
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,699
Is someone using water downstairs?

415
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,800
Water...

416
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,780
Sorry about that. My bad.

417
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,620
She's been so fussy at bedtime lately.

418
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,249
Just to get her to fall asleep,

419
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,320
I usually tell her "Sun and Moon" a million times.

420
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,389
But I guess she was worn out today.

421
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,230
Se conked out after just one lullaby.

422
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,769
Mr. Ma played with her today, you know.

423
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,799
Who knows how many times he spun him around playing airplane.

424
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,000
Men are just built different, you know?

425
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,010
I bet...

426
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,940
his arms are killing him today.

427
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,680
Still, it's so reassuring to have Sang Cheol around.

428
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,990
Hey.

429
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,390
Why don't we ask Su Jin's mom to watch her tonight,

430
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,960
and we hit up Dongdaemun for a change?

431
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,690
- Should we? - Let's go.

432
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,530
Give me a discount.

433
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,059
Hey, ladies, come on! Just take a quick look.

434
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,729
Isn't this one beautiful?

435
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,970
Just looking. No harm in looking.

436
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,399
- But it's not my style. - How about this one?

437
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,499
Sorry, it's just not for me.

438
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,909
- I'll give you a discount. - No thank you.

439
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,639
- Twenty percent? - Sorry.

440
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,110
Goodness.

441
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,179
Unbelievable.

442
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,849
You think they give each other discounts?

443
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,449
Hey! What are you guys doing here? You didn't even call!

444
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,589
Goodness, girl! What's with the surprise?

445
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,819
Well, I'll be. Oh my goodness.

446
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,120
Who did you say is here?

447
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,960
Hey! The Three Corns!

448
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,330
Hae Ja!

449
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,230
Gosh. It's been way too long.

450
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,430
I don't think you've been here since you three came by last fall.

451
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,900
Well, these girls have been busy trying to make a living.

452
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,869
By the way, Yeong Rye, how's studying for night school?

453
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,780
I'm taking it slow and steady, but I'm set on passing this year.

454
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,149
Excuse me? Slow and steady, my foot!

455
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,580
Don't even get me started, okay?

456
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,919
She studies like a maniac every night.

457
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,320
She gets her own room to study, and we're crammed in the master bed.

458
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,820
The woman never sleeps, I tell you. She's nuts.

459
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,729
Yeong Rye has always been a go-getter, even back then.

460
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,830
Working all day and studying all night?

461
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,860
She's really burning the candle at midnight.

462
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Hae Ja.

463
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,399
It's burning the midnight oil, not burning the candle.

464
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,639
Hey. Whatever.

465
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,670
- Call it a rump or call it a rear! - Call it a rump or call it a rear!

466
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,509
Being all together like this really takes me back.

467
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,679
I can say this now, but our Hae Ja was a piece of work, wasn't she?

468
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
- You're telling me. - Yes.

469
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:01,389
The mood of the room always depended on her.

470
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,520
But after Seo Jong Hee showed up, she calmed down a bit, didn't she?

471
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,890
But I wonder what Jong Hee is up to these days...

472
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,330
Wherever she is, I'm sure she's doing just fine.

473
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,870
She has to be.

474
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,269
Hey, I brought out drinks for you. Why aren't you having any?

475
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,310
- Go on, drink up. - Thanks for the drink.

476
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,229
Here, take the soup.

477
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,770
Here, Yeong Mi.

478
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,040
Excuse me, coming through.

479
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,880
Careful, it's hot.

480
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,050
Here you go.

481
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,490
All right.

482
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,970
Let's eat.

483
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,270
- Let's dig in! - Let's dig in!

484
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,410
Right.

485
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,609
Do you two have to go right to work today?

486
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,610
- Yes. - Yes.

487
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,409
Goodness.

488
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,280
The cabbage will be here later,

489
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,550
and Ho Suk and I have to make some fresh kimchi salad.

490
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,459
I don't think I can take Su Jin to her preschool today.

491
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,320
Me! I'll do it. I'll take Su Jin.

492
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,330
Oh, my. What's gotten into you?

493
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,400
You get a year older,

494
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,560
and suddenly our Yeong Mi is all grown up?

495
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,729
Of course.

496
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,400
I'm one of the big kids in middle school now.

497
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,510
Here, have some of this.

498
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,070
Goodness gracious.

499
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,210
That's a relief.

500
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:08,110
Now, we can just focus on the kimchi.

501
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,020
Yeong Rye!

502
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,490
Hey, what's all this?

503
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,420
"Rose Day?"

504
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,059
They've got a day for everything now.

505
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,360
Valentine's Day, White Day...

506
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,000
I guess this is another one of those days to confess your love?

507
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,970
It's all just a marketing gimmick.

508
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,099
When you think about it,

509
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,930
people are so clever coming up with this stuff.

510
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,640
Well, you know...

511
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,240
Maybe this is your chance...

512
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,710
to finally tell Jae Pil how you feel?

513
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,910
Those soap roses are actually really pretty.

514
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,050
(Orange rose: A shy first love)

515
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,450
Jae Pil? Where did that come from?

516
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,890
Because what's between you two is so ambiguous, isn't it?

517
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,999
The regulars at my shop argue about you two all the time.

518
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,259
Are they dating? Are they not?

519
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,500
Are they a couple or aren't they?

520
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,400
Even I can tell that you two are more than just friends.

521
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,399
Just be honest with me, okay?

522
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,940
Do you like Jae Pil, or not?

523
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,270
See? You like him.

524
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,680
We'll be late for work. Come on.

525
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,209
Come on.

526
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,079
The past is the past. You've known each other for ages.

527
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,419
- You could have built a fortress... - The bus is coming. Let's go.

528
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,750
Hey, wait up.

529
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,170
Seriously, why do all rich people...

530
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,610
build their houses on hills like this?

531
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,840
I mean, for them, since they're driven everywhere,

532
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,380
it's not a big deal.

533
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,650
Even when I'm rich again,

534
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,290
I'm definitely building my house on flat ground.

535
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,320
On completely flat ground.

536
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,990
Finally.

537
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,690
Gosh.

538
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,970
Who is it?

539
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,900
Yes, I'm from Judanhak.

540
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,950
Oh, my. Ma'am!

541
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,250
You've gotten some new dark spots already.

542
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,450
I thought they all disappeared after you used our new product.

543
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,750
Did they?

544
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,190
I was in Hawaii with my husband for a business trip.

545
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,760
Maybe the sun was too strong?

546
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,790
Oh, no. That explains it.

547
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,830
As it happens, my company just released a new dark spot cream.

548
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,469
It works like an absolute charm.

549
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,529
Well...

550
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,170
You know the actress, Jung Bo Ra, right?

551
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,069
She's in her fifties.

552
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,710
She used that cream, and her dark spots are all gone.

553
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,010
Is that so?

554
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,240
Come to think of it,

555
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,680
her skin has looked especially clear lately.

556
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,549
Right? I knew you'd noticed.

557
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,950
You have such a keen eye.

558
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,819
But it doesn't just help with dark spots...

559
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,690
By the way, Jae Pil's done with his medical school classes, right?

560
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,289
Is he an intern now?

561
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,290
Yes, that's right.

562
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,560
Time really flies, doesn't it?

563
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,899
Which just means we're all getting older, too.

564
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,670
That's why upkeep is so important.

565
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,070
And this dark spot cream...

566
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,199
What a relief, isn't it?

567
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,069
That Jae Pil got into medical school.

568
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,040
Otherwise, it would've been so draining.

569
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,939
The store owner's wife never worked,

570
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,179
and now she has to run around selling.

571
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,250
Goodness.

572
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,519
- How pitiful. - Well...

573
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,150
I guess that's just my fate.

574
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:37,450
If you feel so bad for me, you can buy this dark spot cream...

575
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,560
Honey, can you hand me my phone?

576
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,790
Yes, of course.

577
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,390
Oh, dear.

578
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,600
Here you go.

579
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,270
Hello?

580
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,310
Hyeon, it's Mom. Is everything okay?

581
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,410
- My goodness. - Really?

582
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,550
You're really coming back to Korea this weekend?

583
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,549
My gosh.

584
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,880
Are you kidding? Of course, I'm thrilled.

585
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,589
Wait, I have to get your room re-wallpapered.

586
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,360
And I need to get you a new bed.

587
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,360
Okay, I got it.

588
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:20,230
I said I got it. Mom will take care of everything.

589
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,100
Okay. Call me back.

590
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,239
So your son is coming home?

591
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Yes.

592
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,910
Oh, my. I can't just be sitting here.

593
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,910
If I had known, I would've had the wallpaper done.

594
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,040
What colour should I go with?

595
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,709
Wait, excuse me, ma'am!

596
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,250
About the dark spot cream...

597
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,020
Dark spot...

598
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,650
Dark spot...

599
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,920
Who do you think you are, glaring at me like that?

600
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,560
You'd better look away.

601
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,100
Why should I look away?

602
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,460
These pretty eyes my mom gave me?

603
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,499
If anyone's looking away, it's you!

604
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,070
Gosh.

605
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,140
This wench is crazy.

606
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Hey!

607
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,310
What makes you so arrogant?

608
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,580
I heard you also ruined my crew's shake down yesterday.

609
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,180
"Shake down?" Don't make me laugh.

610
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,410
Hey.

611
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,720
Even if we are delinquents, let's have some class.

612
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,920
Shaking down kids for cash? How pathetic.

613
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,589
You're giving all of us delinquents a bad name, you know that?

614
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,489
What? You think you can run your mouth...

615
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,959
because you've got one?

616
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,390
What? Are you going to hit me?

617
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,429
Then you should've done it already instead of talking.

618
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,469
- She's lost her mind. - Hey!

619
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,299
- Are you going to let go? Let go! - Let go!

620
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,199
- Hey, let go of me! - What are you doing?

621
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,869
- Let go! Are you deaf? She's nuts. - Look at those reflexes.

622
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,069
Is she some kind of psycho?

623
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,639
- I said let go! Hey! - Hey, are you okay?

624
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,179
- Let go of me! - Is she insane?

625
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,410
- Yeong Bae. - Darn it.

626
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,850
(Koh Yeong Bae)

627
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,490
(Han Sae Ri)

628
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,659
- Hey, didn't I tell you to let go? - Hey, come here.

629
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,830
- I told you to let go! Hey! - Hey!

630
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,760
Koh Yeong Bae.

631
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,260
Wait up.

632
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,299
Hey, it's not what you think.

633
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,670
I was waiting for you, and they're the ones who started it.

634
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,240
Violence is never the answer, no matter what.

635
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,180
They're just a bunch of nasty wenches.

636
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,280
They were shaking down the weaker kids...

637
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,020
Language.

638
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,920
How am I supposed to be nice to a bunch of wenches?

639
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,520
You're always nagging me.

640
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,890
We're broke, and my dad collapsed and is now in the hospital.

641
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,400
With everything that's happened, can you blame me for acting out?

642
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,569
Hey, wait up!

643
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,900
Koh Yeong Bae!

644
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,739
So then I knelt down, and my knees just...

645
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,740
I'm home.

646
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:44,879
Hey, would you just listen to me?

647
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,080
Hey, Han Sae Ri.

648
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,179
Why are you here? Shouldn't you be home?

649
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,509
There's no one at home anyway, so what?

650
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,019
I'm going to do my homework next to Yeong Bae.

651
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,119
Hey, come on.

652
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,119
Hey, don't you bother Yeong Bae while he's studying!

653
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,949
- What? Gosh. - It's fine.

654
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,959
If you start chattering next to him, I swear...

655
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,419
- Stop it. - Gosh, this girl.

656
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,090
I don't know who she gets it from, being such a chatterbox.

657
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:05,960
Anyway...

658
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,830
Now, where was I?

659
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,429
- The marble bench, the makeup... - Oh, right.

660
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,899
Right, so anyway, I was in the middle of a massage,

661
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,369
She acted like she'd buy something. Don't get my hopes up like that.

662
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,969
Like she's the only one with a son.

663
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,739
She stopped her massage midway and just scurried on upstairs.

664
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,610
Gosh, that obnoxious woman. Always making a big deal of nothing.

665
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,120
She talks a big game about how she wants to help me.

666
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,950
- Goodness. - Okay, so...

667
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,950
When is Jeong Hyeon coming home?

668
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,389
This weekend or something, I think.

669
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,930
Yeong Sik told me he'd be back next year.

670
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,530
I guess he's coming back all of a sudden.

671
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,130
Still, if I were her, I'd be thrilled.

672
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,900
He's their only son, after all.

673
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,200
Wait, what?

674
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,839
Are you taking her side over mine right now?

675
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,109
Because her son is friends with Yeong Sik?

676
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,209
Come on.

677
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,239
Sides? For crying out loud, it's not like they're strangers.

678
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,150
Of course, there are sides. Why wouldn't there be?

679
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,350
After I went broke.

680
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,750
You know I have a victim complex, don't you?

681
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,390
I get upset over every little thing.

682
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,320
Come on, just take my side. Quick.

683
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,929
Just take my side, quick!

684
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,099
All right, fine, you're right. The rich are the worst.

685
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,830
Buying one little thing like that is a drop in the bucket for them.

686
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,739
She could have just bought it and then tended to her son.

687
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,970
Gosh, that darn hag.

688
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,270
I hope she trips and falls flat on her face!

689
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,380
There. Happy now?

690
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,920
- Goodness. - Yes, that's much better.

691
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,620
You're going to be the death of me.

692
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,519
I must have committed a terrible sin in a past life...

693
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,290
to be stuck dealing with you.

694
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,920
Gosh, I'm so sick and tired of this.

695
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,959
- But you know... - What?

696
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,430
When you think about it, it's funny how things work out.

697
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,560
What do you mean?

698
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,069
I mean, Jeong Hyeon introduced Yeong Sik to us,

699
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,370
and now Yeong Sik is tutoring our Jae Pil.

700
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,670
And thanks to him, Jae Pil got into medical school.

701
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,740
And you know what?

702
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
He's surprisingly a natural at being a doctor.

703
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,390
- Jae Pil! - Gosh.

704
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,030
Guys.

705
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:18,190
What's with all the drama?

706
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,730
Is the sky falling?

707
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,499
Or did a bus load of patients just show up?

708
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,670
No, that's not it.

709
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,740
It's about the Medical Students' Night this week.

710
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,140
Right.

711
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,540
Is it true that you get a huge fine if you don't have a partner?

712
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,580
Oh, it sounds like Chang Ui is on a power trip again.

713
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,709
We never had to pay a fine before, did we?

714
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,850
Tell me about it.

715
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,719
Man. I'm in huge trouble.

716
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,020
I'm totally broke this month. I don't have money for a fine.

717
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:44,950
Tough luck.

718
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,360
Right.

719
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,690
Come on, eat up.

720
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,870
- Hey, eat up. - Okay.

721
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,010
Hey, Han Jae Pil.

722
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,740
You know that friend of yours?

723
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Who?

724
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:08,780
You know, the one who comes over to do your dad's hair.

725
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,450
She's just a friend, right?

726
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,890
Come on, set me up. She's totally my type.

727
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,220
If it works out, I'll treat you big time.

728
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,130
Beef, not pork. How about some steak?

729
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Not happening.

730
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,000
It's not happening, no matter what you offer.

731
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,600
Why not?

732
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,370
You said she's not even your girlfriend.

733
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,580
Hey, stop just saying no and give me a reason.

734
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,320
Look, the answer is no.

735
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,920
Because I don't want to.

736
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,120
No, it would just make things weird.

737
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,600
Get a grip.

738
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,430
"With Rose Day just a few days away,"

739
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,870
"will I be brave enough to confess my feelings this time?"

740
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,669
"With the hope that it will, this song's for you."

741
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,880
This request is from Shin Jeong Hee in Hongje-dong.

742
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,210
Okay. Here is your song.

743
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,380
"Suzanne" by Kim Seung Jin.

744
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,120
Gosh, that's just unbelievable.

745
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,330
How does a sound like that come from a person's throat?

746
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,660
Gosh. That's hot!

747
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,199
Hey, be careful!

748
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,470
At this rate, all my hair's going to get fried.

749
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,609
That's why I told you to practice on a wig!

750
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,239
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

751
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,710
A wig is different from real hair.

752
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,810
Hey, and I bought you a snack to be my model, didn't I?

753
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,820
So just sit still and stop squirming.

754
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,389
I'm home.

755
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,890
- You're back? - You're here.

756
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,460
Do I smell something burning?

757
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,199
See! You completely fried my hair!

758
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,229
- Seriously, - It's not burned.

759
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,229
- I can't deal with you sometimes. - No, it's not burned.

760
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,100
It's not burned at all. Look.

761
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,669
Smell it. It's not burned.

762
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,609
Like Marie Antoinette, you're pretty.

763
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,009
It smells burned to me, though.

764
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,180
I'm telling you, it's not.

765
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,409
I'll get it.

766
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,049
- Just be careful not to burn it. - It's not burned, I'm serious.

767
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,050
Hello?

768
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,850
Hey, Jae Pil.

769
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,990
You're done for the day?

770
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,920
I thought you might still be there and was going to call in a bit.

771
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,790
Yes, I just got in.

772
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,930
So, what's up? Is everything okay?

773
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,560
Aren't you swamped right now?

774
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,270
I was. Totally swamped.

775
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,329
Because of an accident at a construction site.

776
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,640
I'm just now getting a chance to breathe.

777
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,210
Gosh. You must be exhausted.

778
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,010
Listen.

779
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,480
Are you free this Sunday?

780
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,850
Yes, the salon's closed on the second Sunday, you know.

781
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,150
Why?

782
00:41:32,151 --> 00:41:33,780
Well, it's nothing major,

783
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,950
but there's this annual event called Medical Students' Night.

784
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,690
And if you don't bring a date,

785
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,290
they say you have to pay a fine.

786
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,000
So I was wondering if you might be able to go with me.

787
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,030
So...

788
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,140
A date?

789
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,379
Well, I mean...

790
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,780
I don't mind, but...

791
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,880
Are you sure it's okay for me to go?

792
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:12,520
All right then, I'll go.

793
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,490
Yes, I know that hotel.

794
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,660
Okay.

795
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,160
See you at the entrance.

796
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,460
Okay, sounds good.

797
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,499
A date? What's this about a date?

798
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,069
- Jae Pil asked you to be his date? - "A date?"

799
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,569
Hurry up and tell us!

800
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,639
The suspense is killing me.

801
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,070
- Spill it before I pass out! - Well...

802
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,240
He has this thing, Medical Students' Night or whatever.

803
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,409
He'd be fined if he went alone, so he asked me to go with him.

804
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,609
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

805
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,879
This is it! It's finally happening?

806
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,549
You really think Jae Pil called you over a stupid fine?

807
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,219
This is totally a confession.

808
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,390
He's finally...

809
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,259
made up his mind. It's a confession, I'm sure of it!

810
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,859
Yeong Rye. Snap out of it and listen to me.

811
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,859
- This is your moment. - Right!

812
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,299
Don't let this chance slip by.

813
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,599
- You can't. - You get what I'm saying?

814
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,429
What do you mean, "my moment?" Don't make a big deal out of it.

815
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,939
- Oh, my gosh! - Koh Yeong Rye!

816
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,970
How can you expect us not to make a big deal?

817
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,209
- Go for it, I'm begging you! - I'm telling you, it's your chance!

818
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,679
You'd be a fool to miss it! You have to grab...

819
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,780
Stop! That's enough.

820
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,120
Just knock it off, will you?

821
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,020
I just...

822
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,119
We just...

823
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,520
think you two are so good together.

824
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,159
That it's frustrating to watch from the sidelines.

825
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,260
I know.

826
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,690
I know, but...

827
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,189
But I'll handle my own love life.

828
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,260
So please...

829
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,930
Quiet.

830
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,010
Of course, it's fine.

831
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,250
I'm only asking because it's you.

832
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,020
"Because it's you."

833
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,490
"Because it's you."

834
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,570
What could that mean?

835
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,170
Because he's comfortable with me?

836
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,680
Because we're that close?

837
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,550
Or could it be...

838
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,510
that he...

839
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,420
likes me?

840
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:33,430
Excuse me! One second, please.

841
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,130
- Yes? - A rose.

842
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,000
One rose, please.

843
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,570
For a gift. An orange one, please.

844
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:42,209
(Orange rose: A shy first love)

845
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,669
(Unforgettable memories, for new couples in love)

846
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:48,080
(Gimpo International Airport)

847
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,940
Hi, Driver Jeong!

848
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,510
How have you been?

849
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:22,779
I just got in the car a little while ago, Mother.

850
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,210
Okay. You must be tired, right?

851
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:27,480
Take your time, but hurry on home, okay?

852
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,420
Gosh. Is it because I haven't heard Korean in a while?

853
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,260
I'm not sure how one is supposed to "take your time, but hurry up."

854
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,990
I need to stop somewhere, Mother.

855
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,200
I know you miss me, but wait just a little longer.

856
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,799
Witness Jang Yeon Hee, who was to provide the alibi,

857
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,499
at the time of the incident,

858
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,270
cannot recall being with the defendant.

859
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,739
Therefore, based on the testimony of witness Jang Yeon Hee, alone,

860
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,780
is insufficient to substantiate the defendant's claim.

861
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:57,210
On the other hand, the testimony of Kim Young Soo, the sole eyewitness,

862
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:01,480
has been consistent from his first statement to his court appearance.

863
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,790
Taking all these circumstances into consideration,

864
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,160
Kim Young Soo's testimony is highly credible,

865
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:10,290
making the defendant's innocence extremely unlikely.

866
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,960
Consequently, the facts of the indictment...

867
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,569
are considered to be proven by evidence so conclusive...

868
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,870
that there is no room for reasonable doubt.

869
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,010
For the reasons aforementioned, the court now issues its verdict.

870
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,180
Order. The defendant is sentenced to a fine of 2,000 dollars.

871
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,080
(Judge)

872
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,050
All right, Trainee Koh Yeong Sik.

873
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:43,160
Could you explain your reasoning for finding the defendant guilty?

874
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:47,930
Per Article 307 of the Criminal Act, by the trial by evidence principle,

875
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,430
a finding of guilt...

876
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,200
requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

877
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,270
In this case, the defence's witness...

878
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,370
failed to properly substantiate the defendant's alibi,

879
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:03,110
whereas the victim's testimony was highly credible.

880
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,050
Therefore, I determined the burden of proof was met.

881
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,280
Good. All right.

882
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,089
While testimony can be an unreliable form of evidence,

883
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,460
in a case like this...

884
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,759
If a judge is left with no reasonable doubt...

885
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,400
and is certain of a testimony's credibility,

886
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,670
It can serve as crucial evidence for a verdict.

887
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:26,470
Well done, Trainee Koh Yeong Sik.

888
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:31,970
You were really fired up in there today.

889
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,140
You must be starving. Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

890
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,080
No, I still have work to do. You go ahead and eat.

891
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,579
Come on, let's just grab a bite.

892
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,150
I'm not asking you to treat me. I'm offering, but you always refuse.

893
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,150
- I'm starting to get offended. - Koh Yeong Sik.

894
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,260
Mr. Future Judge.

895
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,490
Hey, what?

896
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,430
It's me. What do you think?

897
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,530
Come here.

898
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,299
- What's with the pat-down? - Give me some space.

899
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,899
Gosh. This guy.

900
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,000
- Hello. - Seriously.

901
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,339
When did you get back?

902
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,610
You didn't say anything in your last letter.

903
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,910
Today.

904
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,610
Hey, it wouldn't be a surprise if I told you.

905
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:15,319
Can I get arrested for cussing at a future judge?

906
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,420
Oh, I'm so scared.

907
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,820
You're still as dramatic as ever.

908
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:20,560
So, are you back for good?

909
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,760
Yes.

910
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,060
I couldn't put it off any longer. My father's getting older,

911
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,300
and I think it's time I took over the company.

912
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,369
Yes, it was bound to happen anyway.

913
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:30,470
Good call.

914
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,300
So, why aren't you dating anyone?

915
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,569
Judging by the vibe back there, that sharp woman...

916
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:41,679
seemed like she might be a little into you, don't you think?

917
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,480
Or is there someone you have your heart set on?

918
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:47,950
What?

919
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,690
No, nothing like that.

920
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,619
I'm busy paying for my siblings' education...

921
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,360
and trying to ease my mom's burden.

922
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,220
Right. Your mother.

923
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,660
She's doing well, I hope?

924
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:01,400
What I missed most in the States was your mom's soybean paste stew.

925
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,830
Yeong Bae and Yeong Mi must be so grown up by now.

926
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,070
And Yeong Rye...

927
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,000
How's Yeong Rye doing?

928
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,230
(The 10th Honourable Yeonseo Medical Students' Night)

929
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,370
Thank you.

930
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:45,270
Bye.

931
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,160
I'm here.

932
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,170
Who are you?

933
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:11,930
Do you know me?

934
00:50:11,931 --> 00:50:14,469
Hey, stop it.

935
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,039
I'm so embarrassed and awkward,

936
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,180
I want to find a hole to crawl into.

937
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,579
Right, so who...

938
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,680
Come on.

939
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,050
All right.

940
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,610
You just look like a completely different person.

941
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,350
So you took me by surprise.

942
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:28,819
Do I look that awkward?

943
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,549
Is the makeup too heavy? Should I take some off?

944
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:32,089
No, it looks fine. Why?

945
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:33,990
No. I'm taking it off. This isn't right.

946
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,660
I'm telling you, it's fine.

947
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,760
You look beautiful, really.

948
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,070
Gosh. I know you're just saying that.

949
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,240
Well then, shall we head inside, partner?

950
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,680
Stop.

951
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,340
Let's go.

952

(The 10th Honourable Yeonseo Medical Students' Night)

953
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,790
- This is amazing. - I know.

954
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,790
What is it?

955
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:08,220
- Are you not feeling well? - Hello.

956
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,490
No, I think it's just my nerves.

957
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,530
I'm getting a little carsick for the first time in a while.

958
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,629
Oh, no. what should we do?

959
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:16,969
Should I run to a pharmacy for some medicine?

960
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:18,830
No, it's not that bad.

961
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,040
I'll be fine in a little bit.

962
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,110
- Let's go. - This way.

963
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,030
- Jong Hee? - Yeong Rye!

964
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:52,400
Excuse me.

965
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:56,270
I'm sorry, do I know you?

966
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:02,010
I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.

967
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,090
What's wrong, Yeong Rye?

968
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:11,720
What happened?

969
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,630
Are you okay?

970
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,000
(The 10th Honourable Yeonseo Medical Students' Night)

971
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,140
Let me see.

972
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,280
Let's put some ice on it before it swells.

973
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:37,450
Is that ice?

974
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:39,180
Where did you get this?

975
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,520
It was an emergency. What was I supposed to do?

976
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,749
I broke off a piece of the commemorative ice sculpture.

977
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,989
What? Hey!

978
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,160
I'm kidding.

979
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,130
I just asked for it at the hotel restaurant.

980
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,560
My gosh.

981
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:57,770
It's cold.

982
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,140
It's a little cold.

983
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,180
Gosh. I think it's already swelling up.

984
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,510
It must be hard for you to walk.

985
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:15,820
What on earth did you see to make you run off in a panic?

986
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,050
Did you see a celebrity or something?

987
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:25,590
If it's still swollen tomorrow, come to the hospital.

988
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,100
We'll need to get an X-ray.

989
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,400
Okay.

990
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:33,670
Okay, that settles it.

991
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,839
Come on, I'll take you home.

992
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,410
Hey, no, it's fine. You should hurry back inside.

993
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,979
I can just grab a taxi. I can get home on my own.

994
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,780
No, I insist. I wouldn't feel right about it.

995
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,680
Besides, why do we even have to do these stupid events anyway?

996
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,420
So I'll get on the seniors' bad side and pay a fine. Big deal.

997
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,330
Your hand.

998
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,500
Here, have some of this too.

999
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,209
Goodness, slow down.

1000
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:11,540
You're going to get an upset stomach.

1001
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,340
I'll get you more rice, so just take your time, okay?

1002
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,579
There's plenty of rice.

1003
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,250
We have a mountain of it over there.

1004
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:18,449
Yes, ma'am. I've missed this taste so much.

1005
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,079
See? I'm getting a little teary just from eating this.

1006
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,420
Wait, I've got an idea.

1007
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,949
Why don't you open up a restaurant in Koreatown?

1008
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:24,950
I'll be your investor.

1009
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:26,659
You'll be the president, and I'll be your advisor.

1010
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,959
With flavour like this, it's a guaranteed hit. Gosh.

1011
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,090
You've gotten even better at laying it on thick.

1012
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,029
Is that what living in the US does to you?

1013
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,100
Gosh.

1014
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,599
You'd ask if I'd slathered my tongue in sesame oil.

1015
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,699
I'm impressed by your creativity.

1016
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,099
All right, that's enough. Now, finish your food.

1017
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,840
- Are you ever going home? - Right.

1018
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,539
Then and now,

1019
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,079
I've always liked your house more than my own. I wonder why.

1020
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,910
Why do you think? It's the food.

1021
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:50,950
You're right. It's the food.

1022
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:52,880
I just love your mom's cooking.

1023
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,520
Please, eat up.

1024
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:59,790
It's got a nice, hearty flavour. You'll like it.

1025
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:02,420
You too, Judge Go.

1026
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,060
Not a judge yet. I'm still a trainee.

1027
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,830
Trainee or not.

1028
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,600
You'll be a judge soon anyway. It's the same difference.

1029
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:14,700
Of course. Ma'am, you're truly incredible.

1030
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,809
The only reason he passed the bar is all thanks to you.

1031
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:19,170
Heaven knows it, and I know it.

1032
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:20,740
Hey, you know it too, don't you?

1033
00:55:20,741 --> 00:55:22,379
If you don't, you're not even human.

1034
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,749
I know. Just calm down and eat.

1035
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,750
Okay.

1036
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:28,750
By the way, when is Yeong Rye getting here?

1037
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,350
Is she getting off work late?

1038
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,890
It's Yeong Rye's day off today. She went on a date.

1039
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,660
"A date?"

1040
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,500
A date with who?

1041
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:43,900
(Youngeun Market)

1042
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,150
Hey, forget it.

1043
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:02,480
I can just walk slowly from here. You should head back now.

1044
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,520
If I were going to do that, would I have gotten out with you?

1045
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,190
Here.

1046
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:11,590
What?

1047
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:18,270
Come on.

1048
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,700
What are you doing?

1049
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,770
If you walk on that foot, it'll just swell up again. Get on.

1050
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:26,439
Hey, come on, it's not that bad.

1051
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,539
Besides, I'm heavy.

1052
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,380
How heavy can you be? Stop arguing and get on.

1053
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,320
You shouldn't strain yourself. I'm a doctor, remember?

1054
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,489
Gosh. My poor legs.

1055
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:45,560
Unless you want me to stand here in pain, just get on.

1056
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,200
You...

1057
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,500
You'd better not regret this. I'm serious...

1058
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,829
I'm getting on, all right?

1059
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:52,970
You've been warned.

1060
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,500
Oh, I'm so scared.

1061
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:58,069
- Okay. I'm getting on. - Come on.

1062
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,110
Yes. I'm ready.

1063
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,580
Okay, up we go.

1064
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,160
Goodness.

1065
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:21,260
Are you made of feathers or something?

1066
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:25,400
You should really eat more. You hear me?

1067
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,500
How can you be on your feet all day when you're this light?

1068
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,580
You say that, but it sounds like you're struggling.

1069
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,640
I am?

1070
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,450
What? No. This is easy.

1071
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:42,020
We're going to fall.

1072
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:43,750
Don't!

1073
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,050
See?

1074
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,420
- Here we go. - Goodness.

1075
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:50,730
Gosh.

1076
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,830
- Hey. - Gosh, Ms. Koh.

1077
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:54,700
Save me.

1078
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:57,730
- You okay? - Yes.

1079
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,400
Good grief.

1080
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,870
Thanks, Han Jae Pil.

1081
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:06,010
I got a ride home thanks to you, but what about you?

1082
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:09,079
The seniors are really going to have it out for you now, aren't they?

1083
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,510
Whatever. Let them.

1084
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,289
I was a total rebel, remember?

1085
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,789
How could I forget?

1086
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:20,820
A group date in your senior year? Yes, that says it all.

1087
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,090
Exactly. Now hurry and get inside.

1088
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:27,130
And don't forget to ice it again before bed.

1089
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,500
By the way...

1090
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,100
You know...

1091
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,110
Yeong Rye.

1092
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,179
Jeong Hyeon?

1093
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,620
Hey, Ugly. When did you get so pretty?

1094
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,650
You getting this pretty makes me nervous.

1095
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:53,460
I preferred you as Ugly. It put me at ease.

1096
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,730
Jeong Hyeon, when did you get back to Korea?

1097
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,790
I didn't even know you were back.

1098
00:58:58,890 --> 00:58:59,899
Today.

1099
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,960
As soon as I got in, I craved your mom's soybean paste stew.

1100
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,170
Well, Jae Pil.

1101
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:08,270
Long time no see.

1102
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:11,210
Gosh. You really look the part of a doctor now.

1103
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:13,940
- How have you been? - Good.

1104
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,749
It's really good to see you, too.

1105
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:17,880
Sure.

1106
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,800
- Another bottle, please. - Right away.

1107
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:38,830
So I was talking to Yeong Rye's friend...

1108
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,340
You two went to Medical Students' Night, right?

1109
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,310
I guess you don't have a girlfriend, since you took Yeong Rye.

1110
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:45,610
No.

1111
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,640
But still...

1112
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,410
You should've taken better care of her.

1113
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:53,980
How could you let her sprain her ankle?

1114
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,490
Hey, how is that Jae Pil's fault? She's the one who's clumsy.

1115
00:59:58,590 --> 00:59:59,789
Well, that's true.

1116
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:02,360
But that's part of her charm, right?

1117
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,990
She's got this subtle vulnerability, right?

1118
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:11,770
Yes.

1119
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,469
I really wanted to see her, but it was so brief.

1120
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,440
Should I go bring her back right now?

1121
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,740
I'll give her a piggyback ride this time. No big deal.

1122
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,310
She can't drink right now.

1123
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,250
It'll increase the inflammation.

1124
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:25,610
It will?

1125
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:30,190
Well, if the doctor says so, I can't really argue with that.

1126
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Here.

1127
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,170
Thanks.

1128
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:50,440
Enjoy.

1129
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,840
- Can we get another bottle? - Yes.

1130
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,800
Actually, just make it two bottles.

1131
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,110
Coming.

1132
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:51,330
Gosh. See, kid?

1133
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,070
You really should learn to pick your battles?

1134
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:45,150
Excuse me.

1135
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,190
Now, on "For You, Sleepless Tonight,"

1136
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:23,490
we have another letter from one of our regulars.

1137
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:26,899
She's someone our whole radio family is rooting for, isn't she?

1138
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,870
Let's read the letter from K in Dodam-dong.

1139
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:33,839
"Today, I learned that apart from Valentine's Day or White Day,"

1140
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,540
"there's also something called Rose Day."

1141
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:41,380
"Apparently, it's a day to confess your love to someone with a rose."

1142
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,449
"I couldn't muster up the courage on Valentine's Day in February,"

1143
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:46,620
"but I think I'm going to go for it this time."

1144
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,379
"I'm worried about what might happen if we drift apart..."

1145
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,590
"and it gets weird."

1146
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:53,559
"But I'm not going to ignore these feelings I've buried..."

1147
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,290
"for a long time."

1148
01:03:56,790 --> 01:04:01,200
And she's requested Yoo Jae Ha's "My Reflection in My Heart."

1149
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,600
I'm dying to know how it turned out for her.

1150
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,099
If her confession went well,

1151
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,040
she probably isn't even listening to the show right now.

1152
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,409
Well, here's hoping it all worked out for her.

1153
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:14,110
Let's listen to the song now.

1154
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:17,380
"My Reflection in My Heart" by Yoo Jae Ha.

1155
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,030
So, in the end,

1156
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,300
my confession today...

1157
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,530
was a bust because the timing was off.

1158
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,210
What on earth?

1159
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,480
What's going on with them? What in the world happened?

1160
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:53,920
Whatever.

1161
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,620
I thought I'd die hauling these two drunks on my shoulders.

1162
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,489
Gosh, these two are a real handful.

1163
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:03,119
What? Where am I?

1164
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,890
It's so dark.

1165
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,929
Well, ain't this a hoot?

1166
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:11,600
You really have to get someone drunk to see their true colours.

1167
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:15,939
Once wasted, the guy from abroad and the doctor...

1168
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,609
are all just the same, right?

1169
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:18,940
Tell me about it.

1170
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,779
I used to think he was so cool.

1171
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:24,450
Now, I see he's kind of a mess.

1172
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:25,809
Goodness.

1173
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:27,880
Who is it?

1174
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:29,420
Mom?

1175
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:32,650
- What? - Oh, my goodness.

1176
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,530
You're heavy.

1177
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,770
That hurts.

1178
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:50,540
Gosh.

1179
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:52,570
Hey, I've got a cramp!

1180
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,950
Hey, who are you guys?

1181
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:00,050
Why are you sleeping in our house?

1182
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:03,150
Good question. Why are we...

1183
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:05,490
Hi, kids.

1184
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,690
Mom said to come downstairs for breakfast.

1185
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:11,230
Both of you.

1186
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:13,530
Hey, time for your hangover soup.

1187
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,550
We're here.

1188
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,120
You're here?

1189
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:42,459
What are you waiting for? Sit down.

1190
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:43,460
Yes, ma'am.

1191
01:06:43,461 --> 01:06:45,760
Is this dried pollock soup? Gosh. You're the best.

1192
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:50,170
Thank you. This looks amazing.

1193
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:52,630
What happened?

1194
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:54,740
I don't know. I'm dying.

1195
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,410
All right, let's eat.

1196
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:07,750
- Thanks for the food! - Thanks for the food!

1197
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:13,150
Good grief.

1198
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:17,290
You didn't drink the booze. The booze drank you.

1199
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:20,860
You feel sick and you're dying of embarrassment, aren't you?

1200
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,399
You're so ashamed you're speechless, I bet.

1201
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,600
You can say that again.

1202
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,840
I hadn't had soju in a while, so it tasted a little too good.

1203
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,440
We're sorry.

1204
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,180
Forget it. Just eat your soup and go.

1205
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,679
Jae Pil, don't you have to get back to the hospital?

1206
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,019
Yes, but my schedule's a bit more relaxed today.

1207
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,519
My hours got adjusted because of an event yesterday.

1208
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:47,760
So, you're just going to hang around for a free lunch and dinner, too?

1209
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,759
No, that's not what I meant...

1210
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,259
Gosh. This soy-braised beef is out of this world.

1211
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:55,160
It's so good. Gosh.

1212
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:57,829
Yeong Rye, have some.

1213
01:07:57,830 --> 01:07:59,600
Here's a huge piece.

1214
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:01,100
- Thank you. - Sure.

1215
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,240
Hey, Jae Pil!

1216
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,839
Hey, Han Jae Pil!

1217
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,680
I heard you got wasted and passed out here yesterday.

1218
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,910
Good morning, Ms. Park.

1219
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:16,080
What a goof.

1220
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:28,029
Gosh. Han Jae Pil, you're something else.

1221
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:30,670
I mean, you don't even really drink. How did you end up like that?

1222
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,040
Jeong Hyeon? I heard you had a drinking contest.

1223
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,769
Why are you getting all competitive over something so pointless?

1224
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:40,039
That's so unlike you.

1225
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,879
Just drop it and let's go. You're really getting on my nerves.

1226
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,150
Yes, right. I'm never going to let you live this down.

1227
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,019
I'm getting out.

1228
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:50,919
Hey. All right.

1229
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,020
All right.

1230
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,320
All right.

1231
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:59,759
You're getting off here, right? I'll pull over on the main road.

1232
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,760
Yes.

1233
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,799
Hey, so...

1234
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,440
Yesterday's medical school event, right?

1235
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,140
But Ho Suk was making such a big deal...

1236
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,410
about you taking Yeong Rye with you.

1237
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,440
What? A big deal about what?

1238
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:19,050
What do you think I mean?

1239
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:20,750
You and Yeong Rye.

1240
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:24,290
You're more than friends, but not quite a couple.

1241
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:26,620
It's this weird, ambiguous thing, you know?

1242
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,990
That's why everyone around you is making a big deal out of it.

1243
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:32,190
So let's be straight about this. Tell me how you really feel.

1244
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:34,660
So what is Yeong Rye...

1245
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:37,470
to you?

1246
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,699
Hey, hold on. I have a right to ask this.

1247
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,369
You know Yeong Rye was my first love, right?

1248
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:45,939
How could I possibly not know? You made such a huge deal about it.

1249
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:49,679
Come on. What do you really feel?

1250
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,410
I mean, is she just a friend?

1251
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:01,390
No.

1252
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:04,060
"No?" That's what I thought.

1253
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:07,129
"No? Hey, you...

1254
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:08,860
Did you just say "no?"

1255
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,869
Then what's your relationship with Yeong Rye?

1256
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:14,039
- Hey! Eyes on the road! - Gosh.

1257
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,299
- You're the one driving! - All right.

1258
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,909
Gosh, you're out of your mind.

1259
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:19,170
Yes, I know.

1260
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:20,710
Okay.

1261
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:27,549
So what is Yeong Rye to you?

1262
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:29,450
I mean, is she more than a friend?

1263
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:33,250
What is she to you, man?

1264
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:36,420
Hello.

1265
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:38,890
Hello.

1266
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,729
What's going on today? Why's the mood so tense?

1267
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:45,829
A super important VVIP is coming to the salon today.

1268
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:48,539
And it's not just her. Her daughter is coming too.

1269
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,169
The director is super on edge today.

1270
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:54,109
Hey! Don't put the planter here. Move it over there.

1271
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:55,280
Good morning.

1272
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:58,049
Koh Yeong Rye, what are you doing? Change and get out here to help.

1273
01:10:58,050 --> 01:10:59,709
- Right away. - Where's Choi Jeong Bun?

1274
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:01,119
It's her day off.

1275
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,250
Fine, go.

1276
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,890
Hey! I told you not to put that there!

1277
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:09,590
Nothing beats a sweet coffee in the morning.

1278
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:11,190
It's the best.

1279
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,699
Anyway, our director is being so extra.

1280
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:16,629
I mean, a VVIP is coming, so what? Why make such a big scene?

1281
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:18,869
She's always been ambitious, hasn't she?

1282
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:20,300
Hey, you didn't know?

1283
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:21,639
She was Director Michelle,

1284
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,369
the godmother of this industry's, protegee.

1285
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:25,909
She stabbed her in the back and left to open this salon.

1286
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:27,709
She even poached all her regulars.

1287
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:29,440
I did hear something about that.

1288
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:33,280
So, who exactly is this VVIP that's supposed to be coming today?

1289
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,119
I'm not totally sure, but...

1290
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,979
I heard it's the chairman of Daeyang Group...

1291
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:38,390
and his only daughter.

1292
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,620
Must be nice.

1293
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:43,590
Begin.

1294
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:46,429
- Welcome to Juri Beauty Salon. - Welcome to Juri Beauty Salon.

1295
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:48,899
You need to bow lower. Again. Begin.

1296
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,829
Welcome to Juri Beauty Salon.

1297
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:55,600
I know you're all probably thinking why I'm being so extra, but...

1298
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,170
Let's just say...

1299
01:11:57,610 --> 01:12:01,510
A VIP and a VVIP are two very different things.

1300
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:02,910
And what's the difference?

1301
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:04,249
They're completely different.

1302
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,849
Their influence is what's different.

1303
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:07,049
- Right. - Their influence.

1304
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:09,649
Think about it. Ten VIPs can come and go,

1305
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:13,419
but just one VVIP stopping by...

1306
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:16,820
has a much bigger impact. You get it?

1307
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:20,089
So, what does that mean we need to do today?

1308
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:21,400
Do a good job.

1309
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:26,269
We need to lock down that VVIP. That's my point.

1310
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:28,600
- Am I making myself clear? - Yes.

1311
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:33,170
I'll personally handle the chairman.

1312
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:34,480
Manager Jo.

1313
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:36,110
Yes.

1314
01:12:36,111 --> 01:12:37,980
- You'll take the daughter. - Okay.

1315
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:41,120
You know the younger ones have more discerning taste, right?

1316
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,749
The blow-dry and the brushing.

1317
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,990
Make it gentle and thorough. Okay?

1318
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:46,849
- Yes, I understand. - Good.

1319
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,059
They're here.

1320
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,660
Really? Everyone, get ready.

1321
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:09,709
My goodness, Chairwoman. You've arrived.

1322
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:11,080
Welcome.

1323
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,380
Right this way.

1324
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:16,250
Chairwoman, please watch your step.

1325
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:22,020
- Welcome to Juri Beauty Salon. - Welcome to Juri Beauty Salon.

1326
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,610
(A Hundred Memories)

1327
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,129
Hello.

1328
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:34,459
Staff stylist...

1329
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:36,329
My name is Koh Yeong Rye.

1330
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:37,470
Please take good care of me today.

1331
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,699
You should have been more careful!

1332
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,199
Sharp things scare my daughter. She's sensitive to anything pointy.

1333
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,739
Daeyang Group's only daughter is the Seo Jong Hee we know?

1334
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:47,780
I was so shocked, my jaw just about hit the floor.

1335
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,339
Jong Hee?

1336
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:50,509
Gosh. Yeong Rye.

1337
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:51,749
Jae Pil.

1338
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:54,279
Actually, the other day...

1339
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,450
She has asked me to bring you.

1340
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:58,250
Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you.

1341
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:59,690
I will forget it.

1342
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:00,820
On one condition.

1343
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,790
You have to forget my past, too.
