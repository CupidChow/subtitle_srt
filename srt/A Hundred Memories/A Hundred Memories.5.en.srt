(A Hundred Memories)

10
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,110
You know how there are those days, Yeong Rye?

11
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,080
You wake up in the morning,

12
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,690
and your favorite song "Red Dragonfly" by Cho Yong Pil...

13
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,560
is playing on the radio.

14
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,959
This pickled lettuce is delicious, right?

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,070
This is my favorite.

16
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,469
- Yes. - Then you go to the cafeteria,

17
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,540
and they serve that pickled lettuce you'd die for as a side dish.

18
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,520
You find a pay phone with a bunch of change left in it.

19
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,100
The sun is shining.

20
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,100
There's a nice breeze,

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,500
and you can't help but hum a tune.

22
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,140
A day where you feel like everything's going your way.

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,350
Seo Jong Hee?

24
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,030
- What? - Where is she going?

25
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,410
She just ran away.

26
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,889
My gosh.

27
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,989
I'm so sorry.

28
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,520
- Gosh. That hurts. - Are you okay?

29
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
I'm so sorry.

30
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,150
That day was exactly one of those days.

31
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,620
I should've known when I was having such good luck all morning.

32
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,930
Why did I run away when I saw him?

33
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,260
"Right. I'm a bus conductor."

34
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,700
That's what I was going to tell him when we met.

35
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,070
I should have just told him confidently.

36
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
But now that I've bolted like that, I'm just...

37
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,710
nothing but a liar.

(Episode 5: A Bad Day)

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,530
Hey, Driver! When are you ever going to leave?

40
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,169
Come on, I'm running late for work!

41
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,540
Let's go, already!

42
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,469
Believe me, I want to go too.

43
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,379
But I can't leave without the conductor.

44
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,239
How am I supposed to drive and work the doors all by myself?

45
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,810
I can't be in two places at once.

46
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,720
The conductor is here.

47
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,180
Oh, Ms. Koh!

48
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,850
Hurry up and get on.

49
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,020
Go on, watch your step.

50
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,330
- Hey. - We're leaving!

51
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,330
All clear!

52
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,230
Koh Yeong Rye?

53
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,210
What?

54
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,180
Does this make any sense at all?

55
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,050
A bus conductor abandoning her bus mid-route,

56
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,079
and a soldier abandoning his gun in wartime.

57
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,149
How are they different?

58
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,620
In all my years...

59
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,319
In my 20 years at this company, I've never seen such a thing.

60
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,919
In my ten years as a housemother,

61
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,990
- this is the first time... - Will you just be quiet?

62
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,830
I...

63
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,800
am not letting this slide.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,360
- Ever! - That's right.

65
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,230
But, sir, I...

66
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,799
still finished the route without any trouble.

67
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,499
Without any trouble, as if!

68
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,970
Don't you know that on a bus route, time is money?

69
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,509
I mean, to be blunt, what if that girl, Seo Jong Hee...

70
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,980
had run off with the cash box? What would you have done then?

71
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,910
Would you have taken responsibility for it?

72
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,449
Would you have taken the blame?

73
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,079
That's not what happened.

74
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,119
I can't tell you why, but...

75
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,549
- I had no choice... - "No choice?"

76
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,920
There she is.

77
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,290
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,190
I won't take my pay for today.

79
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,290
So please, leave her out of this.

80
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,369
The nerve of her...

81
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,369
- Get back here! - Sir.

82
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,809
Thanks for the bike. I'm sorry!

83
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,509
Think you can get away with anything just by being polite?

84
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,409
- Hey! - Is that it, Koh Yeong Rye?

85
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,450
Koh Yeong Rye!

86
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,000
Are you okay?

87
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,539
I was trying to give you your hat.

88
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,770
I chased after you on a bike and...

89
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,010
I saw you with Han Jae Pil.

90
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,950
I'm not okay.

91
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,620
I regret it,

92
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,390
and I'm so embarrassed.

93
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,320
I hate myself,

94
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,390
and I hate this horrid situation.

95
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,170
But you know what the worst part is?

96
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,040
I have to go to work right now.

97
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,840
The schedule today is killer.

98
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,430
There's something I need to tell you in person first.

99
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,930
No, it's not something I can say over the phone.

100
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,499
Hey, Jae Pil!

101
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,300
You won't believe what I just saw.

102
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,270
I'm not dreaming, am I?

103
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,370
Punch me. Go on, punch me.

104
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,410
That hurts.

105
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,050
Hey, Yeong Rye...

106
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,680
Yeong Rye.

107
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,750
She's a bus conductor.

108
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,450
What's with that reaction?

109
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,230
Don't tell me you knew all along.

110
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,700
Then, is Seo Jong Hee too?

111
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,450
Cheers.

112
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,990
This booze tastes especially good tonight.

113
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,560
Hey, now.

114
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,300
My mom said pouring your own drink is three years of bad luck.

115
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,970
As if my luck could get any worse.

116
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,980
I feel so trapped.

117
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,720
I wish I could see the sea tonight. It would clear my head.

118
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Hey.

119
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,390
Should we go right now? To the sea at Incheon?

120
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,960
- Right now? - Yes.

121
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,490
How would we get there?

122
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,790
Take a taxi?

123
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,829
The fare would be expensive, right?

124
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,859
Yes.

125
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,330
We'd probably have to blow our entire day's pay.

126
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,840
I guess this booze will have to do for tonight.

127
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,980
Yeong Rye.

128
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,890
Why is my life like this?

129
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Life seems even more bitter than this soju.

130
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,400
But still...

131
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,540
This soju's aftertaste...

132
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,610
is pretty sweet.

133
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,240
You know why?

134
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,519
Because soju is a diluted spirit,

135
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,389
they add artificial sweeteners to it like it's some kind of seasoning.

136
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,360
Which means the soju itself is actually incredibly bitter.

137
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,730
I see.

138
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,500
Thanks for that fun fact.

139
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,840
That's a real comfort.

140
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,250
Here you go.

141
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:03,150
Weren't you planning on telling Han Jae Pil anyway?

142
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,520
I know.

143
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,960
But letting him know myself and getting caught is different.

144
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,300
It only takes a second to look like a complete fool.

145
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,900
Right, Yeong Rye?

146
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,340
Hey.

147
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,580
Drink with me.

148
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,150
You're going to get wasted at this rate, you know?

149
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,250
All right, cheers.

150
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,989
Cheers!

151
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,989
Drumroll!

152
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,159
And Miss Korea is Seo Jong Hee!

153
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,999
Hey, you'll wake them up!

154
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,330
You're going to wake them up.

155
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,870
Hold on.

156
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,970
The winner needs a crown.

157
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,039
- Gosh. What's that? - Here it is.

158
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,440
All right.

159
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,120
Beautiful.

160
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,000
Hey.

161
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,199
- Honestly. - Jong Hee.

162
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,270
What?

163
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,370
You gorgeous thing.

164
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,839
You have such a pretty face...

165
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,280
and an amazing body to match.

166
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,350
But you know what?

167
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,790
The most beautiful thing about you is your heart.

168
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,350
You really have it all, Seo Jong Hee.

169
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,830
Just go to sleep.

170
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,660
You have to be happy.

171
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,170
- Yes, ma'am. - Okay?

172
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,000
You should be the one getting some sleep.

173
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,280
If you're not happy,

174
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,450
you'll have me to answer to.

175
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,170
I wish I could be.

What's the occasion for the ginseng chicken soup?

179
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,420
What do you mean? It's to help you regain your energy.

You don't even use a space heater, let alone the furnace.

I don't know what I see in you, honestly.

182
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,390
And I lost sleep over it, I swear.

183
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,100
Why did you lose sleep?

184
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,600
"Why..."

185
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,369
"Why did you lose sleep?"

186
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,800
Never mind. Forget I said anything.

187
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,009
- Where's Jae Pil? - Let him be.

188
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,239
He was up jumping rope late last night,

189
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,710
So he's definitely sleeping in.

190
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,380
Why would he be jumping rope late at night?

191
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,150
He should be hitting the books.

192
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,409
Hurry up and go wake him!

193
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,480
We should all eat together on the weekend.

194
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,989
That's what families do, right?

195
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:32,159
I still feel awkward waking Jae Pil up.

196
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,990
What's so uncomfortable about it? We've been a family for ages.

197
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,590
Hurry! Go wake him up!

198
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Goodness.

199
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,070
You could go yourself.

200
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,440
My dear Sae Ri.

201
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,509
Should Daddy pick out the meat for you?

202
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,710
- Right. - Yes.

203
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,650
Jae Pil, breakfast is ready.

204
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,320
Dad wants us all to eat together.

205
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,430
Jae Pil?

206
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,890
Han Jae Pil.

207
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,970
Jae Pil, I'm coming in, okay?

208
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,200
Jae Pil?

209
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,840
Where did he go?

210
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,830
My word.

211
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,070
I was wondering why the sun was shining so bright today.

212
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,640
Reckon it was because of that sight over there.

213
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,170
Oh, please.

214
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,570
You go crazy every time you see a guy.

215
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,650
Well, I'll admit. His back is a little incredible.

216
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,820
Aren't "a little" and "incredible" kind of opposites?

217
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,080
Be quiet.

218
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,859
Excuse me.

219
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,389
Are you looking for your girlfriend by any chance?

220
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,190
We can go get her for you.

221
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,470
Han Jae Pil?

222
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,720
(1pm in front of Vivaldi, Jae Pil)

223
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,030
Jong Hee!

224
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,500
Yes?

225
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,370
Outside! Right now.

226
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,740
So...

227
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,640
Oh, my goodness!

228
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,570
This dashing man came looking for Yeong Rye.

229
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,010
- A man? - Yes.

230
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,049
I don't know what's going on between those two,

231
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,680
but they're having a hushed talk.

232
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,390
You know the type.

233
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,590
He's got this classy, pretty-boy face,

234
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,860
but his arms are all solid muscle.

235
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,289
I mean,

236
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,930
Can you believe that a guy like that actually exists?

237
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Jong Hee.

238
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,970
Han Jae Pil...

239
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,800
is waiting for you outside.

240
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,780
He wants to talk to you.

241
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,790
(Bus Conductor Dormitory)

242
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,730
What's this about?

243
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,040
It doesn't matter to me.

244
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,370
Whoever you are, a student or not, it...

245
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,140
- It doesn't matter to me. - It does for me.

246
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,880
So...

247
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,080
Don't come looking for me again.

248
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,550
You make me uncomfortable.

249
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,480
Then why?

250
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,160
Why did you call me?

251
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,460
Why'd you ask to meet?

252
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,840
To tell you this.

253
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,440
That I'm not that into you.

254
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,330
Look.

255
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Well...

256
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,870
I...

257
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,940
We didn't mean to lie from the beginning.

258
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,010
Jong Hee and I.

259
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,349
We go to Hwaran Night School, but...

260
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,020
We're friends with Ju Gyeong, the one who set up the group date.

261
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,820
And she asked if we could fill in.

262
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,220
She asked us as a favor,

263
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,920
and that's why we went.

264
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,230
I just...

265
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,330
felt I should explain how everything happened.

266
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,000
Is your mom okay?

267
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,170
What?

268
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,410
Yes.

269
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,839
That's a relief.

270
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,080
Thanks for telling me.

271
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,190
The name is Seo Jong Yeon.

272
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,660
Someone said they saw her working as a bus conductor around here.

273
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,230
Please take a good look.

274
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,569
It's an old photo, but...

275
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,800
a person's face doesn't change much in just a few years.

276
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,340
I've looked and looked, but I don't recognize her.

277
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,250
Are you sure she doesn't work here?

278
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,280
Yes, well...

279
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,020
She doesn't seem to be one of our bus conductors.

280
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,670
(Cheongah Bus, Ilpu Bus)

281
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,439
Another dead end?

282
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,379
Was that punk even sure he saw her?

283
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,380
- Was he seeing things? - How should I know?

284
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,219
He said it looked like Jong Yeon at the time.

285
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,319
But he might've still been drunk and seen it wrong.

286
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,390
You punk.

287
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,219
So was it her or not?

288
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,020
How would I know?

289
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,359
Just give up already.

290
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,800
How many days have you spent searching every bus company?

291
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Besides, you...

292
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,900
should take care of yourself.

293
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,770
You punk. Are you being serious?

294
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,140
If you're just going to rain on my parade, get lost. Okay?

295
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,710
I'll tear this whole country apart to find that wench.

296
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,619
Hey, fine, I'll get lost, but let's grab a bite first.

297
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,750
I'm hungry.

298
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,320
Hey.

299
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,990
That actor is so handsome.

300
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,860
Should I leave Clark Gable for him?

301
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,700
How can he be so chiseled?

302
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,099
Unlike a certain someone.

303
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,510
("A Fistful of Dollars")

304
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,240
I'd love to ride a horse, too.

305
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,380
You can learn to ride when you're older.

306
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,020
Or just get your driver's license and start with a car first.

307
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,649
Why?

308
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,220
But they said Yeong Bae and Yeong Mi ride horses all the time.

309
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,820
Who?

310
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,960
Mr. Koh's younger siblings?

311
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,130
Yes.

312
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,829
They really have a horse at their house?

313
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,900
Yes!

314
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,269
(Yeong Sik's Horse Rides)

315
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,270
Oh, my.

316
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,070
Mr. Koh's mother runs this place?

317
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,480
Well, it's a horse, alright.

318
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,950
Hey, Sae Ri!

319
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,610
Yeong Mi! Yeong Bae!

320
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,030
My goodness.

321
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,869
Right. I completely forgot.

322
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,710
I should have paid you first.

323
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,880
How much is it?

324
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,380
It's 6 cents for 5 minutes, and 10 cents for 10 minutes.

325
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,550
That's all? Gosh, that's so cheap.

326
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,150
Here you go.

327
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,580
For crying out loud.

328
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,420
For a kids' ride, who pays with a one-dollar bill?

329
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,190
Some people have more money than sense.

330
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,730
Excuse me.

331
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,659
I haven't even officially opened yet,

332
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,599
so I don't have any change. What do you expect me to do?

333
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,599
Well, in that case...

334
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,969
Then I'll try this.

335
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,099
So I just have to carve it out like this, right?

336
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,200
- Yes. - Right.

337
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,680
I failed.

338
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,179
Oh, no.

339
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,550
Failed again. Gosh.

340
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,349
This is...

341
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,320
a lot harder than it looks.

342
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,890
Goodness.

343
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,860
- Try this one. - Thanks.

344
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,130
If it were that easy, how could I make a living at this?

345
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,930
To you, it's probably a date seed stuck in your nostril,

346
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,839
but this is what I used to feed, clothe, and raise my four kids.

347
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,900
Oh, my.

348
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,040
Oh, my. Why would a date seed get stuck in your nostril?

349
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,110
This lady is hilarious.

350
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,520
A date seed in your nostril.

351
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,979
My sides.

352
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,450
You never heard that one before?

353
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,119
Sae Ri, are you having fun?

354
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,920
Yes, it's so much fun!

355
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,230
By the way, Yeong Bae, you're a really good rider.

356
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,999
Gosh. You're so high up!

357
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,300
You look so cool, Yeong Bae!

358
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,130
You think he is cool?

359
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,639
Then, Sae Ri, are you going to marry him?

360
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,910
Because he's cool.

361
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,840
No, I'm going to marry Yeong Sik.

362
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,949
Yeong Sik is way cooler.

363
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,010
That is true.

364
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,850
He's like a prince on a white horse.

365
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,059
- Hey, block him! - Get him.

366
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,090
- Block him. - Here!

367
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,460
Hey.

368
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,870
I never knew I was such a snob.

369
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,740
Yeong Rye.

370
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,200
No, wait. Is she older than me?

371
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,870
Well, anyway.

372
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,440
My feelings for Yeong Rye...

373
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,380
I thought they were as pure as the driven snow.

374
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,320
But then again, nothing melts faster than snow.

375
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,950
Hey, that's not the point here, man.

376
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,090
Anyway...

377
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,460
I'm really torn.

378
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,860
As you know, I'm an only child.

379
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,500
And my parents are bound to be against it.

380
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,370
But I don't want to see her get hurt either.

381
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,040
Hey.

382
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,970
Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself?

383
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,070
Hey, you never know what can happen.

384
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,680
Anyway, to give up or go for it, that is the question.

385
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,180
I mean, I really do like Yeong Rye, right?

386
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,349
Go for it? Or don't?

387
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,189
Go for it? Or don't?

388
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:13,020
Go for it? Or don't?

389
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,990
Go! Okay!

390
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,460
Let's do this.

391
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,460
After all, the person I like is Ko Yeong Rye herself.

392
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,600
Go big or go home! I'm going for it!

393
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,020
Hey, miss.

394
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,230
Me?

395
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,270
Let me ask you one thing.

396
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,310
Is there a bus conductor named Seo Jong Yeon here?

397
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,040
I'm not sure.

398
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,440
I don't think I've heard that name before.

399
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,280
This is her mug. Are you sure she's not here?

400
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,290
I don't think I've seen her.

401
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,200
Are you sure?

402
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,900
Open your eyes and take a good look.

403
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,630
I know...

404
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,870
every conductor who works here.

405
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,940
If I say she's not here, she's not here.

406
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,010
Darn it.

407
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,020
Where'd that little rat scurry off to?

408
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,270
What? What is it?

409
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,210
- Just now... - Yes?

410
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,350
A strange man...

411
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,750
came looking for you.

412
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,550
"A strange man?"

413
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,720
He said he was looking for someone called Seo Jong Yeon,

414
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,960
so I told him I didn't know anyone by that name.

415
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,860
But then he showed me your photo and asked if I was sure.

416
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,100
I got a really bad feeling, so I insisted I didn't know you.

417
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,600
But it was definitely you.

418
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:45,480
What's going on, Jong Hee?

419
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,250
Jong Hee!

420
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,289
What's wrong, Jong Hee? What is it?

421
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,160
What is it?

422
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,560
I have to run.

423
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,030
As fast as I can.

424
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,100
Just try to calm down, Jong Hee.

425
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,700
What is it? Who was that guy?

426
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,700
The most vicious punk in the world.

427
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,870
My brother.

428
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,410
Your brother?

429
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,650
Hold on.

430
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,450
So where are you going to run to?

431
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,380
Do you even have a place to go?

432
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,150
Did you even figure out where to go before you started packing?

433
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,960
You know what they say, haste makes waste.

434
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,670
First, let's call in sick to work.

435
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,470
And then what?

436
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,210
Well?

437
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,280
You have to disappear.

438
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,180
Without a trace.

439
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,350
Completely.

440
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,730
Mom.

441
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,030
Please don't ask any questions.

442
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,899
Just let me stay at your place for a few days.

443
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,200
Please? Mom?

444
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,140
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

445
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,410
I'll explain everything when the time is right.

446
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,240
I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.

447
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,020
Mom.

448
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,590
It's hard enough feeding my family. How can I take in someone else?

449
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,160
Mom.

450
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,290
You're about to make kimchi.

451
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,229
Gosh. That's going to be so good.

452
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,499
Jong Hee, when you try the kimchi my mom makes,

453
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,199
it'll blow your mind. I'm not kidding.

454
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,199
With this fresh kimchi salad and fresh mudflat oysters...

455
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,869
Gosh. It's out of this world.

456
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,569
Mom, after we salt these, can Jong Hee and I dig for oysters?

457
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,140
Hey, these have already been salted and drained.

458
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,150
If you want to turn this kimchi into a salt lick,

459
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,680
go on, soak it in there again.

460
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,520
I thought you hadn't done it yet.

461
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,160
You're going to earn your keep, right?

462
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,730
I'm not about to feed someone who just sits around.

463
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,870
If you think you'll just sit around and be served, then you can go.

464
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,670
Wait. Mom?

465
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,010
Mom, does that mean Jong Hee can really stay with us? Really?

466
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,279
- Thank you, Mom! - Come on, you're getting me wet.

467
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,579
Goodness, this girl.

468
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,180
Goodness, why are you being so clingy?

469
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,549
- Oh, Mom. - Thank you so much, ma'am.

470
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,450
I'll take good care of Yeong Bae and Yeong Mi.

471
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,090
- Yes! - Why is Mom...

472
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,889
- I'm home! - You're back?

473
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,190
Yeong Sik, Jong Hee is going to live with us starting today!

474
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,499
Hey, go on into the room and unpack your things. Hurry up.

475
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,229
- Let's go! - Thank you.

476
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,230
Let's go.

477
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,900
Come to the kitchen.

478
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,790
Mokpo Lady was saying...

479
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,330
you have to drink this to keep your mind sharp.

480
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,430
Drink this.

481
00:33:23,431 --> 00:33:24,460
Okay.

482
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,459
Drink it now.

483
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,169
Drink it now while those rascals are distracted.

484
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,870
If they see it, they'll snatch it away.

485
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,870
- Hurry. - I'll drink it later.

486
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,110
So, what's going on with Yeong Rye's friend?

487
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,040
I don't know. She showed up pale as a ghost.

488
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,810
And she told me not to ask what's going on, of all things.

489
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:45,280
She didn't seem like a troublemaker, so I let her stay for a few days.

490
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,389
Make sure you drink this. Don't forget.

491
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,450
I got it.

492
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,920
And don't give any to Yeong Bae or Yeong Mi.

493
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,910
Drink it.

494
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,140
I warmed it up, so it'll help you sleep.

495
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,980
Thanks.

496
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,450
You know, I have a feeling...

497
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,090
your mother meant for this to be just for you.

498
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,160
You catch on quick.

499
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,260
I'd better drink it fast then.

500
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,390
If your mom finds out, I'll get kicked out for sure.

501
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,610
I might be overstepping, but...

502
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,010
I don't know what you're going through,

503
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,380
but just running and hiding isn't the answer.

504
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,050
To get past something...

505
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,090
is to actually go through it.

506
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,690
That is, if you really want to be done with it.

507
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,100
You're right.

508
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,539
You're right, but...

509
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,140
But you know how it is.

510
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,580
Like when you're at school, waiting to get a shot,

511
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,339
and even though you know you have to get it,

512
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,850
you keep moving to the back of the line.

513
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,480
I guess that's what happens when you're too scared.

514
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,690
People can be so foolish.

515
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,060
People are inherently foolish.

516
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,800
Especially me.

517
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,400
I act all tough,

518
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,740
but I'm actually a huge coward.

519
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,570
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

520
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,140
I already have the rice cooking. I'll set the table after this.

521
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,840
My goodness, when did you wake up to get all this done?

522
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,480
Oh, my goodness. You even swept the yard?

523
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,519
You're leaving already, without breakfast?

524
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,750
Yes, I have a class.

525
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,390
I'm heading out.

526
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,490
Oh, my gosh!

527
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,490
Oh, no.

528
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,730
Goodness! What's wrong with you?

529
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,600
- Are you hurt? - Oh, no. What do I do?

530
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
That's it.

531
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,310
You're old enough to start washing your own shoes now, okay?

532
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,040
- Okay. - That's it.

533
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,710
Gosh. Yeong Mi, you're really good at this!

534
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,480
Way to go, Yeong Bae! That's it!

535
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,390
Yeong Sik.

536
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,100
Wear these.

537
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,640
Kids, I'm home!

538
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,980
- Yeong Rye! - And I brought dumplings!

539
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,780
Dumplings!

540
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,519
- Make sure you share, okay? - You bought dumplings?

541
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
Okay.

542
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,350
It smells delicious.

543
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,230
Blow on them first. They're hot.

544
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,560
You must be tired.

545
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,840
I took sick leave so suddenly. The dispatch schedule must be chaos.

546
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,510
No, don't worry about it.

547
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,780
Compared to you covering for me when my mom was sick,

548
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,340
this is nothing.

549
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,550
Still...

550
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,679
The personnel manager must be fuming,

551
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,180
and the housemother too.

552
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,660
You know, Yeong Rye, I've been thinking.

553
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,900
I think I might just go back to work today.

554
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,770
Already?

555
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,310
Are you sure you'll be okay?

556
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,940
Well, that punk...

557
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,340
has probably given up and left the neighborhood by now.

558
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,720
Besides, it's not like I can keep hiding forever.

559
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,350
I might as well just face him.

560
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,590
It's not like he'll kill me.

561
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,900
I'm just going to go now.

562
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,230
Okay.

563
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,700
- Hello. - Hello.

564
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,670
I can't remember the last time we had a day off.

565
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,849
The schedule's been so packed. It's been absolutely brutal.

566
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,179
Tell me about it.

567
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,620
The schedule was already killing us, then that wench takes sick leave.

568
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,620
But why'd she suddenly take sick leave anyway?

569
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,389
She didn't even look that sick.

570
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,290
I don't know. I doubt she was actually sick.

571
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,890
She's a bit melancholic.

572
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,700
She's impossible to figure out.

573
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,500
Hae Ja.

574
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,699
Don't you mean "mysterious," not "melancholic?"

575
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,870
Whatever!

576
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,140
It's obvious she ran with a rough crowd.

577
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,140
Who knows what she did before she washed up here.

578
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,679
She's obviously hiding something.

579
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,110
That's why she skipped out, pretending to be sick.

580
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,290
- That's correct, right? - Yes.

581
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,219
- Thank you. - Have a good one.

582
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,430
Bye now.

583
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,750
- How's it going over there? - It's good!

584
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,950
Gosh. Jong Hee!

585
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,390
- Jong Hee! - Have you been okay?

586
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,890
Are you feeling better now?

587
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,359
You were sick, not on vacation. I was worried sick about you.

588
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,430
I'm fine.

589
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,330
I put you all through a lot, didn't I?

590
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,430
Let's go inside. I brought us some treats!

591
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,039
Hold on a second.

592
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,310
- I'll turn off the hose. - And I'll just wash my hands.

593
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,270
Jong Yeon!

594
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,740
- Oh, my gosh! - You.

595
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,510
- Let go of her. - Get out of the way!

596
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,120
- Stop it! Don't touch my friend! - Hey.

597
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,650
You've got a lot of nerve.

598
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,700
Jong Hee.

599
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,029
What's his problem?

600
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,629
Guys, the water guns!

601
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,470
- Hurry! Quick! - The water guns.

602
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,240
That's it!

603
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,339
- Hey! - Who do you think you are?

604
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,840
Come on, Jong Hee.

605
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,020
Yeong Rye, what's the plan?

606
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,850
What does it look like? We're making a run for it.

607
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,150
Didn't I tell you?

608
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,320
I have a commercial driving license. Just in case.

609
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,030
Oh, my gosh. Yeong Rye!

610
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,010
- Who are you? What do you want? - What?

611
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,450
Hey, Mister! What are you doing?

612
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,460
That's my scooter!

613
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:59,660
Stop!

614
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,170
I said stop!

615
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,000
Seo Jong Yeon, you stop right here!

616
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,690
- What's going on? - What?

617
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,000
Looks like there was an accident.

618
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,600
There must be an accident.

619
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,370
Jong Hee.

620
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,010
Run, quick!

621
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,370
- Hurry up! - Right.

622
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,490
Get over here!

623
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,490
Hey, isn't that Seo Jong Hee?

624
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,290
Get over here.

625
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,089
Let go!

626
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:02,589
Thought you were pretty clever?

627
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:03,629
Even changing your name.

628
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:06,060
Hey, where's my money?

629
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,340
And who are you?

630
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:32,390
No, this punk hit me first.

631
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,219
I'm the victim here!

632
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,730
By that logic, you were first to attack Jong Hee.

633
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:38,389
Weren't you?

634
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:40,160
What? I swear, this little pipsqueak...

635
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,400
Quiet!

636
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,770
And you tried to steal a scooter. What gives you the right to talk?

637
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:49,540
And you, Miss, took a company bus.

638
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:53,780
First of all, the bus was returned, so take it up with your company.

639
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,910
Gosh. I just ran a check on this guy.

640
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,410
I think you're going to want to see this.

641
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,780
What?

642
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:03,550
What's this? Gambling, theft, and assault.

643
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,289
Gosh. You've got quite the rap sheet.

644
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,120
On top of that, you're wanted for fraud.

645
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:10,090
You've got some serious nerve.

646
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,759
And you have the audacity to raise your voice?

647
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,759
Hey, that's a separate issue. I'm the actual victim here.

648
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,599
This wench ran off with my money.

649
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,569
I was just trying to get the money my sister owes me.

650
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,599
Is that a crime?

651
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,940
- Is it? - Excuse me!

652
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,369
What do you mean, a thief?

653
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:24,269
I've overheard some things, you know?

654
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:25,340
You're the one who...

655
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,179
No, I mean you. You're the one...

656
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,949
who gambled away all the money Jong Hee earned!

657
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,180
So the real thief...

658
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,479
would be you, Sir!

659
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,419
- What? - Goodness.

660
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,090
Hey, take him inside for now.

661
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,360
Let go of me!

662
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,359
Why is everyone ganging up on me?

663
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,890
I'm a victim here too.

664
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,430
Hey, Seo Jong Yeon.

665
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,430
Do you think changing your name changes who you are?

666
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,970
- I'm the victim! - Just hold still!

667
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,139
Seo Jong Yeon! Hey!

668
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,300
You...

669
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,929
Excuse me! You can't park here!

670
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,270
(Incheon Wonhwa Police Station)

671
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,310
I got a call to come here. I'm Ko Yeong Rye's guardian.

672
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,370
Yeong Sik.

673
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:32,780
Are you okay?

674
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,610
Are you hurt? Are you really okay?

675
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,350
I'm okay.

676
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:44,590
You...

677
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,800
It was a case of mutual assault, so I thought you'd be in trouble.

678
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,000
But he had a prior record and was wanted.

679
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,070
Now that he's in lockup, he won't be getting out for a while.

680
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,380
You must be Jae Pil.

681
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,680
I'm the one who set you up with him for tutoring.

682
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,350
- The eldest son of Hwashin. - I see.

683
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,420
I'm so sorry for all the trouble today.

684
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,120
I should get going.

685
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,030
Jong Hee.

686
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:33,170
I'll get going too.

687
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,440
See you in class, Mr. Koh.

688
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,340
Hey, Jae Pil. Wait.

689
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:19,880
Please.

690
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,490
Please, just leave me alone.

691
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,360
I just...

692
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,400
Having you see me like this...

693
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,869
I feel like you've seen me at my absolute worst.

694
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,300
It's so pathetic and humiliating, I could just die.

695
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:46,680
So...

696
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:51,750
So why didn't you just look away and walk away?

697
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,580
Why...

698
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:58,789
Whether I was getting kicked out or beaten up,

699
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:01,159
you should've just stayed out of it and left!

700
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,190
Why!

701
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,660
Why...

702
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,950
It doesn't matter who you are,

703
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:34,460
how you've lived your life,

704
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,860
or who your family is.

705
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,360
So please...

706
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,100
Like Yeong Rye,

707
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:51,370
let me stay by your side, even just as a friend.

708
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:06,020
Because I worry about you,

709
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:11,760
and I can't stop thinking about you,

710
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,100
and it's driving me crazy.

711
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:40,710
What's gotten into him?

712
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:53,290
Oh, my goodness.

713
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,389
Gosh. What's wrong with this thing?

714
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:57,860
- Oh, dear. Are you okay? - Hey, Driver!

715
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,940
Gosh. There's a nail stuck deep in the tire.

716
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:12,980
We won't even make it to the depot like this.

717
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:16,210
"Can't" is not an option. It has to get done.

718
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,750
Besides, the bus is ancient.

719
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,990
Well...

720
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,890
You want me to just figure it out somehow, right?

721
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,330
The weather...

722
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,350
My tools.

723
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,950
Goodness.

724
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:57,790
What's with him?

725
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,660
Gosh. Good work.

726
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,930
Hey, why are you being like this?

727
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:17,369
Did you eat something weird? Have you lost your mind?

728
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,970
You know why I'm doing this.

729
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:21,900
Do you really hate me?

730
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,740
If you do, just say so. I'll let you go.

731
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,880
What if people see us?

732
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,540
Well?

733
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,810
Well, then...

734
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,950
Should we go somewhere more private?

735
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,220
Oh, dear.

736
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:50,130
How could you sleep like that for three hours straight?

737
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:52,130
I wasn't asleep the whole time.

738
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,600
I woke up for a second whenever they handed out the test.

739
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:55,970
Gosh.

740
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,340
You know, I even had a dream. A total nightmare.

741
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,710
Seo Jong Nam suddenly started wringing my neck like this.

742
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:03,380
I seriously thought I was going to die.

743
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,920
Gosh.

744
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,150
I wonder if it's safe to stay here and not run away.

745
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:13,090
They said he won't be getting out for a while.

746
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,660
Besides, where would you go without me?

747
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,330
Can you live without seeing me?

748
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,700
No, of course not.

749
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,970
I don't know anymore.

750
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:26,970
Whatever will be, will be.

751
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,539
Oh, right.

752
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,539
Jae Pil's done with his exam today, so we're supposed to meet up.

753
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,540
Come with me.

754
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:34,479
No, it's fine. I'm just going to go home and rest.

755
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,740
You two go ahead.

756
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,210
What do you mean, "you two?"

757
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:39,780
Sang Cheol is joined at the hip, so you know he'll be there too.

758
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,649
Come on, let's go. Our exams are over too.

759
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:44,649
We could use a change of scenery. We can go for a bike ride?

760
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:47,389
But I pulled an all-nighter studying for this.

761
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,920
I'm dead tired. I really can't right now.

762
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,230
You can sleep when you're dead, right?

763
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,399
Come with us.

764
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,599
No, I'm not going. Leave me out of it.

765
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,030
Come on, Koh Yeong Rye!

766
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,040
Hey!

767
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:08,810
Hey, Jae Pil. Wait up!

768
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,380
I told you I can't ride this thing!

769
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,790
Hey, Koh Yeong Rye! Wait up!

770
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,760
Jong Hee, hurry up!

771
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,660
I'm having so much fun!

772
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,800
Hey, Jae Pil!

773
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,169
- Hey, Han Jae Pil! - Hey, slow down!

774
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,270
I can't do it!

775
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,100
Gosh. Hey.

776
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:38,110
This is fun!

777
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,280
One, two, three.

778
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,610
There. Yes!

779
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,320
Gosh. How did you do that?

780
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,650
I think it's the rock.

781
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,930
- Gosh. - Here, take this.

782
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,930
And hold it like this.

783
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:01,130
Don't hold your hand this way.

784
00:59:01,131 --> 00:59:02,899
Turn it horizontally, like this.

785
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,600
Then you put the pressure right here.

786
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And with a flick of the wrist...

787
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,310
Okay. Let me try.

788
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,350
- Nice! - Did you see that?

789
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,519
Looks like my teaching paid off.

790
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,549
You're a natural.

791
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:25,190
Yeong Rye, let me show you how it's done.

792
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,460
Okay.

793
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,520
Hey, hand me a rock.

794
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:32,430
Come on, hand it over properly.

795
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:34,099
Hope you mess up!

796
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,400
Hey, stop it. Don't mess with me. This is serious right now.

797
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:38,500
There.

798
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,200
Did you see that?

799
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,239
Hey, what's with that reaction?

800
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,840
Hey, teach me how to do that. Move over.

801
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:49,039
- Was that lame? - What? I think it looks cool.

802
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,079
I think you just gave me a bad rock.

803
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,750
Hold it horizontally like this.

804
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,349
- Horizontally? - Yes.

805
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:56,180
- Put the pressure right here. - Yes.

806
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,220
And then you do this...

807
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,620
- Hey you're even better than me. - You're a natural.

808
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,790
Hey, she's taking a picture.

809
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,829
Kimchi!

810
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,700
One, two, three.

811
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:42,100
Do you want some milk? It'll help with the spice.

812
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,170
It's not because it's spicy.

813
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,970
I'm fine.

814
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:48,270
I think it's just because of the heat.

815
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:52,269
Come on. Stop acting all tough for no reason.

816
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:53,339
Or else your behind will be on fire...

817
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,680
If you're not going to drink it, I will.

818
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,220
Gosh. That's so rich.

819
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,790
I never used to drink milk.

820
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:08,519
Ever since Yeong Sik gave me some, I've really come to like it.

821
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,190
My brother gave you milk?

822
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,790
Right, Jong Hee. Was that when you stayed with us?

823
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:13,999
Yes.

824
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,300
I couldn't sleep, so I was out in the yard.

825
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,270
And he brought me this, all warmed up.

826
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,170
When I first met your brother,

827
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,840
I thought he'd be really cold and kind of gruff.

828
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,310
But he's surprisingly thoughtful.

829
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,950
Hey.

830
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,290
- Are you okay? - Hey!

831
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:41,690
Did you burn yourself? Let me see your hand.

832
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:43,290
Are you okay? It's not hot?

833
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,230
I'm fine.

834
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,500
Here, use this to wipe it.

835
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:51,900
- I'm fine. - Let me see your hand.

836
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:53,140
Hey, you...

837
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,469
You spilled that on purpose to avoid the spicy food, didn't you?

838
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,870
I can handle spicy food just...

839
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:01,479
Look at you.

840
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,050
Goodness. Drink the milk!

841
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,550
Is it raining?

842
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,849
It's really starting to pour.

843
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:13,220
Okay, we can't stay here.

844
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,390
- Let's get out of the rain, quick. - We got to run.

845
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:28,840
What about Jong Hee?

846
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:30,970
I don't know.

847
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:32,710
I'm not sure.

848
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,910
She was running right in front of me just a second ago.

849
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,420
It must be a passing shower.

850
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:46,190
The forecast didn't say anything about rain.

851
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,990
Tell me about it.

852
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:51,090
- It'll probably stop soon. - Yes.

853
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:03,740
Where did this rain come from all of a sudden?

854
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:06,110
And I didn't even get to eat half my ramyeon.

855
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:08,379
If you feel that bad,

856
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,580
you can go finish your half ramyeon broth and half rainwater.

857
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,780
Where did Yeong Rye and Jae Pil go?

858
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,320
They must be around here somewhere.

859
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,790
But why don't you meet up with Yeong Rye?

860
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:24,359
What?

861
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,960
Don't you two have a thing for each other?

862
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,430
So why don't you see each other 1-on-1?

863
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:31,400
Just ask Yeong Rye on a date.

864
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:35,340
I don't know.

865
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,810
Do you think Yeong Rye...

866
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,210
really likes me?

867
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:42,210
What?

868
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,710
And you two call yourselves best friends.

869
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:46,080
You don't seem to know your own friend very well.

870
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:52,220
Well, maybe I'm the one reading too much into things.

871
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:59,290
When is this rain ever going to stop?

872
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:02,060
Who ever heard of rain coming out of nowhere like this?

873
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:04,300
Gosh.

874
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,880
Do you want a piece?

875
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,290
It's so obvious you two are friends.

876
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:52,980
Watch this.

877
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,830
Gosh.

878
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,340
How'd you do that?

879
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:19,040
Jong Hee said...

880
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,179
there's a trick to it.

881
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:22,640
- Yes. - Here.

882
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,290
Like this.

883
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,370
Hey!

884
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:07,160
What?

885
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:14,930
My mom loved this song, so I grew to love it, too.

886
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:21,040
I haven't heard this in forever.

887
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:32,510
On that day,

888
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:34,750
this song was playing.

889
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,790
The day we first met.

890
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,290
Are you okay?

891
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,500
And...

892
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,270
Oh?

893
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:31,940
The rain is letting up a little.

894
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:33,980
Should we get going?

895
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,150
I was first.

896
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:51,490
I...

897
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,860
met you first.

898
01:07:56,430 --> 01:07:57,500
Before Jong Hee.

899
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:06,010
What?

900
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:09,580
The bus conductor who fought with a passenger over the fare.

901
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,810
The one you helped out.

902
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,450
That was me.

903
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:19,490
We met at the movie theater, too.

904
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:23,190
The group date was our third time meeting.

905
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:28,160
It was truly like destiny.

906
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,100
No wonder.

907
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,210
You looked so familiar from the moment I first saw you.

908
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:41,240
And...

909
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,980
the one who fell for you first...

910
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,520
was me.

911
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:56,090
I tried to tell you so many times.

912
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:59,630
But you never gave me a chance.

913
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,130
Just once,

914
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,270
can't you give me...

915
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,440
a chance too?

916
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,089
- Free candy for the pretty lady. - Thank you.

917
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:04,160
It's a heart-shaped candy.

918
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:12,200
Yeong Rye.

919
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,870
Koh Yeong Rye?

920
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:17,610
Yes?

921
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:19,010
Are you coming?

922
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:21,240
Right.

923
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,110
I am.

924
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,399
My heart wants to say this to you today,

925
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,429
Where are they?

926
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:44,399
Even though it may never reach you.

927
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,629
They couldn't have gone far.

928
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:46,770
At least this once,

929
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:49,670
- I'm letting it have a voice. - Let's look for them.

930
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,040
And now,

931
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,180
I'm finally going to end this one-sided love.

932
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:01,950
Goodbye, my first crush.

933
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:06,050
Farewell, my first love.

934
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:17,270
(Cheongah Bus)

935
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:20,230
Five, six, seven, eight.

936
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:23,300
Two, two, three, four,

937
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,639
five, six, seven. One more time.

938
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,210
One, two, three, four,

939
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:34,450
five, six, seven, eight.

940
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:37,850
Two, two, three, four,

941
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:44,330
five, six, seven, and over.

942
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,500
All right, everyone, focus up!

943
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,670
Let's give it our all again today, okay?

944
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:54,570
And your deposits have been a little short lately.

945
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:56,370
You all know that, right?

946
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:59,070
You all know our company motto, right?

947
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,710
"Treat our passengers like family."

948
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:04,409
Even if we're completely packed, we squeeze in one more person.

949
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:06,880
Pack them in tight!

950
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:08,719
Okay, dismissed!

951
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,150
(Cheongah Bus)

952
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:15,590
Right. Hold on! Stop!

953
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:20,530
He sure has a fancy way of saying "drive with the doors open."

954
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:23,200
Since when do you treat family like a piggy bank?

955
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:25,370
Tell me about it.

956
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:29,400
By the way, looks like Jeong Bun stayed out all night again.

957
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:31,840
Her mom must be really sick?

958
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,210
I guess so.

959
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,740
I mean, she went home and then called in sick from there.

960
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,150
Alright!

961
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:40,920
And one more thing.

962
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:45,290
Someone called in sick today, so the dispatch schedule's a mess.

963
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:48,620
Anyone who's off today or has a light schedule...

964
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:49,920
Who can cover for her?

965
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:52,290
Who can cover for her?

966
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:55,100
I'll cover for her.

967
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,600
Good. You're close with Jeong Bun. You can cover for her today.

968
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,500
Dismissed!

969
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,919
"Giant."

970
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,790
(Giant, 10th Anniversary, May 21, 1982)

971
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,570
Excuse me. Please exit slowly.

972
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,770
Go ahead, get on.

973
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,140
Please move a little further inside.

974
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:15,280
Slowly now, take your time!

975
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,249
Move in a little more!

976
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,150
- Hurry up! - Can you go in more?

977
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:22,950
Careful getting on.

978
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,290
We're already packed, here!

979
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:26,450
A little more!

980
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,989
Alright, we're good.

981
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:33,230
- Come on. Seriously? - Miss.

982
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:35,259
Hey, I can see some space up front.

983
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,630
Come on. Move in more.

984
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:39,630
Miss. Please let me get on!

985
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:42,300
- I'm really going to be late! - Let's go!

986
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,840
- Please! - Stop pushing!

987
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:48,439
Hurry, get on.

988
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,379
- Thank you. - A little further inside!

989
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,449
Thank you so much.

990
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:52,780
There is no space here!

991
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:54,380
Thank you.

992
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,950
- A little further inside! - We can't!

993
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,120
Stop pushing!

994
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:03,020
All clear!

995
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:21,140
Do you think Yeong Rye really likes me?

996
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,540
And you two call yourselves best friends.

997
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:25,250
You don't seem to know your own friend very well.

998
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,250
Well...

999
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,120
My gut says it's a guy.

1000
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:35,990
A guy? What are you talking about?

1001
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:47,170
Hey.

1002
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,600
- Are you okay? - Hey!

1003
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,070
Did you burn yourself? Let me see your hand.

1004
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:53,740
Are you okay? It's not hot?

1005
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,510
I'm fine.

1006
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,780
Here, use this to wipe it.

1007
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:11,230
(Giant, 10th Anniversary, May 21, 1982)

1008
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:35,180
- Hold on. - What was that?

1009
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,090
Someone call for help!

1010
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:39,890
Somebody call an ambulance!

1011
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:44,130
Darn it. Call an ambulance!
