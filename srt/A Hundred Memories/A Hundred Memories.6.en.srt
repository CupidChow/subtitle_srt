life really is...

Oh, no. What do we do?

27
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,009
Someone call for help!

28

Somebody call an ambulance!

29
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,780
By a single, split-second choice,

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,650
the victim of that misfortune could change.

Hae Ja said she'd take the shift and just got on Bus Five.

I heard her family's struggling.

41
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,910
Guess she's desperate for the money.

42
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,910
She's driven four days straight, and now she wants to go again.

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,520
She's something else. Come on, hurry up!

44
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,520

Do you need something?

47
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,760
I ran out of lotion.

48
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,930
See? I told you to stock up before you ran out.

49

What? An accident?

56
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,109
Yes, right.

57
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,410
Okay, I understand.

58
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
What is it?

59
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,680
What accident?

60
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,450
Did they get a flat tire or something?

61
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,020
No, it's not that...

It feels like there's still a lot left.

No, listen!

Where do you all think you're going?

80

We heard Hae Ja got hurt. We're going to the hospital.

81
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,220
So you're all just going to go in a big group?

82
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,890
Then who's going to attend all these buses?

83

Someone's been hurt.

87
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm the one going to the hospital!

88
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,140
What good will you do there? Pay for her surgery?

89
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,870
Are you going to go into the operating room instead of her?

90
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,069
Then those with a scheduled route will go.

91
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,109
Ok Hui and I don't have a shift, so we'll go.

92
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,079
Yes, please let us go, sir.

93
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,650
We're just so worried about her. Please.

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,890

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,060

Excuse me.

101

She's going to be okay, right?

102
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,850
She just came out of surgery. She needs to remain stable.

103
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,680
We're taking her to the recovery room now.

104
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,990

105
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,490
Hae Ja!

106
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,330
The surgery went well, so...

107
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,290
Let's just wait and see.

108
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,600
I can't believe this is happening.

109

Hae Ja...

111
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,440
Her leg is gone.

He...

115
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,830
asked me to give this to you.

116
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,530
I have a full shift that day.

117
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,500
So I didn't even have time anyway.

118
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,740
I'll cover your shift.

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,409
Jae Pil's done with his exam today, so we're supposed to meet up.

120
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,410
Come with me.

121
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:03,279
No, it's fine. I'm just going to go home and rest.

122
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,380
You two go ahead.

(Wonhwa Jaeil Hospital)

124
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,670
We did everything we could to save it.

125
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,200
But the nerves were severed, so amputation was unavoidable.

126
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,810
Hae Ja.

127
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,850
Hey, why are you crying? Don't cry.

128
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,350
I'm not dead.

129
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Hae Ja.

130
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,360
Are you okay?

131
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,060
Doesn't it hurt?

132
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,529
Well...

133
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,330
They said that with the morphine, it should be bearable for now.

134
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,330
But...

135
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,840
If I start getting phantom pains,

136
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,710
they said it might be unbearable.

137
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,180
The nurse said to call her if it hurts.

138
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,950
I'm so sorry, Hae Ja.

139
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,320
If I hadn't bailed on my shift and just come in yesterday,

140
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,250
then this never would've happened.

141
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,450
It's all my fault.

142
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,420
I'm so sorry, Hae Ja.

143
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,130
Forget it. There's no one to blame.

144
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,700
It's my own fault for being greedy and pushing myself too hard.

145
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,740
Anyway, why haven't we heard from the company?

146
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,640
The hospital bill must be huge.

147
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,340
And still not a word from them?

148
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
No way.

149
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,180
They'll cover it.

150
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,250
It was a workplace accident.

151
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,080
I'll look into it for you.

152
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,990
Yes, thanks. You know the most about that stuff.

153
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,730
I'm counting on you, Yeong Rye.

154
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,500
What is that supposed to mean?

155
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,430
What do you mean the company's not responsible?

156
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,369
But this was a workplace accident.

157
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,339
How is the company not responsible? Does that make any sense?

158
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,770
Of course, it makes sense.

159
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,009
Why wouldn't it? I mean, to be blunt,

160
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,450
did anyone twist Kwon Hae Ja's arm to take that dispatch?

161
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,149
That happened because she got greedy and insisted on going, right?

162
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,349
It was an accident due to an individual's poor judgment.

163
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,450
Why should the company take the fall for her accident?

164
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,660
Do you think the company is that easy to take advantage of?

165
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,629
- But even so... - Sir.

166
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,660
Hae Ja was just trying to be a diligent worker.

167
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,260
I've cleared it with corporate, so drop it.

168
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,670
My head is killing me.

169
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,170
What do you mean you've cleared it?

170
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,300
Hae Ja lost her leg.

171
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,670
How can you possibly say this is settled?

172
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,810
Gosh, Ms. Koh. You're getting on my nerves today!

173
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,209
It's none of your business.

174
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,310
Why are you getting involved like this?

175
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,180
Let me be blunt.

176
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,820
Because of Kwon Hae Ja,

177
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,790
the dispatch schedule's a mess, and the company's losing a fortune.

178
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,190
We could sue her for damages,

179
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:57,189
so she should consider herself lucky we haven't.

180
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,120
How frustrating. Seriously.

181
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,970
Watch your mouth. Got it?

182
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,680
That's absurd.

183
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,810
The company isn't responsible?

184
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,550
Who do they think we work so hard for with our own two hands,

185
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,719
cramming people into rusty tin cans they call buses?

186
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,850
Exactly.

187
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,790
They've gone way too far. Those heartless punks.

188
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,030
So what should we do?

189
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,130
Hae Ja.

190
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,130
I heard she doesn't have a penny to her name.

191
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,930
That's why I called this meeting.

192
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,470
I think maybe we...

193
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,540
need to step up and do something.

194
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,290
(Secret meeting in the cafeteria at 1am)

195
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,630
(Cafeteria)

196
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,720
Help yourselves, everyone!

197
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,720
Just eat a little. You don't want to get carsick again.

198
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,130
Everyone.

199
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,230
Thank you all for coming.

200
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,800
What I'm about to say...

201
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,940
concerns our safety and our rights.

202
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,740
I'm sure you've all heard,

203
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,740
but this accident with Kwon Hae Ja...

204
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,880
is something that could happen to any one of us.

205
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,750
They don't even properly inspect the ageing buses.

206
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,080
They pressure us to drive off with the doors still open.

207
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,690
And for any problems that arise from that,

208
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,760
the company pushes all the blame onto us...

209
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,820
and refuses to take any responsibility.

210
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,630
If we let them get away with this injustice,

211
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,960
then the next time something happens,

212
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,100
the company won't be there to protect us either.

213
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,670
That's why...

214
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
I think we...

215
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,410
need to stand together.

216
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,229
(Cheongah Bus)

217
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,069

223
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,330
What do you think you're doing?

224
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,629
(Don't fill your stomachs with blood money.)

225
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,960
(Cheongah Bus must apologise.)

226
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
What?

227
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,070
What do you think you're doing right now?

228
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,140
We know there are risks involved in our line of work,

229
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,980
but we have human rights too.

230
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,679
But the company has no intention of protecting them,

231
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,720
not even in the slightest.

232
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,190
Just look at what happened in Hae Ja's accident.

233
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,220
So,

234
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,160
we have no choice but to organise.

235
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,020
Hey, Ms. Koh.

236
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,630
You've got some serious nerve, don't you?

237
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,830
You need to know when to stop.

238
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,270
Who do you think you are, threatening me?

239
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,010
It seems to me you're the one who doesn't get the situation, sir.

240
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,510
Let's use our words.

241
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,910
And keep your hands to yourself.

242
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,309
That's right. Let's talk.

243
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,280
We'll try to handle this as peacefully as we can.

244
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,720
Even a cornered mouse will bite.

245
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,749
And if you step on a worm, it will turn.

246
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,250
And you know what that means?

247
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,960
It means that from now on, we're not taking this lying down.

248
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,560
- Right? - Right.

249
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,990
Have you all collectively lost your minds?

250
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,360
Are you out of your minds?

251
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,930
You're the one out of your mind, sir.

252
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,329
About what happened to Hae Ja...

253
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,669
Until the company accepts blame for it,

254
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,240
we are absolutely not backing down.

255
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,939
Cheongah Bus must guarantee...

256
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,309
the safety and rights of the conductors!

257
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,139
Guarantee them!

258
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,180
- Guarantee them! - Guarantee them!

259
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,550
You make us drive with open doors and then shirk all responsibility!

260
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,619
Wake up!

261
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,549
- Wake up! - Wake up!

262
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,119
Cheongah Bus ignores the rights of its conductors!

263
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,890
Wake up!

264
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,030
- Wake up! - Wake up!

265
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,200
Here!

266
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,710
I came out early just to see her for a moment.

267
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,389
This is as far as we go.

268
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,789
Good grief, what in the world is going on?

269
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,089
Come on, everybody off. Hurry.

270
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,829
Hey, Driver! Why are the buses so far apart?

271
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,929
I've waited over 30 minutes!

272
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,669
- I'll be so late for work! - It's because...

273
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,899
all the conductors are on strike right now.

274
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,140
Take your complaint to the company, not me.

275
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,340
This whole thing is driving me crazy too.

276
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:47,939
What is this? It's all crumpled up.

277
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,040
Darn it. This is only half a ticket, kid!

278
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,839
- Hey, kid! - No. It's okay, Driver.

279
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,279
- Hey, I... - Where do you think you're going?

280
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,049
Who's going to drive if you run off? Honestly.

281
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,119
- Then hurry up and get on. - Goodness.

282
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,519
- This is so chaotic, seriously. - My hair is a mess now!

283
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,179
Get on, quick. There might not be another one.

284
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,920
- Go on. - Goodness.

285
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,350
Come on.

286
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
Gosh.

287
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:06,160
Okay. All clear!

288
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,189
"All right," my foot. Now I have to do this too?

289
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,329
- Yes, I understand. - Our conductors are on strike.

290
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,659
- We're very sorry. - The buses aren't running.

291
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,400
- Yes, we are extremely sorry. - Of course.

292
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,539
- Sure. - Yes, Cheongah Bus.

293
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,069
- Yes, we do apologise. - I'm so sorry.

294
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,240
It's because the conductors have collectively gone on strike.

295
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,639
We're terribly sorry. We're trying to fix it quickly.

296
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,839
- Look. I get it, but... - We're so sorry.

297
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,049
We're at our wits' end, and you want a note explaining why we're late?

298
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,249
- Yes? - Yes, we're looking into...

299
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,449
Hello?

300
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,050
- Why are you cursing at me? - Hello?

301
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,320
Hello? Why is the connection so bad?

302
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,560
- For goodness' sake. - Yes, we're terribly sorry.

303
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,970
What do we do? If this continues, it'll disrupt our operations...

304
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,200
Quiet! Hurry and unplug all the phones!

305
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,670
- Unplug them? All of them? - All of them!

306
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,110
Where's the person in charge here?

307
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,739
I want to see the person in charge!

308
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,740
- Oh, my gosh! - Oh, my gosh.

309
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
Are you in charge?

310
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,639
- Yes, how may I help you? - Don't give me that.

311
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,250
It's because of your darn buses!

312
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,210
I lost out on a huge contract today!

313
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,120
- How will you make this right? - Don't do this!

314
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,390
Let go of me!

315
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,949
How will you make this right?

316
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,419
- Answer me, now! - Sir!

317
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,930
Answer me right now!

318
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,320
- Jong Hee. - Yes?

319
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,690
Stand up for a second.

320
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,360
Sit here. This cushion is thicker.

321
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,859
No, it's okay. You sit.

322
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,360
No, really, I'm fine.

323
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,930
I've got plenty of padding back here.

324
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,650
Koh Yeong Rye.

325
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,150
Yes?

326
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,820
Why are you always the one to give in?

327
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,860
Am I?

328
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,430
You know you are.

329
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,460
Even at meals, you always give me the best dishes.

330
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,330
When the bathroom's crowded, you always let me go first.

331
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,130
And when it comes to our routes,

332
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,840
you always switch with me for the easier one.

333
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,370
And...

334
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,640
Hey.

335
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,940
I'm not like that at all.

336
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,780
The side dishes?

337
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,020
I only gave them to you because they're not my favourite.

338
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,520
And the bathroom? I don't even remember that.

339
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,149
And honestly, with the routes,

340
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,460
you've covered my shifts way more often.

341
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,860
Besides,

342
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,000
I wasn't even going to bring this up, but...

343
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,400
I do have a bit of curve back there, so I've got plenty of cushion.

344
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,110
As if.

345
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,640
No way.

346
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,580
I'm serious!

347
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,050
I get it from my mom.

348
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,230
Where are you going?

349
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,970
To the bathroom.

350
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,910
Oh, my gosh. What do I do?

351
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,650
Oh, gosh. Just a second.

352
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,950
Yes, hello?

353
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,290
Yes, hello?

354
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,960
Well, I'm doing fine,

355
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,330
but may I ask who's calling?

356
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,030
I'm...

357
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,670
I'm Seo Jong Hee. I'm a friend of Jae Pil's.

358
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,600
"Seo Jong Hee?"

359
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,140
Oh, my. Then are you Jae Pil's girlfriend?

360
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,679
- Please hold on a moment. - Honey.

361
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,209
Jae Pil, it's for you!

362
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,210
I'm hungry.

363
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,209
Honey, come to the room. We need to talk.

364
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,079
- About what? - We have something to discuss.

365
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Let's talk in the room.

366
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:34,220
It's a girl.

367
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Let's go.

368
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,260
Hello?

369
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:44,930
Hello?

370
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,370
Seo Jong Hee?

371
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,240
Yes, it's me.

372
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,710
What were you up to?

373
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,810
Studying.

374
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,609
I made a big promise to my father, so I'm trying, but it isn't easy.

375
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,720
My fundamentals are pretty weak.

376
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,980
You've got this.

377
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,960
This Saturday...

378
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,460
Do you think...

379
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,260
we could meet?

380
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,100
Yes, of course.

381
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,400
Actually...

382
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,900
I wish I could see you right now.

383
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,740
Okay, then.

384
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,940
Let's meet at the Wonhwa-dong Intersection at 12pm.

385
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,780
Make sure you look sharp, Han Jae Pil.

386
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,220
Got it?

387
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,620
(Demands: Cover the injured bus conductor's medical bill.)

388
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,659
(Bus conductors are people too.)

389
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,630
(People came before buses, not the way around.)

390
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,010
So...

391
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,780
You're determined to continue this, even if you have to camp all night?

392
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,650
Okay.

393
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,180
Fine.

394
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,250
Looks like you want to take this all the way.

395
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,290
I'll give you exactly one day.

396
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,820
Anyone who returns to work by tomorrow...

397
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,090
will face no repercussions.

398
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,260
Anyone who doesn't...

399
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,860
will be fired on the spot. Make no mistake.

400
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,340
I have made my warning clear.

401
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,679
Just...

402
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,880
one day.

403
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,290
Oh, no. What are we going to do?

404
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,499
The company has no intention of meeting our demands.

405
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,730
At this rate,

406
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,300
aren't we all just going to get fired?

407
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,900
Yeong Rye.

408
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,900
I'm sorry,

409
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,510
but I really can't afford to get fired.

410
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,140
I have a lot of younger siblings to support.

411
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,810
I don't think I can be a part of this anymore.

412
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,580
- I'm sorry. - Wait.

413
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,420
I never thought they'd actually fire us.

414
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,120
I'm really sorry.

415
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,020
Hey, wait up!

416
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Guys.

417
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,600
(People came before buses, not the way around.)

418
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,540
This isn't going to work.

419
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,150
We need to figure something out.

420
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,879
Are you going straight home?

421
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,919
Do you want a ride?

422
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,289
- You drove here? - Yes.

423
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,060
My mom went with my dad on his business trip to Australia.

424
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,590
So both of their cars are available.

425
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,460
Yeong Sik!

426
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,060
Hey there, Ugly.

427
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,010
We almost missed each other.

428
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,040
How did you know we were at the library?

429
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,910
She's here for me, not us.

430
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,750
Whatever, you jerk. Stop nitpicking.

431
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,880
Gosh. Here.

432
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:29,020
Mom said you'd be getting home late from the library today.

433
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,460
Like I mentioned briefly,

434
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,290
the situation at my company is pretty urgent.

435
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,530
Yeong Sik.

436
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,460
I mean...

437
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,930
We really need your help.

438
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,899
So, the company is refusing to accept blame for the accident,

439
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,270
and if you continue the strike, they'll fire everyone.

440
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,940
They're basically threatening you, right?

441
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,380
That company has no class.

442
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,050
If they were injured on the job, that's a clear workers' comp case.

443
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,590
If you let this slide now,

444
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,120
this kind of thing will just keep happening.

445
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,830
In conditions this poor, open-door departure accidents...

446
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,890
are just going to keep happening.

447
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,430
I understand where you're coming from,

448
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,870
but there's a legal process for strikes, you know?

449
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,240
Your strike didn't go through a cooling-off period,

450
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,380
so technically, it is illegal.

451
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,610
Even so,

452
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,119
the fact that the company hasn't reported you...

453
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,489
means they're not so clean either.

454
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,420
Like you said, Yeong Rye,

455
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,960
the company's position was to never negotiate in the first place.

456
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,820
As for them threatening to fire you,

457
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,730
I think that was just a bluff to scare you all.

458
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,530
"A bluff?"

459
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,399
The Constitution guarantees three basic labour rights.

460
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,399
These three rights protect your right to pursue happiness.

461
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,600
They're your fundamental rights as workers.

462
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,469
So that means, under the Constitution's Article 33,

463
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,180
you have the right to make legitimate demands.

464
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,950
Well, it gets a little complicated if you get into the details.

465
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,380
So, you're saying...

466
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,980
Even if we keep holding out,

467
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,850
the company can't just fire us whenever they want, right?

468
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
Bingo.

469
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,160
That's all I needed to hear.

470
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,090
That's the answer I was hoping for.

471
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:19,200
That said, if the stand-off drags on, you'll lose your advantage.

472
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,929
The company will do whatever it can to find replacement workers...

473
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,330
and keep the buses running.

474
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,740
You'll all get exhausted,

475
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,740
and eventually, more people will start to drop out.

476
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,210
Then what do we do?

477
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,210
If we stop now,

478
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,480
it'll be worse than if we never started at all.

479
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,420
And what about Hae Ja's hospital bills?

480
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,220
You're right.

481
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,720
This is a really tough situation.

482
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,760
But in a situation like this,

483
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,900
there is one way to make the company back down.

484
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,040
Okay, get home safe.

485
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,010
I'll drop Yeong Rye off. I have an errand over there anyway.

486
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,250
- Let's go. - Really?

487
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,050
Thank you, Hyeon.

488
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,590
Well, I'll get going, then.

489
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,390
Bye.

490
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,690
I thought you said you were giving me a ride.

491
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,330
Goodness.

492
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,210
Gosh. You've got some serious guts, Ugly.

493
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,780
Why did you decide to take the lead on something like that?

494
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,650
That's not something just anyone can do.

495
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,280
You're tougher than you look.

496
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,360
Goodness. You must've been exhausted.

497
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,430
What?

498
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,330
You're awake?

499
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,130
Talk about perfect timing. We just got here.

500
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,970
Really?

501
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:15,340
It feels like it's been well over an hour.

502
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,410
There was an accident,

503
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,140
so we were stuck in traffic for a while.

504
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,250
Maybe that's why you slept so soundly.

505
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,250
Lucky you, Ugly.

506
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,690
Thank you, Hyeon.

507
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,660
I had such a comfortable ride, thanks to you.

508
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,730
Yes, it sure looked like you were comfortable.

509
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,130
You were even snoring.

510
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,370
What? I was?

511
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,200
No, I'm just kidding.

512
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,970
Fighting for your cause is vital, but take care of yourself.

513
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,170
And remember what I told you earlier.

514
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,240
Bye. Drive safely.

515
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,080
Okay, hurry inside. Your friends must be waiting.

516
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,860
- Hey, Hyeon. - Yes?

517
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,690
Have I ever told you this?

518
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,460
That you remind me of Daddy-Long-Legs.

519
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,300
"Daddy-Long-Legs?"

520
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,970
In the book "Daddy-Long-Legs,"

521
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,970
when the main character is at the lowest point in her life,

522
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,110
the one who gives her strength and supports her...

523
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,940
is her Daddy-Long-Legs.

524
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,180
And that's who you are to me.

525
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,950
Great. Happy now that you've turned me into an old man?

526
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,820
Go on, get inside.

527
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,600
Daddy-Long-Legs?

528
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,470
Not bad, I guess.

529
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,280
I guess I should've been a bit taller.

530
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,290
Thank you.

531
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,420
I've asked you to come by my office, but you never showed up.

532
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,890
My goodness, what brings you here so late at night?

533
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,030
I was just in the neighbourhood.

534
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,870
Are you here for some career advice?

535
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,200
I heard your sister wants you to study abroad.

536
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,270
She's hoping you'll take over the company.

537
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,810
I'm still thinking about it.

538
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,980
Becoming a judge or prosecutor and deciding who's right or wrong...

539
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,210
is a little daunting.

540
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,980
- But that's not why I'm here. - Yes.

541
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,180
Uncle.

542
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:43,190
You said you have a close friend at the Dongseong Daily, right?

543
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,860
(Cheongah Bus)

544
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,399
(A bus conductor was injured on shift!)

545
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,670
(People came before buses, not the way around.)

546
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,510
(Chungah Bus is dodging the open-door departure accident.)

547
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,810
(Guarantee the safety of bus conductors.)

548
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,579
Wait! Stop them! Don't let them in!

549
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,919
- Stop them! What are you doing? - Everybody, get up!

550
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,089
- No! - You can't just barge in like this!

551
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,789
- Stop them! - You can't do this.

552
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,959
- Manager, over here! - What?

553
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,929
What is wrong with you people? This is completely out of line!

554
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,930
Yes!

555
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:25,699
I mean, without any prior notice or an official request...

556
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,899
What story? What is there to even report?

557
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,569
It's about the bus accident with the open doors.

558
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,599
We heard a conflict arose between the conductors and the company,

559
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,740
and that they're on strike now.

560
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,610
First, we'd like to cover the strike and interview a conductor.

561
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,079
Then we'll get the company's side of the story as well.

562
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,379
The company has no comment. Got it?

563
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,949
I'm telling you, this isn't even newsworthy.

564
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,820
They're blaming us for an accident that was their own fault.

565
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
What do you expect us to do?

566
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:49,549
That's exactly what we're here to investigate.

567
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,860
We need to hear from both sides, don't you think?

568
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,460
We already have someone to interview from the conductors' side.

569
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,829
Ms. Koh Yeong Rye.

570
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,830
What?

571
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,060
Koh Yeong Rye?

572
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,530
I'm Koh Yeong Rye!

573
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,740
I am Koh Yeong Rye.

574
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,639
Where should we do the interview?

575
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,409
First, let's get some shots of the conductors on strike here.

576
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,620
We'd like to do the interview with the protest in the background.

577
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,579
Okay, let's hurry and start filming here.

578
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,189
- Yes. - Stop! What are you filming?

579
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,190
What are you filming?

580
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,590
I don't know who tipped them off,

581
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,330
but Dongseong Daily found out and came running.

582
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,429
If that kind of story gets out in the press,

583
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,830
it's going to look bad for us.

584
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,940
Yes, I understand.

585
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,570
Yes. I'll do that.

586
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,980
Seriously.

587
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,610
What'd they say?

588
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,020
Honestly.

589
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
So?

590
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,510
What did headquarters say?

591
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,480
What did they say?

592
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,390
You guys won.

593
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,390
Kwon Hae Ja's hospital bills...

594
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,360
and her severance pay.

595
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,130
Headquarters has agreed to pay for it all.

596
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,130
So, break it up now!

597
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,100
Do it.

598
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,369
What?

599
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,370
We're done!

600
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,950
We won!

601
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,950
We won.

602
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,690
- We won! - We won!

603
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,460
Everyone! This is all thanks to our Koh Yeong Rye!

604
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,629
- Koh Yeong Rye! - Koh Yeong Rye!

605
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,699
- Koh Yeong Rye! - Koh Yeong Rye!

606
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,470
- Koh Yeong Rye! - Koh Yeong Rye!

607
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,410
So...

608
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,340
The hospital bills are taken care of,

609
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,310
and I'm getting compensation?

610
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,720
Yes, Hae Ja.

611
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,990
Honestly...

612
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,090
When I first heard what happened,

613
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,190
I thought this was the end of the line for me.

614
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,760
The company abandoned me.

615
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,130
I had no idea how to handle this situation.

616
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,200
I'm so glad everything worked out, Hae Ja.

617
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,870
This time, though,

618
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,870
Yeong Rye really worked so hard.

619
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,580
It wasn't just me.

620
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,179
It was only possible because everyone stuck together.

621
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,910
If I had done it alone, I wouldn't have stood a chance.

622
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,720
Thank you, Koh Yeong Rye.

623
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,260
And all the rest of you, too.

624
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,730
To be honest,

625
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,000
as your dorm leader all this time,

626
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:25,640
I always just did whatever I wanted and bossed you all around.

627
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,970
I was so mean.

628
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,310
And yet,

629
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,040
you still did all this for me.

630
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,120
Well, you did have your moments.

631
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:45,290
What? Why the sudden respect?

632
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,990
What happened to insisting that we were the same age?

633
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,160
Now that...

634
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,400
all our worries are over,

635
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,530
and only good things are ahead.

636
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,970
So just focus on your treatment, Hae Ja.

637
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,670
Yes, I will.

638
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,210
I'm going to start physical therapy first thing tomorrow.

639
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,040
My therapist...

640
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,040
turns out he's super handsome.

641
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,380
I'm planning to make my move.

642
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,779
Seriously? At a time like this?

643
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,150
Now that sounds like our Hae Ja.

644
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,820
Oh, right. There's more news.

645
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,060
It's about Driver Kim.

646
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,360
They say he's going to Dongjin Bus.

647
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,230
Wait. Driver Kim?

648
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,829
Which Driver Kim?

649
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,499
What do you mean, "which Driver Kim?"

650
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,870
That womanizer, Driver Kim, of course.

651
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,170
Unbelievable.

652
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,740
I wonder what kind of trouble he'll stir up at Dongjin Bus.

653
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,410
What are you talking about? Can you explain?

654
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,350
So it's true that you're going to Dongjin Bus?

655
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,260
But why so suddenly?

656
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,790
Without even saying a word to me.

657
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,360
Well, it wasn't exactly sudden.

658
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,930
There's been talk about it for a while.

659
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,200
This is nice.

660
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,840
This ssanghwa tea is really good.

661
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,840
We should start coming here from now on, right?

662
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,580
Then what about us?

663
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,350
What's going to happen to us?

664
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,050
Us?

665
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,280
What's the big deal?

666
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,190
Just because I'm going to Dongjin Bus doesn't mean we can't meet.

667
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,460
We can meet on my days off.

668
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,430
And we can still run into each other now and then.

669
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,400
You won't try to see me.

670
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,030
Not me, anyway.

671
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,310
You're just done with me, right?

672
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,770
What?

673
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:46,280
You'll just hit on the conductors there.

674
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,910
A leopard can't change its spots.

675
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,649
You think a womanizer is going to stop playing his games?

676
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,249
How can you say that to me?

677
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,719
Are you calling me a womanizer right now?

678
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,290
There's nothing more to say.

679
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,090
I'm going to...

680
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,390
give you one last piece of advice.

681
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,829
Stop living such a sleazy life.

682
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,000
- You'll get what's coming to you. - Jeong Bun.

683
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,930
Jeong Bun, why the foul language?

684
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:14,000
If you're going to be like this, I can't see you anymore, Jeong Bun.

685
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,240
I'm the one who's done. I won't see you.

686
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,009
Darn it, I should just sew that mouth of yours shut.

687
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,240
You've got some nerve.

688
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,810
Get your life straight, you hear?

689
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,480
If you make others cry,

690
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,120
you'll shed tears of blood.

691
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,470
Womanizer, my foot.

692
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,890
It's good to see you, Seo Jong Hee.

693
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,360
It's been way too long, hasn't it?

694
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,330
Tell me about it. It has been a while.

695
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,340
It's been a whirlwind at the company these past few days.

696
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,940
- We even went on strike. - Really?

697
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,340
So that's why the buses weren't running.

698
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,940
- How about now? - It's all sorted out.

699
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,110
Yeong Rye worked really hard on it.

700
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,279
She even stepped up to lead the strike.

701
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,719
Really?

702
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,690
I didn't know Yeong Rye had that kind of backbone.

703
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,150
That's a surprise.

704
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,490
Oh, right.

705
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,730
Here, have a seat.

706
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,840
I was getting one for myself and bought one for you too.

707
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,470
I thought they'd look good on you.

708
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,940
Gosh.

709
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:37,850
Try them on.

710
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,120
- Should I? - Yes.

711
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,790
They're a perfect fit.

712
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,630
How did you know my size?

713
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:52,930
I just eyeballed it.

714
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,860
I figured we could exchange them if they didn't fit.

715
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,570
Sang Cheol, that idiot, always says you shouldn't give shoes as a gift.

716
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,810
He says they'll use them to run away from you.

717
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,040
But I've never believed in things like that.

718
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,150
Where would you even go without me?

719
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,980
Right?

720
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,590
Wearing these,

721
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,090
let's go have some fun today.

722
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,560
What should we do? Anything you want.

723
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,930
- I get to choose? - Yes.

724
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,630
In that case...

725
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,339
Since I get to choose,

726
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,070
how about we get out of the neighbourhood for once?

727
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,760
I took most of it.

728
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,160
Are you okay?

729
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,490
Here, let's trade.

730
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,430
Here.

731
00:43:58,431 --> 00:44:01,160
(Haunted House)

732
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,900
Gosh. Look at that!

733
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,870
Look over there.

734
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,720
Watch this.

735
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,530
Gosh, it's so beautiful, right?

736
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,640
- Cheers. - Cheers.

737
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,510
That looks delicious, right?

738
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:45,740
- Should I try it? - Go ahead.

739
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:52,950
Is it good?

740
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,220
You got some on your face.

741
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:11,930
Wait. We're not going home already, are we?

742
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,900
Do you want me to tell you?

743
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,170
What is it?

744
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,210
Are you going to do it this time?

745
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,150
No.

746
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:52,110
Here, let me see.

747
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,740
- Is it bad? - No, it's fine.

748
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,080
- Give it here. I'll put it on. - I've got it.

749
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,850
It's an awkward spot. Let me help.

750
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:04,450
Oh, no.

751
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,060
New shoes usually need some time to be broken in.

752
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,500
We walked too much today.

753
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,970
I wasn't thinking.

754
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:24,870
I'm sorry.

755
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,220
Next time,

756
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,520
let's just stay in one place and not move an inch.

757
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:43,990
There...

758
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,130
won't be a next time.

759
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,200
What?

760
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:51,300
What's that supposed to mean?

761
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,440
Let's...

762
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,680
Let's just end it here.

763
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,920
We're too different.

764
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,260
We grew up in different worlds, and I don't have a mom or a dad,

765
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:17,960
I just have a brother I'd like to kill sometimes.

766
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,400
But that's something you already know.

767
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,900
But now that we're actually together,

768
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,600
it's become painfully clear how different we are.

769
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,070
And I'm exhausted from the strike, too.

770
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:37,949
That's insane. To just do this out of the blue...

771
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:38,950
You're right.

772
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,450
This is just who I am.

773
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,320
Impulsive and selfish.

774
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,620
I'm fickle and too proud for my own good.

775
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,460
So let's end this before you're completely sick of me.

776
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,800
I'm sorry.

777
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,100
No.

778
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:00,600
Don't be sorry.

779
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,370
I can't accept this.

780
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:04,470
- Jae Pil. - Why are you doing this?

781
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,280
I mean, why all of a sudden?

782
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:09,210
What changed your mind?

783
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,319
We were happy, weren't we?

784
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,050
Yes, it was good. It was.

785
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,460
But it wasn't all good.

786
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:25,090
You said it yourself. That new shoes need breaking in.

787
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,100
But with us,

788
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:33,300
there are too many obstacles in the way.

789
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:35,940
We'll probably always feel uncomfortable...

790
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,840
like we're wearing shoes that don't fit.

791
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:39,880
I guess...

792
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:47,980
This is as far as my feelings for you go.

793
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,660
Thanks for the band-aid.

794
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,740
Take care.

795
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:10,370
And make sure you get into college.

796
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,400
Seo Jong Hee.

797
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,540
Are you...

798
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,140
really okay with never seeing me again?

799
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,880
Just like this?

800
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,550
You're really ending it just like that?

801
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:57,950
Yes.

802
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,860
It's not like we've been together that long.

803
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,830
Jong Hee!

804
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,570
You said you were meeting Jae Pil, so why...

805
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,510
Hey, what's wrong?

806
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:27,740
Did something happen?

807
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,210
What is it? What's wrong, Jong Hee?

808
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:33,180
What is it?

809
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,690
This is for the best.

810
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,490
This is for the best.

811
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,460
It can't be helped.

812
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,360
Here's the weather.

813
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:53,759
Today, an earlier than usual first snow of the season...

814
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,360
is forecast across the country.

815
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:02,940
First snow? But it's only November.

816
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,640
No way.

817
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,080
Tell me about it.

818
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,680
But it sure has gotten chilly all of a sudden.

819
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:15,080
Oh, my.

820
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:23,230
Why are you blocking the way?

821
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,200
Hey, now.

822
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,300
What's gotten into him now?

823
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,739
It has to be wiped perfectly clean.

824
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,540
He's always picking on Yeong Rye these days.

825
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,479
Where is Mudeung Mountain tiger?

826
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,780
It should come take that punk.

827
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,190
One, two, three.

828
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,160
Goodness. That's so loud.

829
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:02,399
Darn it. Of all the days, why'd he set up right there.

830
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,600
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

831
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,100
Gosh. I messed it up again.

832
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:09,509
This airplane one is way too hard.

833
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,040
I can do the hat shape with my eyes closed now.

834
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,610
That scared me!

835
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,679
That scared me. Sae Ri!

836
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,780
You made me break it again.

837
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,179
Why are you always so jumpy?

838
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,890
She startles at every little thing.

839
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:26,960
All right. Again.

840
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,560
Okay, focus up.

841
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:59,960
Wait, is that my wife?

842
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,160
Stop.

843
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,830
Back up.

844
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:12,330
What do you think you're doing here?

845
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,700
- You scared me. - Dad.

846
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,870
So this is what you've been up to when you're not home.

847
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,910
Out on the street with our daughter, eating junk food?

848
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,840
We're going home!

849
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,749
- Get in! Now! - All right.

850
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,680
Why are you yelling like that?

851
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,279
Let me just get this one last thing. I'm so close to getting it.

852
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,520
Seriously, this woman.

853
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,420
And the housekeeper's off today!

854
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,960
I'm hungry!

855
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,520
I need to get dinner on the table!

856
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,860
Hurry and get in. Sae Ri, get in.

857
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,230
- Come on, hurry. Get in. - Gosh. Seriously.

858
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,570
Man Ok is saying she'll leave as soon as she gets it.

859
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,470
It's not like getting this takes an hour.

860
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:49,569
You won't pass out from hunger if dinner's a little late, right?

861
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,040
- Am I right? - What's with this lady?

862
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,510
Are you going to let go of me or what?

863
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:53,680
I won't.

864
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,040
I can't let go.

865
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,879
Not until you let go of his hand, sir.

866
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,850
It's just lipstick on a pig, you know.

867
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:03,390
A truly respectable person should cherish their spouse.

868
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:06,390
You're doing this on the street, in front of a cheap snack vendor.

869
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:08,860
How could you humiliate her like this?

870
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,940
Be home in 30 minutes.

871
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:25,770
Or else...

872
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,150
You're getting kicked out.

873
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:44,690
Don't be late!

874
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,000
Oh, my gosh. You were incredible.

875
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:00,339
You sent infamous Han Gi Bok away just like that.

876
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,340
Gosh.

877
00:57:01,341 --> 00:57:04,410
I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

878
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,679
That was so incredibly satisfying!

879
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,320
Hey, not in front of the kid.

880
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,850
Hurry up and get your prize before you get kicked out.

881
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:13,890
He won't kick me out. He's all talk.

882
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,230
But seriously, that was so satisfying.

883
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,160
You're really...

884
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,349
These fried anchovies are well-salted.

885
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:38,610
They're mighty tasty.

886
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,450
Jeong Bun, you've been eating so much lately.

887
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,390
At this rate, you'll eat us out of house and home.

888
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,630
But I'm just so curious, I have to ask.

889
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,030
Jong Hee.

890
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,860
Why on earth did you and your boyfriend break up?

891
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,900
Yes, I've been wondering that myself.

892
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,200
You were so crazy about each other. What happened?

893
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,840
There was no reason.

894
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:03,570
That's just how relationships are.

895
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,609
People meet, and people break up.

896
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:07,740
You can be crazy about someone, and then just get tired of them.

897
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,210
I get bored easily.

898
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,510
I'm just really fickle.

899
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,649
But still, Jong Hee, you two were...

900
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:15,650
That's enough.

901
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:18,090
I told you not to bring that up.

902
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,530
Eat.

903
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:26,700
Come on, eat up.

904
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,070
I'm telling you to slow down.

905
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:38,309
The way you're eating,

906
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,410
anyone would think you're pregnant...

907
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,910
Don't tell me.

908
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,080
You're not, are you?

909
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:51,990
Hey!

910
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,020
Even as a joke,

911
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,060
you can't say that to an unmarried woman.

912
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,570
How did this happen?

913
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,270
Who is he?

914
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,479
Jeong Bun, why would you do that?

915
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,380
What were you thinking?

916
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:21,550
Ho Suk.

917
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,620
The one who is the most overwhelmed right now...

918
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,520
isn't us, it's Jeong Bun.

919
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:28,090
The father.

920
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:29,860
Does the father know?

921
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:31,990
Does he even know?

922
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,730
This is insane, seriously.

923
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:43,770
I'm getting rid of it.

924
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,980
I have to. What other choice do I have?

925
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:52,050
A baby without a father...

926
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,250
How am I supposed to raise a child on my own?

927
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,070
Hey.

928
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,400
Come work out with me today.

929
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,800
You've been studying like a maniac lately.

930
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,670
How can you stay glued to your chair without a single bathroom break?

931
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,440
Seriously, you're starting to scare me.

932
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,180
Are you even listening?

933
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,810
Come on, let's go.

934
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:26,479
We can hit the heavy bag a bit. Get some fresh air.

935
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,120
The weather's so nice out, you know?

936
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,489
Hey, and let's be real here.

937
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,160
Is Seo Jong Hee the only girl in the world or something?

938
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,929
A guy with your looks, your money, and your personality.

939
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,230
If you just so much as wink at them...

940
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:41,260
Girls would be lining up by the truckload for you!

941
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:47,270
I'm sorry.

942
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,740
That's why I'm saying we should go!

943
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,970
This doesn't add up.

944
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:55,310
None of it adds up.

945
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,880
Ms. Gye.

946
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:03,650
The secret inspector's headcount, from corporate,

947
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:07,320
and the deposit amount here. Why don't they match at all?

948
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,390
Nothing adds up at all.

949
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:10,930
Are you sure you calculated this correctly?

950
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:13,130
I did calculate it correctly.

951
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:16,629
Those inspectors come undercover, but act like they can't be bothered.

952
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:17,829
They do a sloppy job counting.

953
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:19,569
So of course the headcount is going to be off.

954
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:21,039
All right, that's enough.

955
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,040
Quiet.

956
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:23,940
These corporate guys...

957
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:27,480
- Unbelievable. - Gosh.

958
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,350
What on earth isn't adding up?

959
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:32,710
I mean, come on.

960
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,660
You think you can get away with playing dumb?

961
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,900
The deposit amount is off!

962
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,670
I'm telling you, that's impossible.

963
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,740
I'm sure I collected the fare...

964
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,640
from every single passenger that day,

965
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,279
and I deposited the exact amount I received.

966
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,609
Then why is the headcount the corporate inspector took...

967
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:06,009
different from the amount you deposited?

968
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,650
The answer is pretty obvious.

969
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,990
Either the money grew wings and flew away,

970
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,360
or someone skimmed off the top.

971
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:15,990
Are you...

972
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,460
accusing me right now?

973
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:20,760
Yes.

974
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,800
I am.

975
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:26,130
Why? What?

976
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:27,840
Do you have proof that you didn't?

977
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:31,840
Out of all things, I would never steal.

978
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,540
And I'd never sell my conscience for money.

979
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,309
In all my years as a conductor,

980
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:41,320
that's a line I've never crossed.

981
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,420
Oh, that's rich.

982
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:47,290
How am I supposed to know that?

983
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:51,460
How am I supposed to take your word that you've been honest?

The usual Vienna coffee?

987
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,800
Yes.

988
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,170
You know, your girlfriend requests that same song whenever she's here.

989
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:11,840
Are you two obsessed with this song or something?

990
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,910
But why have you been coming in separately lately?

991
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:15,510
Are your schedules not lining up?

992
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:18,180
She keeps...

993
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:20,850
coming here by herself?

994
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:22,050
Yes.

995
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:23,290
She doesn't stay long.

996
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,690
She just requests this one song,

997
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:27,160
listens to it on repeat a few times, and then leaves.

998
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:28,620
I'll go get your coffee.

999
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,820
Okay.

Why are you by yourself?

1008

I don't know. My heart just feels heavy.

1009
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,520
Jeong Bun had to go somewhere and left a while ago.

1010
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,919
Yeong Rye was called in by the manager earlier.

1011
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,090
- and isn't back yet. - How long has Yeong Rye been gone?

Yes.

You know the kind of person I trust the least in this world?

1019
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,710
so high and mighty.

1020
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,420
The kind who pretends to have a conscience.

going on and on about human rights,

1023
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:44,659
but then stabbing people in the back and skimming money, just like you!

1024
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:46,430
What makes you so sure?

1025
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:48,930
Aren't you...

1026
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:51,500
just trying to frame me for this?

and staple that mouth of yours shut.

01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:37,390
What about Jong Hee?

1087
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:42,390
Did something happen to Jong Hee? Jong Hee, where is she?

1088

To check the iron's heat, hold it near your nose.

1099
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:51,009
If you feel the heat, it's ready, okay?

1100
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:52,280
Thank you.

1101
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:55,380
Yeong Rye. Get changed and hurry on down.

1102
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:56,580
What?

1103
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,820
I start at 10am. I'm not late yet.

1104
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:00,490
I know.

1105
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:02,690
It's not that you're late.

1106
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:06,890
It's that difficult client, the manager's cut regular.

1107
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:10,459
His cut's done, but he's insisting on getting his hair washed by you.

1108
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:12,199
Says you have the magic touch or something.

1109
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,400
Gosh, he's the worst.

1110
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,639
And has he no manners?

1111
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,869
The way he talks down to people.

1112
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:19,609
If he weren't a customer, I would just...

1113
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:21,280
All right, tell him I'll just be a minute.

More.

1116

- Excuse me? - No, I mean...

1117
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:40,430
It feels great, so do more.

1118
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:42,400
You really do have the magic touch.

1119
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,849
What? Are you crazy?

1120
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,450
Is something the matter, sir?

1121
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:08,059
It seems you suffer from chronic headaches.

1122
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,919
So I just pressed a pressure point for you.

1123
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,529
Did you not like it?

1124
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:14,060
I mean, what kind of pressure point hurts that much?

1125
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,199
It's just, you don't usually make such a peculiar sound.

1126
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,299
Not unless the headache was particularly severe.

1127
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,300
I might have applied a little more pressure.

1128
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:24,670
Would you like me to go a little easier?

1129
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:39,650
Yeong Rye, your boyfriend's here.

I guess this is another one of those days to confess your love?

1133
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:34,639
Maybe this is your chance...

1134
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,609
to finally tell Jae Pil how you feel?

1135
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:37,680
Jae Pil? Where did that come from?

1136
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,079
No, it would just make things weird.

1137
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,719
How long are you going to leave her hanging like this?

1138
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,149
Make your move, you fool.

So what is Yeong Rye to you?

1144
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:54,700
I mean, is she more than a friend?

1145
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:56,530
Are you sure it's okay for me to go?

1146
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:57,930
Of course, it's fine.

1147
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:00,000
I'm only asking because it's you.

1148

- Jong Hee? - Yeong Rye!
