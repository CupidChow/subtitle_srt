9
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,070
What's this? Why isn't she leaving?

10
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,940
- What are you doing? - What's wrong with her?

11
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,420
Jong Hee.

12
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,950
- Jong Hee. - What's going on?

13
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,290
- Jong Hee! - What's wrong with her?

14
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,790
Jong Hee, snap out of it.

15
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,890
Jong Hee!

16
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,160
An ambulance! Someone call an ambulance, quick!

17
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,800
Hurry!

18
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,130
Jong Hee. What do I do?

19
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,140
Back then, I had no idea.

20
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,710
That the series of misfortunes that had befallen us...

21
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,480
was only just the beginning.

22
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,210
And...

23
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,180
Just as it had been with Jong Hee,

24
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,490
that those who leave always come back...

25
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,960
to the crossroads where our separate lives would meet.

26
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,530
To the place our cruel fate was leading us.

(Episode 12: The Unfinished Story)

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,430
Jong Hee, are you okay? Hey.

29
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,700
Are you with me?

30
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,280
It was him.

31
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,680
Him? Who are you talking about?

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
The personnel manager.

33
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,120
I'm sure it was him.

34
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,460
He was staring at me like he wanted to kill me.

35
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,030
The personnel manager?

36
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,130
He went to see Mom.

37
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,830
With my brother.

38
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,110
Claiming I tried to kill him.

39
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,080
If she didn't give him money, he'd go to the press.

40
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,450
But why would he show up there?

41
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,720
Because he knows he can't get anything out of my mom...

42
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,920
So he came to threaten me?

43
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,150
That must be it, right?

44
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,660
That's why he came for me, right? Tell me I'm right.

45
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,690
Jong Hee, I need you to calm down.

46
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,760
Here.

47
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,460
- Have some water... - But I'm telling you, I saw him!

48
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,560
So you're sure... it was definitely him?

49
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,360
The personnel manager, or whatever his name is.

50
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,900
He was glaring at me like he wanted to kill me.

51
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,830
Like it was some kind of warning.

52
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,000
What on earth is he planning?

53
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,970
Why would he show up there?

54
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,440
That's enough. I don't want you to worry about this.

55
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,750
I'll take care of everything.

56
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,320
You just focus on the pageant.

57
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,120
Whatever that scumbag has planned, I'll make sure it comes to nothing.

58
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,630
In return, the star of the pageant must be...

59
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,070
my daughter, Seo Jong Hee.

60
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,230
Understand?

61
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,810
Hey, hold on.

62
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,950
What is it? Who are you?

63
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,180
What happened?

64
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,680
"Miss Korea contestant Seo Jong Hee..."

65
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,650
"tried to commit murder in the past and now lives under a new identity."

66
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,620
You said a story this big would make the front page.

67
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,920
But now there's nothing but radio silence.

68
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,930
You think pushing a pen makes you a reporter?

69
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,130
Look...

70
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,100
Sorry, but that's...

71
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,270
not something you should be taking up with me.

72
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,600
Turns out there's something mightier than the pen.

73
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,310
It's the money that makes the world go around.

74
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,310
If you've got a problem with that, go become a chairman yourself.

75
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,950
Me? I just do what my editor tells me to do.

76
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,390
Make it look like suicide, so untie him. Quickly.

77
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,630
All right.

78
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,730
You sure he won't be able to get free?

79
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,430
After all that booze? No way.

80
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,440
- Hey, bring some more of the booze. - Got it.

81
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,140
Come on, hurry.

82
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,610
Hey, get a good grip.

83
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,280
With how much he drank, it'll be a while before he wakes.

84
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,420
We need to report to Chairman Yang, so let's get a move on.

85
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,520
Right.

86
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,190
Let's lift him.

87
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,690
Throw him in here.

88
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,050
That should do it, right?

89
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,800
You're sure he's taken care of?

90
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,630
Of course. This isn't our first rodeo.

91
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,470
So, about the payment...

92
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,170
I'll wire it to the account we agreed on.

93
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,740
Thanks.

94
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,050
You should've taken the warning seriously.

95
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,450
Foolish.

96
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,930
My, how the time just slips through your fingers.

97
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,470
It's gone in a flash, you know.

98
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,370
I can't believe the Miss Korea finals are tomorrow.

99
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,010
I wonder if Yeong Rye is getting any sleep.

100
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,080
You've been in that one spot for a while now.

101
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,880
You're going to wear a hole in the floor.

102
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,020
Careful, or someone'll report you as a spy.

103
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,790
Just leave it be.

104
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,520
Okay, out with it.

105
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,860
Ms. Ma...

106
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,200
Something's clearly bothering you.

107
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,230
Well...

108
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Worried? About what?

109
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,070
Just give it here.

110
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,540
Huh? No way.

111
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,370
There's definitely something.

112
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,440
Could it be...

113
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,810
Is it about money?

114
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,340
Are you in a hole?

115
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,380
Money's not an issue. I have plenty.

116
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,950
- Hurry, give it here! - See? I knew you were in a hole.

117
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,220
- Hey, I told you I'm not! - Yes, you are.

118
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,790
Hello, Ms. Lim.

119
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,530
Jeong Bun is working late tonight.

120
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,200
And Su Jin is asleep.

121
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,470
Actually, today I'm here to see...

122
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,270
someone else.

123
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,710
- About Su Jin... - About Su Jin...

124
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,780
Please, you first.

125
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,850
No, I insist. You go ahead.

126
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,780
Please. You've seen many more years than I have.

127
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,780
Oh, I don't know about all that...

128
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,490
About last time,

129
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,430
I wanted to say I'm sorry,

130
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,530
and thank you.

131
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,960
I should have been watching Su Jin more closely.

132
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,970
I just looked away for a second.

133
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,270
No, not at all.

134
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,470
I was the one who failed my duty.

135
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,740
Especially since Jeong Bun had asked me to.

136
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,850
And...

137
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,030
Actually, on that day...

138
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,660
I was rather shaken up.

139
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,470
When Su Jin went missing...

140
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,300
seeing you go pale,

141
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,870
frantically searching for her,

142
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,140
and then holding Su Jin, just sobbing uncontrollably...

143
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,350
Seeing you and Jeong Bun...

144
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,560
made me wonder if I deserve to be her father.

145
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,860
That something stronger than blood...

146
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,600
could actually exist.

147
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,170
And that maybe...

148
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,340
That's what a real family is.

149
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,410
So...

150
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,580
I've done a lot of thinking.

151
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,780
I...

152
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,150
I want to ask you, man to man.

153
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,200
Jeong Bun and Su Jin...

154
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,900
Please, take good care of them for me.

155
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,070
Please.

156
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,860
Until that darn Cheol Gu gets here from Changwon,

157
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,400
I have to stick it out here for a few more days.

158
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,430
Walking on eggshells around here is killing me.

159
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,940
Gosh, forget it. Whatever.

160
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,810
Goodness.

161
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,810
Hey, you're back?

162
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,220
You look awful.

163
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,490
What happened? Did you fall in a river?

164
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,630
Why on earth are you still here?

165
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,190
Get lost.

166
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm going to leave.

167
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,970
A friend's coming from out of town in a few days,

168
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,600
and I'll just stay until then.

169
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,370
I told you to get lost!

170
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,610
Do I look like a pushover?

171
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,780
Do I, you jerk?

172
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,650
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

173
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,450
Let go of me so we can talk.

174
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,550
My life has been dragged through the mud.

175
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,290
I'm just trying to get something back for it.

176
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,290
What did I do that was so wrong?

177
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,860
Wrong enough to be killed for it?

178
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,610
This is wrong.

179
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,540
You can't do this.

180
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,810
What did I do that was so wrong?

181
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,520
I was born with nothing,

182
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,190
but I still tried my best to get by.

183
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
I did whatever the company told me,

184
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,070
and I worked my ass off like a dog. That's my only crime.

185
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,120
Miss Korea?

186
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,360
Not a chance.

187
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,660
I'm not going down alone like this.

188
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,930
I'll kill them all.

189
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,820
That was a close one. I almost died.

190
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,970
(Miss Korea Pageant, the Final, at Seoul Cultural Center)

191
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,980
Miss Korea?

192
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,180
Not a chance.

193
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,450
I'm not going down alone like this.

194
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,750
I'll kill them all.

195
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,020
The look in his eyes was pure crazy.

196
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,330
I thought he was going to do something terrible.

197
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,500
Whatever.

198
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,980
Why should I care about a girl who doesn't care for her brother?

199
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,730
Where are you?

200
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,570
Can I help you?

201
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,840
One of the Miss Korea contestants, Seo Jong Hee...

202
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,340
She's Miss Seoul something, right? Anyway,

203
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,810
I'm her older brother. I have to see her. It's urgent.

204
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,980
I'm sorry, sir. That's not possible.

205
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,080
No visitors are allowed during the pageant camp.

206
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,680
As you know, today is the finals, so she can't see anyone.

207
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,120
I know, but this is a real emergency.

208
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,750
Look, I'll be honest.

209
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,490
I'm a total jerk.

210
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,230
I've never been a good brother to her, not once.

211
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,260
But I've got a really bad feeling about this.

212
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,730
I have to see her.

213
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,270
Please! I'm begging you!

214
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,370
I'm telling you, I'm her brother!

215
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,070
God, you're not helping at all.

216
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,610
There's nothing I can do, I'm telling you.

217
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,280
Oh, come on, man!

218
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,580
Just... be reasonable.

219
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,190
Hey, Seo Jong Yeon!

220
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,120
Hey, Seo Jong Hee!

221
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,560
Seo Jong Hee, stop right there!

222
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,710
We are live at the 33rd Annual Miss Korea Pageant,

223
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,610
broadcasting from the Seoul Cultural Center.

224
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,230
Jong Hee, if it hurts, let me know.

225
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,440
Don't try too hard to relax.

226
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,740
If you're nervous, just be nervous. Show them the real Koh Yeong Rye.

227
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,280
Just speak your mind.

228
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,220
The judges and the audience,

229
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,750
they all want to see that kind of sincerity.

230
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,550
Yes, Director.

231
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,760
Gosh, it's hot.

232
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,130
- Ms. Jo, her blush. - Yes.

233
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,500
A little more colour.

234
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,930
Yes, ma'am.

235
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,540
Our Jong Hee is the best!

236
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,280
Jong Hee, listen to me.

237
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,650
Whether or not you win that crown...

238
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,280
Our salon's entire future is riding on it.

239
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,090
You can't forget that. Understood?

240
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,520
Yes, of course.

241
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,790
A pin.

244
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,740
Oh, my goodness.

245
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,740
It's not like I'm the one in this pageant,

246
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,070
so why am I so nervous?

247
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,080
Hey, give me one of those.

248
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,780
You're having another one?

249
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,280
I need it to calm my nerves.

250
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,250
Mom, how many of those have you had? That's enough.

251
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,760
Your heart's going to stop at this rate.

252
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,360
Can I have one too? I'm so nervous.

253
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,090
This isn't for kids.

254
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,730
You just pray.

255
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,270
I'll pray too.

256
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,770
Please let Aunt Yeong Rye become Miss Korea.

257
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,810
By the way, where is Jae Pil? Why isn't he here yet?

258
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,980
It's about to start.

259
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,440
You're right.

260
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,580
He said he'd slip out of work early.

261
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,150
He's cutting it really close.

262
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,050
I'll go check outside for him.

263
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,790

264
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,060
Su Jin, you be a good girl for Mom, okay?

265
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,860
I'll be right back.

266
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,160
Let's sit up nice and pretty.

267
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,300
Goodness.

268
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,030
Sorry. Excuse me.

269
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,970
The final call was ages ago. Is he stuck in traffic?

270
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,230
He's running late.

271
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,840
Hey, you're going to burn a hole through that clock.

272
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,040
If you're that antsy, just leave it to us and go.

273
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,940
The entire country knows the Miss Korea pageant is today.

274
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,880
You're just itching to go cheer on your girlfriend, right?

275
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,320
Go on. Go.

276
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,520
We can handle things here, so just go, all right?

277
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,620
Are you serious? You really mean it?

278
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,520
Thank you so much. I swear, I'll never forget this.

279
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,720
I owe you my life!

280
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:37,970
Hold on tight.

281
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,370
- Careful. - All right, easy now. Easy.

282
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,080
One, two, three.

283
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,550
What happened?

284
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,350
He was in a motorcycle accident at the Jeongyu-dong intersection.

285
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,250
He lost consciousness from the impact.

286
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,680
And he has fractures in his arm and leg.

287
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,620
- What? - Unbelievable.

288
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,720
Hey, Seo Jong Yeon!

289
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
Hey!

290
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,690
You think changing your name changes anything?

291
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,830
Get the ultrasound ready. Move it!

292
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,030
Let's go, let's go!

293
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,900
Come on. Hurry!

294
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:15,180
And now, we proudly present the 1989 Miss Korea Pageant.

295
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,680
Let the glamorous festivities begin!

296
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,220
Oh my gosh, there she is, Yeong Rye! There she is, over there!

297
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,620
I see her! I have eyes too, you know.

298
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,330
To think the girls we ate and slept side-by-side with in Room 3...

299
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,630
are now in the Miss Korea pageant.

300
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,060
And two of them, at that.

301
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,070
I'm feeling so ambidextrous about all this.

302
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,600
You mean ambivalent, not ambidextrous.

303
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,440
Ambidextrous, ambivalent. Tomayto, tomahto.

304
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
Anyway...

305
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,770
Let's just pray.

306
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,610
That one of them makes it.

307
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,540
But it'd be even better if it was Yeong Rye.

308
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,040
Sir, are you awake?

309
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,320
Do you know...

310
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
who I am?

311
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,060
We met at the police station seven years ago, right?

312
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,330
I wasn't sure at first, but it really is you.

313
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,300
You were knocked out in the crash,

314
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,800
but luckily, your organs and brain...

315
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,800
are fine.

316
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,200
The fractures in your arms and legs aren't too serious either.

317
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,840
But you'll still need to be admitted.

318
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,810
Since we know each other, I couldn't just leave.

319
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,950
Right now...

320
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,280
I don't have time for this. I have to get to Jong Hee.

321
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,490
If you mean the Miss Korea pageant, you can't go in your condition.

322
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,920
It's not that.

323
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,160
Jong Hee is in danger.

324
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
What?

325
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,490
Who knows what that jerk will do? I have to go warn Jong Hee, quickly.

326
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,370
Our next contestant is contestant number ten,

327
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,540
from Seoul, Seo Jong Hee.

328
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,940
A physical education major at Youngin University,

329
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,010
her special talent is equestrianism.

330
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,520
Hello, everyone.

331
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,590
With a beauty from a balance of mind, body, and character,

332
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,390
I am contestant number ten, Seo Jong Hee.

333
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,030
I also want to share Korea's beauty with the rest of the world.

334
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,760
That is a cherished dream of mine.

335
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,560
Thank you.

336
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:33,240
Next, we have contestant number 11, from Seoul, Koh Yeong Rye.

337
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
It's Yeong Rye!

338
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,880
The eldest daughter in a family of four children,

339
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,650
she currently works as a hairstylist.

340
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,120
I believe that what's on the inside...

341
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,990
is more beautiful than what's on the outside.

342
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,460
I am contestant number 11, Koh Yeong Rye.

343
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,800
As Miss Korea, I will embody that value.

344
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,530
Thank you.

345
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,610
She's so pretty. Our daughter is so beautiful.

346
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,230
That punk, the personnel manager...

347
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,670
He's lost his mind.

348
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,770
He doesn't care about the pageant. He said he's going to kill everyone.

349
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,670
I even saw him grab a knife.

350
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,820
And now, the eight who will be Miss Korea for one year,

351
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,880
share our country's beauty...

352
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,790
with the world and at international pageants.

353
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,220
I will now announce their names.

354
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,670
Contestant number 15, from Daegu,

355
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,130

356
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,720
Contestant number 40, from New York,

357
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,890
Pyo Se Rim.

358
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,930
Contestant number 36, from South Jeolla Province,

359
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,700
Hyun Hae Kyung.

360
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,660
You can't go in right now.

361
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,130
But...

362
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,500
I have an invitation.

363
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,100
Even with an invite, you can't enter.

364
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,670
- The show is on the air. - But please.

365
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,900
This is an emergency.

366
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,900
You can't, sir. You just can't.

367
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,180
(1989 Miss Korea Pageant)

368
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,390
The seventh finalist is...

369
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,220
Contestant number ten, from Seoul...

370
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,930
Seo Jong Hee!

371
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,730
Alright, only one spot left.

372
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,630
And our final contestant is...

373
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,970
Contestant number 11, from Seoul...

374
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,570
Koh Yeong Rye!

375
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,740
Thank you. Thank you so much.

376
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,200
All right. For the eight finalists we just announced,

377
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,030
let's have a huge round of applause!

378
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:10,680
Now, let's have a little chat with our eight finalists.

379
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,820
And as the host, I'll be choosing the order at random.

380
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,130
Okay, first up,

381
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,290
Ms. Seo Jong Hee from Seoul.

382
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,230
Yes, hello.

383
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,540
I imagine this is your first time on such a big stage.

384
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,570
A lot of memories must be running through your mind.

385
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,350
So, Seo Jong Hee, what does "memory" mean to you?

386
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,320
To me, a memory is...

387
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,920
a bus that's already left.

388
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,430
A bus that's already left?

389
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,800
That's an interesting answer. Why is that?

390
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,100
Because a bus that has left...

391
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,840
will never come back, no matter how hard you chase it.

392
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,840
That's why...

393
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,680
instead of living in the past, I choose to live in the moment...

394
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,710
and look forward to the future.

395
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,250
For example?

396
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,280
If I had a time machine,

397
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,350
I'd go five minutes into the future...

398
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,590
to see whether I'll be the one wearing the crown tonight.

399
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,530
Why not take a peek?

400
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,600
That was a very clever answer from Seo Jong Hee.

401
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,040
All right, next up,

402
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,080
Miss Seoul, Koh Yeong Rye.

403
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,980
A moment ago, Seo Jong Hee mentioned a time machine.

404
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,250
If a time machine appeared in front of you right now,

405
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,990
Yeong Rye, where in time would you go?

406
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,700
I would...

407
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,830
go back to the time when I was...

408
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,940
working as a bus conductor.

409
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,580
Oh, so you used to work as a bus conductor.

410
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,410
Yes.

411
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,750
For me, that time...

412
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,690
was the prime of my youth.

413
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,560
And it was...

414
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,530
when I met my most...

415
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,630
precious friend.

416
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,700
It sounds like you have many wonderful memories with your friend.

417
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,200
I'm envious.

418
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,640
So if you took that time machine back to those days,

419
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,480
what would you want to do, Yeong Rye?

420
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,310
If I went back,

421
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,150
I would want to hold...

422
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,320
that friend tightly.

423
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,660
Back then, I didn't understand...

424
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,200
what she was going through.

425
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,800
I'd tell her she didn't have to.

426
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,740
That she shouldn't be unhappy...

427
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,170
because of me.

428
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,440
I'd tell her I'm sorry...

429
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,010
and that I'm grateful.

430
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,480
That's what I would want to tell her.

431
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,530
And finally...

432
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,230
a bus that has left may not return,

433
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,840
but if you wait patiently where you are,

434
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,970
it will eventually come back around.

435
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,580
That's what I'd want to tell her.

436
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,350
That's a beautiful sentiment.

437
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:09,190
Now, for Koh Yeong Rye's courageous confession,

438
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,620
let's give her a huge round of applause!

439
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,510
All right, now for the 1989 pageant,

440
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,210
we'll start by announcing Miss Korea Mi, the 3rd place.

441
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,120
And Miss Korea Mi is...

442
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,130
Contestant number 19, Miss Incheon, Kim Hyeon Yeong!

443
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,530
Congratulations.

444
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,020
And now, all that's left is the coveted Miss Korea Jin title...

445
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,830
and Miss Korea Seon.

446
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:23,160
The winner of Miss Korea Jin will go to an international pageant,

447
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,200
receive a 15,000 dollar scholarship...

448
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,030
and be awarded an additional prize and a trophy.

449
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,700
The award will be presented by last year's winner...

450
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,140
Miss Korea 1988, Hwang Seon Ah.

451
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,190
She's pretty.

452
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,030
Alright.

453
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,140
Let's see who it is.

454
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:18,920
And the title of Miss Korea 1989 goes to...

455
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,170
Contestant number 10, Seo Jong Hee from Seoul!

456
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Congratulations!

457
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,780
Contestant number 11, Koh Yeong Rye from Seoul,

458
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,820
automatically becomes the first runner-up.

459
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,860
Congratulations!

460
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,400
What about you?

461
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,400
Do you have a dream?

462
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,300
Of course, I do.

463
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,640
I...

464
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,970
I might just become Miss Korea.

465
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,780
Gosh, that's amazing.

466
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,080
I bet you'll actually do it.

467
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,430
And now,

468
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,590
let's hear the acceptance speech...

469
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,160
from our new Miss Korea 1989,

470
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,730
Seo Jong Hee.

471
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,250
Thank you.

472
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,620
This is such an overwhelming night.

473
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,590
I will never forget this moment.

474
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,560
Thank you.

475
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,460
You both did so well.

476
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,390
Yeong Rye.

477
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,700
Yeong Rye.

478
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,340
Yeong Rye!

479
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,120
Yeong Rye, look at me.

480
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,320
Yeong Rye.

481
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,830
Yeong Rye. Stay with me.

482
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,500
Yeong Rye.

483
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,030
Yeong Rye, look at me.

484
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,360
- Jong Hee. - Yeong Rye.

485
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,130
I told you, didn't I?

486
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,440
I had a feeling you'd make your dream come true.

487
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,740
That you'd become a star that shines brighter than any other.

488
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,310
I wanted to be there to see it happen.

489
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,450
More than anyone else,

490
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,880
I wanted to congratulate you in person with all my heart.

491
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,720
Will I...

492
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,890
be able to do that?

493
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
Will I ever...

494
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,330
see you again?

495
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,710
And in our next story.

496
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,050
An update on the recent incident at the Miss Korea pageant.

497
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,520
A Mr. Noh, who rushed the stage in a stabbing attack...

498
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,480
and then fled the scene,

499
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,990
has been arrested by the police.

500
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:24,920
Police are interrogating Mr. Noh to determine the motive,

501
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,930
and a thorough investigation is underway.

502
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,100
(Yeong Sik's Restaurant)

503
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,670
(Closed for personal reasons)

504
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,780
Darn it all.

505
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,050
You can't even go outside, just lying here all day,

506
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,120
and your hands get this filthy even after just one day.

507
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,750
I can't tell if this place is just dirty,

508
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,820
or if you're secretly getting up and sneaking around when I'm gone,

509
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,660
only to lie back down and pretend you haven't moved an inch.

510
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:10,170
I almost wish that were the case.

511
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,310
Visiting hours are over, ma'am.

512
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:24,280
I'll stay here, so why don't you go get some rest?

513
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,850
You're the one who needs to get some sleep.

514
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,160
You haven't slept in days.

515
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,760
Between work and watching Yeong Rye, you must be exhausted.

516
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,000
You're going to collapse before she even wakes up.

517
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,300
No, I'm not.

518
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:43,940
I'm okay, really.

519
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,050
Hey.

520
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,620
Isn't that the girl who just won Miss Korea?

521
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,560
Oh, I think you're right.

522
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Excuse me.

523
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,970
You're Seo Jong Hee, right?

524
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,510
This year's Miss Korea.

525
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,780
You look like you can hold your liquor. Why are you all by yourself?

526
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,750
Want to join us?

527
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,380
I'd rather drink alone.

528
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,590
Oh, come on. Have a drink with us.

529
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,860
Right. What's the fun in drinking alone?

530
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,990
Join us, won't you?

531
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,690
I said I want to drink alone.

532
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,200
So stop bothering me and go try someone else.

533
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,570
Look, I get that you're going through something.

534
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:57,680
But it's dangerous for Miss Korea to get wasted in a place like this.

535
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,580
Especially since you almost got stabbed.

536
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,350
We're saying we'll be your bodyguards.

537
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:05,250
It's free, and you'll be safe.

538
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,420
Killing 2 birds with 1 stone, right?

539
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,420
Get lost.

540
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,320
I don't need it.

541
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,200
Now you're just making us look like creeps.

542
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,970
We just asked for one drink. Why are you playing so hard to get?

543
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,070
Who are you?

544
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,240
I'm with her.

545
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,980
Get up. Let's go.

546
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,830
Come on, let's go.

547
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,200
I need to take you home and then get to the hospital.

548
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,380
But...

549
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,250
Don't you hate me?

550
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,960
This is all my fault.

551
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,230
I was supposed to get hurt, but Yeong Rye took my place.

552
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,570
And do you know what I said to her?

553
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,670
I told her it was all her fault.

554
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,480
That I was miserable all over again.

555
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:44,520
That I felt so lonely I could die, so pathetic.

556
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,090
I told her all of that was because of her.

557
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,460
I said it was all Yeong Rye's fault.

558
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,910
I don't know everything that happened between you two...

559
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:10,180
But I don't want you to torture yourself with guilt.

560
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,480
You both made your own choices.

561
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,750
And this is what happened.

562
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,860
It's just the way things turned out. It's nobody's fault.

563
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,360
Yeong Sik.

564
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,430
I'm so scared.

565
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,270
What if Yeong Rye never wakes up?

566
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,210
What if I never get to see her again?

567
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,910
I never even got to say I was sorry.

568
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,220
Or that I still loved her the most.

569
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,350
That's why I hated her even more. I never got to tell her how I felt.

570
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:58,390
But if she never wakes up, what am I going to do?

571
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:07,230
That's not going to happen. This is Koh Yeong Rye, after all.

572
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,370
Yeong Rye will wake up soon.

573
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:14,670
She will.

574
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:22,820
She has to.

575
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,470
So, are we sure they've left the country?

576
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,200
If they get caught, I'm in danger too.

577
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,040
Even an attempt, I can't escape a solicitation of murder charge.

578
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,580
I should've made sure he was finished back then.

579
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,810
I gave him an excuse to retaliate, and Jong Hee almost died.

580
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,150
What are you talking about?

581
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:04,820
Jong Hee.

582
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,860
What did you just say? Solicitation of murder?

583
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:13,930
Don't tell me...

584
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,440
Mom, did you hire someone to kill the manager?

585
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,310
Is that why it happened?

586
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,550
Is that why that man tried to kill me?

587
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:33,950
I had no other choice back then. It was to protect you.

588
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,260
How was that protecting me? How?

589
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,830
Because of what you did, my friend got stabbed instead of me.

590
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,030
She's still unconscious, lying there in a vegetative state.

591
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,540
Her family is worried sick.

592
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,310
How...

593
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,280
How was that protecting me?

594
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,650
That's not what that was.

595
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,380
That's not love.

596
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,590
Jong Hee.

597
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,190
Jong Hee.

598
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,420
Just calm down first, okay?

599
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,930
- Just calm down. - No.

600
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:14,990
Jong Hee.

601
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:16,530
I'm not doing this anymore.

602
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,440
Jong Hee.

603
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,310
Jong Hee, don't do this, okay?

604
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,110
Don't do this, Jong Hee. Please.

605
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:36,080
You're just upset right now.

606
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,050
Let's talk about this calmly with me and work it out, okay?

607
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,520
No.

608
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:45,890
You know it too.

609
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,960
This "perfect daughter" act you've staged...

610
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,230
is over now.

611
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,710
If you walk out that door,

612
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:03,580
I'll never see you again.

613
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,850
You're going to regret this, Seo Jong Hee!

614
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:09,820
Jong Hee.

615
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:36,740
Are you Yang Mi Suk?

616
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,610
We're from the Jung-gu Police Station.

617
00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:00,530
(Customers will come back when they leave with a smile.)

618
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,950
(Closed for personal reasons)

619
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,850
Stay here for a while.

620
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,190
Just until Yeong Rye comes back.

621
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:56,520
If you need to apologise to her...

622
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,760
When Yeong Rye wakes up and comes home,

623
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,490
You can tell her you're sorry to her face then.

624
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,900
Yeong Rye.

625
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,080
Yeong Rye.

626
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,480
It's a great song, isn't it?

627
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,080
No matter when I hear it...

628
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:56,530
You know...

629
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,930
I listen to this song hundreds of times a day.

630
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,340
Somehow, I feel like you're playing it for me.

631
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,650
Like you're right here next to me.

632
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:17,450
If I don't at least listen to this,

633
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,720
I can't function.

634
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,230
So...

635
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,870
So you have to hang in there too.

636
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,340
Listen to this song...

637
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,650
One, two, three.

638
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,320
- Let me try one more time. - Okay.

639
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,220
- Go for it. - Give me the camera.

640
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,400
Here.

641
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,200
See that? Did you see? I did it again!

642
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,480
Jong Hee!

643
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:55,450
Han Jae Pil.

644
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,380
Ma Sang Cheol.

645
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:03,520
Where did everyone go?

646
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:07,030
Stop joking around.

647
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:10,300
Seo Jong Hee!

648
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:24,470
Jae Pil.

649
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,310
Jae Pil.

650
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,780
Jae Pil!

651
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,630
Ma'am, are you waking up?

652
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,460
Doctor! Doctor Han!

653
01:04:58,760 --> 01:04:59,990
Hello?

654
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:02,830
Yes.

655
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,200
Oh, thank goodness.

656
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,440
Thank you so much.

657
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,280
Wait, wait! Mr. Ma!

658
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,320
Mr. Ma! I'll go get Mr. Ma!

659
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,030
- Jong Hee! Jong Hee! - Jong Hee!

660
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,620
(1 year later)

661
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:04,690
In a novel, characters...

662
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:08,230
are the key element that drives the narrative forward.

663
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,100
For example,

664
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:12,100
in Lee Mun Yol's "Son of Man..."

665
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:14,270
The protagonist, through various social...

666
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:16,270
and personal conflicts,

667
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:18,300
demonstrates growth.

668
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,870
This internal transformation of the character...

669
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,940
and the reflection of their external situation...

670
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,410
are what gives the novel its depth.

671
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:30,320
Characters aren't just there to have things happen to them.

672
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:35,050
Yeong Rye, come on, we'll be late for the wedding.

673
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:38,020
I'm sorry. I had a last-minute make-up class.

674
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,960
After Jong Hee gave up her scholarship grant for you,

675
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,290
I couldn't just skip class, right?

676
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,700
- Get in. Wait, hold on. - What?

677
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,430
Where's your dress?

678
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:47,130
Ho Sook is bringing it straight to the venue.

679
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,470
Wait, are you sure it's safe for me to get on this?

680
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:51,470
Why?

681
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:53,400
I'm asking if I can really trust you with my life.

682
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,770
Fine, then you can take a taxi. I'm leaving.

683
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:56,770
Wait!

684
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:58,210
Oh, whatever.

685
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:01,080
I already cheated death once. Might as well leave it to fate.

686
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:02,550
Let's go! Go, go!

687
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:10,590
All right, great!

688
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,860
Big smiles from both of you!

689
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,460
- Groom, give me a big smile. - Okay, okay.

690
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,670
- Try to relax. - Okay.

691
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,230
Let's take one more.

692
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:24,000
Smile!

693
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,810
You've got to do something about those hiccups.

694
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:30,280
You're making me nervous too.

695
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:34,280
Want another glass of water? I'll get it for you.

696
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,280
I can't drink anymore.

697
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,680
I already drank so much.

698
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,650
I think my bladder's about to burst.

699
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:43,620
You're a doctor, aren't you?

700
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,160
Can't you do something?

701
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:48,190
It's not really something a doctor can do anything about.

702
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:49,460
It's psychological.

703
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,460
You're just feeling temporary stress and anxiety.

704
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,530
It seems like your diaphragm isn't working properly right now.

705
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:56,030
Let's do a breathing exercise. Copy me.

706
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,040
Okay.

707
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,540
I'm sorry. I'm not too late, am I?

708
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,780
Well, well. If it isn't Miss Korea.

709
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:08,280
The taping for my show ran late. I was afraid I wouldn't make it.

710
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,380
Honey.

711
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,520
I feel like I'm going to be sick.

712
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:14,850
I think I need to go to the restroom.

713
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,520
Just wait here, okay? I'll be right back.

714
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,260
But it's about to start...

715
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:22,090
Come on, honey...

716
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,360
You're not running away, are you?

717
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,900
Hey, your dress! The dress!

718
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:27,630
Hey! I wanted to get a picture...

719
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,230
Wait!

720
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:32,400
What's the point of all of us rushing over there?

721
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:34,310
Let them work it out on their own.

722
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:37,310
Still, I feel like I should go check on them.

723
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:44,580
What's wrong? Why are you acting like this?

724
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:46,820
It's just...

725
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,550
You look especially beautiful today.

726
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,560
I've wanted to do this for a while now.

727
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:56,830
This is nice.

728
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,970
I can't wait.

729
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:06,300
I was going to give this to you after the ceremony.

730
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:12,410
What... What is this?

731
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,580
I went to buy a tie, but I saw this and thought it was pretty.

732
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:26,520
It's my way of calling dibs, to let everyone know you're taken.

733
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,930
You can't take this off, all right?

734
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:34,600
It's so beautiful.

735
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:39,440
Honestly, I wanted to give you a ring,

736
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:43,470
but I thought that might be too much pressure for now.

737
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:45,440
After you finish school,

738
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:47,710
and when I become an attending physician,

739
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:52,050
let's get married then.

740
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,320
I mean, it is a proposal, but...

741
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,030
this isn't the official one. I'll do that properly later.

742
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,560
But if I don't at least do this,

743
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:04,500
I'm just so worried someone else will snatch you up.

744
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:33,220
(Gimpo International Airport)

745
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:37,900
After your meetings, you're stopping in Europe, right?

746
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:39,430
For how long?

747
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:41,700
About a week or two?

748
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,500
What? For that long?

749
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,270
Things have been crazy, launching the apparel line.

750
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,370
I've already spoken to my father, so cut me some slack.

751
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,140
And as for me,

752
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,350
don't you think I need some time to get my head on straight?

753
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:56,810
Excuse me?

754
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:04,460
All fairy tales have pretty much the same ending.

755
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,060
Even "Daddy-Long-Legs."

756
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,730
"And they all lived happily"

757
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:17,970
"ever after."

758
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:21,410
The End."

759
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,680
All right, friends and family.

760
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,990
Please stand next to and behind the bride and groom.

761
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:38,660
Big smiles, everyone!

762
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,090
Nice and bright now. Okay, let's take another one.

763
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,900
Okay, one, two, three!

764
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,770
Hey, the groom's side over there.

765
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,440
Could you squeeze in a little tighter?

766
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:57,680
Yes, and the bride's side, could you move in a bit too?

767
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,440
All right, perfect.

768
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,850
All right, perfect. Taking the shot. One, two, three!

769
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:08,250
You, there, at the end of the front row.

770
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,190
You're blocked. I can barely see you.

771
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:11,520
Could you move in a little?

772
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,930
Closer, closer.

773
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,060
Come over here, Jong Hee.

774
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:22,130
Yes, right there. That should work.

775
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,140
Yes, great. Okay, hold it right there.

776
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:27,810
Okay, everyone, smile!

777
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,770
Everybody, smile!

778
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:31,410
- Smile! - Smile!

779
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,580
Absolutely perfect!

780
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:39,580
Whoever wants to catch the bouquet, please come forward now.

781
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:46,960
All right, Bride. As we practised. A gentle toss over your shoulder.

782
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,290
Ready?

783
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:51,100
One, two, three!

784
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,540
It's all good.

785
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,480
All's well that ends well, right?

786
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,350
It found its rightful owner, so it's all good.

787
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:14,690
I got it!

788
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:17,720
Perfect!

789
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,790
And for the last shot, let's get another one with everyone.

790
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,560
One, two, three!

791
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,930
- Smile! - Smile!

792
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:28,170
Bigger smiles! Just one more.

793
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,170
Okay, really, this is the last one.

794
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:31,370
Be happy.

795
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:33,170
- Okay, big smiles! - Choi Jeong Bun.

796
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:37,680
And you too, Su Jin.

797
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,720
Have a good trip, Mom.

798
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:47,390
Okay, I'll be back before you know it.

799
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:48,850
You know the old saying.

800
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,090
"You follow your love wherever they may go."

801
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:53,420
So no more bickering, you two. Live a happy life together.

802
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:55,990
I'll take good care of Su Jin, so don't you worry.

803
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:58,730
While you're on your honeymoon, give Su Jin a little sibling.

804
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,570
What do you call it?

805
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,330
- A honeymoon baby? - Right, that's the one.

806
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,970
Why don't you bring one of those back with you?

807
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:07,540
Oh, Mom.

808
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,910
- We'll give it our all! - Go for it!

809
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,840
Hey, you better get going before the sun sets.

810
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,680
Have a great trip! And take lots of pictures.

811
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,910
- Have a good trip! - Bye!

812
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,580
- Have a safe trip. - Su Jin.

813
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:18,580
Be a good girl for Grandma, okay? We'll be back soon.

814
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:20,420
- Go on, you'll hit traffic. - Okay.

815
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,920
- Go on, go! - Okay, we're going.

816
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,190
- Bye, Mommy! - Bye!

817
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:26,320
Goodness. They tied so many cans to the car.

818
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,800
I'm so jealous.

819
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:34,430
They're hitting Gangjin, Tongyeong, and Gangneung on their trip, right?

820
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:37,640
Yes. A road trip like that was always Sangcheol's dream.

821
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,440
You have the whole day off today, right?

822
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:45,910
Want to get out of the city for a bit?

823
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:47,580
Okay.

824
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,010
Let's do it.

825
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:06,000
Gosh, the sea at Incheon. It's been forever.

826
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:09,130
Tell me about it. It really has been a while.

827
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:13,070
Jong Hee.

828
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,210
- You know what? - What?

829
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:17,740
Why don't seagulls fly over the bay?

830
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:20,240
"Why don't seagulls fly over the bay?"

831
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:23,150
I don't know, why?

832
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,450
Because...

833
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,250
Then they'd be bagels!

834
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:31,360
Get it?

835
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,430
Over the bay, so they'd be bagels.

836
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:37,600
You think that's funny?

837
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,900
Gosh, don't tell jokes like that.

838
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,800
Seriously, they're not funny at all.

839
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,340
What? Jae Pil thought it was funny.

840
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,070
Right, Jae Pil?

841
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,310
Hey, you two. How could you put me on the spot?

842
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,180
Who knows?

843
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,280
- I'm out of here! - Hey!

844
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:57,380
Hey!

845
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,950
Your bag's going to get soaked!

846
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:01,690
We're not going to chase you!

847
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,560
We're not chasing you!

848
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,330
- Let's go, let's go. - So long!

849
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,530
Come on, let's go.

850
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,430
And so, this is how our story ends.

851
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:53,360
The story of our youth. It was exhausting and shabby.

852
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:58,870
But it sparkled and shined because we had each other.

853
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,910
Of you from those brilliant days.

854
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:06,910
Of me.

855
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:08,910
And...

856
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:11,450
of us.

857
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,390
In the years to come,

858
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:17,720
we will be hurt by life's rough seas,

859
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,060
and we will heal.

860
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:20,790
We will cry, and we will laugh.

861
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:23,930
But we are not afraid.

862
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:28,330
Because we will always be together.

863
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:32,440
And so,

864
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,070
perhaps,

865
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,910
our story is not over yet.
