7
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,870
Hold on, sir.

8
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,370
Thanks.

9
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,370
You didn't have to come all this way.

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,470
Of course, ma'am.

11
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,880
I drove you all the way out there.

12
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,540
Go on in. I'll just take this.

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,810
Okay. Get home safe.

14
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,420
Yeong Rye!

15
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,650
- Ho Suk. - You haven't heard, have you?

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,090
I just got a call from Sae Ri.

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,260
She said her dad's disappeared.

18
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,690
What?

19
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,490
Sae Ri was hysterical.

20
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,160
Mom called Judanhak...

21
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,800
and started screaming, "Get me Seong Man Ok!"

22
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,430
Yeong Rye, take this.

23
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,870
Okay.

24
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,550
Jae Pil!

25
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,960
Sae Ri!

26
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,260
- Yeong Rye! - Yeong Rye!

27
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,390
Man Ok.

28
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,100
What happened? Where is he?

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,370
We've looked everywhere, but he's not around here.

30
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,299
And the police...

31
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,300
They said we have to wait 24 hours to file a report, as he's an adult.

32
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,210
Yeong Rye, what if we can't find him?

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,409
What if we never find him?

34
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,609
It's going to be okay.

35
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,110
I'm such an idiot.

36
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,480
As if that little bit of extra money was so important.

37
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,620
Leaving him with just a kid...

38
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,259
I should have just put my foot down and refused to leave.

39
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,789
I should've stayed right by his side.

40
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,729
Don't worry, ma'am. I'm sure he'll come home.

41
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,899
Yes, you're right. He'll come back, right?

42
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,970
You don't think he'd do anything drastic, do you?

43
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,270
Of course not. That's ridiculous, ma'am.

44
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,440
There's absolutely no way that would happen. No way.

45
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,710
Let's go inside and wait for now.

46
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,380
You too, Sae Ri. Let's go.

47
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,920
(Episode 10: Close to You)

48
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:58,100
(We're closed for dinner for personal reasons.)

49
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,040
Even so, do you really need to close the restaurant?

50
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,209
I can just go make the deliveries and come back.

51
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,710
You should stay and keep the restaurant open.

52
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,950
The dinner rush is our main business.

53
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,420
Oh, forget it. It's fine.

54
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,990
People come before money, not the other way around.

55
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
I have to go.

56
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,730
I'm sure Man Ok...

57
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,470
is probably too worried to eat, just pacing around.

58
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,300
I need to go make her eat something, even if I have to force-feed her.

59
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,910
And check on Sae Ri too.

60
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,810
You're something else.

61
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,110
What? What is it?

62
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,480
A minute ago, you were saying, "We're born alone and die alone."

63
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,480
So what's Man Ok to you? She's not family.

64
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,190
It's not like you're blood related. Is she your younger or older sister?

65
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,090
A friend.

66
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,290
What?

67
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,660
She and I are friends.

68
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,800
That's why I have to go and comfort her.

69
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,970
I'll go with you, Mom.

70
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,870
Sae Ri is my friend too.

71
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,550
Seo Jong Hee.

72
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,590
What brings you here all of a sudden?

73
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,860
No reason.

74
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,870
Do you have some time to hang out?

75
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,450
Forget horseback riding. Shouldn't you be playing baseball?

76
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,890
You're a natural at this.

77
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,160
I hit these whenever I'm feeling stressed.

78
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,890
I just come here.

79
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,540
Gosh, that feels so good.

80
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,850
You say that, but your expression says otherwise.

81
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,080
Gosh, you're like a mind reader.

82
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,850
I've always wondered.

83
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,290
How can you read my mind so easily?

84
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,760
It's a little scary sometimes.

85
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,100
You see things when you pay attention.

86
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,400
So you're interested in me?

87
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,300
Not that kind of interest.

88
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,580
I guess seven years is a really long time.

89
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,350
You know that feeling?

90
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Like everyone else is moving forward,

91
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,059
but you're the only one who can't take a single step,

92
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,600
just stuck wandering around the starting line.

93
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,070
I want to be a part of it.

94
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,870
I want to move forward with them.

95
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,340
But I don't even know how to catch up.

96
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,350
So, what happened to you during those seven years?

97
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,250
A lot can happen in seven years.

98
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,760
Just like it did for you.

99
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,730
Remember when I...

100
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,800
told you to be honest about your feelings?

101
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,940
But while you should be honest with yourself,

102
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,500
don't rush into anything.

103
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,280
Respect other people's feelings and just...

104
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,150
let things take their natural course.

105
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,480
Their natural course?

106
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,200
If Yeong Rye and I got in a fight,

107
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,830
you'd take her side, wouldn't you?

108
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,270
Because that's the natural course of things.

109
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,900
I would.

110
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,540
But I hope you two don't fight.

111
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,650
Because I'd want to be on your side too.

112
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,680
You're just saying that.

113
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,290
Still, hearing you say that does make me feel a little better.

114
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,820
It's comforting.

115
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,160
I guess I have to do what I can.

116
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,570
You should go now.

117
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,070
I've taken up too much of your time.

118
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,860
Yeong Bae, bring Sae Ri out. She needs to eat.

119
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,720
Okay, one second.

120
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,030
Let's go get something to eat, okay?

121
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,260
Sae Ri.

122
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,070
I don't want to eat.

123
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,640
I was a real jerk to him.

124
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,200
I complained leaving the hospital was useless.

125
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,170
Because he wouldn't let me go to your house,

126
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,680
I showed that I was upset about it.

127
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,119
You know that song Yeong Mi's been listening to?

128
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,560
It's called "Don't Worry, Be Happy."

129
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,260
What does that mean?

130
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,530
You're not making fun of me...

131
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,940
for getting a 32 on my English midterm,

132
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,700
are you?

133
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,670
It means, "Don't worry, be happy."

134
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,210
"Don't worry, be happy."

135
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,750
"Don't worry, be happy."

136
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,920
It says everyone has some trouble in their life.

137
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,650
But when you worry, you make it double.

138
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,520
So...

139
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,990
"Don't worry, be happy."

140
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,560
"It will soon pass, whatever it is."

141
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,460
Don't worry, be happy.

142
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,630
And whatever it is, it will pass.

143
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,300
That's the message.

144
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,240
He's going to be okay.

145
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,180
This is so frustrating.

146
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,149
Why do you have to be so cool at a time like this?

147
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,620
Koh Yeong Bae, Yepon

148
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,500
I know your heart must be all over the place,

149
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,030
but you have to eat something.

150
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,640
You need your strength to find him...

151
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,370
and deal with what comes next.

152
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,040
Come on, have a bite.

153
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,810
I made it easy to swallow and seasoned it lightly.

154
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,310
I made it all for you. Come on.

155
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,849
Here.

156
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,690
Thank you, but...

157
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,260
I don't think I could swallow a thing right now.

158
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,630
Yeah, I know exactly how you feel.

159
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,400
They can drive you crazy, but you still love them.

160
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,900
When my husband was sick in bed, I felt the exact same way.

161
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,969
You may bicker and fight,

162
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,010
but in an instant, you feel sorry, and your heart aches for them.

163
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,680
He's going to be okay, right?

164
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,980
He hasn't collapsed somewhere, has he?

165
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,019
You said he took his wallet, right?

166
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,720
His ID is in it,

167
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,420
and if he'd collapsed, we'd have gotten a call by now.

168
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,230
For sure. Of course.

169
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,930
But you know what? Now I'm getting angry again.

170
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:22,070
A man his age should know better. Why make his family worry like this?

171
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,640
Especially since he's not well. Why on earth would he just leave?

172
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,110
We had a fight.

173
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,850
What?

174
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,920
I talked back to my father.

175
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,220
I just couldn't understand...

176
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,389
why he has to be so stubborn every single time.

177
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,830
I told him to stay at the hospital, but he just wouldn't listen...

178
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,700
Jae Pil.

179
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,440
Jae Pil, about him leaving the hospital...

180
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,510
I think he did it for you.

181
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,150
What?

182
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,920
He mentioned it yesterday.

183
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,150
He said he was being difficult and making things hard for you.

184
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,590
How embarrassing it must be for you in front of the hospital staff.

185
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,630
I think...

186
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,470
he must have overheard people talking.

187
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,870
Why would he listen to that?

188
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,139
Why would he even care?

189
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,850
Since when has he ever cared so much about me?

190
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,220
Don't say that, Jae Pil.

191
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,790
Your father...

192
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,520
He cares about you a great deal.

193
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,900
I promised your father I'd be quiet, and I have been until now, but...

194
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,270
About your mother passing away... It wasn't all your father's fault.

195
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,939
Your father, he truly loved your mother.

196
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,340
I know because I was his secretary.

197
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,309
Your mother married him without love due to her family's situation.

198
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,820
And she could never open up her heart to him.

199
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,190
That's why her alcoholism and her depression got so severe.

200
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,660
The doctors said she would die if they did nothing.

201
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,630
So your father decided that even if he had to be forceful,

202
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,089
he had to do it to save your mother...

203
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,160
Hold on.

204
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,700
Your dad...

205
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,070
Do you think he might have gone there?

206
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
I'm here.

207
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,700
It's been too long, hasn't it?

208
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,540
I wanted to come sooner.

209
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,100
But my health...

210
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,340
hasn't been so good.

211
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,210
I brought you...

212
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,950
some of your favourite liquor and tangerines.

213
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,640
I didn't understand you.

214
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,010
But as I've gotten older,

215
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,120
I think I'm starting to understand.

216
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,590
What it means to be living in your own personal hell.

217
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,430
Just how agonizing it is.

218
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,170
My department store went under.

219
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,800
And now I'm just a burden on my son.

220
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,510
A man like me, Han Gi Bok... Without my pride, I'm nothing.

221
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,350
It's a fiery pit, Eun Hye.

222
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,990
Since you left it all behind,

223
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,400
are you happy now, where you are?

224
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,400
Dad!

225
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,810
What on earth are you doing here?

226
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,749
How did you know I was here?

227
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,280
You should have told me. Why do you always...

228
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,750
Dad, every time...

229
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,890
I'm sorry.

230
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,890
I didn't mean to make you worry.

231
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,860
I just really wanted to come here.

232
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,270
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,080
I'm so sorry, Dad.

234
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,920
I was too young and immature,

235
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,720
and for over a decade, I misunderstood you.

236
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,360
I hated you and made you so lonely.

237
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,760
I'm sorry.

238
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,770
Why didn't you say anything? Why?

239
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,210
Why did you just let me hate you? Why? Why...

240
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,720
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,120
I'm so sorry.

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,230
(Yeonseo University Hospital)

243
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,640
This looks amazing! Thank you!

244
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,970
This is so good. Thank you.

245
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,970
Have another one.

246
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,950
You shouldn't work without eating.

247
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,380
When you get caught up in work...

248
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,180
Hey, Jae Pil. The man of the hour. Hey, have a seat.

249
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,550
- Hey, you made it. - Jong Hee.

250
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,719
There's this sandwich shop I go to all the time.

251
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,160
It's seriously delicious.

252
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,830
Plus, they were really nice to me when I was in the hospital.

253
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,130
This is a little bribe so they'll take good care of you.

254
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,370
Have a seat.

255
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
Hey, you!

256
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,039
So sneaky.

257
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,679
You had such a pretty girlfriend? all this time,

258
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,880
pretending like you were single.

259
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,579
Goodness.

260
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,179
That's not cool, dude.

261
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,879
What do you mean, girlfriend?

262
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,250
It's not like that, man.

263
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,850
But it's not like he's totally wrong.

264
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,860
That doesn't make me her boyfriend, does it?

265
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,960
Right. You've got a point there.

266
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,890
Gosh, she's pretty and has a sense of humour.

267
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,100
Man, what a lucky jerk.

268
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,099
When am I going to find a girlfriend like that?

269
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,370
The way I see it,

270
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,340
Jae Pil here must've saved a country in a past life.

271
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,040
And I must've sold one out.

272
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,079
Come on, eat up. Eat up.

273
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,439
Hey, you should eat too.

274
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,910
This is really good. Try some.

275
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,419
(Daeyang Group)

276
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,550
So, did you find anything?

277
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,819
Yes. Her name is Koh Yeong Rye.

278
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,160
She's the same age as Jong Hee.

279
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,789
They were best friends when they were...

280
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,130
bus conductors for Cheonga Bus.

281
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,430
Her mother runs a restaurant in Yeongeun Market.

282
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
And...

283
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,600
And?

284
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,409
Koh Yeong Rye is currently...

285
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,510
working as a staff member at Juri Beauty Salon.

286
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,540
What? Juri Beauty Salon?

287
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,810
Yes.

288
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,589
Looks like her nose job hasn't settled yet.

289
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,230
- You're right. - She's out.

290
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,900
Isn't this the one they poached from Cheongdam Salon?

291
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,870
Incep...

292
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,440
It's no great loss. Not a loss at all.

293
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,280
Her look... Why is it so tacky? Honestly.

294
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,580
Any news from Michelle's camp?

295
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,150
They must've picked their candidate and started training her.

296
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,590
Not yet.

297
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,659
Director Michelle is very strict about keeping things under wraps.

298
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,400
Right. That woman's no pushover.

299
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,770
And I'm sure she's wary of us too.

300
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,970
By the way...

301
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,770
You two still haven't made up, have you?

302
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,009
It was all just a misunderstanding.

303
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,650
What misunderstanding?

304
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,450
I'm the one who betrayed her.

305
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,779
Actually, no.

306
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,890
"Betrayal" is so dramatic.

307
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,020
I was talented enough to strike out on my own.

308
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,359
Goodness. None of these faces are grabbing me.

309
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,830
- This is driving me nuts. - Here. What about here?

310
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,159
- No, she's also... - Ma'am.

311
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,699
Oh, my goodness, Madam Chairman.

312
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,330
Oh, Madam Chairman.

313
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,569
Oh, Madam Chairman. I didn't expect you. No appointment?

314
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,640
Yes, something came up unexpectedly.

315
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,009
Can you do an updo for me?

316
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:06,680
Of course. For you, Madam Chairman, we're available anytime, year-round.

317
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,479
Please, come this way. I'll do it for you myself.

318
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,720
No, not today.

319
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,150
I'd like to have that girl give it a try.

320
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,419
My daughter seems to really like the way she does hair.

321
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,560
So I'm curious to see for myself.

322
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,230
Ms. Koh.

323
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,130
Okay.

324
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,690
Right here.

325
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,629
Can you give this side as much volume as possible?

326
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,400
Yes, of course.

327
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,339
This side... Gosh!

328
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,410
My goodness. Are you all right?

329
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,249
- Oh, no. - Oh, my!

330
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,679
Oh, Madam Chairman! Oh, my goodness.

331
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,550
- Oh, no... - Hey, get some cold water, quick!

332
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,289
- Oh, my gosh. I think she's burned. - Move, move!

333
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,050
- Are you okay? - Ms. Koh!

334
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,490
What do we do? Poor Madam Chairman. Oh, this is awful.

335
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,809
Madam Chairman, are you all right?

336
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,110
Oh, no. That must sting so much.

337
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,410
We're so sorry. We don't usually make such mistakes.

338
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,550
I'll personally compensate you fully.

339
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,850
And I can't apologise enough.

340
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,520
I am so very sorry, Madam Chairman.

341
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,690
I don't need compensation. How much could it possibly cost?

342
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,620
What's more important...

343
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,690
is if a customer would return after service this inept.

344
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,960
Do you think they'd ever want to come back?

345
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,730
Excuse me?

346
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,840
I'm sorry, Madam Chairman.

347
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,940
I made a terrible mistake.

348
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,340
But I always give a warning before using a hot iron.

349
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,780
I tell my clients right from the start...

350
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,479
that they can get burned if they move,

351
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,720
and to please warn me first.

352
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,149
But in a situation like the one just now...

353
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,350
Are you saying I didn't warn you?

354
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,620
So this whole accident is my fault?

355
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,130
No, that's not what I meant...

356
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,690
A mere hairstylist...

357
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,360
is trying to lecture me.

358
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,270
I'm so offended. I don't think I'll go to Juri Beauty Salon again.

359
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,370
I'll have to find another salon.

360
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,510
Please, Madam Chairman.

361
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,610
If you leave like this...

362
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,880
You should be on your knees begging, but you're talking about a warning?

363
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,320
You're fired. Effective immediately.

364
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,820
Pack your things and get out now. Understand?

365
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,690
Please, Madam Chairman.

366
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,660
Madam Chairman!

367
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,450
Hey, Jae Pil.

368
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,619
You have that other girlfriend, right?

369
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,319
The one I asked you to set me up with?

370
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,549
Oh, Yeong Rye.

371
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,590
Yes, what about her?

372
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,260
I literally just saw her get fired by her boss.

373
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,730
Something about burning a client.

374
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,500
It didn't look that bad to me. She must've been a VIP or something.

375
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,530
Really?

376
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,970
Are you sure she got fired?

377
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,260
What are you doing here?

378
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,930
I came to get my hair dyed, like you suggested.

379
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,900
You picked the wrong day.

380
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,600
I just got fired.

381
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,370
What?

382
00:27:24,371 --> 00:27:26,610
But now I don't know where to go.

383
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,110
If I go home now, my mom will be so worried.

384
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,800
(Juri Beauty Salon)

385
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,400
I didn't realise you liked modern pop.

386
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
I had no idea.

387
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,230
Should I put this on?

388
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,840
Let's just drive in silence.

389
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,040
You're not in the mood for music right now.

390
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,580
I guess there's no fooling you.

391
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,019
So, why haven't you asked?

392
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,679
About why I got fired.

393
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,919
What's there to ask?

394
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,690
I doubt you did anything bad enough to get fired.

395
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,120
It must have been unfair dismissal, right?

396
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,190
Not really.

397
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,200
I wasn't completely blameless.

398
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,800
So I wouldn't call it unfair dismissal.

399
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,040
What are you, a saint? Keeping that in will make you sick.

400
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,810
Well, on the bright side...

401
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,510
Why don't you use this time to rest and just focus on your studies?

402
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,050
You said you were trying for college this year anyway.

403
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,280
But I still have to do both.

404
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,220
The landlord wants to raise the rent on my mom's restaurant.

405
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,220
So I have to help out with living expenses.

406
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,490
At least my brother becomes a judge and has a steady income.

407
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,939
I know a job that's perfect for a stand-up person like you.

408
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,870
Are you interested?

409
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,250
Is this really your office?

410
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,480
Yes.

411
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,920
It's amazing.

412
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,690
I start next week, but I haven't hired a secretary yet.

413
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,929
The one my mother recommended...

414
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,600
would just end up being a spy for my parents.

415
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,360
So?

416
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,070
Want to be my secretary?

417
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,400
There wouldn't be much to do.

418
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,240
Just manage my schedule and talk with me.

419
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,540
In your free time, you can study. I'll look the other way.

420
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,080
That's a very tempting offer.

421
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,520
You're making it a simple yes-or-no question.

422
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,050
But...

423
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,720
it would be shameless of me to accept this too.

424
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,260
You've already done so much for me.

425
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,800
What's one more thing on top of all that?

426
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,400
You can pay me back for everything at once later.

427
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,139
I don't know how I can ever repay you.

428
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,200
That wouldn't be right.

429
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,840
I'll find a way to get through this on my own.

430
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,850
But thank you so, so much. Your support means the world to me.

431
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,120
You really are my Daddy-Long-Legs.

432
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,720
You know, I'm getting tired of just being your Daddy-Long-Legs.

433
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,290
What?

434
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,060
Never mind.

435
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,860
I guess I was getting ahead of myself.

436
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,200
Okay, let's just forget I made that offer.

437
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,370
Instead...

438
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,570
I'll buy you a meal to cheer you up.

439
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,140
To celebrate your new unemployment.

440
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,910
Now that's an offer I'll take.

441
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,980
Make it something good.

442
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,610
Okay, let's go.

443
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,950
All right. Bring it on.

444
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,750
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

445
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,359
When you're trying to do good, you're bound to attract some pests.

446
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,230
You just have to get rid of them before they turn into flies, right?

447
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,629
Right. Be a man, go right up to him, and confront him.

448
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,299
"How long have you dated Jeong Bun? Are you thinking about marriage?"

449
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,439
If he says no, I'll say, "Then back off, you jerk."

450
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,710
If he says yes...

451
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,840
And if he says yes?

452
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,880
"Then let's make it a fair fight. We used to be pretty serious too."

453
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,520
What?

454
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,320
What? Why would you...

455
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,740
You're in good spirits, Koh Yeong Rye.

456
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,140
- What? - Oh, nothing.

457
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,280
Since you lost your job today, you have a pretty good appetite.

458
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,120
To be honest, I've been starving all day.

459
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,750
I woke up so late I didn't have time for breakfast.

460
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,889
Eat up.

461
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,460
You need your strength to find another job.

462
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,630
I'm not going to steal food off your plate or anything.

463
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,200
Well, since it's a special occasion, I guess I'll eat up.

464
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,410
You know...

465
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,580
When you get married, I bet you'll be a great husband.

466
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,220
You're so kind and considerate.

467
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,220
Do you really think so?

468
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,190
Yes, of course.

469
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,919
Whoever she is,

470
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,830
the woman who marries you is going to hit the jackpot.

471
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,930
If it's such a prize,

472
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,600
then you should be the one to claim it.

473
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:04,669
Oh, come on. I couldn't be that greedy.

474
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,870
Me, claiming that prize? I couldn't...

475
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,880
I'd be tempting fate.

476
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,710
Oh? Hyeon, my son.

477
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,550
Oh? Mom.

478
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,080
You're having a late lunch.

479
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,520
And who's this?

480
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,760
Your girlfriend?

481
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,730
I'm Koh Yeong Rye.

482
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,170
I'm the sister of your son's friend, Koh Yeong Sik.

483
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,300
Yeong Sik! Oh, right!

484
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,269
So you're Yeong Sik's little sister?

485
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,270
Yes.

486
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,740
She's the woman I have feelings for.

487
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,580
I like her.

488
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,750
It's one-sided for now, but...

489
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,370
Now that I've said it out loud, I'm a little embarrassed.

490
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,509
You're surprised, aren't you?

491
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,910
A little.

492
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,950
This is why I kept you close, waiting for the right moment.

493
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,850
But my mom just had to show up.

494
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,759
Look, I...

495
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,960
Wait.

496
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,360
Don't rush to say something.

497
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,200
I'm not asking for an answer right now.

498
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:39,000
I didn't want to just introduce you as my friend's little sister.

499
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:40,970
Take your time.

500
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,270
Instead of just seeing me as your "Daddy-Long-Legs,"

501
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,510
I want you to see me as a man and carefully consider your options.

502
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,880
I'd like you to give me an answer after that.

503
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,510
You can do that much for me, can't you?

504
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,820
Considering how sincere I've been.

505
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,119
Wait at the entrance. I'll go get the car.

506
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,330
No.

507
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,760
I'll take the bus.

508
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,700
I think that would be better today.

509
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,060
You avoid dog crap not out of fear, but out of disgust.

510
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,399
Where is it?

511
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,730
My favourite Buddy Bar...

512
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,170
Oh, here it is.

513
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,310
Hey, kiddo.

514
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,570
You're Jeong Bun's daughter, right?

515
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,479
I'm not "kiddo," I'm Su Jin.

516
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,550
Okay, Su Jin. Do you like Buddy Bars too?

517
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,720
Oh no. About this Buddy Bars...

518
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,120
It looks like this is the last one.

519
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,260
And I... already grabbed it, didn't I?

520
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,230
You want some?

521
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,530
Wow, it's hard to split one of these perfectly in half.

522
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,969
You're a pro, Su Jin.

523
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,770
My mom and I eat them all the time.

524
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,870
With your mom?

525
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,540
Jeong Bun likes these things?

526
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,010
The father and daughter look like two peas in a pod.

527
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,980
We look exactly alike.

528
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,820
You and I, we're identical.

529
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,160
That's hilarious, right?

530
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,490
So, Su Jin, how old are you?

531
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,099
Are you in kindergarten?

532
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,770
I'm seven. I'm in the Apple Class at Sunny Day Kindergarten.

533
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,170
Seven years old... Sunny Day Kindergarten.

534
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,870
Seven...

535
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,880
Seven?

536
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,480
When's your birthday?

537
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,080
July 30.

538
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,450
On my birthday, my mom takes me to the Children's Grand Park.

539
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,990
July?

540
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,690
July... So that means... October, November, December...

541
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,750
Gosh, what do you want now?

542
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,509
Why are you still hanging around?

543
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,849
I just need to confirm one thing.

544
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,650
What could you and I possibly have to confirm?

545
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,050
Su Jin.

546
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,360
By any chance, who is her father?

547
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,590
That little girl...

548
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,530
Is she my daughter?

549
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,900
Goodness.

550
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:02,839
What kind of nonsense are you spouting now?

551
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,309
That's so ridiculous, a stray dog would laugh.

552
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,010
In all my life,

553
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,210
I have never heard such utter nonsense.

554
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,649
Just because you have a mouth, doesn't mean you can run it.

555
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,450
Or I'll get my sewing machine and stitch it shut for you.

556
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,920
You're saying no?

557
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,390
Are you serious?

558
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,690
Look me in the eyes and tell me.

559
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,560
I've done the math again and again.

560
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,160
If Su Jin is seven,

561
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,000
and she was born in July,

562
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,340
that means she was conceived right when we were together.

563
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,570
Were you seeing some other guy back then?

564
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,340
You?

565
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,180
No.

566
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,420
You wouldn't do that. Right?

567
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:51,950
Say something.

568
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,320
Su Jin...

569
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,690
She's my daughter, right?

570
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,130
Hey, you.

571
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,010
Why are you here again?

572
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,780
I thought I told you to stop hanging around here.

573
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,250
You stay out of this.

574
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,790
Between me, Jeong Bun, and Su Jin. It's a matter for the three of us.

575
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,160
Isn't that right?

576
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,700
Su Jin.

577
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,230
She's our daughter, isn't she?

578
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,090
There you are! Where have you been?

579
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,790
Jae Pil.

580
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,030
My legs are killing me. I've been looking everywhere.

581
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,929
What are you doing here without calling?

582
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,329
I was worried about you, that's why.

583
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,659
Worried that losing your job would make you do something crazy,

584
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,169
or that you'd be passed out drunk in a gutter somewhere.

585
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,170
I just...

586
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,169
I had to see for myself that you were okay.

587
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,110
I had to, so I could stop worrying. You got a problem with that?

588
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,910
You're ridiculous.

589
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,280
Give me that.

590
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,820
You must be hungry. Do you want to go get some noodles?

591
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,960
- You okay? - Let's go.

592
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,620
You're buying.

593
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,390
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

594
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,010
There you go.

595
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,050
Thank you.

596
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,749
Please enjoy.

597
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,880
You too.

598
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,430
So...

599
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,530
what's your plan now?

600
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,400
What do you think?

601
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,470
Start looking for a new job, of course.

602
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,140
Well, since this happened,

603
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,679
I might as well aim for better pay...

604
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,340
and try to get into a bigger company.

605
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,650
Besides, this field has a pretty high turnover rate,

606
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,850
so there are bound to be some openings.

607
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,990
Gosh, and here I was. I feel so betrayed right now.

608
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,060
I worried about you for nothing, Yeong Rye.

609
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,730
Honestly, it's for the best.

610
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,230
My manager really didn't like me, so it was really stressful.

611
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,300
Working somewhere else could be a blessing in disguise.

612
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,099
Like my mom always says,

613
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,110
nothing's just going to fall into your lap.

614
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,840
So, tomorrow, I'll hit reset and get back to it.

615
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,909
Okay, I admit it, you're tough. Now just eat.

616
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,120
Your noodles are getting soggy.

617
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,400
Guess you're not that hungry.

618
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,760
Did you eat something already?

619
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,530
Well...

620
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,070
I wasn't alone, though.

621
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,670
You weren't alone?

622
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,540
What?

623
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,139
Jong Hee?

624
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,810
No, not Jong Hee.

625
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,180
Here, have some more.

626
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,090
What about your dad?

627
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:49,720
Is your dad doing all right?

628
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,160
Yes.

629
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,730
Thanks to you.

630
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,860
We went to the bathhouse together over the weekend.

631
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,530
It was the first time in my life I ever scrubbed my dad's back.

632
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,769
I know you're probably not worried,

633
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,870
but I'm saying this just in case.

634
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,580
You have one of those faces that makes people trust you.

635
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,980
So, no matter where you interview,

636
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,850
you'll get hired right away.

637
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,550
It's so obvious you're just saying that.

638
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,220
Maybe wipe the broth off your chin before you say it.

639
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,819
Hey, I'm being serious!

640
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,059
People can tell...

641
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,800
you're more than looks just by talking to you for a second.

642
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,530
You're sharp and articulate.

643
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,640
And all your facial features are so neatly put together.

644
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,570
You're so capable.

645
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,669
What else is there?

646
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,909
Hey, don't try so hard. Just eat.

647
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,110
Say "Ah."

648
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,410
Eat up.

649
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,450
- I'm serious! - Hey.

650
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,250
- I'm not just... - Eat this first, then talk.

651
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,089
I'm not like that.

652
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:01,590
(Michelle Beauty Salon)

653
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,330
Be confident and stay calm.

654
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,570
You can do this, Yeong Rye.

655
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,140
(Michelle Beauty Salon)

656
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,750
Why did you quit from Juri Beauty Salon?

657
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:31,120
Were you unhappy with the pay?

658
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,430
No.

659
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,700
I was terminated because of a mistake I made.

660
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,300
I appreciate your honesty.

661
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,899
All right, then, let me give you a hypothetical situation.

662
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,100
Tell me what you'd do.

663
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,070
Okay.

664
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:48,109
A client comes in, and it looks like she just went through a breakup.

665
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:51,640
She asks you to cut her hair as short as possible.

666
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,720
So, how would you handle that, Ms. Koh?

667
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,120
Well, I would...

668
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,900
Hey, come on over for some coffee.

669
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:15,270
Coffee's on the lady at the vegetable store!

670
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,109
No, thanks. You guys go ahead. I already had some.

671
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,370
All right, then.

672
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,750
Excuse me, where can I find the Sparrow Mill?

673
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,320
It's about 20m straight ahead.

674
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,120
Okay, thank you.

675
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,860
Oh, for crying out loud!

676
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,230
Stop being so dramatic, will you?

677
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,260
If she gets it, she gets it. If not, she doesn't.

678
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,170
It's just one little interview. No need to wait on pins and needles.

679
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,839
- Mom. - What is it?

680
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,470
You're holding the mallet backwards.

681
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,880
This way, that way, what's the difference?

682
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,010
As long as it gets the job done, who cares?

683
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,690
What's taking her so long?

684
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,389
Maybe the interview didn't go well.

685
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,989
I hope not.

686
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,330
She has to get the job so I can get my allowance.

687
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,029
Listen, you two. Whatever you do, don't let on when Yeong Rye arrives.

688
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,500
Don't put any pressure on her.

689
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,230
Especially you, Ho Suk!

690
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:20,870
Of course.

691
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,170
I'm not a complete idiot.

692
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,970
I've spent years learning to read the room.

693
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,509
- So, how'd it go? - Did you get it?

694
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,079
- So, are you in? - Did you get the job?

695
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,479
What? What are you all saying? One at a time, please.

696
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,480
Goodness.

697
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:39,890
So what did they say? The job, did you get it?

698
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,050
Yeah.

699
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,620
I got it. They want me to start tomorrow.

700
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,660
- Oh, I'm so proud of you! - Oh, come on.

701
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,430
My heart was just pounding.

702
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,769
All right, a toast to Yeong Rye for getting the job at Michelle's!

703
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,170
- Cheers! - Cheers!

704
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,080
Gosh, that hits the spot.

705
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,719
Michelle's is much better than Juri's.

706
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,620
It's the top salon in the country.

707
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,219
You're telling me.

708
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,289
Everyone at Juri's will be jealous when they hear the news.

709
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,499
Gosh! I love it.

710
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,699
Okay, enough with the flattery.

711
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,770
I'm still just a junior stylist.

712
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,700
Hey, even if you are a junior stylist,

713
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:32,070
you got the "designer" title and a bigger paycheck, right?

714
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,710
That's moving up in the world. That's what success is.

715
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,780
So, Mom, you're just happy I'm making more money, aren't you?

716
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,250
Well...

717
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:40,979
What are you talking about?

718
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,179
Is there anyone here...

719
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,120
who doesn't like money? Show me one person.

720
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,579
Go on, I'd like to meet them.

721
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,290
You're right, Mom. I like money too.

722
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:48,620
Goes without saying.

723
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,890
Congratulations!

724
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,260
Are you guys starting the party without me?

725
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,659
- Hey, Jong Hee, you're here! - Is that Jong Hee?

726
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,800
Hey, Jong Hee, long time no see. Come on, have a seat.

727
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,769
How'd you hear the news?

728
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,099
What do you mean, how?

729
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,600
I called to see how your interview went, and Ho Suk told me the news.

730
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,110
Congratulations. I hear you got a better job.

731
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,679
No, it's not that different.

732
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,480
What do you mean it's not that different?

733
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:16,180
Just like my money-loving mom said, the pay is a lot better.

734
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,020
You ungrateful brat! I've created a monster.

735
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,150
You can make your own food starting tomorrow.

736
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,519
Gosh, listen to her, holding food over my head.

737
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,360
Oh, the horror! I'm so heartbroken!

738
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,460
I'll get it.

739
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,299
Hey, since Jong Hee's here, let's all do a toast.

740
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,939
- Cheers, cheers! - Cheers!

741
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,209
One, two, three!

742
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,440
- Cheers! - Cheers!

743
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,110
Hello?

744
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:45,740
Koh Yeong Rye, how did it go?

745
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,110
How do you think it went?

746
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,050
You got it.

747
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,580
You did, right? You got the job, didn't you?

748
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,790
Bingo.

749
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:58,259
Yes! Congratulations! See? What did I tell you?

750
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,989
I told you that you'd get it for sure, didn't I?

751
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:02,030
I knew that interview was a shoo-in for you.

752
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,800
You really spoke it into existence.

753
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,500
I think I passed thanks to you counting my chickens for me.

754
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:10,840
Thanks, Han Jae Pil.

755
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,540
Actually, all day today...

756
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,579
while I was eating, seeing patients, or getting an earful from my boss...

757
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,110
I was secretly rooting for you.

758
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,750
"Come on, Koh Yeong Rye, get it."

759
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,520
"Come on, Koh Yeong Rye, get it. Come on, Koh Yeong Rye, get it."

760
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,550
Now I'm even more grateful.

761
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:29,290
Oh, you're not on call tonight, right?

762
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:30,889
Do you want to come over when you're done?

763
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,560
We're throwing a little party here.

764
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,930
I'd really love to,

765
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,830
but I have plans.

766
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,580
Gosh, really! I said I'm busy, but you just won't stop.

767
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,939
If you're that desperate for a drink,

768
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,310
you should just drink by himself.

769
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,450
Hey, what's the fun in drinking alone?

770
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:58,880
Especially since I'm already in a bad mood.

771
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,390
Why?

772
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,720
What do you have to be in a bad mood about?

773
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,930
I can't tell you, dude.

774
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,470
Who are your plans with?

775
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,199
If it's no big deal, why not ask them to come here?

776
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,500
I already did.

777
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,070
You did?

778
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,510
And there he is.

779
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,580
Your previous engagement...

780
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:29,980
It was Han Jae Pil?

781
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,030
Truth be told...

782
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,130
I was debating whether or not I should meet with you.

783
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,670
You wanted to meet with me?

784
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,010
Why is that?

785
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,340
Jae Pil.

786
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:57,910
Make yourself clear.

787
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:03,620
I don't know if you've noticed yet, but I care about Yeong Rye. A lot.

788
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:10,060
But ever since Jong Hee showed up, I'm a little confused...

789
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,030
about where your heart lies.

790
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,460
So like I said,

791
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,430
make your intentions clear.

792
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,470
If you keep on hesitating,

793
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:27,470
I'll just go for her.

794
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,080
This is a warning, man to man.

795
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,420
Got it?

796
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,859
What's going on? Are you fighting? Why is it so tense in here?

797
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,900
Fighting? What are we, kids? Come on, let's drink.

802
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,389
Mom, I'm heading out.

803
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:20,730
Oh, sweetie.

804
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:22,430
So, it's your first day.

805
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,730
Is it obvious that I'm nervous?

806
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,030
Very.

807
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,700
- Try to relax a little. - Okay.

808
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,070
It's just another job. How different can it be?

809
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,570
Don't you worry and get going.

810
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,209
If you don't know something, just make sure you ask.

811
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,210
Okay.

812
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,510
You should've slept well last night. Didn't you?

813
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:42,820
Those kids were making such a racket.

814
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,499
Oh, Ms. Koh. You're here.

815
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,770
Hello. Good morning.

816
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,570
Go get changed and then come out. I'll tell you what you'll be doing.

817
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,740
Okay.

819
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,560
This way.

820
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,029
For now, while you're getting settled in,

821
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:07,270
get a feel for how things work and just provide general support.

822
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,539
Ten minutes before we open, the staff and director gather...

823
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,439
for a briefing on the day's schedule,

824
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,440
so make sure you're there.

825
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,010
As for your specific role...

826
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:20,750
We'll discuss it again next week. Okay?

827
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,210
Okay.

828
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:30,260
Morning, everyone.

829
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,230
First off, let's double-check all of today's appointments.

830
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:39,260
Two off-site events today, right? The commercial shoot over in Dasan.

831
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,430
- Han, that's your team. - Yes.

832
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,470
Don't forget to stick to the agreed-upon time.

833
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,339
That whole "let's just get along" attitude...

834
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,910
We need to make it crystal clear that it doesn't fly anymore.

835
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,380
And the two-day beauty seminar in Dongincheon.

836
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,210
I'll be there for that one, so we're good.

837
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,780
Oh, how are we on staff?

838
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,090
Yun Ju and Jeong Hui are set to go.

839
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,390
Three of us, including me.

840
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,490
Is that going to be enough?

841
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,660
Have the new hire tag along. It's all good experience.

842
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:09,430
That's all.

843
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,170
Off-site work on her first day?

844
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,440
What's that, special treatment?

845
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,740
You heard her, right?

846
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,050
The event isn't until this afternoon,

847
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,210
but why don't you go early and start setting up?

848
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,330
Hey, you guys!

849
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,489
I let you sleep over one time,

850
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,850
and now you think you can just drop by.

851
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:12,589
If you're going to get wasted, you should crawl back to your homes.

852
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,560
Why do you keep crashing here?

853
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,400
We're sorry.

854
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,430
But nothing beats your pollock soup for a hangover.

855
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,770
Oh, yes. I have to agree with that.

856
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,340
I'm finally starting to feel human again.

857
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,570
What are you grabbing?

858
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,140
What? Do I have to do it too?

859
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,810
What is this?

860
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,449
Alright, that's enough, you guys.

861
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,280
Stop trying to butter me up. Just eat and go.

Jae Pil, don't you have to be at the hospital?

863
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:44,120
Yes, I do. But I can go in late today.

00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,140
Mom, is Sang Cheol at the shop next door?

867
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:59,540
I'm in a hurry, and I was wondering if I could catch a ride with him.

868
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,840
Sang Cheol just left to do his collections.

869
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,340
What about your car?

870
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,410
Aren't you supposed to be at work at that place, Michelle?

871
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,580
I am, but I have to get to Dongincheon in a hurry.

872
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,620
But I missed my bus at the terminal.

873
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,550
And the taxis here will only go to Seoul.

874
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:17,990
Never mind. I'll try to find a taxi again. Bye.

875
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:20,129
Oh, for crying out loud!

876
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,530

877
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,800
Gosh, that's ridiculous!

878
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,000
I'll take her, ma'am.

879
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,300
- But your food... - My car is parked nearby.

880
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,700

Okay, just breathe naturally now.

885
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,600
Make yourself clear.

If you keep on hesitating,

887
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,580
I'll just go for her.

(Corrections)

892
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,830
- Mom, let's go. Come on. - Okay, let's go.

893
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:49,880
(Establishing Law and Order)

894
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,900
I wanted to treat you both to a meal.

895
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,130
Partly because of what happened the other day,

896
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:16,370
and I have something to discuss, so this seemed like a good time.

897
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:19,540
Well, you really didn't have to do all this.

898
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,770
So, what was it you wanted to discuss?

899
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,040
Well, how should I put this...

900
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,040
This may be presumptuous of me,

901
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:29,180
but I'd like to make a proposition.

902
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,350
You see, registration for Miss Korea is opening up soon.

903
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:37,219
And at our salon,

904
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:40,230
we've been considering several different candidates.

905
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,800
But ever since I first saw her,

906
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,899
your daughter has elegant features and is so beautiful.

907
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,840
On top of that, she's incredibly talented.

908
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,570
If she were to enter the Miss Korea pageant,

909
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:56,210
I'm certain she'd be a shoo-in for the crown.

910
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,540
That's what I've been thinking, you see.

911
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:03,280
If you say the word, Ms. Jong Hee, we here at Juri Beauty Salon...

912
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,450
are confident we can give you our full support.

913
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,789
What do you say?

914
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,220
Oh, I don't know...

915
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:12,989
I mean, I vaguely dreamed of being Miss Korea when I was little, but...

916
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:14,890
- Oh, really? - We're not interested.

917
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,900
She is going to take over my business.

918
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:22,230
She has no time to waste on the Miss Korea pageant.

919
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,770
We're looking into her studying at George Mason University in D.C.

920
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,610
Being a former Miss Korea, well...

921
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:34,050
It wouldn't hurt her studying abroad or her future career.

922
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:39,050
I was just wondering... Do you feel the same, Ms. Jong Hee?

923
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,490
Yes, well...

924
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,320
If my mother doesn't want me to, I'm not that interested either.

925
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,130
I see.

926
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,400
I understand.

927
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:54,170
I knew it was a long shot,

928
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,400
but I guess I was aiming too high.

929
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,770
I'll drop the subject then.

930
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:02,010
Please, eat. Go on.

931
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,680
Let's eat.

932
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,320
I was informed that employee was fired.

933
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:19,930
Of course, Mr. Chairman. I had her fired that very day.

934
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,000
I may not be good at much, but I can handle things like that.

935
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:26,630
It wasn't just about the mistake she made.

936
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,869
The point is she was bothering you, wasn't she, Madam Chairman?

937
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:31,769
She may be just another staff member,

938
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:35,870
but to us, Madam Chairman, you're more than a VVIP.

939
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:38,810
Is the food to your liking?

940
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:40,510
Yes, it's very good.

941
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,120
Why on earth would you do that?

942
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,690
Don't tell me you did it knowing she was my friend. Did you?

943
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,990
Lower your voice.

944
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,529
How dare you raise your voice in such a vulgar way?

945
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,900
Mom, that was her livelihood on the line!

946
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:58,699
Even if she was wrong, this is too much.

947
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,830
Then you shouldn't have ignored me!

948
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,300
Mom!

949
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:05,300
That's right.

950
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,370
I did it because I knew she was your friend.

951
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:10,440
You haven't noticed, have you?

952
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,379
How much you've changed since you started seeing her again.

953
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,980
You've been lying and even daring to talk back to me.

954
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,850
So you got her fired on purpose?

955
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,919
Then that mistake she made...

956
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,120
You know what they say. "Lie down with dogs, you get fleas."

957
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,860
Stay away from her.

958
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:28,990
You know what?

959
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,170
Sometimes, Mom, you're just...

960
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:38,670
overwhelming. And you scare me.

961
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,340
Where are you going?

962
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:44,180
Jong Hee.

963
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:59,119
Thank you so, so much.

964
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,259
Let me buy you dinner sometime. I'm running late.

965
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,860
- Take care. - Okay.

966
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,270
She didn't give me a chance to say anything.

971
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,869
You're here.

972
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:45,840
I think we're pretty much ready, Director.

973
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:49,910
Good work. You're fast and thorough too.

974
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:51,580
Thank you, Director.

975
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:56,149
Director, Manager, the model is here.

976
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:57,520
Hello.

977
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,049
The concept for this seminar...

978
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:04,390
was supposed to be an elegant updo.

979
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:06,220
I'm sure I made myself clear.

980
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:08,690
When did you colour your hair?

981
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,200
It's a natural dark brown, so I didn't think it'd be an issue.

982
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,670
About a week ago...

983
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,440
You're done. Go home.

984
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,640
What?

985
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:29,980
I said go home. We'll compensate you for travel.

986
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,720
I see.

987
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:33,750
All right.

988
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:43,160
Director, the seminar is in less than an hour.

989
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,300
We don't have time to find another model.

990
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:46,869
What are you going to do?

991
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:50,170
Just because we have no time, we should use a totally wrong model?

992
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,070
And that's going to help our careers how, exactly?

993
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:26,140
Why don't you have a seat, Ms. Koh?

994
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:27,910
Me?

995
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:31,040
You mean Ms. Koh?

996
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:34,609
Oh, she's at the hair seminar in Dongincheon.

997
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:35,980
She's out of the salon right now.

998
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:37,480
She's out?

999
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:41,020
So she's not coming in today at all?

1000
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:42,690
That's right. It doesn't look like she will be.

1001

Koh Yeong Rye.

1002
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:44,320
You said she was single, right?

1003
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,310
Hi there.

1004
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,610
Hi.

1005
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,439
Where to?

1006
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,240
Injeong-dong residential complex, please.

1007
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:14,750
Injeong-dong? You got it.

1008
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,020
Ma'am?

1009
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,060
Would it be okay if I listened to the radio?

1010
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:28,790
Oh, sure, of course. Go right ahead.

1011
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:38,940
It's been a bit, but here's a letter from one of our regulars.

1012
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,840
It was sent in by a Ms. K, who lives in Dodam-dong.

1013
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,740
"Giant."

1014
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:50,880
"The first time I met him, he was a giant to me."

1015
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:56,320
"On a packed bus one ordinary day, I was shouting, 'All clear!'"

1016
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:59,520
"There was a passenger who ran off without paying."

1017
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:03,700
"So I was chasing him at my full speed that morning."

1018
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,400
"That's when I met him for the very first time."

1019
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:11,870
And just like that, I fell for him at first sight.

1020
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,540
And when by fate we met again,

1021
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:18,740
his eyes weren't for me, but for my friend.

1022
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,750
But I couldn't bring myself to give up on our connection.

1023
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,880
After all, he was my first love.

1024
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,460
And to this day,

1025
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,260
he remains by my side, this larger-than-life presence.

1026
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,560
Never once dreaming of how I feel about him.

1027
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:40,470
Sir?

1028
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,840
I'm sorry, but could you please turn the car around?

1029
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,399
What's that?

1030
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,610
Take me to Dongincheon, please. I'll pay you triple the fare.

1031
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:54,310
Just like the lyrics to this song that played in the record store,

1032
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:56,280
when will I ever be able to...

1033
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:59,080
get closer to him?

1034
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:02,650
"Close to You."

1035
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:06,120
Close to you.

1036
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,790
"Close to You."

1037
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,750
Yeong Rye.

1038
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:38,860
My father...

1039
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,030
My father...

1040
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:15,229
(You'll pass.)

1041
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:16,460
Han Jae Pil.

1042
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,230
What are you doing here?

1043
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:22,800
Good luck on your exam.

1044
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,400
What's this?

1045
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:34,510
Jae Pil.

1046
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,480
Why are you here?

1047
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:43,890
Brace yourself for what I'm about to say.

1048
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:48,190
We got a call at the house.

1049
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,200
Your dad...

1050
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:56,370
Your dad...

1051
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,100
He collapsed again.

1052
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:08,980
She was there.

1053
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,620
All those moments when I felt like I wanted to die,

1054
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,820
she was next to me.

1055
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:21,390
Quietly holding my hand.

1056
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:24,960
My silent source of strength.

1057
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,030
Whose first love is me.

1058
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,370
And the one who is now my...

1059
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,590
Who is it?

1060
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,660
Sir?

1061
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,100
Han Jae Pil.

1062
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,140
What are you doing here?

1063
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,670
It's been a long time.

1064
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:11,340
Koh Yeong Rye.

1065
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,560
It's been a while. You brought me all the way to the Incheon Sea.

1066
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:29,660
I know.

1067
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:32,500
I didn't expect to make it out here myself.

1068
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:37,400
So thanks. It's been a long time for me too.

1069
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:49,510
Actually...

1070
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:53,950
I had something I wanted to tell you.

1071
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,560
Jae Pil...

1072
01:15:05,561 --> 01:15:06,700
Let me go first.

1073
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,670
No, I'm going first.

1074
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:16,110
I realised it on the way here.

1075
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:20,650
From the moment we first met until now...

1076
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:25,250
Whenever I was struggling, you were always there for me.

1077
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,320
I'd lean on you,

1078
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:32,020
and find my strength again.

1079
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,499
To me, you're absolutely essential.

1080
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,530
No...

1081
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,600
I can't imagine my life without you. So why...

1082
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,840
Why did I only ever keep you in the friend zone?

1083
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,010
Jae Pil.

1084
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:58,250
Let's stop being friends.

1085
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,520
I don't want to be your friend anymore.

1086
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:04,320
Not with you.

1087
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:10,700
I like you.

1088
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:19,440
I love your smile.

1089
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:23,940
I love talking to you on the phone.

1090
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,450
I love it.

1091
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:32,320
I love it when you ask me, "Are you okay?"

1092
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,020
Every single moment I spend with you...

1093
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,190
I love it all so much.

Koh Yeong Rye.

1095
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:53,840
I was first.

1096
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,310
The truth is...

1097
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:04,850
For a long time now, I've...

1100
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:37,369
How did you become lovers with Jae Pil?

1101
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:38,610
Oh, did you hear the news?

1102
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,410
Yeong Rye will enter the Miss Korea pageant.

1103
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,510
I'll give it a try.

1104
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:44,419
I want to enter the Miss Korea pageant.

1105
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,480
I'll become one.

1106
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:46,820
I'll win the crown.

1107
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,819
Where's the candidate for Michelle Beauty Salon?

1108
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:50,720
What are you doing, not coming in?

1109
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,420
You do your best in your way.

1110
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:55,890
I'll do my best in my way.

1111
01:18:58,460 --> 01:18:59,899
Let's play fair again, Yeong Rye.
