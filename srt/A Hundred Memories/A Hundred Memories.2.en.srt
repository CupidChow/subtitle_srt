What are you? Are you some kind of pervert?

Unbelievable.

I appreciate all your work.

17

18

- Quiet.

- Is this how you treat the victim?
- Well...

31

Actually, he's not the victim.

32
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,559
And besides, this is a case of mutual assault. Okay?

33
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,090

34
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,959
Someone had to have thrown the first punch!

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,059
My son doesn't have the guts to do something like that.

36
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,030
So it must've been these punks, right?

37

You don't even check for that, and you just go and act like this?

Do you think this is what I pay my taxes for?

39
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,839
Okay, sir. I understand. But first, please calm down.

40

I'm not your father!

41
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,309

60

can you imagine how much fun the actors must have had?

61
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,670
I wonder why he did that.

62
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,610

That must be so thrilling, don't you think?

67
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,190
He looked like he got hurt. I wonder if he's okay.

68
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,520
Maybe I should've gone after him.

69

What is it?

73

I asked you a question, so it'd be nice if you answered.

74
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,570
No, it's just...

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,779

76
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,780

I mean that student by the entrance to the theatre.

80

I wonder why he did that.

81

A student? Give me a break.

82
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,090
He was obviously a creep.

83
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,460
You get people like that at theatres sometimes.

84
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,730

182
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,000
Spit it out, now.

183
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,239
Who is Giant?

184
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,769
I'm telling you it's not like that.

185
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,780
Hey.

186
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,910
Are you really going to start keeping secrets from me?

187
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,519
Who is he?

188
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,090
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

189
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,120
He's just some guy I don't know.

190
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,360
"Some guy you don't know?"

191
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,260
Gosh.

192
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,260
Hey! Who is this guy that you don't know?

193
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,430
Hey!

194
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,729
- Jae Pil. Did you hear?
- Come over here.

195
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,769
They said Deok Gu and the guys got called to the dean's office.

196
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,640
And there's going to be a disciplinary hearing soon, too.

197
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,910
Hey.

198
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,110
Hey.

199
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,580
What are you going to say?

200
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,710
March in and demand to know why we're not being punished too?

201
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,050
Deok Gu is competing in the High School Sports Festival.

202
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,480
If he's disciplined, he might not get to compete.

203
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,420
It's no use, you idiot.

204
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,519
Do you think if you go in and say, "Punish me too, please,"

205
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,959
that they'll say, "You want to be punished too?"

206
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,490
"Okay." You think that's what they'll say?

207
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,500
You'll just rub salt in the wound. Just stay put.

208
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,070
Having a dad with connections isn't always a good thing.

209

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,410
Are you Deok Gu's grandfather, by any chance?

214
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,620
No, I'm his father.

215
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,790
I see.

216
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,019
I hate to bother you, but could you please give this to him?

217
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,020
I have to get to work.

218
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,500
I think he's embarrassed I packed it so he always leaves it behind.

219
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,000
Tell him I made it extra special today.

220
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,940
Please tell him he has to eat it, okay?

221
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,200
- Okay.
- Thanks.

222
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,140
Okay, then.

To watch me pathetically sit here and write this reflection paper?

226
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,180
Your father asked me to give you this.

227

Did you...

228
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,860
tell my dad I was here?

229

If you're done, why don't you leave?

Yes, I am.

At this rate,

00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,590
I drink my water warm, but she brought me cold water.

360
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,459
His clothes are soaked. What a mess.

361
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,890
It's all right, Ms. Kwon. It's okay.

(Giant, 10th Anniversary, May 21, 1982)

364
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,540
He didn't seem like the type to hang out here.

365
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,910
(Giant)

366
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,420

- Okay.

00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,699
It's a raid! The cops are here!

369
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,269
You. Hurry and run that way.

370
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,670
And you! Run this way!

371
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,179
It's not me!

372
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,009
- I'm not underage!
- Get over here. Come on.

373
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,280
Go get them!

(Giant Night Club)

375
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,620
Why did you run away?

376
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,420
Stand up properly.

377
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,159
So, if you had your ID on you, why did you run away?

378
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,500
Well, it's just...

379
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,200
I was just so startled.

380
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,000
When you started chasing me, I ran without thinking.

381
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,570
Gosh. Some people...

382
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,340
Here you go.

383
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,080
Thank you.

384
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,810
Hey! Can't you stand up straight?

385
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,150
Just a bunch of kids, still wet behind the ears.

386
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,920
Hurry up. Let's go!

387
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,930
Koh Yeong Rye?

388
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,270
Koh Yeong Rye!

389
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,269
Where have you been?

390
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,580
Do you have any idea what time it is?

391
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,180
Hey.

392
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,349
Don't tell me you were at that Giant place again...

(Cheongah Bus)

395
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,350
I need you to slap me.

396
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
What?

397
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,660
I need to snap out of it.

398
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,230
Go on. Do it. And make it hard.

399
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Seriously?

400
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,000
Yes, I'm serious.

401
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,430
I promise I won't hold it against you.

402
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,500
Just do it.

403
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,409
Wait.

404
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,249
Wait.

405
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,410
Don't hit me.

406
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,280
Just pinch me. That's better.

407
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,220
Where have you been?

408
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,190
So did you end up meeting Giant or not?

409
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,130
From now on,

410
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,630
I'm going to forget all about Giant.

411
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,900
And...

412
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,040
I'm going to apply for that instead.

413

(Recruiting Applicants for Night School)

414
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,560
If I enrol in this,

415
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,600
you're sure the company will give me time off for this, right?

416
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
Yes.

417
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,230
I checked. I'm sure.

418
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
But studying and I just don't mix.

419
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,670
And there's one more important thing.

420
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,740
Apparently, you need a diploma to be in the Miss Korea pageant.

421
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,090
Gosh. They're all so pretty.

422
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,830
We're pretty too.

423
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,860
Right. You mean you.

424
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,160
You're pretty too.

425
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,200
Although I am a bit prettier, of course.

426
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,670
Anyway...

427
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,509
Are you going to completely forget about Giant...

428
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,069
Hey. Why would you bring him up again?

429
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,079
Don't bring up Giant anymore.

430
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,480
Just don't.

431
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,080
Giant.

432
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,790
Now, I'm stuck having to go to school.

433
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,119
Since we have to go anyway,

434
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,990
night school kids should get uniforms.

435
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,630
Day students and night students. Isn't this blatant discrimination?

436
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,429
Uniforms cost money, you know.

437
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,600
I guess since we're basically going for free.

438
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,500
That's just sad.

439
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,240
All this sadness is making me hungry.

440
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,710
Let's go get something to eat.

441
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,770
Food?

442
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,810
I know an amazing place for soybean paste stew.

443
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,210
Do you want to go?

444
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,650
Let's go.

445
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,320
- Let's go.
- Go!

446
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,850
This is the place.

447
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,590
Koh Yeong Bae. Koh Yeong Mi.

448
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,860
- Yeong Rye!
- Yeong Rye!

449
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,200
How have you two been?

450
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,440
Say hello. This is my friend.

451
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,070
Hello.

452
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,740
Go on. Say hello.

453
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,510
Hello.

454
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,510
Hi, little ones.

455
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,780
I'm your sister's friend,

456
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,120
Seo Jong Hee.

457
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,520
Here. I got you something!

458
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,790
Pastries!

459
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,760
Gosh. Pastries!

460
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,300
Pastries!

461
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,340
Yeong Mi. Here, have some water.

462
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,810
You too, Yeong Bae.

463
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Koh Yeong Mi.

464
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,649
Do you know what 4 divided by 4 is?

465
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,949
No. What's that?

466
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,649
It's 1. If there are 4 people and 4 pastries,

467
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,790
it means each person gets to eat one.

468
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,420
I guess being a stickler for the numbers runs in the family.

469
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
But...

470
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,530
Even in math, there's a little wiggle room.

471
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,130
Here you go.

472
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,170
Today's your lucky day.

473
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,010
Okay.

474
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,540
Thank you.

475
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,440
Eat slowly.

476
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,150
Should I give some to Yeong Bae too?

477
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,890
- Mom.
- Good grief. You're always here.

478
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,959
I told you to sleep in on your day off.

479
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,259
Why do you keep coming over?

480
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,530
Goodness. You are so stubborn.

481
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,660
My mom's got such a sharp tongue.

482
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,200
Even though she's happy to see me.

483
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,770
Happy? As if.

484
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,370
Why would I be happy about another mouth to feed?

485
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,010
And who's this?

486
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,179
Hello, I'm...

487
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,980
I'm Yeong Rye's roommate. My name is Seo Jong Hee.

488
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,610
Is that right?

489
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,980
Well, now, look at you.

490
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,980
Aren't you a pretty one?

491
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,990
Since you're here, you might as well stay for a bite.

492
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,290
Good thing you don't look like a big eater.

493
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
Give it.

494
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,090
That's just her way of saying she's glad you're here.

495
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,729
That's just how my mom is.

496
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,230
I got the message, loud and clear.

497
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,199
Mom. Is Yeong Sik coming home late today?

498
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,440
I feel like I haven't seen him in ages.

499
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,810
Hi, brother!

500
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,879
Hyeon. Hi.

501
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,950
Hey.

502
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,419
Even Mr. Popular gets tired, I see.

503
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,919
Tired? Not at all.

504
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,259
If my smile can bring happiness to even one person...

505
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,459
Then, according to the Constitution of Korea, Article ten.

506
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,289
"All citizens have the right to pursue happiness."

507
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,700
You'll find an excuse for anything, won't you?

508
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,969
Are you just getting here now? I didn't see you in class.

509
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,330
No, I'm on my way out.

510
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,670
I decided to skip class.

511
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,100
The weather was too nice, so I was photosynthesising.

512
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,770
Hey. But why are you leaving already?

513
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,739
Right. Today's the day, isn't it?

514
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,450
That tutoring gig. Your secret side hustle.

515
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,779
Thanks for setting me up.

516
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,120
I'll treat you when I get my first paycheck.

517
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,290
Don't worry. Think of all the meals I eat at your place.

518
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,119
You know that's in my neighbourhood, right?

519
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,160
I'll be around, so when you're done...

520
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,330
Why?

521
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,060
Again?

522
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,629
The Constitution of Korea, Article 17.

523
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,900
"All citizens have the right to privacy and freedom from intrusion."

524
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,340
So call me. I'm not eating dinner until you do.

525
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,099
Please, take it. No need to make a fuss.

526
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,500
Yes, ma'am.

527
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,409
The wife of the Hwashin Electronics chairman told me...

528
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,240
that you were a top student at Minguk University.

529
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,849
I was expecting you to look geeky,

530
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,450
but you're quite handsome.

531
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,849
Has anyone ever...

532
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,790
told you that you look like Clark Gable?

533
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,059
You know, the actor from "Gone with the Wind?"

534
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:16,290
I think there's a resemblance in your eyes and your jawline.

535
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,589
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

536
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,660
In any case...

537
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,769
My Jae Pil is a pretty good student,

538
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,570
but he seems to have hit a plateau.

539
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,770
And since he's my husband's only son...

540
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,579
By the way, what about you? Do you have any siblings?

541
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,540
I have two younger sisters and a younger brother.

542
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,880
I suppose your brother is around my son's age.

543
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
Hi.

544
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,650
So it looks like Jae Pil has finished changing his clothes.

545
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,719
Shall we head upstairs now, Mr. Koh?

546
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,460
Okay.

547
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,760
- Where to? The 2nd floor. Right.
- The 2nd floor.

548
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,210
A top law student tutoring illegally?

549
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,450
I guess grades and character are usually inversely proportional.

550
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,150
Well, I don't know about that.

551
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,490
But poverty and conscience usually are.

552
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,120
Something you'll probably never have to learn.

553
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,659
For now, we'll focus on English and Math.

554
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,730
Today will be Math.

555
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,530
Try this one first.

556
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,300
I'm going to time you, so pace yourself.

557
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,890
If it's like you said, and good grades mean bad character,

558
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,360
that means you must have a great personality?

559
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,159
So let's put that great character to use, work hard,

560
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,960
and pull those grades up. Shall we?

561
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,670
You'd have to try to get this first question wrong.

562
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,729
But since you've pulled off such a difficult feat,

563
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,200
I'm sure you'll have no problem overcoming any other obstacles.

564
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,270
And since you're supposedly so smart...

565
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,210
So, shall we begin?

566
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,210
Look.

567
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,420
- That's wrong.
- Goodness gracious.

568
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,149
Look how pitch-black the bottoms of their feet are.

569
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,689
Were they rolling around in a coal pit?

570
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,660
At this rate, crows are going to ask to be friends.

571
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,489
- Yeong Rye.
- Yes?

572
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,790
Go wash Yeong Bae and Yeong Mi's feet.

573
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,169
Koh Yeong Bae. Koh Yeong Mi. On the count of two. Get up. Move!

574
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,500
- One, two!
- One, two!

575
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,739
All right, I'll go get them cleaned up.

576
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,269
- Okay.
- Let's go.

577
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,370
Let's go.

578
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,840
Here. You wear the shoes.

579
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,580
- Is this Yeong Rye's room?
- Am I first?

580
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,250
Just look at your feet!

581
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,440
(Certificate of Commendation, Certificate of Appreciation)

582
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,149
(Academic Excellence Award: Koh Yeong Sik)

583
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,350
(Award Certificate: Koh Yeong Bae)

584
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,060
I can't make out a single word of this.

585
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,169
Who are you?

586
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,539
I'm Seo Jong Hee. I work with Yeong Rye.

587
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,139
I'm sorry for just walking in like this.

588
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,210
It's okay.

589
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,780
Seo Jong Hee. That's a pretty name. Nice to meet you.

590
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,060
Who's this?

591
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,730
This is Seo Jong Hee. She's Yeong Rye's friend from work.

592
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,029
Do you two know each other?

593
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,100
No, I just met her myself.

594
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,360
Jong Hee, this is...

595
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,100
Yeong Sik. When did you get here?

596
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,970
Looks like Jeong Hyeon is here again.

597
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,200
Hi, Ugly.

598
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,540
Long time no see. You've gotten even uglier.

599
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,840
It's not him, is it?

600
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,750
No wonder.

601
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,850
Hello. You must be Yeong Rye's brother.

602
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,450
My name is Seo Jong Hee.

603
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,530
What's that "that explains it" supposed to mean?

604
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,400
Go wait outside.

605
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,200
- I'm getting a strange vibe here.
- Go on. Hurry up.

606
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,980
- Mom.
- What?

607
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,910
Putting pumpkin in soybean paste stew is a little strange.

608
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,580
What's wrong with it?

609
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,680
Pumpkin is pumpkin.

610
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,549
The market lady was throwing it out just because it was a bit cracked.

611
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,820
So I snatched it up.

612
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,160
Gosh. Seriously, Mother?

613
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,630
That was a brilliant choice. So that was the secret ingredient.

614
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,860
Goodness.

615
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,600
- Yes.
- You're one smooth talker.

616
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,130
So, how is it? Is it any good?

617
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,270
I'll use a fresh one for you next time.

618
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,569
Not at all, Mother.

619
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,140
It's way better than with zucchini.

620
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,210
Goodness. Eat up. Don't just pick at your food.

621
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,650
Your eyes aren't just tired. They look completely sunken.

622
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,120
Is that a human face or a skull?

623
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,650
Here. Eat up.

624
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,750
Okay.

625
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,890
Right.

626
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,929
- Hey. Are you going to...
- Oh, no.

627
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,430
You're not? Okay.

628
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,410
- For me?
- Go ahead.

629
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,550
Here. You guys eat.

630
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,579
- Goodness.
- No.

631
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,490
What are you doing, eating that with your hands?

632
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,120
Slow down. Eat slowly.

633
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,690
Goodness gracious.

634
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,230
Don't fight over it.

635
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,130
- By the way, Mom.
- Yes?

636
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,730
I...

637
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,740
I applied to night school with Jong Hee.

638
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,940
What?

639
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,539
You'd have better luck getting blood from a stone.

640
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,910
What studying?

641
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,150
And how in the world are you going to pay the tuition?

642
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,880
I don't have to pay tuition. My company is paying for it.

643
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,149
They said there's a government subsidy.

644
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,250
Even so, it will still cost a pretty penny.

645
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,990
What about a bag and supplies? Do you think those are free?

646
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,729
Don't worry, Mother.

647
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,800
If it's a government subsidy, it'll probably cover most costs.

648
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,129
Anyway, Ugly.

649
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,500
You'll have to get prettier for high school. You are in trouble.

650
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,000
They'll kick you out if you're ugly.

651
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,870
Seo Jong Hee. Stop laughing.

652
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,009
Don't even react to him. Hurry up and eat.

653
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,110
Why not?

654
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,609
Hey. You will. I'm serious.

655
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,950
You could even set a record?

656
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,519
- Stop it.
- Your sister really is ugly.

657
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,349
- Just eat your food.
- Are you my brother?

658
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,589
- I'm your dad. Now, hurry and eat.
- Just eat.

659
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,590
Is that right?

660
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,300
Why is that guy always coming over to our house to eat?

661
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,270
Is he really from a rich family?

662
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,500
He says Mom's cooking is better than his family's housekeeper's.

663
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,110
What's this?

664
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,710
You said you were starting school.

665
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,950
These are my old notebooks. Thought they might help.

666
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,780
Now, get going.

667
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,170
And here I thought he didn't care.

668
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,050
Let's go.

669
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,280
I mean, seriously.

670
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,149
He's so smart,

671
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,660
and so handsome, too.

672
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,720
Do they pick their tutors based on looks?

673
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,530
I told you to interview a tutor,

674
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,000
not hold an audition for a movie star.

675
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,499
Stop going on about his looks.

676
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,410
Come on. If equal, pick the best. It's a bonus that he's handsome.

677
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,980
In any case...

678
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,239
I have a feeling...

679
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,379
he's just the person to get Jae Pil in a top school.

680
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,579
No doubt about it.

681
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,320
My gut tells me he's trustworthy.

682
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,050
I guess we'll see.

683
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,250
Water.

684
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,220
Jae Pil.

685
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,990
Where are you off to at this hour?

686
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,230
I'm going to the boxing gym.

687
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,600
Oh, my gosh. You must be out of your mind.

688
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,059
Do you want your father to kill you again?

689
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,369
Seriously, what's gotten into you?

690
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,530
Just be back early.

691
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,840
Don't stay out too late.

692
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,410
Well, that's a first.

693
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,539
I mean, he should be breathing fire right now.

694
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,240
What's gotten into Mr. Han?

695
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,150
You know what they say. Sudden changes mean death is near.

696
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,920
Is there something you'd like to say?

697
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,020
What?

698
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,420
No, it's nothing.

699
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,890
Alright, off you go.

700
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,640
That kid's harder to read than Han Gi Bok.

701
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,310
Okay, you go first.

702
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,740
One-two.

703
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,580
- Give me an uppercut.
- Wait a second.

704
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,079
So you're free to come to the gym whenever you want?

705
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,220
Yes, Sang Cheol.

706
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,420
You've said that a dozen times. Now, hit me.

707
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,159
It's just so hard to believe!

708
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,659
Seriously, what's gotten into your dad?

709
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,530
Getting your friends off suspension and even letting you box...

710
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,660
Like the old saying goes, if someone suddenly changes...

711
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,329
Anyway, it's really something else.

712
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,530
Alright, hit me.

713
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,540
Nice.

714
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,499
Punch properly. Come on.

715
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,539
To celebrate you becoming a free man,

716
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,009
I planned a killer event.

717
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,479
- You're not going to box, right?
- You've got to come.

718
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,679
You don't get to say no, got it?

719
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,180
What kind of trouble are you cooking up now?

720
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,080
This wouldn't even count as trouble.

721
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,250
You know our exams are coming up, right?

722
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,590
On the day it's over,

723
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,930
let's go on a 4-on-4 group date.

724
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,659
This Christmas...

725
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,870
I want to have a girlfriend to spend Christmas with.

726
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,070
What about the girl from Ddoddo Snack Bar?

727
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,100
Oh, her?

728
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,139
Turns out she's already taken.

729
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,909
That's why I want to do it too. The group date.

730
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,579
Come on. Let's do it. What do you say, Jae Pil?

731
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,949
A group date? Forget it. I'm out.

732
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,379
Come on. Why not?

733
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,249
You always say no to everything.

734
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,689
Do you know what the three most important things in life are?

735
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,950
Faith, hope, and love!

736
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,689
And the greatest of these is love. Do you understand?

737
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,819
Don't come crying to me later.

738
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,589
When your big brother gives you a chance, you should jump on it.

739
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,659
Who knows? You might meet the love of a lifetime.

740
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,899
Okay. Cut it out and get over here.

741
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,699
Hey. You just said okay.

742
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,399
- Just start already.
- So you're in.

743
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,599
Of course. Come on.

744
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,899
- Are you in or not?
- Just hit already!

745
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,709
- Are you in or out?
- Hit me.

746
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,370
- You're in, right?
- Hit me properly.

747
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,079
- You're in, right?
- Good one.

748
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,710
You said you're in. We're going!

749
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,550
Do your footwork.

750
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,050
(Cheongah Bus)

751
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,020
- Hey.
- Good luck today!

752
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,530
Gosh. That was rough.

753
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,429
Gosh. I'm exhausted.

754
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,739
Do you like that you're going to school?

755
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,209
Are they teaching you anything good?

756
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,240
That's what I'm saying.

757
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,940
What?

758
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,479
Well, look how pretty this is.

759
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,680
Don't touch it!

760
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,350
Gosh.

761
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,860
How was that?

762
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,000
My angry act was pretty good, right?

763
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:37,830
Did I get you?

764
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,269
Awesome, right?

765
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,169
You gave me a real fright.

766
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:44,409
Goodness gracious. You nearly scared me to death, girl.

767
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,510
I almost let a bad word slip out.

768
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,850
But you've really got a knack for it?

769
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,249
You're going to be a real actress someday.

770
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,479
- Really?
- Yes.

771
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,520
Come to think of it, you're right.

772
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,289
Yeong Rye. We're going to be late for school.

773
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,489
- Let's hurry.
- Okay.

774
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,290
- Thanks for the compliment.
- You bet.

775
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,960
Be careful crossing the street!

776
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:10,100
(Hwaran Girls' High School Art Exhibition)

777
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,670
Gosh. Back to school.

778
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,340
School.

779
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,150
I never imagined this, not even in my wildest dreams.

780
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,279
I'm actually going to school.

781
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,180
Do you think I ever imagined this?

782
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,050
Studying. Gosh.

783
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,520
How in the world did I end up here?

784
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,130
Here.

785
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:37,690
What's this?

786
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:39,359
I got one for you.

787
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,800
A little something to celebrate our first day of school.

788
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,300
So this is your way of telling me to study hard?

789
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,710
Gosh. This is exactly what I've always wanted!

790
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,310
It's just...

791
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:02,150
I just hope we can write a new chapter in our lives together.

792
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:07,020
Thanks for going to school with me, Seo Jong Hee.

793
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,330
You...

794
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:13,730
Now I can't fall asleep during class, can I?

795
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,169
You've totally got me wrapped around your finger, Koh Yeong Rye.

796
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:21,600
You bet. If you start to nod off, I'll be there to wake you up.

797
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,509
You're one scary woman.

798
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,410
You're a sly fox disguised as a teddy bear.

799
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,510
Okay, fine.

800
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:30,780
Since...

801
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,120
Since you were so thoughtful, I'll carry it with me always.

802
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,720
I can't promise I'll actually study with it, though.

803
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,220
- Let's go.
- Okay.

804
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,670
- What is it?
- Look at this.

805
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,569
(Good luck to whoever is studying here!)

806
00:46:58,570 --> 00:46:59,809
That's cute.

807
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,510
That's adorable. I should write back.

808
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,770
Excuse me. One second. I think my MyMy is at my desk.

809
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,900
It's here. Thank goodness.

810
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,840
Excuse me. You're from Bus 100, right?

811
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:35,040
You're the one who gave me a ride when I was about to be late.

812
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:36,710
Oh, right!

813
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,149
You're that student.

814
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,519
That's me. I can't believe you're here...

815
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,789
- It's so good to see you!
- It's so good to see you too!

816
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,919
This is so crazy. What are the odds...

817
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,960
Hello?

818
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,459
I was there with her that day, you know?

819
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,690
Get over here, then.

820
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,430
This is so wild.

821
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,199
- Mom.
- Yes?

822
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,769
Why are you closing up so early today?

823
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,940
Well, it's nice to have a day like this once in a while.

824
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:06,480
We sold out of all the sugar we brought.

825
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,350
And we were packed with customers for the horse rides all day long.

826
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:10,550
Oh, gosh.

827
00:48:10,551 --> 00:48:13,879
If every day were like today, we would be rich in no time.

828
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,819
Really? Are we rich now, Mom?

829
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,150
Of course! To us, this is a fortune.

830
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,989
Yeong Bae. Yeong Mi. Come here for a second.

831
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:24,990
Okay!

832
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:27,960
Here you go.

833
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,369
Here. Go buy yourselves some ice pops.

834
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:31,799
Gosh. Ice pops!

835
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,100
Let's go, Yeong Mi!

836
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,870
Honestly.

837
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,640
It's the little things that make them so happy.

838
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:45,410
Oh, my goodness!

839
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:52,460
Oh, no!

840
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,560
Oh, no.

841
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,270
Oh, goodness.

842
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:12,609
Koh Yeong Rye. Hurry home!

843
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:14,680
Your mom was in an accident and got hurt!

844
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,220
Mom!

845
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,390
Mom, are you okay? Are you all right?

846
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,800
What's all the fuss?

847
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:36,399
I'm not dead. Don't be so dramatic.

848
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,830
What happened?

849
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,440
How did this happen?

850
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,510
She was pulling her cart up a hill, and she fell.

851
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,570
She cut up her knees and arms a bit.

852
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,780
And I told her to go to the hospital in case of internal injuries,

853
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,209
but she's being stubborn, as usual.

854
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:54,550
Mom, come on. You're really worrying me.

855
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,389
We need to get you to a hospital.

856
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,889
A hospital? Don't be ridiculous.

857
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:01,160
Cut the nonsense.

858
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:03,730
The hospital is the least of my worries.

859
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:08,400
That cart. What am I going to do about the cart?

860
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:11,129
I had to go to the head of my savings club...

861
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:15,100
and beg to get the first payout so I could finally buy it.

862
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,939
I still have a year of payments, and now I've gone and destroyed it.

863
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,139
What am I going to do? Goodness.

864
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,609
- Mom.
- Mom.

865
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:25,710
I guess you can't escape your fate.

866
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:30,020
I just had to open my big mouth and say we were okay. I jinxed it.

867
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,820
That's how I feed my family of five. What am I going to do?

868
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:41,160
My poor kids. What's going to happen to them?

869
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:47,340
Mom.

871
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,010
One at a time, please!

872
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,040
Hurry on up.

873
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,250
All clear!

874
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:15,220
Manager,

875
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,830
can't you make just one exception?

876
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,299
Please, sir. Just this once.

877
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,730
I'm in a really desperate spot.

878
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,570
Yeong Rye. Are you that desperate?

879
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,300
Yes.

880
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,799
Well, I've got bigger problems. All right?

881
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,270
Corporate is breathing down my neck about our deposit numbers.

882
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:34,310
This job is going to be the death of me.

883
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:35,949
And I'd like to live a long life.

884
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,149
Manager.

885
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,220
Forget it. Every single one of you has some sob story.

886
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,249
Someone's parents are on death's door.

887
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,219
For another, their house is flooded and destroyed every other day.

888
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,789
I mean, if I hear this sob story and that sob story,

889
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:48,459
how is the company supposed to stay in business?

890
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,560
Are we running a charity here?

891
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,229
Do you think money just grows on trees?

892
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,159
That we can just pluck it whenever we want?

893
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,160
Then...

894
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,669
If you can't give me a two-month advance...

895
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,429
- How about just one month's?
- Hey.

896
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:00,440
What if you just take the advance and run off?

897
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,339
How am I supposed to cover that?

898
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,169
You're really making this difficult for me.

899
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:05,170
For goodness' sake.

900
00:53:05,171 --> 00:53:07,239
You know I'm not that kind of person.

901
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,109
Sir, I would never just run off.

902
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,779
I promise on my life. I really mean it.

903
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,880
"Promise?"

904
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,979
You know what I don't believe in? Promises. You hear me?

905
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,449
And I trust people even less.

906
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:17,689
Absolutely not. Now get out.

907
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,189
Manager, please.

908
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,759
I just have nowhere else to turn.

909
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,759
Quiet! Get out! Go on. Get back to work.

910
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,490
Get out!

911
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:47,980
What brings you here?

912
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,320
I doubt you came just to check on me.

913
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,290
Uncle.

914
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,330
The money you borrowed from my dad...

915
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,960
Could you please pay it back?

916
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,160
What?

917
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,130
You people in this family...

918
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,770
are always harping on about that money.

919
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,139
Your mother came here and made a scene...

920
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,310
when your brother started college.

921
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:13,780
I already paid that money back. How many times must I tell you?

922
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,810
But you didn't.

923
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:20,420
We know everything.

924
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:26,620
Then...

925
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,490
Lend me some money, then.

926
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:31,390
I promise I'll pay you back.

927
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:35,830
My mom was in an accident, and her cart was destroyed.

928
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,569
She's hurt, too.

929
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,540
But she's refusing to even go to the hospital.

930
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:41,470
I'll pay you back.

931
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,540
I promise I'll find a way to pay you back someday.

932
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,610
Business has been slow for us lately.

933
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,750
We're completely tapped out...

934
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,080
of money.

935
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,879
And frankly...

936
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,420
Your mother is the one who cut us off in the first place.

937
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:00,889
She ghosts us on the holidays without so much as a phone call.

938
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:04,390
But you only show up when you need money.

939
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,240
Here. Take this for bus fare.

940
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,330
Gosh. What on earth happened?

941
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,130
I'm fine, really.

942
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,370
You silly goose.

943
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,139
If it's raining, you could at least buy a cheap umbrella.

944
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,909
What are you doing, wandering around in the rain?

945
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,510
You're going to catch a cold.

946
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,180
Oh, no.

947
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,379
And what on earth happened to your nails?

948
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,420
What's this here?

949
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:59,150
I'm a total wreck, aren't I?

950
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,360
Just hold still. I'll go find a bandage for that.

951
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:07,360
It's always one thing after another with you, Koh Yeong Rye.

952
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:09,229
The housemother is already complaining...

953
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,970
that our room's deposits are always short.

954
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:13,939
So don't you dare get sick and miss work.

955
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,370
You'll be dead meat.

956
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,070
The rest of you, get to bed!

957
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:20,080
Listen to Hae Ja, girls.

958
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,109
How on earth did you get so hurt?

959
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:25,250
I'm okay.

960
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,510
If all those stars were money,

961
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:58,910
I'd stay up all night,

962
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,720
whatever it takes,

963
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,150
and I'd pick them all,

964
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:09,120
every last one.

965
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:38,820
What are you up to?

966
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,360
Come on in.

967
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:45,130
What are you doing, Ms. Koh?

968
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,129
It's not like you're exercising under the moonlight.

969
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:48,260
Why the cleaning?

970
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:52,169
I probably won't want to do it at dawn tomorrow,

971
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,200
so I'm doing it now.

972
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,300
Right.

973
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,470
Cleaning at 4 am is no joke.

974
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,640
I'm still going to wait until tomorrow, though.

975
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:21,800
You're upset about your mom's accident, aren't you?

976
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,510
I guess you don't know I have superpowers.

977
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,380
The truth is...

978
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,680
I'm an alien from a star called Andromeda.

979
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,480
And that's why...

980
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,780
I can see right through what humans are thinking.

981
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,890
- Really?
- Yes.

982
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,620
Or so I'd like to say, but...

983
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,530
I just don't have the energy for it today.

984
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,670
Then how did you know?

985
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:01,570
Just a lucky guess.

986
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,020
Here.

987
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,120
What's this for?

988
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,320
It's a gift.

989
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:24,930
You gave me one, too.

990
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,630
It might not look like much,

991
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:30,930
but he's a pretty hefty guy.

992
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:52,890
I can't...

993
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:55,490
Use this to get your mom a new cart.

994
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,730
I'm not just giving it to you, though.

995
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,060
It's a loan.

996
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,470
You can pay me when you're a teacher and you get your first paycheck.

997
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:05,499
And I won't charge you interest.

998
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,239
No, I can't take this.

999
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,299
How can I possibly take this much money from you?

1000
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,410
Just take it.

1001
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:13,910
This is what this money is for.

1002
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,939
End of discussion.

1003
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:17,479
Jong Hee, but really...

1004
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,980
Come on. Just take it.

1005
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:23,720
Fine. Then, as a bonus, I'm putting one favour in the bank.

1006
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:26,720
And you have to grant it, no matter what. Okay?

1007
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:32,760
But still, I can't take it.

1008
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:34,700
Take it.

1009
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,730
I'll be hurt if you don't.

1010
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,040
If it makes you feel better,

1011
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,040
then you can pay me back a certain amount each month.

1012
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,990
Hey.

1013
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:02,490
What is it?

1014
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,030
Koh Yeong Rye. Are you crying?

1015
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:07,430
I'm not crying. It's just the rain.

1016
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,800
The rain stopped a while ago.

1017
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,100
Gosh. Koh Yeong Rye.

1018
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,100
You're easy. All it takes is a little money?

1019
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:22,140
That's right. I can be bought. I love money.

1020
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,350
What are you going to do about it?

1021
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,000
But seriously...

1022
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,200
After going through all this,

1023
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:55,210
I realised you absolutely have to have money.

1024
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,480
It was a real wake-up call.

1025
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,250
What if Mom...

1026
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:08,360
had been seriously hurt?

1027
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:13,800
Money's a scary thing, isn't it?

1028
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:19,430
You're just figuring that out now?

1029
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,020
You know.

1030
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:38,589
I've started keeping a diary lately.

1031
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:40,320
With the fountain pen you gave me.

1032
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:42,490
And guess what?

1033
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,360
You know what I find myself writing the most?

1034
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:49,130
"Did something with Yeong Rye."

1035
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:50,700
"It was fun."

1036
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,370
"I laughed so hard. I was happy."

1037
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,410
I was never the kind of person who used words like that.

1038
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:03,340
But thanks to you, life's gotten a little more fun.

1039
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:07,250
So, you see...

1040
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,190
That doesn't even compare.

1041
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:16,930
You're giving me something so much more valuable.

1042
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,810
That was a little...

1043
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,940
cheesy, Seo Jong Hee.

1044
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,080
I know.

1045
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,120
I regretted it the second I said it.

1046
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:12,610
This is my favourite song.

1047
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:22,659
- So full of love - So full of love

1048
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:26,089
- You and I alone - You and I alone

1049
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:29,729
- Where and as what - Where and as what

1050
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:33,270
- Shall we meet again - Shall we meet again

1051
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:58,460
(Yeong Sik's Horse Rides)

1052
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:01,130
Gosh. This beauty is just gleaming.

1053
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:04,470
It's much more handsome than the last one.

1054
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:06,600
This must've cost a fortune.

1055
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:09,500
Did you really get a paycheck advance for this?

1056
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,770
What's gotten into him? That cheapskate personnel manager.

1057
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:14,979
- Well...
- Well, Yeong Rye...

1058
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:16,680
is just that good at her job.

1059
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,779
It'd be a huge loss for them if she went to another company.

1060
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,280
So they're just buttering her up.

1061
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,380
Well, at least he knows a good thing when he sees it.

1062
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:27,090
I can get right back out there and start working tomorrow. Right?

1063
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:28,690
- Mom.
- Mom.

1064
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:31,589
No way. What are you talking about, business?

1065
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,899
You need to rest all this week. You can go out next week.

1066
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,229
Nonsense.

1067
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:38,100
I'm stir-crazy from not working for a few days.

1068
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,729
I'm perfectly fine.

1069
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:43,809
What do you mean, "perfectly fine?" You look like you should be in bed.

1070
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:46,009
Hurry up and go rest. I'll get your bed ready.

1071
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,439
- Come on. Go on.
- Honestly. Don't fuss.

1072
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,249
- Go on. Get inside.
- Hey, you little brat.

1073
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,550
When did you get so strong? Oh, my gosh.

1074
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:54,480
- I told you I'm fine!
- Get in.

1075
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:04,760
Yeong Rye told me.

1076
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:08,600
Thank you. I promise I'll pay you back.

1077
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,130
Please. Don't worry about paying me back.

1078
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:13,070
You two really are siblings, aren't you?

1079
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,770
It's not like I need the money right away.

1080
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:21,380
If you really insist on paying it back,

1081
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,050
you can play rock-paper-scissors with Yeong Rye for it.

1082
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:27,280
I was a step too late.

1083
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:43,500
Okay. Pencils down!

1084
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,370
Hands on your heads.

1085
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,540
Person in the last row, pass the answer sheets forward.

1086
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,040
The answer...

1087
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,880
Here.

1088
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:01,620
My bad neck always flares up around exam time.

1089
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,079
Maybe from sleeping with my head on the desk all the time?

1090
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,090
Here?

1091
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,719
- Right there. That's the spot.
- Goodness.

1092
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,919
That's something to be proud of.

1093
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,989
Hey! You're messing up my hair.

1094
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:11,060
You have no idea how much work I put into this this morning.

1095
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,760
It's so sticky.

1096
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:14,960
What is this? Did you use mousse?

1097
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,830
- Of course I did.
- Why?

1098
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:20,699
Because, as I've already announced,

1099
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:23,340
today is our last big blind date of senior year.

1100
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,469
So you're coming, right?

1101
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:27,179
I made it very clear I'm not going. You go on your own.

1102
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:28,280
Come on. Hey.

1103
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,110
Can't you do this one little thing for your friend?

1104
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:32,650
The numbers are already set!

1105
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,620
My handsome and cool friend, who's also super loyal. Jae Pil.

1106
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:38,090
Brother!

1107
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:40,419
So now I'm your brother? You say that when you want a favour.

1108
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:42,089
- I'm begging you.
- No.

1109
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,059
- Please, just for an hour!
- Let go.

1110
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:47,060
Please, just for one hour!

1111
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,000
- Gosh.
- I'll owe you big. Just one hour.

1112
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:53,170
You're driving me nuts. Brother!

1113
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,039
Please.

1114
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,039
So Yeong and Jeong Hui were supposed to go,

1115
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,109
but they bailed when they got tickets for "Music Top Ten."

1116
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:02,309
You got to help me out, just this once.

1117
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:04,879
It's a 4-on-4 date. How can only 2 of us show up?

1118
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,879
No way. I hate these things.

1119
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,049
I know, right? It's always a bunch of losers.

1120
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:10,989
But they said one of them is very popular.

1121
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:12,389
For real!

1122
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:15,089
- I told you no.
- You go by yourself then.

1123
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,190
Look...

1124
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,829
I'll give you my MyMy.

1125
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:20,330
You two can listen to music on it.

1126
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:23,230
- Please.
- It's a cassette player.

1127
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:27,270
This kind of deal between friends is not exactly proper.

1128
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,470
How many people bailed on this blind date, you said?

1129
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:31,809
- Two?
- Two.

1130
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:33,070
Okay.

1131
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,349
We'll take their spots.

1132
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:39,749
Seo Jong Hee! What are you talking about?

1133
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,620
We have class.

1134
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,100
A group date? No way.

1135
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,129
No way.

1136
01:12:58,130 --> 01:12:59,629
No way. That's out of the question.

1137
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:01,370
Why is it out of the question?

1138
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:03,400
I always wanted to try one of those group dates.

1139
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,269
Let's just do it while we have the chance. Okay?

1140
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:07,710
Then what about our class?

1141
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,180
And besides...

1142
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,580
I don't feel right about going and pretending to be a day student.

1143
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,050
Why? I think it sounds fun.

1144
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:18,920
And Ju Gyeong said she could lend us the uniforms.

1145
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,819
Let's do it, Yeong Rye. Please?

1146
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,160
No. I can't do it.

1147
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:28,330
You know I'm a terrible liar.

1148
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,260
- I can't.
- Hey.

1149
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,200
You only get better at lying with practice.

1150
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,040
Come on. Please?

1151
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,070
Okay, fine.

1152
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:40,740
Then I'm cashing in that favour right now.

1153
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,780
You know, the wish I've been saving, the one you promised you'd grant?

1154
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,779
You haven't forgotten, have you?

1155
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:48,420
But that's...

1156
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:05,470
- Hey.
- What?

1157
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:06,930
One hour. That's it.

1158
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:09,739
We're here for one hour, tops. Then I'm off to boxing.

1159
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:12,570
Fine. Suit yourself.

1160
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:14,810
You can just sit there and look pretty.

1161
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,580
After all, your only job...

1162
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,910
is to be the eye candy that brings up our average.

1163
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,290
Hey. They're here.

1164
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:10,030
(A Hundred Memories)

1165
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:30,119
- I had fun today.
- Bye!

1166
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,450
Hey. They're just leaving like this?

1167
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:34,319
Are you planning to ask them on another date?

1168
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,359
What?

1169
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,530
I have a great idea.

1170
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:39,090
What are you up to?

1171
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:41,359
A boxing gym event?

1172
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,899
They asked me to tell you they really want to invite you.

1173
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,269
The handsome one.

1174
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:47,070
He is the one who is into Yeong Rye.

1175
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:48,669
(What's on your mind? Are you thinking of Han Jae Pil?)

1176
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,500
I'm sure it's not like that.

1177
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:52,470
Are you coming today?

1178
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:54,179
- Hi.
- Hi.

1179
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:55,209
Let's go.

1180
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:56,239
It'll be fun.

1181
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,780
(Giant Boxing Gym)

1182
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:06,490
Stop it!

1183
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,220
Stop it.
