(Episode 11: Miss Korea)

8
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,430
Try some.

9
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,900
A friend gave me this pu'er tea.

10
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,730
I heard fermented tea is good for you.

11
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,430
The aroma's quite nice.

12
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Thank you.

13
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,780
"So, why did you want to see me?"

14
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
"Don't beat around the bush. Just get to the point."

15
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,650
You've got that look in your eye, don't you?

16
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,819
It's just that my next appointment will be here soon.

17
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,420
Okay, down to business then.

18
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
Koh Yeong Rye.

19
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,040
How about you and me stir things up a bit?

20
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,839
Stir things up? What do you mean...?

21
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,910
How would you like to enter the Miss Korea pageant?

22
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,610
What?

23
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,740
Our salon already has a candidate we've been backing.

24
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,980
With my 20 years of experience picking winners, my gut tells me...

25
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,390
she's missing that certain something.

26
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,760
And I think you've got what she's missing.

27
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,090
So, what do you say?

28
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
Director.

29
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,259
I've never even dreamed of doing something like that...

30
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,930
Well, start thinking about it now.

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,370
Registration for the preliminaries is this weekend.

32
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,199
Compared to the girls who've been professionally groomed,

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,740
I think you're much more natural and refreshing.

34
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,939
But Director...

35
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,610
You said your dream was to go to college, right?

36
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,580
If you're crowned Miss Korea,

37
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,290
you get 15,000 dollars in scholarship money.

38
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,059
I know that because of your financial situation,

39
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,590
you're working and squeezing in time to study for night school.

40
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,290
That'll take forever.

41
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,330
With this,

42
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,300
Isn't that motivation enough?

43
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,540
I'm all for it.

44
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,910
You've always wanted to go to college.

45
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,309
And if money weren't an issue, you could just focus on getting in.

46
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,780
Even if you don't place, I think it'll be a great life experience.

47
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,820
Taking on a challenge is your thing, isn't it?

48
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,020
Aren't you Koh Yeong Rye, the girl who always goes for broke?

49
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,860
Still...

50
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,930
This is on another level, though.

51
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,230
Me, Miss Korea? I could never even dream of it.

52
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,170
Never dream of it?

53
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,940
Why not? What's wrong with you?

54
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,000
In my eyes, you're already the winner.

55
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
Hey.

56
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,779
I'm being serious here.

57
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,010
Okay. What about your mom?

58
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,210
Have you told your mom?

59
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,780
No, not yet.

60
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,120
My mom would totally freak out.

61
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,860
Still...

62
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,220
I should probably talk to her about it, right?

63
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,630
Yeah, I probably should.

64
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,039
Gosh, I told you to go upstairs. You must be tired.

65
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,110
Why are you so stubborn?

66
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,310
It'd be easier to just do this myself.

67
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,050
What is it?

68
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,620
You have something to say, don't you?

69
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,560
It's like you're psychic.

70
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,689
If you set up shop as a fortune-teller,

71
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,390
you'd put all the famous psychics in this town out of business.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,200
I'll be old and gray by the time you're done.

73
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,830
Enough with the flattery.

74
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,870
Hurry up and tell me. What is it?

75
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
So...

76
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,010
that lady from the...

77
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,420
The Art or Magic salon or whatever...

78
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,589
She asked you to enter the Miss Korea pageant?

79
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,790
Yes.

80
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,020
She said if I win, there's scholarship money.

81
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,030
It's 15,000 dollars.

82
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,729
It's 15,000 dollars?

83
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,930
With that money,

84
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,299
the landlord would stop hassling us about...

85
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,670
the rent for the shop,

86
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,500
and I'd have enough for tuition and living expenses.

87
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,840
I think I could finally just focus on getting into college, but...

88
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,639
But?

89
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,940
Why'd you stop mid-sentence?

90
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,910
What if I don't make it?

91
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,049
I mean, what if...

92
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,590
What if I reach the finals and I still don't win?

93
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,820
I can't work during the training camp,

94
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,830
so I won't get a paycheck.

95
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,490
I'm afraid it'll just be a waste of time.

96
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,530
And I won't be able to help you with expenses.

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,799
Don't you even think about the expenses.

98
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,139
How can I not?

99
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,409
I know you're already struggling to make rent.

100
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,170
Not this time.

101
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,250
Don't worry about the money.

102
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,450
If you want to do this, then do it.

103
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,620
So what if you fail? It's not the end of the world.

104
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
All those years I was raising you,

105
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,570
do you know what I said to you the most?

106
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,500
"Don't do it."

107
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,770
"Do it later."

108
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,380
Back then, I was desperate, trying to feed a family of five.

109
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,180
I needed you to help out.

110
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,050
I mean, come on.

111
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,960
Hey, if you'd used your brain for studying,

112
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,590
you would've made something of yourself by now.

113
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,170
When you were young, you were busy helping on the buses.

114
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,000
And now you're too busy doing everyone else's hair.

115
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,620
For once, I just wanted to tell you, "Go for it."

116
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,520
You're at an age where you should sparkle with all you want to do.

117
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,159
Mom, why are you being like this all of a sudden?

118
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,590
Hey, that's just how I feel, okay?

119
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,900
So just go for it, Miss Korea or whatever.

120
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,700
This time, I'm going to back you up 100 percent.

121
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,840
And stop worrying about the living expenses.

122
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,640
Really?

123
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,110
You mean I can really do it?

124
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,950
But I might not win.

125
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,189
Why do you always think about failing first?

126
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,760
If you're going to do this, you must believe you'll win.

127
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,700
Okay, I'll really do it then, Mom. Okay?

128
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,900
I'll work really hard.

129
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,370
I'll work so, so hard.

130
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,540
Thank you, Mom.

131
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,209
You'd better be thankful.

132
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,180
You only got an offer like that because you take after me.

133
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,760
You've got my figure, and you're gorgeous.

134
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,830
And for the record, I was considered tall in my day, you know?

135
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,930
I can't believe it. My daughter's doing Miss Korea.

136
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,640
I'll do it, ma'am.

137
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,310
I'm going to give Miss Korea a shot.

138
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,880
Good. You made the right choice.

139
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,720
Let's create a masterpiece. It's been a while.

140
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
Hey.

141
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,670
You get a real kick out of this, don't you?

142
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,810
Showing up unannounced like this.

143
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,580
Yep, it's fun watching you run out all flustered.

144
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,380
Studying all day must be frying your brain, right?

145
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,520
Want to go blow off some steam with me again?

146
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,130
Keep your eye on the ball.

147
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,610
You have to get the timing right.

148
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,880
All right, focus. Timing.

149
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,079
You're really off your game today.

150
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,280
Tell me about it.

151
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,220
I just can't seem to get it right.

152
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,220
Why don't you take a swing?

153
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,290
I'm totally wiped.

154
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,400
Gosh, you're a natural!

155
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,540
This is good.

156
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,910
Are you actually enjoying that?

157
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,220
It looks like it's half-melted.

158
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,420
I'm starting to regret buying you that ice cream.

159
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,290
What do you mean? I'm trying my best.

160
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,890
Don't push yourself.

161
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,990
You're exhausted.

162
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,850
Want to sit for a minute?

163
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,630
You really are...

164
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,730
the Seo Jong Hee expert.

165
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,600
To be honest, today...

166
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,100
I came because I wanted you to notice...

167
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,800
that I'm having a hard time.

168
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,510
Why?

169
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,640
What's weighing on you this time?

170
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,880
Where do I even begin?

171
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,080
Hope, disappointment, desire...

172
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,090
Jealousy, love...

173
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,030
And that complicated feeling of hating someone you love.

174
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,730
I think life is hard because we are emotional creatures.

175
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,999
You can power through other hardships,

176
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,200
but feelings...

177
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,670
You just can't control them.

178
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,110
That's true. The heart...

179
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,980
It is impossible to control, even when it's your own.

180
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,950
Looking back on it,

181
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,120
I think the most important thing is timing.

182
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,759
Even in baseball,

183
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,000
you have to swing at the right time to raise your batting average.

184
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,459
Just like today.

185
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,230
But your timing today was perfect for a great pinch hitter.

186
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,340
You're right. I had you.

187
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,750
There's something I've learned in my life.

188
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,120
The present is just as important as timing.

189
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,420
Because the things you do right now...

190
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,660
are what create your next opportunity.

191
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,390
So,

192
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,130
there's still a chance.

193
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,430
You think so?

194
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,340
Still, I'm glad I came to see you.

195
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,740
Now that I've talked with you like this,

196
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,680
I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

197
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,919
You have to go back in?

198
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,420
No. I'm heading home for the day.

199
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,250
Want to have dinner at my mom's? You can see Yeong Rye too.

200
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,860
No, thanks.

201
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,690
Not today...

202
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,400
All right.

203
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,100
Oh, by the way, did you hear?

204
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,370
Yeong Rye is entering the Miss Korea pageant.

205
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,300
Miss Korea?

206
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,300
Apparently, her salon's director suggested it.

207
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,110
And it looks like she decided to go for it.

208
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,080
Anyway, Koh Yeong Rye is really something else.

209
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,310
She's always so unpredictable, that one.

210
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,870
What are you doing here? You didn't even call.

211
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,540
You made me worry for days. Are you here out of guilt?

212
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,450
Want to stay for dinner?

213
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,720
No, that's not it.

214
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,920
- Mom. - Yes?

215
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,960
I'm going to enter the Miss Korea pageant.

216
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,530
What?

217
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,260
I said I'm going to compete in Miss Korea.

218
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,530
The one Ms. Juri at the salon suggested before.

219
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,810
It's been my childhood dream to be Miss Korea.

220
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,410
To be honest, when she made that offer,

221
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,250
my heart was pounding because I wanted to do it so badly.

222
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,620
But I gave up on it because you were against it.

223
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,620
But now, I really want to do it.

224
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,030
I'm going to do it.

225
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,700
Please, let me compete in Miss Korea.

226
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,630
Are you sure you can win the crown?

227
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,470
You're Yang Mi Sook's daughter.

228
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,480
If you're going to be in Miss Korea, you'd better bring home the crown.

229
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,580
If you're that confident, then go for it.

230
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,949
It would open up global opportunities.

231
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,920
And it wouldn't be a bad experience.

232
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,490
I will.

233
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,800
I'll become Miss Korea.

234
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,939
- Thank you. - Of course.

235
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,270
I'm looking forward to working with you all.

236
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,780
Jong Hee.

237
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:35,419
Thank you so much for making this difficult decision.

238
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,420
Seriously.

239
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:40,790
It's like we've just gained a whole army.

240
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,230
I mean, it's great you're on board, but...

241
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,160
How on earth did you convince the Madam Chairman?

242
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,630
I begged her, saying I really wanted to do it.

243
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,070
Oh my goodness. Madam Chairman is a real softy for her daughter.

244
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,670
That's so sweet to see.

245
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,640
Jong Hee.

246
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,140
Just trust me.

247
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,249
You don't have to worry about a thing.

248
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,410
Director.

249
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,579
Isn't that Michelle?

250
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,820
Did you say Michelle?

251
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,390
Hello!

252
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,259
It's been a while, Director. You've been well, I hope?

253
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,330
Well...

254
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,689
I don't think we're on friendly enough terms...

255
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,899
to be asking how we're doing.

256
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,260
But completely ignoring each other is just so tacky, don't you think?

257
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,340
By the way...

258
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,040
Where is Michelle's candidate?

259
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,810
Jong Hee.

260
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,140
What are you doing? Hurry up and come inside.

261
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,930
Ms. Koh.

262
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,330
She looks a lot like our Ms. Koh, doesn't she?

263
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,130
No!

264
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,000
It really is Ms. Koh.

265
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,570
What?

266
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,170
Ms. Koh.

267
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,320
Go on and say it.

268
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,550
You said you had something to tell me.

269
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,460
I felt...

270
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,800
I felt I should be the one to tell you.

271
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,440
Jong Hee.

272
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,079
The thing is, Jae Pil and I...

273
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,750
What, did you two decide to start dating?

274
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,620
Why are you making it such a big deal?

275
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,160
Congratulations.

276
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,490
So you're the one who won Han Jae Pil's heart.

277
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,630
But you competing in Miss Korea... That's a surprise.

278
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,000
It kind of feels like I was blind sided.

279
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,110
Director Michelle saw something in me.

280
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,550
She said if I win Miss Korea, there's a scholarship grant.

281
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,220
So after thinking it over, I decided to go for it.

282
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,750
The scholarship money.

283
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,730
Right.

284
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,900
Your dream has always been to go to college.

285
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,800
If I'd known you were competing as Juri's candidate,

286
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,870
maybe...

287
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,769
I wouldn't have been able to do it.

288
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,870
No.

289
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,410
You don't need to feel that way.

290
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,480
In fact, hearing you're competing makes me even more fired up.

291
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,690
You just do your best.

292
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,020
And I'll do my best too.

293
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,960
Let's have another fair fight, Koh Yeong Rye.

294
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,870
It won't be so easy for you this time.

295
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,549
One, two, knees!

296
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,819
Three, four, shoulders back!

297
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,689
One, two, tighten your core! Three, four!

298
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,400
One, two, three, four.

299
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,169
- One, step forward, that's it! - Three, good!

300
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,100
Find your center and tighten your core.

301
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,570
Pose.

302
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,409
There it is. You've got it.

303
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,009
Pose. Three, four.

304
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,210
Go.

305
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,180
With a little more confidence.

306
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,150
Pose.

307
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,550
Okay.

308
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,220
Jong Hee is the best.

309
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,930
Hello. I am contestant number 34, Seo Jong Hee.

310
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,469
That was wonderful.

311
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,670
Okay, when you say "Seo Jong Hee," your smile has to reach your eyes.

312
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,880
One, one.

313
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,050
One, one.

314
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,580
One.

315
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,880
Pose.

316
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,690
One, two, three.

317
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,499
Who will go on to the 1989 Miss Korea pageant finals.

318
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,030
We'll now announce the final results of the Miss Seoul competition.

319
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,070
Miss Seoul's 2nd runner-up is Number 23, Cho Min Sun.

320
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,640
The 1st runner-up is Number 34, Seo Jong Hee.

321
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,170
And the winner is Number 15, Koh Yeong Rye.

322
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,109
Oh my goodness!

323
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,550
Hope you sell a lot today.

324
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,250
- Hey, Ms. Park. - What is it?

325
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,320
I heard there was some good news over at your place.

326
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,289
Oh, the good news...

327
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,890
It's not a big deal.

328
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,889
It's just the Miss Seoul title, that's all.

329
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,099
She still has the finals to go. You never know what'll happen.

330
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,230
But still.

331
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,169
But the Miss Seoul winner has always had an advantage.

332
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,140
Wow, that's wonderful!

333
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,570
Darn it!

334
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,809
Why are you hanging that thing crooked?

335
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,010
What do you mean? Like this?

336
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,979
A little higher. Up, up.

337
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,510
Up? Like this? All right, how about now?

338
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,109
- A little lower... - Yeong Bae, what was that?

339
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,849
- A bit lower. A little lower. - Lower? Like this?

340
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,150
No, higher! Darn it! Hey!

341
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,020
Are you blind? Why can't you hang it straight?

342
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,419
There. Look, look. How is it now? Right now.

343
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,160
Now it looks right.

344
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,699
But Mom, you need to control that temper.

345
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,100
You could be the mother of Miss Korea soon.

346
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,899
No, I just...

347
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,840
I was just telling him to hang it up properly.

348
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,940
Oh, gosh. It's done now.

349
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,780
I still can't tell if I'm dreaming or if this is real.

350
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,750
What if Yeong Rye actually becomes Miss Korea?

351
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,219
Yeong Bae and Yeong Mi, what are we going to do?

352
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,650
That'd be great.

353
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,190
If she wins, we have to ask her to show us around the TV station.

354
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,029
I want to see Kim Wan Sun.

355
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,399
Gosh, the banner's already up. It looks amazing.

356
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,500
- You're here. - Hello.

357
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,600
Is Yeong Rye not here yet?

358
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,399
I wanted to congratulate her before camp, since I won't see her.

359
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,069
Oh, she called earlier.

360
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,340
She said she's going to be a little late.

361
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,879
She must have a lot to take care of with the director.

362
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,080
Well, in that case...

363
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,379
Should we start the party without our guest of honour?

364
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,510
It's my treat.

365
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,620
You should get out and have someone else cook for you sometimes, ma'am.

366
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,220
Should we? All right then.

367
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,989
Sure. All right.

368
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,560
This is a rare treat for me.

369
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,260
Thanks to Yeong Rye, I can close up the shop...

370
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,359
and eat a meal I didn't cook for a change.

371
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,430
- Let's go, let's go! - Go get ready.

372
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,200
(Yeonseo University Hospital)

373
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,479
Yes, this is the doctor's office.

374
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,180
Is Dr. Han Jae Pil there, by any chance?

375
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,550
Gosh.

376
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,949
Well, look who it is.

377
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,320
Is this the winner of Miss Seoul I'm speaking to?

378
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,920
Yes, that's right.

379
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,000
This is Koh Yeong Rye, your accidental Miss Seoul.

380
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,400
What do you mean, accidental? You won because you deserved it.

381
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,940
Man, I wish I could congratulate you in person.

382
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,869
The doctor I'm on call with had an emergency,

383
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,070
so I promised to cover for him until he gets back.

384
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,110
I really want to see you, though.

385
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,710
Oh, really?

386
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,180
You miss me that much?

387
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,290
Of course, I miss you.

388
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,890
Once you start the training camp, we won't see each other for a month.

389
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,260
Right.

390
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,160
Well, if you miss me that much,

391
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,000
then you should just see me.

392
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,500
Just count to ten...

393
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,500
and then open the door.

394
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,940
Come on.

395
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,450
Hi, Dr. Han.

396
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,630
Have you been well?

397
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,600
I'll enjoy it.

398
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,310
I've never been in here before.

399
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,880
But am I even allowed to be in here?

400
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,550
Technically, no. But you're with me.

401
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,649
Why? Are you uncomfortable? We can go eat somewhere else.

402
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,850
Oh, no, it's not that.

403
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,690
You're on call, right?

404
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,290
I'll just watch you eat and then head out.

405
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,500
Here, you have some too.

406
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,730
Being Miss Seoul is great and all, but you've gotten so thin.

407
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,240
You're much cuter when you have your chubby cheeks.

408
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,080
I can't. If I eat this,

409
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,880
I'll gain weight, and the director will have my head.

410
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,780
Just have one. One won't hurt.

411
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,520
Here you go.

412
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,230
Good job.

413
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,769
That's it, eat up.

414
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,970
Have some more.

415
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,710
- It's delicious. - It is?

416
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,409
The training camp is three weeks, right?

417
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,610
Yes.

418
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,419
I can't see this adorable hamster face for three weeks...

419
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,350
What on earth am I going to do?

420
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,990
I don't think I can stand it.

421
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,960
Oh, no, what a disaster.

422
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,260
If Han Jae Pil can't see me,

423
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,560
he might just get sick from longing.

424
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,730
Then I'd better get a good look while I can.

425
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,700
Ko Yeong Rye.

426
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,940
Yeong Rye, wait. Didn't we eat all the dumplings?

427
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,340
Oh, I guess I ate them all.

428
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,350
Then why did you bring the container?

429
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,280
Hey, Han Jae Pil.

430
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,550
All right, I get it.

431
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,650
I get it.

432
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,030
Oh, we're here already?

433
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,070
I didn't realise your place was this close to the bus stop.

434
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,330
Tell me about it.

435
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,000
It's way too close.

436
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:04,970
Come on.

437
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,510
I'll walk you back.

438
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,479
No way.

439
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,080
Your training starts tomorrow. You need to go inside and pack.

440
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,410
Don't you get disqualified if you're not there by nine?

441
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,080
No, it's fine. I can get up on time.

442
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,680
Come on, let's go.

443
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,790
- Hey! - Come on, let's go, let's go!

444
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,220
- No, really. - Hurry.

445
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,200
Did we just teleport?

446
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,000
How are we at my place already?

447
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,140
I thought I walked as slowly as I could.

448
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,270
This is crazy.

449
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,879
Okay, that's it. I'm walking you back.

450
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,750
- What? Where are you going? - Let's go.

451
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,679
I can just take a taxi. You have to work tomorrow.

452
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,719
No, it's dangerous to take a taxi by yourself.

453
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,250
Go on. Hurry up. Go, go.

454
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,390
Go on in. For real this time.

455
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,100
It's late. Go and pack your things.

456
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,130
Okay.

457
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,530
You go first.

458
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,069
I'll leave after I see you go in. My place is right over there.

459
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,270
Don't be silly.

460
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,270
I'll watch you go in first.

461
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,140
- Go on, hurry. - Okay.

462
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,980
You don't think...

463
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,280
You won't forget my face after a month apart, will you?

464
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:26,320
Just in case, I should take a good long look.

465
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,590
What was that?

466
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,800
You didn't even give me a warning.

467
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,770
Oh, you're in so much trouble.

468
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,670
Come here.

469
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,310
So?

470
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,910
So how did you and Jae Pil become a thing?

471
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,320
Come on, girl. Stop keeping us in suspense.

472
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,889
So when did you two... You know.

473
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:39,260
Actually get together? Can't you just tell us that?

474
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,430
Just leave her be.

475
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,730
But come on, we go way back.

476
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,140
She'll probably tell us about the wedding invitations.

477
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,509
Or maybe when we get a new niece or nephew?

478
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,210
- Hey, that's enough. Stop it. - Yeah, right. When the baby's born.

479
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,780
Wait a minute, that time...

480
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,380
at the beauty seminar in Dongincheon...

481
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,490
What? The beauty seminar?

482
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,120
My gosh. Then that day...

483
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,120
What did I tell you?

484
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,829
She was acting a little strange the day after Michelle started.

485
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,460
Okay, that's enough. Go now. I have to get this done.

486
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,530
Who made the first move?

487
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,769
Who asked who out?

488
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,470
No way. Don't tell me it was you.

489
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,940
It wasn't really one of us.

490
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,710
It just sort of happened.

491
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,340
What about the kiss?

492
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,350
You kissed?

493
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,980
And not just a little peck like before, right?

494
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,590
We did.

495
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,059
Okay, go now. I need to pack my things.

496
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,459
Where did you do it?

497
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,100
- Hurry up, no more questions. - My goodness.

498
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,530
- Watch it. - Sorry.

499
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,490
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

500
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,800
That's her, right? Miss Seoul.

501
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,169
You made it.

502
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,600
She doesn't exactly stand out.

503
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,140
Not really.

504
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,800
Then again, Miss Seoul is always the favourite to win each year.

505
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,570
But I hear Seoul's runner-up is a real contender this year.

506
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,710
I thought I was going to be late.

507
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,810
I ran the whole way here.

508
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,220
All right, can everyone hear me?

509
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,850
- Yes. - Yes.

510
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,720
For the duration of this training camp,

511
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,090
I will be running the various programs...

512
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,389
and serving as your head supervisor.

513
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,760
My name is Lee Byeong Hoon, and I'm on the executive committee.

514
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,010
First, before we assign the rooms. It will be 2 per 1 room.

515
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,580
I think we should choose a leader to be your representative.

516
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,610
To save time and make things easier,

517
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,079
how about the winner of Miss Seoul...

518
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,320
I'll do it!

519
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,760
I'd really like to be the group representative.

520
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,930
I've always kicked myself for never being class president.

521
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,730
Okay then. Our group leader will be...

522
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,169
Contestant Number Ten, the Miss Seoul runner-up.

523
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,370
Okay, so the runner-up's our leader.

524
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,939
So, if you have any suggestions or other concerns,

525
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,269
you can bring them to Number Ten.

526
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,540
I'll do my best!

527
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,720
Now, for the room assignments.

528
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,250
Shall we draw your numbers and let fate decide?

00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,800
At least there's a bathroom.

537
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,970
Still, it's way bigger than my room.

538
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,010
Which bed do you want?

539
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,570
You pick.

540
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,839
Well, why don't you take the one on the inside?

541
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,080
It's probably noisy by the hall, and you're a light sleeper.

542
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,650
We know way too much about each other.

543
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,320
Okay, I'll take the inside one then.

544
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,330
But isn't it crazy?

545
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,330
Out of all those people,

546
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,630
how did we end up in the same room?

547
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,870
I know, right?

548
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,840
I don't know if we should call this fate,

549
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,510
or is it destiny?

550
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,580
I'm going to go check on the room next door real quick.

551
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,349
Since I'm the group leader, I should get to know everyone.

552
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,020
Okay, go ahead.

553
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,290
I'm going for Miss Congeniality.

554
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,260
I heard that's worth some extra points.

555
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,469
Hey!

556
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,870
Hey, Su Jin!

557
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,910
Sleep well?

558
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,450
What brings you here so early?

559
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,379
I'm so sorry to ask,

560
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,750
but could you possibly watch Su Jin for just an hour or two?

561
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,149
Her preschool is closed today, of all days.

562
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,290
Mom and Ho Suk have their morning deliveries,

563
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,230
and right after, they'll be too busy prepping for a large party.

564
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,860
Okay, okay.

565
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,260
She can hang out with me, so don't worry and get to work.

566
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,670
I'm so sorry.

567
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,899
I'll be sure to make it up to you.

568
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,340
Why are you always talking about repaying me?

569
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,970
It's not like you're keeping a tally.

570
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,510
If you insist, then...

571
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,980
you can buy me dinner sometime.

572
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Dinner?

573
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,550
Dinner.

574
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,730
I can buy you dinner, but...

575
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,700
I'll buy you dinner.

576
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,830
Okay.

577
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,740
Su Jin, be good for him, okay?

578
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,970
Auntie Ho Suk will come get you later.

579
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,080
- Mommy's got to go. - Say bye to your mom.

580
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,110
Bye, Mommy.

581
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,550
- Go on, head to work. - Thank you.

582
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,350
Alright, Su Jin.

583
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,920
We haven't had a date in a while, have we?

584
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,990
So, what should we do?

585
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,160
I want to fly a kite!

586
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,190
Fly a kite? Okay.

587
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,560
Should we go to the store and buy one?

588
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,970
Su Jin.

589
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,710
Gosh.

590
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,340
Hey, Su Jin. You been good?

591
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,980
I missed you so much, I haven't been doing so great.

592
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,979
Hello.

593
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,490
Good girl.

594
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,130
What's she doing with you again?

595
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,460
I was supposed to watch her for a bit.

596
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,830
Jeong Bun went to work,

597
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,769
and Mother and Ho Suk are busy.

598
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,770
Save it.

599
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,010
I'll hang out with her. You can go mind your own business.

600
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,470
Su Jin, let's go.

601
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,980
What do you want, Su Jin?

602
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,280
Dad... I mean, I'll buy you a pretty dress.

603
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,180
Let's go.

604
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,590
Let's see...

605
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,660
These clothes don't do you justice.

606
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,259
Excuse me, do you have any dresses that are more like a princess dress?

607
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,699
You know, the kind little girls like.

608
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,429
With lots of lace and frills, that kind of thing.

609
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,699
Super pink, you know?

610
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,140
We should have something like that.

611
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,340
- Oh, there are more over here? - Right here.

612
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,210
Here, how about this one? Very pink.

613
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,749
It's very pink, but... it's not a very pretty pink.

614
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,120
Don't you have a prettier pink?

615
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,949
There's this one too.

616
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,649
Maybe I should just take her to a department store.

617
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,950
I want to get her an outfit now and then buy her something yummy.

618
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,260
Oh? This one's pretty.

619
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,990
Yeah, this one's nice.

620
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,000
Do you have this in a size up?

621
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,200
- We do. - This is perfect.

622
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,000
Right, Su Jin? This one's pretty, right?

623
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,300
Su Jin?

624
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,770
Su Jin?

625
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,910
Where'd she go? Where did Su Jin go?

626
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,980
Su Jin!

627
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
Su Jin!

628
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,750
Su Jin!

629
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,180
- Su Jin! - Su Jin!

630
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,519
- Su Jin... - Did you find her?

631
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,989
No, she's not where she usually...

632
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,860
She's not over here. I checked all the likely places.

633
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,129
Hey, no one at the market has seen her.

634
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,760
Where on earth could a little girl like her have gone?

635
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,270
Oh, God, my heart is pounding.

636
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,840
What are we going to do?

637
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
Ho Suk.

638
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,979
Jeong Bun, I think we have to...

639
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,580
report her missing at the police station, okay?

640
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,720
Oh, no...

641
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,619
How could this happen?

642
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,119
If you're going to watch a kid, you have to actually watch her!

643
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,229
What were you doing that was so urgent you lost track of her?

644
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,699
I wasn't fooling around.

645
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,499
I was just trying to buy her a dress...

646
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,370
I told you we didn't need anything!

647
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,639
I said we don't need anything, so please, just stay away!

648
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,309
Showing up now, trying to play dad?

649
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,580
Causing all this trouble!

650
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,850
What about Su Jin?

651
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,190
My baby, my baby...

652
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,560
A kite.

653
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,190
A kite, a kite!

654
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,430
Kite.

655
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,130
Su Jin's kite! Her kite!

656
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,160
- Where? - Where?

657
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,430
Where is it!

658
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,280
Su Jin!

659
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,350
Uncle...

660
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,350
Hey, you...

661
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,400
It's okay. I'm here now. It's okay.

662
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,530
You're okay. It's okay, you're okay.

663
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,030
I'm here now, so you're fine.

664
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,770
I'm here now, so you're fine. It's okay.

665
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,310
Su Jin.

666
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,740
Mom!

667
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,210
It's okay. We found her, so it's all right.

668
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,390
Stop crying, both of you. It's okay.

669
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,430
Don't cry. You're okay.

670
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,590
Hey, buddy.

671
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,330
Got a light?

672
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,600
How's it going?

673
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,740
Finding any work these days?

674
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,140
The guys with skills get picked up right away.

675
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,210
The rest of us just have to get lucky.

676
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,180
Looks like another bust today.

677
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,890
It always comes down to skill.

678
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,860
When I land a job,

679
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,760
I'll treat you to a proper meal.

680
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,760
To pay you back for the light.

681
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,570
That said...

682
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,470
You got enough for a drink, buddy?

683
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:13,450
One, two, three, four.

684
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:16,219
One, two, three, four, five, six.

685
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,420
One, two, three, four. Five, six, seven, eight.

686
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,450
One, two.

687
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,920
Stop.

688
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,260
Stop.

689
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,130
Number 11.

690
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,660
Yes?

691
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,400
Have you got no rhythm?

692
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,770
Why do you keep missing the beat?

693
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:35,570
In a group dance,

694
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,540
if one person messes up the moves, it ruins the whole dance. Get it?

695
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,840
From the front, it's painfully obvious.

696
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,280
I'm sorry.

697
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,680
Excuse me.

698
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,710
Just moving side to side seems a little too simple.

699
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,280
- Right. - So instead of side to side,

700
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,250
How about a little spin like this and then end with that?

701
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,360
Okay, like this?

702
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,230
One, two, three.

703
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,300
How's that?

704
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,729
All right, everyone. Get ready.

705
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,800
And... go!

706
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:09,240
One, two, three, four, one, two.

707
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,699
One, two, three, four, one.

708
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,940
Oh, you're all doing great!

709
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:14,870
Good!

710
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,239
Let's take it from the top.

711
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,510
Ready and go!

712
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,050
One, two, three, four.

713
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,220
One, two.

714
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,620
Left, right, left, right.

715
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,860
Again.

716
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,700
One, two, three...

717
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,330
Left, right.

718
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,280
Why can't I get this?

719
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,450
You have two left feet, Koh Yeong Rye.

720
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
What?

721
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,040
Jong Hee...

722
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,620
You can do this, Koh Yeong Rye.

723
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,060
One, two, three, four.

724
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,890
Left, right.

725
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,589
One, two, three, four, left.

726
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,629
Oh, I'm getting it!

727
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,030
One, two, three, four.

728
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,460
Left, two.

729
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,299
I'm doing it! I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

730
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,570
Again, again.

731
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,490
Ho Suk.

732
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,630
Hey, Ho Suk.

733
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,930
When you sit there with your lips sealed like a clam...

734
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,400
It's scary, you know?

735
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,880
I'm sorry.

736
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,550
I...

737
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:36,450
I meant to tell you sooner, but...

738
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,950
I just couldn't bring myself to say it.

739
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:42,960
It's not like you're a stranger.

740
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,560
Like some crazy lady...

741
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:48,630
"Her dad is Mr. Kim, our driver."

742
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,860
I couldn't just say that, could I?

743
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,230
But still!

744
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,100
You should have told me!

745
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,500
After everything we've been through.

746
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,240
How could you hide something so huge from me?

747
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,820
You must have been hurting so much inside.

748
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,890
Your poor heart must have been all black and blue.

749
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,000
How could you...

750
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,230
How could you!

751
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,370
Oh, my gosh.

752
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,310
Ho Suk.

753
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,440
No, no, I'm the one...

754
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,750
I should've realised sooner.

755
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:45,580
I should have helped you...

756
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,160
share that burden.

757
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,220
I...

758
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,430
I'm so sorry for being so clueless.

759
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:58,859
No, don't say you're sorry.

760
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,500
I'm the one who's sorry, okay? It's all my fault.

761
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:07,340
No, no. I'm the slow one. I'm sorry.

762
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,880
Hey, don't say that. I'm the one who's truly sorry.

763
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,050
This is ridiculous.

764
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,220
That was pretty funny.

765
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,820
You said you'd only stay for a few days.

766
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,290
Why haven't you left yet?

767
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:29,360
How many days has it been already?

768
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,030
I'm going to, I am.

769
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,740
I need to find a job and make money, so I can get a motel room.

770
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,639
But there's no work. None at all.

771
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,910
I keep coming up empty-handed.

772
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,580
It's over already? Is there anything else fun on?

773
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:52,120
The 40 finalists of the 1989 Miss Korea Pageant...

774
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,320
have now begun their training camp.

775
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,590
Chosen from regional preliminaries, the contestants...

776
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:01,990
will spend the next three weeks participating in various programs...

777
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:03,230
- and community service. - My sister.

778
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:05,400
There, right there! That's my sister!

779
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,069
That's your sister?

780
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:16,240
Yeah, that's right. My sister.

781
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:19,480
Gosh. She's got some nerve.

782
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,879
I mean, I went to her workplace as soon as I got out of the joint,

783
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,050
but she was gone.

784
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,850
So how did she end up on...

785
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,220
Gosh, this is a real shocker.

786
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,260
Her old workplace...

787
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,859
You mean Cheongah Bus?

788
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,930
Wait a second. How do you know that?

789
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,160
Did you work at Cheongah Bus?

790
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,699
So, you're telling me...

791
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,540
that bus conductor Seo Jong Hee from Cheongah Bus...

792
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,770
is your sister?

793
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,410
I'm telling you, she is.

794
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,610
There's definitely something else going on.

795
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,150
She's got a sponsor. I'm telling you.

796
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,290
If we play this right, we could get something out of it.

797
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,490
Don't you think so?

798
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,730
Okay, can everyone hear me?

799
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,330
- Yes! - Yes!

800
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,370
Normally, you can't leave camp during the training period.

801
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:20,170
But you have all endured a gruelling practice schedule the last few days.

802
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:23,380
And you've outperformed any group before you.

803
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,350
As a result, we've managed to finish everything ahead of schedule.

804
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:29,180
So, with special permission from the chairman,

805
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:33,450
I'm granting you all a half-day leave as a reward.

806
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,330
You must be back by 9pm.

807
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:44,400
Anyone back late will get demerits, so make sure you are on time.

808
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,970
- Yes! - Yes!

809
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,100
Is she here yet? Do you see her?

810
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,200
No.

811
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,710
I don't see her yet.

812
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,810
Is that her now? Do you see her?

813
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,839
No, not a sign of her.

814
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,609
It's just been weeks, but I'm already dying to see her.

815
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,980
She'll be here when it's time.

816
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,320
Stop being so antsy and just wait.

817
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,020
Hello.

818
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,019
She's here, she's here! It's Yeong Rye!

819
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,529
- Yeong Rye! - Hey!

820
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:16,559
- Hey! - We thought you'd never get here.

821
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,900
Oh, honey, how have you been? My gosh, is the food okay? Is it?

822
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,970
They're not feeding you like a bird, are they?

823
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,969
You look like you've lost weight.

824
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:26,540
Being Miss Korea is one thing, but you have to eat well.

825
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,740
I'm okay, Mom. I've been eating and doing fine.

826
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,410
Su Jin, have you been well?

827
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:35,809
- She missed you so much. - Have you been good?

828
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:36,820
Yes.

829
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,759
Gosh, Mom, you made so much food.

830
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,260
I can't afford to gain any weight.

831
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,159
Oh, it's nothing special.

832
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,999
Just some braised ribs and a little stir-fried beef.

833
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,429
And I made your favourite stew and mixed up some glass noodles.

834
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,270
Plus some seasoned veggies and a few savoury pancakes.

835
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:58,700
What did I even make? Nothing, really.

836
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:00,539
You're too much.

837
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,240
Anyway, you have to admit she always goes all out.

838
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,440
- Let's eat! - Yes, let's dig in.

839
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,580
- Looks great! Thanks for the food! - Thank you for the food!

840
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,879
- Yeong Rye, have some noodles. - What?

841
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,020
The way she seasons them is the absolute best.

842
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,820
And this. The braised ribs too.

843
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:20,260
They're perfectly savoury. It makes your mouth dance the samba.

844
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:23,830
Here, you like the bean sprouts.

845
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,530
And some zucchini pancakes.

846
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:27,730
Thanks.

847
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:30,269
Me too! I want to give you some too!

848
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,639
Su Jin, what do you want to give me?

849
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,569
The anchovies!

850
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,670
Gosh, thank you.

851
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,380
Okay, then. I have to try the anchovies from Su Jin first.

852
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,780
It's delicious. So delicious!

853
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,150
Try this too.

854
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,049
By the way, when is Jae Pil supposed to get here?

855
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,319
Yes, I was wondering that too.

856
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,460
Mr. Ma said he's coming right after some seminar or something.

857
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,460
I'm sure he'll be here when he can.

858
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,660
Let's just start eating without him.

859
00:53:58,430 --> 00:53:59,430
This is so good.

860
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:01,370
Goodness.

861
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:04,240
Well, look at our Miss Korea! You're looking gorgeous!

862
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,310
How have you been?

863
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,809
Same old Mr. Ma.

864
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,009
Uncle!

865
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:10,810
Hey there, Su Jin!

866
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,380
Are you enjoying your food?

867
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,950
Come sit over here.

868
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,250
- Any silverware over there? - No, I don't.

869
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,650
All right, cardiopulmonary resuscitation,

870
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,220
or CPR, has two stages. Basic and advanced life support.

871
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,690
So what's the difference between the two?

872
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:30,330
It's the quality of the resuscitation.

873
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:36,030
Advanced life support is provided by medical professionals, like doctors.

874
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,500
That's because it's a professional procedure.

875
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:42,780
Okay, so then, what about advanced life support?

876
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,550
What different types are there?

877
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,780
The fidgety intern over there.

878
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,680
Yes, you.

879
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,420
Go ahead and answer.

880
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,860
Besides chest compressions, there's intubation and epinephrine.

881
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:03,030
Based on the patient's condition, we can use advanced procedures.

882
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,570
I see you were paying attention.

883
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,899
With more emergency patients from things like traffic accidents,

884
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,070
emergency procedures like CPR are more important than ever.

885
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,580
My goodness. We're running late,

886
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,980
but we still need to do the practical exercise.

887
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,679
Okay, come on up. We're short on mannequins,

888
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,120
so let's go in order, starting from the front.

889
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,990
You're here.

890
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,460
- How have you been? How's your mom? - Fine.

891
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,130
She just called, actually.

892
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,760
She was out of town and just got back to the office.

893
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:40,530
She's signing urgent papers. She said to get dinner ready.

894
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,030
Are you hungry?

895
00:55:42,031 --> 00:55:43,870
No, I'm okay. Go ahead.

896
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,400
Can I have the flowers?

897
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,410
I'll give them to her myself.

898
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,350
Let's reschedule the board meeting.

899
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,720
I think we'll need some more time to review everything.

900
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,019
Understood.

901
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,629
Well, my daughter is waiting for me.

902
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,830
Yes, of course.

903
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,099
Madam Chairman, a man claiming to be her brother...

904
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,910
is in the lobby asking to see you.

905
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,740
I see. Send him up.

906
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,150
See?

907
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,590
I told you playing that brother card would work.

908
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,929
I opened the door for you, just like I promised.

909
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,290
The rest is on you.

910
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,330
I'm not good with big shots like chairmen.

911
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:46,600
I tend to get intimidated by guys like that.

912
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,600
Just keep your promise to split it 50-50, got it?

913
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:52,940
Don't you worry.

914
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,940
You just make sure you keep your end of the deal.

915
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,450
Here.

916
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:06,080
This is proof that I'm Seo Jong Hee's brother.

917
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,090
And this is the insurance policy our parents took out.

918
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,700
After our parents passed away,

919
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,130
that wench collected the entire insurance payout.

920
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,770
That's the kind of woman she is.

921
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,940
I wonder if you knew that when you adopted her.

922
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:35,710
You think I would've adopted her without doing a background check?

923
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,120
What?

924
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,919
Stealing the insurance payout...

925
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,050
and gambling it all away? I heard that was her brother.

926
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,020
You're even more of a lowlife than I expected.

927
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:50,600
Do you think I can be threatened by Jong Hee's background?

928
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,070
Then what if...

929
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:59,040
What if Seo Jong Hee was a criminal who attempted murder?

930
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,850
Would that be enough to threaten you with?

931
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,420
She stabbed me with a fountain pen.

932
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,220
Seven years ago, at the Cheongah Bus office.

933
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:21,160
I lost all use of my shoulder and now have a permanent disability.

934
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,900
If I leak this to the press,

935
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,310
it would certainly complicate her shot at Miss Korea, wouldn't it?

936
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:05,370
Even if that's true, I don't negotiate.

937
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:08,070
I know how people like you operate.

938
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:11,240
One time becomes two, and your demands become endless.

939
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,110
If you want to go public, go ahead.

940
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,320
I'll handle it my way.

941
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,180
Then I believe we're done here.

942
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:20,920
Get home safe.

943
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,479
They said she already left the office.

944
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,820
I wonder what's keeping her.

945
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,090
You should eat something. You must be starving.

946
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,690
I'll reheat the steak.

947
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,160
No, that's okay.

948
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,730
I don't think I'll have time to eat.

949
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,070
Hey, just a second.

950
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:10,740
Hold on.

951
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:12,770
Hey!

952
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:15,970
No way.

953
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,540
Is it true? That Jong Yeon... No.

954
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:20,780
That Jong Hee stabbed you?

955
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:23,010
You never told me that.

956
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,080
There was only one reason I decided to work with you.

957
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,320
I thought it would make it easier to get to her.

958
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,190
But...

959
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,890
Now that it's turned out this way, let's just go our separate ways.

960
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,290
Because I'm not giving up, no matter what.

961
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,370
What on earth was she thinking? Honestly, that girl...

962
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:51,010
This just makes things more complicated for me.

963
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,050
Hello, is this the Hyeonseong Daily News?

964
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:34,150
This is about one of the Miss Korea contestants.

965
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,590
I have a tip for you.

966
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:49,970
Yeong Rye!

967
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,580
Yeong Rye!

968
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,250
Koh Yeong Rye!

969
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,120
Han Jae Pil?

970
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,450
The umbrella! Get under!

971
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:10,190
Jae Pil.

972
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:11,990
I'm so sorry.

973
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:14,130
My seminar ran super late.

974
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,930
I called your house,

975
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:18,500
and they said you'd already left, so I tried to grab a cab, but...

976
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,140
I've missed you so much.

977
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:33,280
I've missed you so much, Koh Yeong Rye.

978
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,480
Me too.

979
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,850
I've missed you so much too, Han Jae Pil.

980
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,790
You should have used this umbrella. Why did you come out in the rain?

981
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,530
I was just in a hurry to see you.

982
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:59,700
You've gotten even more handsome since I saw you last, Mr. Han.

983
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,839
I doubt that.

984
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,340
I've been losing sleep thinking about a certain someone.

985
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,880
Here.

986
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:08,510
What's this?

987
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,020
This is delicious.

988
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:15,120
- Is it good? - Yes.

989
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,720
And I already ate a huge meal before I came.

990
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,460
But I still have room for this.

991
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:24,600
I came out on leave, and I'll go back looking like a pig.

992
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,530
A pig is fine.

993
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,970
A hamster is fine. You don't have to win Miss Korea.

994
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,040
All I need is you.

995
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,410
Hey, Han Jae Pil.

996
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,180
You've gotten a little cheesy while I was away, haven't you?

997
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:44,520
What, did you take a class on how to sweet-talk someone?

998
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,690
Hey, stop it.

999
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,150
- Stop it. - Okay, now your left...

1000
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,890
- Hey! - All right, all right.

1001
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:55,790
Want some?

1002
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:57,229
Yes, I do.

1003
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:59,230
Watching you eat is making me hungry.

1004
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:00,970
Okay, say "Ah."

1005
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,920
Mom.

1006
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,350
Did you come straight here?

1007
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,760
I was waiting for you at the house...

1008
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,059
Your brother and a man...

1009
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,430
who said he was the labour manager for the bus company came by.

1010
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:36,070
He said you nearly killed a man.

1011
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:39,499
He threatened to go to the press about the attempted murder.

1012
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,609
Why do I have to endure threats from scum like that?

1013
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:45,140
Just how low have you sunk?

1014
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:00,890
I'll take care of this and keep it quiet.

1015
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:05,960
In return, you make sure you win the crown, no matter what.

1016
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:09,430
That's the only way this humiliation I've suffered will be worth it.

1017
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,080
Jong Hee.

1018
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,560
- Jong Hee. - Let go of me.

1019
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:19,340
What happened?

1020
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,140
What on earth is going on?

1021
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,840
What could possibly have happened...

1022
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,910
that would make your own mother come all this way to hit you?

1023
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:35,590
This...

1024
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,220
This isn't the first time, is it?

1025
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:47,730
She's sweet to you when she feels like it,

1026
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,200
but she gets angry and hits you when she's upset?

1027
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,470
Is that how you've lived as their daughter?

1028
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:55,740
Is it?

1029
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:03,280
Why do you live like that?

1030
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:06,820
Why?

1031
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,320
I don't care if you're from a wealthy family.

1032
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:13,730
This isn't happiness, is it?

1033
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:19,759
Why do you put up with all that just to be their daughter?

1034
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,230
That's not like you.

1035
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,670
Why do I live like this?

1036
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,010
You really don't know?

1037
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,380
It's because of you.

1038
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:45,860
I was so happy at Cheongah Bus.

1039
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,600
Going to your place on my days off,

1040
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,570
secretly making ramyeon with Jeong Bun and Ho Suk...

1041
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:59,239
That was the first time in my life I'd ever felt true happiness.

1042
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,870
So why do you think I left?

1043
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,470
Why did I...

1044
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,580
Why did I say things I didn't even mean...

1045
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,819
and tell Jae Pil we should break up?

1046
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:12,880
Why would I do that?

1047
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,160
What are you talking about?

1048
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,730
You broke up with Jae Pil...

1049
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:29,970
because of me?

1050
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,140
I knew it the whole time.

1051
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,110
That you had a crush on Jae Pil.

1052
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:46,850
I knew it all back then.

1053
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,860
Jong Hee...

1054
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:56,190
But I shouldn't have done that.

1055
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,900
I shouldn't have broken up with him, pretending not to know about it.

1056
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:04,570
You...

1057
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:09,970
You have a family that truly cherishes you,

1058
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,180
and you have Jeong Bun and Ho Suk. But I...

1059
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,320
I...

1060
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,290
What do I have to be so proud of?

1061
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,790
I don't have anything.

1062
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:38,540
I have absolutely nothing.

1063
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:08,929
No way.

1064
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:11,370
Can you believe how fast time flies? My goodness.

1065
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,639
It feels like...

1066
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,710
just the other day Yeong Rye left for the training camp,

1067
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,140
and now the competition's here.

1068
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:18,339
I heard they're taping the pre-show today.

1069
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,780
Fast? What are you talking about?

1070
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,220
For a guy like Jae Pil, I bet 3 weeks felt like 3 years.

1071
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:28,020
You're right. He was so obviously moping around, wasn't he?

1072
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,089
I guess he cares more about Yeong Rye than me now.

1073
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:32,490
Of course. You care about Yeong Bae more than me.

1074
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,489
But if this keeps up,

1075
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:38,900
won't our family tree be complicated?

1076
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:40,700
If we become double in-laws or something...

1077
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,630
There you go again, getting ahead of yourself.

1078
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:45,469
They're just middle schoolers. What do you mean, double in-laws?

1079
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:48,570
Hey, you never know what the future holds.

1080
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,040
Right?

1081
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:52,480
I'm all for it. What's wrong with double in-laws?

1082
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:58,420
Anyway, can you imagine how nervous Yeong Rye must be?

1083
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,550
My heart is pounding like crazy just thinking about it.

1084
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,990
(Miss Korea Pageant Pre-show)

1085
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,560
Look forward.

1086
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,200
And get that smile on your face now.

1087
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,170
Confidence comes from your posture,

1088
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:54,510
and poise comes from your smile.

1089
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:57,780
Shoulders back, core tight.

1090
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,240
That's it.

1091
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:04,150
Of all days, why won't my makeup go on right?

1092
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,880
This is driving me crazy.

1093
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,190
Gosh, her dark circles...

1094
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,460
She has them.

1095
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:13,660
Jong Hee, did you not get any sleep last night?

1096
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:16,690
Yes, not much.

1097
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,360
Concealer. Quick, bring the concealer!

1098
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,070
Hurry!

1099
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,440
All right, everyone, may I have your attention, please?

1100
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,909
The president of the firm sponsoring our Miss Korea pageant...

1101
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:33,610
is here to give you a few words of encouragement.

1102
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,650
Please, everyone, rise and greet him.

1103
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:37,380
Right this way, sir.

1104
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,720
Hello, everyone.

1105
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:48,060
I'm Jeong Hyeon, CEO of Hwashin Apparel.

1106
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:57,940
Wait, what are you doing here?

1107
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,740
How are you the sponsor's CEO?

1108
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,669
It just worked out that way.

1109
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:04,910
It's not like I planned it.

1110
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:07,110
It was something my father always did.

1111
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,980
But when I took over apparel, it fell to me.

1112
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,920
I did turn down being a judge, though.

1113
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:15,320
I wasn't sure I could be objective.

1114
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:18,020
That's a shame.

1115
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:21,929
If you were a judge, I would've had it in the bag.

1116
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:22,930
Oh, really?

1117
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:24,900
Well, should I go tell them I'll do it then?

1118
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:26,760
No, no. It's okay.

1119
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:31,840
I was already nervous enough,

1120
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,140
but I'm just glad to see you.

1121
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:37,110
- It's a real confidence boost. - I'm glad.

1122
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:43,250
Yeong Rye, do you know why they called him Daddy-Long-Legs?

1123
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:46,620
Gosh, I don't really remember...

1124
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:50,050
Because all she ever saw was his long shadow walking away.

1125
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:56,690
Even though I'm not a judge...

1126
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:59,959
I'll always be right behind you, watching over you like a shadow.

1127
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,870
Don't you forget it. Do your best, okay?

1128
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:08,610
Actually...

1129
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:12,540
I was hoping I'd get to see you.

1130
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,449
What you said to me last time...

1131
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:17,450
It's okay.

1132
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,220
I know.

1133
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:32,560
Right now, let's just focus on the pageant.

1134
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,170
Come here. Let me give you a hug for good luck.

1135
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:48,650
Do great out there, my Ugly.

1136
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:57,150

1137

(The 33rd Miss Korea Pre-show)

1140
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,300
And with that...

1141
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:19,899
The 1989 Miss Korea Pre-show,

1142
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,170
a night of excitement and anticipation...

1143
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,409
has now come to an end.

1144
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:27,410
To the audience who stayed to the end, thank you so much.

1145
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:29,479
Following tonight's event,

1146
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,379
we hope you'll join us for the final Miss Korea competition tomorrow.

1147
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,250
We look forward to your continued support.

1148
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:35,920
Good night, everyone.
