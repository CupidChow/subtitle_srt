00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:39,471
That thing's so sharp, the actress might cut herself on it.

184
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:40,811
She's going to get cut.

185
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:49,181
- Come on. That was the best part.
- Seriously.

186
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,950
Just sitting there with that dopey look on your face.

187
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:54,390
Don't tell me you're actually jealous.

188
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:57,120
Do you think I pay the electric bill so you can watch your soap operas?

189
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:58,291
Oh, my.

190
00:12:58,521 --> 00:13:00,690
That look in your eyes just now.

191
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:02,630
It was the exact same look you had back then.

192
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:05,700
You know, when you saved me from that rude client.

193
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,300
That gooey, love-struck look.

194
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:10,700
Is that any way to talk to your husband?

195
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:12,671
Goodness gracious.

196
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:13,911
Water.

197
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:16,311
All right, fine.

198
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:21,751
He used to be such a romantic.

199
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,680
Where did that Han Gi Bok go?

200
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:28,391
And who's this gray-haired man standing over there?

201
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:32,721
I miss that guy.

202
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:35,861
Ice.

203
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:38,531
Seriously. Could you not have asked at once?

204
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:00,321
I'm home.

205
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:02,291
- Jae Pil!
- You're back.

206
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:07,591
Wait. Stop!

207
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,410
For a kid who was supposedly studying,

208
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:22,941
Your hair's soaking wet.

209
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:28,550
I ran home for some exercise.

210
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:30,651
Why would you run? You're a high school senior.

211
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:34,150
You should be studying every waking moment.

212
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:36,720
Especially since you already took a whole year off.

213
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:38,321
You're already so far behind.

214
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:40,431
It's not like you're dense or something.

215
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:43,030
You have an IQ of 140.

216
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:44,431
Why can't you bring your grades up?

217
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:50,801
And what's this?

218
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:59,141
Are you going to start inspecting my underwear too now?

219
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:08,721
Go upstairs and wash up.

220
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,270
Should I take a shower too?

221
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:23,631
After we put Se Ri to bed early?

222
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:35,151
Jae Pil!

223
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:38,651
You startled me.

224
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:40,621
Se Ri.

225
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:42,791
My little Magic Princess.

226
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,720
I'm not the Magic Princess.

227
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:47,861
The Magic Princess is Minky.

228
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:50,061
In my day, it was Se Ri.

229
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:52,161
What is it?

230
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,870
Do you want me to cut out more paper dolls?

231
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:59,670
Yes. Mom says she can't look away in case a kissing scene is on.

232
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:02,041
What does a kid like you know about kissing?

233
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:04,210
Come here. There.

234
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:05,281
Here we go.

235
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:11,820
All right. I'll do my best not to cut the tail off...

236
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:13,520
like I did last time.

237
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:15,191
- Okay.
- Okay.

238
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:32,971
I got you.

239
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,981
Go toward the light. May you be reborn a human next time.

240
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:42,180
Gosh. That scared the daylights out of me.

241
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:43,211
Oh, my.

242
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:51,461
Goodness. She is not ordinary, that one.

243
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,760
Here. Have some water with that.

244
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:55,390
You'll get sores in your mouth if you keep eating like that.

245
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,091
Is that your fourth one already?

246
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:06,240
Anyway, our Ms. Koh here. She's a real piece of work?

247
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:09,310
A bus conductor who's constantly motion sick.

248
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:12,540
Always motion sick, but with a monster appetite.

249
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,750
She eats like a pig, but is still skinny as a rail.

250
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:20,050
And with that slender body, she smacks cockroaches dead easily.

251
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:22,021
I couldn't even eat lunch because of my motion sickness.

252
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:24,791
So I have to eat whenever I can.

253
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:27,160
Yeong Rye. You should try wearing sunglasses.

254
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:30,601
Hong Ja from next door says it helps a bit with the carsickness.

255
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:34,131
But she gets motion sickness when it rains, too.

256
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:38,501
I thought I took my glasses off...

257
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:41,471
What is wrong with me?

258
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:50,681
Hey. Is it that hilarious?

259
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:54,090
You really have a strange sense of humor.

260
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:56,151
This one's not ordinary, either.

261
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:58,520
Hey. You brats!

262
00:17:58,521 --> 00:17:59,691
Will you shut your mouths?

263
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:03,590
Today, I'm feeling...

264
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:05,200
really down and sensitive, okay?

265
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:08,431
She's on a diet right now, so she's feeling a little sensitive.

266
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,800
I was just trying to get some sleep.

267
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:14,040
And suddenly, I smell sweet bread from you stuffing your face.

268
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,270
And the other is chattering away.

269
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:18,110
Can't you all just be quiet...

270
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:20,511
and act a little more sophmored?

271
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:21,711
Hae Ja.

272
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:23,851
I think you mean "sophisticated," not "sophmored."

273
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,391
The Three Corns.

274
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,991
Front and center.

275
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:34,831
Front and center!

276
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,470
It's showtime. Song and dance.

277
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:46,271
And you're not done until I'm in a good mood.

278
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,811
If I don't like it, we're skipping to the next track.

279
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,641
"Singing and Dancing." Start.

280
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:57,211
Don't you know what start means? It means you can begin.

281
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:02,150
- All our beloved friends - All our beloved friends

282
00:19:02,151 --> 00:19:03,690
- Let us all gather around - Let us all gather around

283
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:05,361
All right, stop!

284
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:09,761
"Friends Forever."

285
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:16,370
- Like the wings of a dove - Like the wings of a dove

286
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:17,640
- That circle the blue sky - That circle the blue sky

287
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:21,110
Corns, I can't hear you. Raise your volume!

288
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:23,810
- Our hearts take to flight - Our hearts take to flight

289
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:27,111
- And soar right through the sky - And soar right through the sky

290
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:31,721
- We all share a laugh and a smile - We all share a laugh and a smile

291
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:34,251
- Living for the dream - Living for the dream

292
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:39,161
- Of a brand new tomorrow - Of a brand new tomorrow

293
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:42,891
- Oh, friends forever - Oh, friends forever

294
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,601
- Oh, hearts full of bliss - Oh, hearts full of bliss

295
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:49,931
- Oh, what a...
- Oh, what a joyful life

296
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:52,371
Yes.

297
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,081
Come in.

298
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:06,151
All right. Listen up.

299
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:09,050
This is the new hire who just came in today.

300
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:10,151
Seo Jong Hee.

301
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:12,791
She says it's her first time as a conductor,

302
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:15,831
so teach her well.

303
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:19,761
Try not to learn any bad habits.

304
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:23,871
Now, get to sleep!

305
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:31,211
What's your name again?

306
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:33,511
Seo Jong Hee.

307
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:36,281
Well, aren't we informal?

308
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:39,620
You look a good 4 or 5 years younger than me.

309
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:40,820
How old are you?

310
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:43,190
I'm 23.

311
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:44,391
What are you going to do about it?

312
00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:48,031
We're the same, then.

313
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,931
- The same?
- Yes.

314
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:55,931
What does age matter? Time served is what counts.

315
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:00,201
A new hire, smacking her gum right in a senior's face.

316
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,541
The nerve on this one.

317
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:04,481
Quite the spectacle for her first day.

318
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:07,181
You mean a debacle, not a spectacle.

319
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:10,781
Spectacle is for when the view is spectacular.

320
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:13,050
Hey. Are you crazy?

321
00:21:13,051 --> 00:21:14,721
Who does a new hire think she is, talking to my...

322
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,321
What was after Seo?

323
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,431
- Jong Hee.
- Fine.

324
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:25,200
Jong Hee. Ding Dong. Whatever.

325
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,231
You're really smart, aren't you?

326
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:29,800
So smart...

327
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:33,470
you've got more guts than brains.

328
00:21:33,471 --> 00:21:34,541
Right?

329
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:37,481
You.

330
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,741
Do you have any idea who I am in this room?

331
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:50,221
(Room 3)

332
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:36,971
"By the time."

333
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:39,701
"By the time."

334
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:42,471
"Keep it."

335
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:09,331
"English Grammar..."

336
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:14,511
(English Grammar)

337
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:20,441
That's a good one.

338
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:22,681
But you really should sleep when everyone else is.

339
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:26,481
Excuse me.

340
00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:33,160
Are you really the same age as Hae Ja?

341
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,731
What? Of course not. That was a lie.

342
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:40,361
So what are you? Year of Tiger?

343
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:43,200
Or are you Year of Rabbit?

344
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:44,401
I'm...

345
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:46,771
Year of Rabbit.

346
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:50,841
Stop staring.

347
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:54,381
So, we really are the same age.

348
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,951
Gosh. That was quite the performance earlier.

349
00:24:10,961 --> 00:24:14,471
(Cheongah Bus)

350
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:45,731
Gosh. Is it morning already?

351
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:56,711
You should get up.

352
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:02,711
Wake up.

353
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:16,031
(Cheongah Bus)

354
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:18,661
Start.

355
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:22,131
One, two, three, four,

356
00:25:22,431 --> 00:25:25,171
five, six, seven, eight.

357
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:28,111
Two, two, three, four,

358
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,381
five, six, seven, eight.

359
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:34,341
One, two, three, four,

360
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:37,211
five, six, seven, eight.

361
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,320
Two, two, three, four,

362
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:43,120
five, six, seven. One more time.

363
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:45,821
One, two, three, four,

364
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:47,620
- Five, six...
- That wench...

365
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:49,091
is not your average girl, is she?

366
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:52,631
Yes, she looks like she's been around.

367
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:54,161
She's no ordinary girl, that one.

368
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:58,571
And I bet that wench lied about her age, too.

369
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:01,441
I'll have to put her in her place right from the start.

370
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:04,441
Darn it.

371
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:08,281
Good morning, sir.

372
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:10,581
- Jae Pil. Do you want a ride?
- Hello.

373
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:13,080
Just pretend you didn't see me, sir.

374
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:14,081
I'm off.

375
00:26:18,061 --> 00:26:19,860
(Cheongah Bus)

376
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:21,330
Bus number three.

377
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,030
Bus three conductor. Where are you? Hurry up and get going.

378
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:25,461
You're two minutes late already!

379
00:26:59,331 --> 00:27:01,030
Here you are. Koh Yeong Rye.

380
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:02,330
Hey. Get over here.

381
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:03,900
You've got a trainee today.

382
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:04,901
What?

383
00:27:05,301 --> 00:27:07,370
Hae Ja would be better...

384
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:10,370
Enough. She's the most honest person at this company,

385
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:11,741
and our best worker.

386
00:27:12,141 --> 00:27:13,811
I'm counting on you. I'll leave you two.

387
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:19,721
Please show me the ropes.

388
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:23,591
"The most honest and best worker here."

389
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:27,361
Please. "The best?" Hardly.

390
00:27:28,361 --> 00:27:30,261
As if I have anything to teach.

391
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:33,861
(Maintain street order.)

392
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:40,401
Watch your step on the way out.

393
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:44,070
No matter how many passengers are getting off,

394
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:46,380
you must collect the fare from all as they exit.

395
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:49,450
Because in a crowd, you lose track of who's paid and who hasn't.

396
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:51,850
And for passengers paying with cash, the trick is making change.

397
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:53,680
You have to be fast and accurate, no matter what.

398
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:55,550
With practice, you can just stick your hand in your pocket,

399
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:57,791
and you'll be able to feel if it's a cent or a dime.

400
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:02,291
You've got some skills.

401
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:04,961
You should use that talent for good. Now, how about a real ticket?

402
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:06,731
Darn it.

403
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:12,040
Gosh. It looked so real. How did you know right away?

404
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:15,270
The paper feels different, but the giveaway is their eyes.

405
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:18,080
People using fakes always have shifty eyes.

406
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:20,211
Impressive.

407
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:23,451
Please board!

408
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:25,151
Let's go.

409
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:28,091
Driver. All clear!

410
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:47,771
One at a time, please. Watch your step.

411
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:53,481
- Pay in the back!
- In the back.

412
00:28:55,311 --> 00:28:56,351
Hold on.

413
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,250
Why just one fare? You must pay for your friends too.

414
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:00,251
My friends?

415
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:02,821
What are you talking about? I got on alone.

416
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:11,831
Yeong Rye.

417
00:29:11,832 --> 00:29:13,831
- Yeong Rye. Where are you going?
- What's happening?

418
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:16,331
Goodness. There she goes again.

419
00:29:16,431 --> 00:29:17,831
Unbelievable.

420
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:37,921
Three tokens.

421
00:29:39,021 --> 00:29:40,691
Pay up. Now.

422
00:29:41,331 --> 00:29:42,861
If I were going to pay, do you think I would've run?

423
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:48,731
My mom always said...

424
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:51,231
"Even a flea has its pride."

425
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:54,741
"You can live with nothing, but you can't live with no shame."

426
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:57,070
Wait!

427
00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:58,081
Wait.

428
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:01,651
Can we maybe go the other way?

429
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:04,550
I get really bad motion sickness.

430
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:05,651
What are you talking about?

431
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:10,520
No way. You're not going anywhere until you pay up.

432
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:12,091
I said, pay the fare!

433
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,531
Three tokens. Now.

434
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:17,190
Get out of my way. Okay?

435
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,501
Get out of the way!

436
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,410
This is your last warning.

437
00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:32,411
Move.

438
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:35,380
One, two,

439
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:36,381
three!

440
00:30:47,461 --> 00:30:48,831
You should've just paid up.

441
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:51,430
This is going to cost you more in doctor's bills.

442
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:52,531
What are you...

443
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:57,971
Wait!

444
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:00,901
Where is it?

445
00:31:20,121 --> 00:31:21,121
Thank...

446
00:31:28,401 --> 00:31:29,401
Are you okay?

447
00:31:34,941 --> 00:31:35,941
Yes.

448
00:32:54,751 --> 00:32:58,521
(Giant, 10th Anniversary, May 21, 1982)

449
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:00,661
Hey! Assume the position!

450
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:03,360
Hey! You want to go?

451
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:04,361
Get down!

452
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,171
I told you all to be on time!

453
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:10,971
Next.

454
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:16,141
Who's this? You're late again? That's two extra for you.

455
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:25,351
Goodness. I nearly jumped out of my skin.

456
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:28,081
I thought the dean was here.

457
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:31,991
Well, the PTA president's son sneaking in.

458
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,731
Hey.

459
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:38,561
I hear they call you "Prince Charming."

460
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:40,901
- Must be nice?
- Hey.

461
00:33:41,431 --> 00:33:42,901
"Prince Charming," is it?

462
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:44,800
He was held back a year because he was sick.

463
00:33:44,801 --> 00:33:47,541
So you should be calling him "Your Highness," you punk.

464
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:50,241
Your Highness.

465
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:51,510
What's it going to be?

466
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:52,811
Care for a smoke, Your Highness?

467
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:54,241
Knock yourself out.

468
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:02,991
Quiet!

469
00:34:04,121 --> 00:34:05,321
Sit down.

470
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,061
All right. There are no special announcements.

471
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:13,731
Who's the empty seat?

472
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:18,131
Han Jae Pil, sir. He had to use the bathroom.

473
00:34:19,241 --> 00:34:20,641
Oh, Jae Pil.

474
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:23,310
And air this place out during your break.

475
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,240
The female teachers are coming to me in tears.

476
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:27,140
They say the smell is so bad they can't teach. Okay?

477
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:28,681
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

478
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:30,111
That's all.

479
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,630
What is it? Did you oversleep, Jinxed Jae Pil?

480
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:45,130
Get off. It's too hot for all that.

481
00:34:45,131 --> 00:34:47,001
I don't want to. I'm going to stick to you like glue.

482
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:50,671
I think I'm seriously touch-starved.

483
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:53,200
My parents were so busy with work that they didn't hold me much...

484
00:34:53,201 --> 00:34:54,201
as a baby.

485
00:34:55,271 --> 00:34:56,271
Let's see.

486
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,541
Gosh. Spicy stir-fried octopus!

487
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:02,180
Doesn't your stepmom realize that you can't handle spicy food at all?

488
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:03,480
"Can't handle it?" What are you talking about?

489
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:05,020
I can handle my spice just fine now, okay?

490
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:07,680
Please. You rinse your kimchi. Who are you kidding?

491
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:10,151
That was in middle school. Give me that.

492
00:35:21,131 --> 00:35:22,930
You're so cute.

493
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:24,631
It's cute. You and your pride.

494
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:27,201
You're coming to the match tomorrow, right?

495
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:29,041
Of course, I am.

496
00:35:29,511 --> 00:35:31,341
Seventh period is gym, so let's go out then.

497
00:35:45,821 --> 00:35:47,291
(Giant, 10th Anniversary, May 21, 1982)

498
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:57,470
Yeong Rye.

499
00:35:57,471 --> 00:35:59,440
Why are you ironing the towels we use to clean our hands and feet?

500
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:01,000
All that fuss over nothing.

501
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:02,911
I was just bored.

502
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:04,911
Just leave that be.

503
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:07,210
Why don't you try and mend the ripped ones instead?

504
00:36:07,211 --> 00:36:08,481
I just can't seem to get it right.

505
00:36:10,011 --> 00:36:12,021
But you're a certified seamstress, aren't you?

506
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:13,650
Gosh.

507
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:14,981
Goodness.

508
00:36:15,191 --> 00:36:17,251
You just can't sit still, can you? It's like a sickness.

509
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:19,060
You're not going to work in a factory,

510
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:20,291
so why bother with the certificate?

511
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,961
You never know.

512
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,001
You're a professional.

Hey. Popcorn Rookie.

514
00:36:32,071 --> 00:36:33,301
Get over here and rub my back.

Hey. Do it right, will you?

516
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:51,721
Level two.

517
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:54,461
Okay. Level three.

Hey. Newcomer.

522
00:37:14,141 --> 00:37:15,151
Newcomer.

523
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:18,881
- Me?
- Yes, you.

I'm only saying this once, so listen up.

00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:26,390
Go to Ddoddo Snack Bar at the intersection,

527
00:37:26,391 --> 00:37:28,960
Get 10 jumbo dumplings, 2 bags of tteokbokki without green onions,

528
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:29,961
Three servings of sundae without the lung,

529

but with the heart and liver.

530
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:33,060
And five fish cake rods, not the folded ones,

531
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:34,100
with lots of broth.

532
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:35,570
Then, at Hwajung Supermarket next door,

533
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:37,430
get 5 packs of crackers and 4 rainbow candies,

534
00:37:37,431 --> 00:37:39,970
4 almond chocolate bars, and 2 1-liter cartons of milk.

535
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:40,971
Did you get that?

536
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:44,871
Go on. Hurry up.

537
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:53,121
Can you repeat that?

538
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:54,981
What was that?

539
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:56,851
I'm pretty sure I said I was only saying it once.

00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:04,431
Be back by 10pm. Any later and you're locked out.

542
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:09,201
Aren't you going?

543
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,901
You only have 29 minutes left.

544
00:38:20,981 --> 00:38:24,280
Ten jumbo dumplings. Two bags of tteokbokki, no green onions,

545
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:26,750
And for the sundae...

546
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:29,220
Did she say no heart? Just a moment.

547
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:32,590
No lung and add liver and heart. Three servings.

548
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:35,230
And five fish cake rods, not the folded ones,

549
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,660
And extra broth, please.

550
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:37,661
Hey.

551
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:40,100
Can you please ring this up first? Quickly.

552
00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:43,201
Just a minute. I need to finish this other bill first.

553
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:49,271
Twenty jumbo dumplings, 35 cents.

554
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:53,081
Three plates of tteokbokki...

555
00:38:53,181 --> 00:38:55,011
are 27 cents.

556
00:38:55,611 --> 00:38:59,121
Sundae is 15 cents.

557
00:38:59,221 --> 00:39:01,350
The fish cakes...

558
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:04,451
are 24 cents.

559
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:09,361
The fritters are 22 cents.

560
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:13,631
And then the kimbap. One, two, three rolls...

561
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:16,600
I need to start over from the beginning.

562
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:19,141
No, it's okay. Give it here. I'll do it.

563
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:24,470
That's 35 plus 27 plus 15...

564
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:27,280
plus 24, plus 22, and 30.

565
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,051
So that's a total of 1.53 dollars.

566
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:30,950
Oh, my. You're incredibly fast.

567
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,021
They sure ate a lot.

568
00:39:36,091 --> 00:39:37,521
You've got a lot of tricks up your sleeve?

569
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:39,661
And when did you learn to use an abacus?

570
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:43,561
Well, I figured you never know, so I got my abacus certification.

571
00:39:44,891 --> 00:39:46,701
But listen, you need to be careful.

572
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:50,171
If you get on Hae Ja's bad side, life in this dorm will be tough.

573
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:53,441
In our room, what she says goes.

574
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:54,941
Why?

575
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:57,871
Well, for one, she's the oldest.

576
00:39:58,341 --> 00:39:59,641
And she has been here the longest.

577
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:01,681
- And her personality...
- Is a total wench, right?

578
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:03,781
That's what it seems like.

579
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:05,581
I don't like her either.

580
00:40:07,221 --> 00:40:09,451
- Oh, right. Hey.
- Yes?

581
00:40:10,351 --> 00:40:12,561
Do you think you can carry all this back?

582
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:14,760
Sure. Where are you off to?

583
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:15,761
Well...

584
00:40:15,961 --> 00:40:18,661
Since I'm already out, I figured I'd go see my mom.

585
00:40:19,431 --> 00:40:21,730
You need to get back fast, okay? All right?

586
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:24,171
Hurry. Go on. Okay?

587
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:25,671
Hurry up!

588
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:33,481
Mom.

589
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:36,881
- Mom.
- What?

590
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:42,191
Hey. Why are you running?

591
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:45,321
You said running made your head spin and that you'll throw up.

592
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:47,121
What are you doing here?

593
00:40:47,521 --> 00:40:50,561
I was in the neighborhood and figured you might still be here.

594
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:53,630
Are you about to pack up?

595
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:54,631
Yes.

596
00:40:55,701 --> 00:40:57,371
Goodness gracious.

597
00:40:57,571 --> 00:40:59,541
I even had a customer for the horse ride today.

598
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:02,511
"This horse is so old. The spring isn't sturdy enough."

599
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:05,841
Unbelievably picky. They were a real pain.

600
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:08,980
At least a few people showed up later in the evening.

601
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:10,581
And I sold about a dozen lucky draws.

602
00:41:11,651 --> 00:41:12,751
Anyway...

603
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:15,821
The best sight is a customer's back as they're leaving.

604
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:18,250
All right. You two, hop down.

605
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:19,461
- Okay.
- Come over here.

606
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,821
- Come on.
- Come on, Yeong Mi.

607
00:41:22,531 --> 00:41:23,591
Let's go.

608
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:26,361
Good job, my little helpers.

609
00:41:28,261 --> 00:41:29,271
Here.

610
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:33,471
Here, you have one too.

611
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:35,611
Get a sugar boost before you head out or whatever.

612
00:41:39,511 --> 00:41:40,581
It's sweet.

613
00:41:47,681 --> 00:41:49,051
You've got some sleep in your eye, Yeong Mi.

614
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:01,261
Looks like nothing's missing.

615
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:04,831
Didn't I ask you to buy those egg cookies?

616
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:06,671
No, you didn't.

617
00:42:06,871 --> 00:42:08,711
I'm sure I would've remembered that.

618
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:15,911
Aren't you guys going to set the table?

619
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:17,810
- You want me to set the table too?
- Coming, Hae Ja.

620
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:18,881
Goodness.

621
00:42:22,621 --> 00:42:23,691
What?

622
00:42:24,721 --> 00:42:26,920
Newcomer. Are you planning on eating?

623
00:42:26,921 --> 00:42:28,260
Too bad. You've still got work to do.

624
00:42:28,261 --> 00:42:29,291
What else is there to do?

625
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:34,501
The blankets get washed every ten days.

626
00:42:35,131 --> 00:42:36,901
And that's the new hire's job.

627
00:42:37,331 --> 00:42:38,431
Right?

628
00:42:38,801 --> 00:42:41,000
That goes without saying, Hae Ja.

629
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:42,941
If the new hire doesn't do it, who else will?

630
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:50,111
That is really classy.

631
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,680
You're being so petty over food. Seriously.

632
00:42:53,681 --> 00:42:54,681
Hey.

633
00:42:56,591 --> 00:42:57,851
What did you just say?

634
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:01,561
Nothing.

635
00:43:01,861 --> 00:43:03,691
I said, "Enjoy your meal."

636
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:17,110
What are you waiting for? Set the table.

637
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:19,611
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

638
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:27,021
Is Yeong Sik always this late?

639
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:28,381
Of course, he is.

640
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:30,651
Being poor is a curse.

641
00:43:31,991 --> 00:43:33,491
At his age, he should only be focused on studying,

642
00:43:34,061 --> 00:43:35,891
But instead, he has to worry about making money.

643
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,961
Whenever I think about your brother,

644
00:43:39,301 --> 00:43:40,901
it breaks my heart. I feel so sorry for him.

645
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,631
It tears me up inside.

646
00:43:44,671 --> 00:43:47,701
You only ever feel sorry for Yeong Sik.

647
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:51,811
What about my tuition?

648
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:54,611
I'll pay it. The deadline isn't here yet.

649
00:43:55,381 --> 00:43:56,481
Mom.

650
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:58,781
Look.

651
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:02,021
What if we ask our uncle?

652
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:04,891
What uncle? You don't have an uncle.

653
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,591
I wouldn't even walk in their direction.

654
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:10,791
No matter how desperate you get, don't you go groveling to them.

655
00:44:10,991 --> 00:44:13,201
The second your father died, they sold the family burial grounds.

656
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:15,601
What do you expect from people who'd just cut us off like that?

657
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:18,171
Honestly, you'd have an easier time getting blood from a stone.

658
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:24,110
Yeong Mi. You're slacking, aren't you?

659
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:26,711
I can tell you're just resting your hands on it.

660
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:28,910
Put your back on it. Come on.

661
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:30,510
It'll be easier on Mom that way.

662
00:44:30,511 --> 00:44:31,651
Come on.

663
00:44:31,751 --> 00:44:34,620
- One, two.
- One, two.

664
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:35,991
- One, two.
- Goodness.

665
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:40,691
We're almost there! One, two!

666
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:44,161
Come out!

667
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:46,160
Come out of there, now!

668
00:44:46,161 --> 00:44:47,631
Oh, no!

669
00:44:50,571 --> 00:44:52,470
Hey! Ok Hui. Are you out of your mind?

670
00:44:52,471 --> 00:44:54,100
- I can't hold it anymore!
- Are you insane?

671
00:44:54,101 --> 00:44:55,911
I'm about to have an accident, right now!

672
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:57,210
I'm sorry, okay?

673
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:58,880
I'm really about to have an accident. I'm sorry.

674
00:44:58,881 --> 00:45:00,441
- I'm sorry!
- Get out!

675
00:45:14,321 --> 00:45:16,130
What on earth is going on here?

676
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:17,990
Oh, my gosh. This is killing me.

677
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:19,661
I have no idea.

678
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:24,301
Since dawn, it's like a thunderstorm was raging inside my stomach.

679
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,440
And then...

680
00:45:26,441 --> 00:45:30,241
- it hit every single one of us...
- I feel like my organs are out.

681
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:33,381
The other rooms are fine.

682
00:45:34,281 --> 00:45:35,281
Darn it.

683
00:45:35,481 --> 00:45:38,651
What did you eat to all get explosive diarrhea?

684
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:43,951
Are you two all right?

685
00:45:44,151 --> 00:45:45,551
Yes, I'm fine.

686
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:48,861
- Yes, me too.
- Gosh. I'm in pain.

687
00:45:49,191 --> 00:45:52,661
Gosh. This is a disaster. We've got buses scheduled to leave.

688
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:56,001
How are we supposed to cover all these shifts?

689
00:45:57,701 --> 00:45:58,701
Oh, my gosh. I'm going to have an accident.

690
00:45:58,702 --> 00:46:01,170
As you all know, right?

691
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:03,170
This is an emergency.

692
00:46:03,171 --> 00:46:06,010
It's an emergency, so it's no time to say, "That's not my job," right?

693
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:07,880
So we all need to pitch in and get this done fast.

694
00:46:07,881 --> 00:46:10,510
Look, I'll take it if you insist.

695
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:12,480
But what are we supposed to do with this?

696
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:14,720
Because someone has to be there to collect the fares.

697
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:16,220
- For now...
- For now!

698
00:46:16,221 --> 00:46:19,460
Just get on the bus. All you do is open and close doors.

699
00:46:19,461 --> 00:46:21,391
Collect the fares and then go.

700
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:23,330
It's simple, right? Here, take it. Quick.

701
00:46:23,331 --> 00:46:26,000
This is no time to stand around. Hurry up and get ready!

702
00:46:26,001 --> 00:46:27,800
What are you doing? Get on.

703
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:29,531
Let's get moving. Go.

704
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:32,171
Koh Yeong Rye! Aren't you coming?

705
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:33,471
Trainee!

706
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:35,171
You're riding on a different bus today!

707
00:46:37,871 --> 00:46:38,871
Hurry!

708
00:46:52,251 --> 00:46:53,261
You punk.

709
00:46:54,191 --> 00:46:55,361
If it was this bad,

710
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:58,261
you should've said something back then!

711
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:00,860
What are we supposed to do now?

712
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:01,861
Goodness.

713
00:47:02,061 --> 00:47:03,971
And you have a match coming up!

714
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,101
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

715
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:12,741
If we lose the welterweight, we're completely ruined.

716
00:47:13,281 --> 00:47:14,581
I can still fight.

717
00:47:15,781 --> 00:47:17,081
I just need a bit more icing.

718
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:21,720
Hey. You think icing is going to fix this?

719
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:23,590
You're trying to make me out to be the bad guy.

720
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,861
You could end your whole career like this, you punk! You hear me?

721
00:47:27,521 --> 00:47:29,360
I don't know whether to kill you or not.

722
00:47:29,361 --> 00:47:31,861
I'm seriously losing my mind.

723
00:47:34,201 --> 00:47:35,530
- Coach!
- Yes?

724
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:36,631
Coach.

725
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:38,431
We're here.

726
00:47:38,931 --> 00:47:41,241
We seriously ran our way here.

727
00:47:42,471 --> 00:47:43,571
Jae Pil.

728
00:47:43,771 --> 00:47:46,081
Could you do me a favor, just this once?

729
00:47:55,721 --> 00:47:56,721
Me?

730
00:47:57,221 --> 00:47:59,460
No way. Why would I do something like that?

731
00:47:59,461 --> 00:48:00,920
What do you mean, "no way?"

732
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:02,991
Then why does everyone have explosive diarrhea?

733
00:48:03,391 --> 00:48:05,901
Only you and Yeong Rye are fine, and you didn't eat with us.

734
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:07,931
You put something in the food, didn't you?

735
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:09,830
What is it? Did you spike it with laxatives?

736
00:48:09,831 --> 00:48:10,871
Hey.

737
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:12,941
I wouldn't stoop to a cheap trick like that.

738
00:48:13,171 --> 00:48:14,771
- I'm not like you.
- What did you say?

739
00:48:15,341 --> 00:48:17,510
You brat. How old are you?

740
00:48:17,511 --> 00:48:19,240
Spit it out! How old are you, you wench?

741
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:21,081
Does your age make you royalty or something?

742
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,810
Gosh. You're really something else.

743
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:25,310
- Look at them go.
- Hey. Let go of me!

744
00:48:25,311 --> 00:48:26,721
- Good grief.
- Hey!

745
00:48:27,181 --> 00:48:29,651
At this rate, she'll get her scalp torn right off, don't you think?

746
00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:31,421
Goodness. What a vicious wench.

747
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:33,590
She didn't just poke the bear.

748
00:48:33,591 --> 00:48:35,220
She went and pulled Kwon Hae Ja by the hair?

749
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:36,230
- What's wrong with you?
- Hey.

750
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:37,360
Who do you think will let go first?

751
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:39,160
My money's on Kwon Hae Ja.

752
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:40,700
- You two. Stop it.
- Hey!

753
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:42,530
- Hey. Come on, you two.
- Stop it, already!

754
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:45,731
I'm betting on the new hire.

755
00:48:45,941 --> 00:48:48,101
Yeong Rye, how about you? Who are you betting on?

756
00:48:48,941 --> 00:48:51,270
- Gosh. I'm out of here.
- Stop it.

757
00:48:51,271 --> 00:48:52,271
Hey.

758
00:48:52,272 --> 00:48:54,710
Gosh. I'm also...

759
00:48:54,711 --> 00:48:57,150
Don't hit the face!

760
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:58,780
Hey, let go!

761
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:02,120
All right. In 1, 2, 3, you both let go. Do you hear me?

762
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:04,290
One, two, three!

763
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:06,120
Of course, you wouldn't let go. Just brilliant!

764
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:08,060
- Hey. Let go!
- You let go!

765
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:10,161
- One, two, three!
- One, two...

766
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:14,631
Honestly, these troublemakers.

767
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:18,970
Kwon Hae Ja. Are you sure about this?

768
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:21,171
I'm telling you, I'm positive!

769
00:49:21,571 --> 00:49:23,071
I'm telling you, she's the one who did it!

770
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:25,340
If she isn't the one, I'll change my last name.

771
00:49:25,341 --> 00:49:26,711
From Kwon to Con.

772
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:31,011
In fact, I'll just quit my job here altogether.

773
00:50:36,581 --> 00:50:39,151
Listen. He's the favorite to win, so...

774
00:50:39,951 --> 00:50:42,050
Focus on your defense. Stay defensive, and then...

775
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:44,091
Don't get too aggressive. Don't force it.

776
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:47,621
Stick to defense, and take any opening you see. Okay?

777
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:57,471
Box!

778
00:51:32,671 --> 00:51:33,671
That's right!

779
00:51:35,771 --> 00:51:37,710
- Land a punch! Smash his head in!
- Hey!

780
00:51:37,711 --> 00:51:39,681
- Go for his head!
- No, don't!

781
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:50,291
Jae Pil. Are you okay?

782
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:05,631
No, just leave me alone!

783
00:52:07,571 --> 00:52:09,171
I said no!

784
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:11,141
Please, stop!

785
00:52:11,741 --> 00:52:13,541
My mom says she doesn't want you to!

786
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:18,651
No!

787
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:21,621
One!

788
00:52:22,321 --> 00:52:23,521
Two!

789
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:25,321
Three!

790
00:52:25,991 --> 00:52:27,161
Four!

791
00:52:27,361 --> 00:52:28,461
Five!

792
00:52:31,391 --> 00:52:32,491
Are you okay?

793
00:52:33,601 --> 00:52:36,170
- Nice.
- That's it.

794
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:37,571
- This is your moment!
- Box!

797
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:16,310
- six, seven...
- Come on. Hang in there!

798
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:18,211
- Eight, nine!
- Eight, nine!

799
00:53:18,911 --> 00:53:19,941

you've seen advertised everywhere.

803
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:49,410
It's 20 inches.

804
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:50,640
And in keeping with the new age of color,

805
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:52,840
this model even comes equipped with color controls.

806
00:53:52,841 --> 00:53:54,281
- Nice, isn't it?
- Thank you.

807
00:53:55,241 --> 00:53:56,411
The color looks great, too.

808
00:53:57,311 --> 00:53:58,811
- Try another channel.
- Sure, sir.

810
00:54:01,622 --> 00:54:05,691
There was a major upset today at the youth boxing championship.

811
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:08,220
That kid there looks a lot like my boy.

812
00:54:08,221 --> 00:54:09,590
An unknown rookie defeated...

813
00:54:09,591 --> 00:54:11,731
It's not just a resemblance. I think that actually is Jae Pil.

814
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:12,831
- What?
- As the winner was announced,

815
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:16,631
the gym was filled with an uproar of both cheers and shock.

816
00:54:17,631 --> 00:54:19,640
With this win, this unknown rookie...

817
00:54:19,641 --> 00:54:21,870
could be on his way to stardom. All eyes are on what's next.

818
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:24,110
- That punk.
- Experts are saying...

819
00:54:24,111 --> 00:54:25,571
he is showing great potential.

820
00:54:33,651 --> 00:54:35,721
Yeong Rye. Are you going to wash up?

821
00:55:11,751 --> 00:55:12,751
Over here.

822
00:55:14,421 --> 00:55:15,691
Why? What's going on?

823
00:55:18,931 --> 00:55:20,031
Well...

825
00:55:25,271 --> 00:55:26,701
Did a cat get your tongue?

826
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,940
What on earth were you doing, throwing punches, you punk!

827
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:31,541
I wasn't throwing punches. It's called boxing.

828
00:55:31,841 --> 00:55:32,841
What?

829
00:55:33,211 --> 00:55:35,141
The nerve of you...

830
00:55:35,241 --> 00:55:37,280
This is what happens when you run around doing this.

831
00:55:37,281 --> 00:55:39,920
And why your grades are awful despite being so smart, you punk!

832
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,120
You don't want to go to college?

833
00:55:41,121 --> 00:55:43,951
You're already a year behind. You want to retake exams for years?

834
00:55:44,051 --> 00:55:45,520
Do you think I'm working so hard as PTA president...

835
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:48,221
and pouring money down the drain so you can mess around like this?

836
00:55:49,531 --> 00:55:51,991
Stop this nonsense and get a tutor.

837
00:55:52,931 --> 00:55:54,660
I'll get you the best one money can buy.

838
00:55:54,661 --> 00:55:57,230
No. Besides, that's illegal.

839
00:55:57,231 --> 00:55:58,331
Why you little...

840
00:55:58,801 --> 00:56:01,041
Since when have you ever cared about the law, you punk?

841
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:02,341
You're doing it!

842
00:56:03,141 --> 00:56:04,710
You have to get into college, don't you?

843
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:05,941
I won't.

844
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:08,080
College isn't my dream.

845
00:56:08,081 --> 00:56:10,550
It's your regret you couldn't go. It's your dream, not mine.

846
00:56:10,551 --> 00:56:11,551
What did you say?

847
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,821
You disrespectful little punk.

848
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:21,191
What are you going to do? Stare me down, you punk?

849
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:22,761
Get on the floor.

850
00:56:24,661 --> 00:56:26,261
I said, get on the floor, you little punk!

What was that?

College is my regret?

854
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:45,250
If you know that,

855
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:47,781
then you should grit your teeth and work even harder!

856
00:56:51,121 --> 00:56:53,161
Are you still refusing the tutor?

857
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:55,491
How about now?

858
00:56:57,661 --> 00:56:58,861
And now!

Why are you in my bag at this hour?

What's all this noise?

867
00:59:08,761 --> 00:59:12,060
Why are you making such a racket? I can't even sleep.

868
00:59:12,061 --> 00:59:16,061
Well, they were sneaking around, going through my bag like alleycats!

869

What is it?

It's medicine from Suk Ja's bag.

875
00:59:32,351 --> 00:59:34,881
I'm pretty sure it's a laxative.

Earlier, in the washroom,

877
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:39,491
I even saw her eating a cream bun.

878

Who eats a cream bun when they have an upset stomach?

879
00:59:42,761 --> 00:59:44,991
I didn't eat any cream bun!

It's...

884
00:59:53,971 --> 00:59:55,171
It's cold medicine.

Ever since yesterday,

886
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:00,581
I've been feeling a cold coming on.

We'll know if it's cold medicine or a laxative, right?

01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:24,931
That's right.

896
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:27,031
I did it!

897
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:31,731
I'm always stuck on standby, not making a dime.

898
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:35,341
I was sick of watching you all be so happy-go-lucky.

899
01:01:36,371 --> 01:01:40,241
I wanted you to know what it's like to miss work and lose out on pay.

900
01:01:40,811 --> 01:01:43,611
So I put some laxatives in the fish cake broth.

901
01:01:43,811 --> 01:01:45,081
- So what?
- Hey.

902
01:01:45,551 --> 01:01:46,551
Do you hear yourself right now?

903
01:01:46,751 --> 01:01:48,580
This girl's completely lost it!

904
01:01:48,581 --> 01:01:50,290
That's right! I have lost it!

905
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:52,291
Do you think I'd do that if I were in my right mind?

906
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:54,121
Let's be honest here.

907
01:01:54,721 --> 01:01:57,261
Is there a single one of you who hasn't skimmed off the top?

908
01:01:58,061 --> 01:01:59,861
So why should I be the only one who gets punished?

909
01:02:01,231 --> 01:02:03,331
Why is it just me?

910
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:29,621
You were so sure of yourself.

911
01:02:29,721 --> 01:02:32,291
And I wasn't the culprit, was I?

912
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:35,531
So?

913
01:02:35,532 --> 01:02:37,801
You told the personnel manager and the housemother, didn't you?

914
01:02:39,201 --> 01:02:40,641
That if I weren't the one to blame,

915
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:43,001
you'd quit...

916
01:02:45,771 --> 01:02:47,440
this place entirely.

917
01:02:47,441 --> 01:02:48,441
So what?

918
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:50,681
You really expect me to resign over something this petty?

919
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:53,281
How dare you threaten me!

920
01:02:58,391 --> 01:03:00,561
If there's one thing I hate, it's violence.

921
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:05,761
Let's just keep this between us.

922
01:03:06,061 --> 01:03:08,931
All the dirty looks I'll get at work thinking I'm the culprit...

923
01:03:09,731 --> 01:03:10,801
I can handle it.

924
01:03:12,701 --> 01:03:13,801
But...

925
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:21,841
Stop making the other girls give you massages.

926
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:25,111
They're wiped out after working all day.

927
01:03:29,951 --> 01:03:31,991
(Fire hydrant)

928
01:03:43,771 --> 01:03:45,671
- Are you okay?
- No.

929
01:03:46,601 --> 01:03:48,571
I'm not okay. This is my...

930
01:03:49,171 --> 01:03:50,311
fifth trip already.

931
01:03:50,611 --> 01:03:52,311
Hey. Do you want to go to the hospital?

932
01:03:52,911 --> 01:03:54,641
- Or maybe...
- That's not it.

933
01:03:55,611 --> 01:03:57,151
I'm just starving.

934
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:00,881
From flushing everything out.

935
01:04:19,531 --> 01:04:21,141
Are you sure you should be eating that?

936
01:04:22,201 --> 01:04:23,811
That ramyeon's going to be rough on your stomach.

937
01:04:23,911 --> 01:04:24,911
I don't care.

938
01:04:24,912 --> 01:04:26,841
I'm just going to eat while I can.

939
01:04:27,111 --> 01:04:28,411
Even if it goes right through me.

940
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:31,880
You're a closet oddball, aren't you?

941
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:34,120
A closet oddball? What's that?

942
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:35,220
Someone who's secretly an oddball.

943
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:36,621
They're scarier than the obvious ones.

944
01:04:36,821 --> 01:04:38,291
Well, now you know.

945
01:04:38,491 --> 01:04:39,651
And you're definitely one.

946
01:04:45,091 --> 01:04:46,561
- This is good.
- It is?

947
01:04:50,801 --> 01:04:53,201
Watch this. I'll show you something cool.

948
01:04:53,601 --> 01:04:54,871
I can even do this with my neck.

949
01:04:55,401 --> 01:04:56,471
Here I go.

950
01:04:56,571 --> 01:04:57,641
Watch.

951
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:02,111
Pretty cool, right?

952
01:05:05,811 --> 01:05:06,881
Do you want to try?

953
01:05:07,281 --> 01:05:08,281
Yes.

954
01:05:16,361 --> 01:05:19,191
Don't tell me you're a certified hula hoop instructor, too.

955
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:21,601
You're always so driven.

956
01:05:22,261 --> 01:05:24,571
You have a ton of certificates and always study in your spare time.

957
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:30,111
Those are just things I got as a backup plan.

958
01:05:33,781 --> 01:05:35,180
But my real dream...

959
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,980
is to go to college.

960
01:05:36,981 --> 01:05:38,051
After I pass my GED.

961
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:39,481
"College?"

962
01:05:39,781 --> 01:05:41,781
Gosh. That's impressive.

963
01:05:42,951 --> 01:05:44,850
I'll major in Korean Literature.

964
01:05:44,851 --> 01:05:47,421
And become a teacher or a professor.

965
01:05:49,221 --> 01:05:51,031
It might take a while, but...

966
01:05:53,061 --> 01:05:54,731
Once things are better for my family,

967
01:05:54,931 --> 01:05:56,201
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

968
01:05:58,471 --> 01:05:59,571
What about you?

969
01:06:00,201 --> 01:06:01,371
Do you have a dream?

970
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:03,641
Of course, I do.

971
01:06:04,871 --> 01:06:05,971
I'm going to...

972
01:06:07,811 --> 01:06:09,441
Maybe I'll become Miss Korea.

973
01:06:12,411 --> 01:06:13,951
And after that, I'll become an actress.

974
01:06:14,851 --> 01:06:18,591
I'll make people laugh and cry, and move them.

975
01:06:20,691 --> 01:06:23,461
A star that shines brighter than all the others up there.

976
01:06:26,261 --> 01:06:28,961
That's so amazing.

977
01:06:30,101 --> 01:06:31,671
You'll definitely make it.

978
01:06:32,401 --> 01:06:33,501
I don't know about that.

979
01:06:34,941 --> 01:06:38,211
The way things are going, I'll be stuck yelling "All clear!"

980
01:06:41,211 --> 01:06:43,241
In this book I'm studying,

981
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:45,681
there's this one quote.

982
01:06:47,081 --> 01:06:49,381
"Boys, be ambitious."

983
01:06:49,681 --> 01:06:50,891
What does that mean?

984
01:06:54,361 --> 01:06:56,991
"Boys, be ambitious."

985
01:06:57,761 --> 01:07:01,661
"Not for money or for your own selfish success."

986
01:07:02,301 --> 01:07:06,271
"And not for that fleeting thing that people call fame."

987
01:07:06,571 --> 01:07:10,771
"But for the sake of attaining all that a person is meant to be."

988
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:15,541
So every morning, I recite a little mantra.

989
01:07:18,381 --> 01:07:20,421
"Girls, be ambitious."

990
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:25,751
Who says only boys get to be ambitious?

991
01:07:25,951 --> 01:07:27,461
Girls should be, too.

992
01:07:27,661 --> 01:07:29,261
We've got our whole lives ahead of us.

993
01:07:33,391 --> 01:07:35,231
I think I just fell for you.

994
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:41,071
Well...

995
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:43,201
I already have.

996
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:47,981
The moment you blew that huge bubble on the bus.

997
01:07:48,181 --> 01:07:49,181
You did?

998
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:54,281
That's a relief. I'm glad it's mutual.

999
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:57,121
Because I'm not a fan of unrequited love.

1000
01:08:01,491 --> 01:08:02,561
Oh, right.

1001
01:08:02,761 --> 01:08:03,761
By the way...

1002
01:08:04,961 --> 01:08:08,161
You know how we work two days on, then get one day off, right?

1003
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:11,331
What are you going to do on yours?

1004
01:08:11,431 --> 01:08:12,531
I don't know.

1005
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:18,611
Sleeping all day feels like a waste, though.

1006
01:08:20,881 --> 01:08:22,411
- Do you want to go downtown?
- Yes!

1007
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:24,311
- Really?
- Yes.

1008
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:26,711
Let's go downtown together!

1009
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:28,251
- Together?
- Yes!

1010
01:08:29,181 --> 01:08:30,181
That'll be so much fun!

1011
01:08:30,391 --> 01:08:31,391
Okay!

1012
01:08:33,451 --> 01:08:34,591
Show me that trick again.

1013
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:36,220
- It was pretty neat, right?
- Yes.

1014
01:08:36,221 --> 01:08:38,161
Okay. Watch.

1015
01:08:40,031 --> 01:08:41,860
- One, two, three, four, - Gosh.

1016
01:08:41,861 --> 01:08:44,470
- five, six, seven, eight.
- Let me try.

1017
01:08:44,471 --> 01:08:45,601
- You want to try?
- Yes.

1018
01:08:46,201 --> 01:08:47,841
Careful. Come over here.

1019
01:08:50,741 --> 01:08:51,741
One...

1020
01:08:53,211 --> 01:08:55,241
You bend over like this, and...

1022
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:15,931
Read yours.

1023

Open wide.

1024
01:09:22,601 --> 01:09:24,011
You eat it.

1025
01:09:28,941 --> 01:09:31,111
Here it is. I spotted this place the other day.

1026
01:09:31,681 --> 01:09:34,221
They take song requests, and they have live music sometimes.

1027
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:36,021
Welcome to Vivaldi.

1028
01:09:36,221 --> 01:09:37,420
- Hi.
- Hi.

1029
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:38,651
Please, sit wherever you'd like.

1030
01:09:39,451 --> 01:09:40,461
How about here?

1031
01:09:56,971 --> 01:09:58,971
What was that? High-five me.

1032
01:10:01,211 --> 01:10:03,010
- High-five.
- Yes!

1033
01:10:03,011 --> 01:10:04,050
I'm off now.

1034
01:10:04,051 --> 01:10:05,511
- Go on, then!
- See you later!

1035
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:11,251
- Did you ask?
- Yes.

1036
01:10:17,791 --> 01:10:18,891
They're playing our song!

1037
01:10:31,071 --> 01:10:32,440
So, where should we go today?

1038
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:33,471
- Today?
- Yes.

1039
01:10:33,671 --> 01:10:34,781
Vivaldi.

1040
01:10:34,881 --> 01:10:35,911
Vivaldi. Let's go.

1041
01:10:37,551 --> 01:10:40,351
(Vivaldi)

1042
01:10:43,581 --> 01:10:44,891
- Why isn't it working?
- Try again.

1043
01:10:48,991 --> 01:10:49,991
I can't.

1044
01:10:50,961 --> 01:10:51,961
One more time.

1045
01:10:52,761 --> 01:10:53,761
Do you want to try together?

1046
01:10:59,871 --> 01:11:01,641
Your dad's really something else.

1047
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,300
It's not as if you did anything wrong.

1048
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:04,971
And all just because you like to box.

1049
01:11:05,271 --> 01:11:07,071
He goes and gets you a full-time driver? Honestly.

1050
01:11:07,841 --> 01:11:10,011
Are you getting whisked away again or are you going straight home?

1051
01:11:10,681 --> 01:11:11,681
Probably?

1052
01:11:13,851 --> 01:11:16,721
It's no fun at the gym without you. I've got no motivation to work out.

1053
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:21,361
That's separation anxiety you've got there.

1054
01:11:22,961 --> 01:11:24,991
You should take this chance to wean yourself off me.

1055
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:26,861
And learn to stand on your own two feet.

1056
01:11:27,061 --> 01:11:29,161
No way. I'm not interested.

1057
01:11:29,561 --> 01:11:31,670
I still need to go to Ddoddo Snack Bar with you.

1058
01:11:31,671 --> 01:11:34,041
There's this girl, a regular, that I've got my eye on.

1059
01:11:34,641 --> 01:11:35,641
Hey.

1060
01:11:36,371 --> 01:11:37,440
Instead of just moping,

1061
01:11:37,441 --> 01:11:38,571
do you want to come up with a little plan?

1062
01:11:39,311 --> 01:11:40,311
"A plan?"

1063
01:11:43,951 --> 01:11:44,951
You have to come later, okay?

1064
01:11:52,751 --> 01:11:54,060
Hey. Hide.

1065
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:55,490
(7th Annual Student Comprehensive Works Exhibition)

1066
01:11:55,491 --> 01:11:57,190
All right, take one and go.

1067
01:11:57,191 --> 01:11:59,161
All right. Move along.

1068
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:00,930
Good work.

1069
01:12:00,931 --> 01:12:03,530
Grab one and go. Keep it moving.

1070
01:12:03,531 --> 01:12:04,771
Hey, stop. Ji Hoon!

1071
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,500
That was some great acting. Well done?

1072
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:09,641
It was really natural. You can take two.

1073
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:11,171
Well done. Bravo.

1074
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,550
Hey. Just to grab some tteokbokki with you...

1075
01:12:20,551 --> 01:12:22,020
I just blew through two weeks' worth of bus tokens.

1076
01:12:22,021 --> 01:12:24,220
This was all you. Planning, directing, and acting.

1077
01:12:24,221 --> 01:12:25,650
I told you I wasn't that into it, remember?

1078
01:12:25,651 --> 01:12:26,991
Come on.

1079
01:12:27,461 --> 01:12:29,520
But I'm telling you, that girl at Ddoddo Snack Bar is beautiful.

1080
01:12:29,521 --> 01:12:31,261
I just wanted to show you what she looks like...

1081
01:12:31,861 --> 01:12:34,061
- Look at him. He's so handsome.
- Oh, my gosh.

1082
01:12:36,701 --> 01:12:37,900
Did you see that?

1083
01:12:37,901 --> 01:12:39,231
Did you see how she was looking at her?

1084
01:12:39,971 --> 01:12:40,971
I saw.

1085
01:12:40,972 --> 01:12:44,110
This Prince Charming. What am I supposed to do with you?

1086
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:47,941
This guy is rich, smart, and popular.

1087
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:50,080
Hey. Don't even be a top student, too.

1088
01:12:50,081 --> 01:12:51,981
If you're a good student, you'll be insufferable.

1089
01:12:52,411 --> 01:12:53,511
I'm not hanging out with you then.

1090
01:12:58,491 --> 01:13:00,151
- Careful coming down.
- Okay.

1091
01:13:02,321 --> 01:13:04,490
Gosh. It's been forever since we had a day off.

1092
01:13:04,491 --> 01:13:05,491
Seriously.

1093
01:13:10,671 --> 01:13:12,170
The weather is incredible, isn't it?

1094
01:13:12,171 --> 01:13:13,971
It's great!

1095
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:18,940
(Dispatch Status Board)

1096
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:20,341
(Recruiting Applicants for Night School)

1097
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,751
What are you doing? Hurry up. We'll be late for the movie.

1098
01:13:25,411 --> 01:13:26,750
Right. I'm coming.

1099
01:13:26,751 --> 01:13:27,820
(Cheongah Bus)

1100
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:29,821
What's the movie called again?

1101
01:13:29,921 --> 01:13:30,951
You'll see.

1102
01:13:31,151 --> 01:13:33,721
A movie that builds character.

1103
01:13:35,321 --> 01:13:37,991
By the way, are you sure you don't need to check in at home?

1104
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:39,661
It's been a while since you last went.

1105
01:13:39,861 --> 01:13:41,631
No, I'm good.

1106
01:13:43,971 --> 01:13:44,971
Stop right there!

1107
01:13:46,771 --> 01:13:48,741
- Stop, you punk!
- Would you stop if you were me?

1108
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:50,041
Darn it.

1109
01:14:07,561 --> 01:14:08,621
Get over here.

1110
01:14:10,891 --> 01:14:13,261
I honestly don't know her. I've never seen her before.

1111
01:14:14,301 --> 01:14:15,831
Then why'd you bolt?

1112
01:14:16,131 --> 01:14:18,430
You ran because you're guilty, didn't you? You little punk.

1113
01:14:18,431 --> 01:14:19,571
No, it's just...

1114
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:22,341
The vibe just felt like I should probably run first.

1115
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:28,011
Take another look. Okay?

1116
01:14:28,311 --> 01:14:29,681
Her name is Seo Jong Yeon.

1117
01:14:30,211 --> 01:14:33,250
We're asking because someone saw her on your turf, you punk.

1118
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:34,381
You really don't know her?

1119
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:39,720
I have a knack for remembering faces of every woman I've seen, but...

1120
01:14:39,721 --> 01:14:41,461
I'm telling you, I've never seen this one before.

1121
01:14:53,801 --> 01:14:55,101
Darn it.

1122
01:14:59,011 --> 01:15:00,011
Well...

1123
01:15:00,571 --> 01:15:02,041
What are we going to do about these?

1124
01:15:02,241 --> 01:15:04,181
- We've only got a few left. Gosh.
- Goodness.

1125
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:06,611
Han Jae Pil!

1126
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:10,421
It's even nicer running into you out here.

1127
01:15:10,921 --> 01:15:12,751
I can't say the feeling is mutual.

1128
01:15:18,691 --> 01:15:19,831
I'm so scared.

1129
01:15:26,131 --> 01:15:27,741
How come you haven't been at the gym lately?

1130
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:31,141
After that one match I got you,

1131
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:32,541
is the thrill gone?

1132
01:15:33,211 --> 01:15:34,411
Is boxing beneath you now?

1133
01:15:36,911 --> 01:15:38,110
But seeing the state you're in,

1134
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,451
I have a feeling I'll be benefiting from your mess-ups again soon.

1135
01:15:41,381 --> 01:15:42,920
What did you say, you punk?

1136
01:15:42,921 --> 01:15:44,891
I would've been the one to fight if it weren't for you.

1137
01:15:45,421 --> 01:15:46,421
Actually,

1138
01:15:46,422 --> 01:15:48,220
I wouldn't have even busted my ankle in the first place.

1139
01:15:48,221 --> 01:15:50,220
It's all your fault, isn't it?

1140
01:15:50,221 --> 01:15:51,430
Deok Gu, what's gotten into you?

1141
01:15:51,431 --> 01:15:53,261
Stay out of this, you little punk!

1142
01:15:58,971 --> 01:15:59,971
Stop it.

1143
01:16:22,961 --> 01:16:23,961
Hey!

1144
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:26,631
Jae Pil!

1145
01:16:33,671 --> 01:16:34,770
What is this?

1146
01:16:34,771 --> 01:16:36,600
What's all this? What do you kids think you're doing?

1147
01:16:36,601 --> 01:16:37,811
Run for it!

1148
01:16:37,941 --> 01:16:41,110
- Stop right there!
- Hey! Get back here!

1149
01:16:41,111 --> 01:16:42,311
Get back here.

1150
01:16:42,511 --> 01:16:44,150
- Hey!
- Darn it.

1151
01:16:44,151 --> 01:16:45,451
- Hey!
- Hey.

1152
01:16:45,751 --> 01:16:49,751
(Madame Aema)

1153
01:16:51,991 --> 01:16:52,991
So this...

1154
01:16:53,821 --> 01:16:56,761
This is supposed to be so important to us?

1155
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:58,361
Of course.

1156
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:00,531
It'll do us a world of good.

1157
01:17:01,831 --> 01:17:04,671
Look. We're not minors. What's the big deal if we see it?

1158
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:08,571
Let's just march in there with our heads held high.

1159
01:17:09,841 --> 01:17:10,841
Let's go.

1160
01:17:15,311 --> 01:17:17,081
- Get back here!
- Hey. Stop right there!

1161
01:17:17,181 --> 01:17:18,181
Freeze!

1162
01:17:18,381 --> 01:17:20,051
- Hey!
- Hey. Get back here!

1163
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:22,321
Get back here.

1164
01:17:22,421 --> 01:17:23,951
- Get back here.
- Hey!

1165
01:17:26,991 --> 01:17:27,991
- Jong Hee.
- Yes?

1166
01:17:27,992 --> 01:17:29,520
I'm just going to run to the bathroom.

1167
01:17:29,521 --> 01:17:31,461
- Go ahead.
- I'll go on inside.

1168
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:34,501
(The viewing area is to the right.)

1169
01:17:37,531 --> 01:17:38,531
Back then,

1170
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:42,171
there was a thirst inside us that we couldn't bear unless we ran.

1171
01:17:43,201 --> 01:17:44,210
Darn it.

1172
01:17:44,211 --> 01:17:46,271
Not even knowing what it was we wanted,

1173
01:17:47,111 --> 01:17:49,081
but we couldn't bring ourselves to stop.

1174
01:17:49,281 --> 01:17:51,111
It was like driving with no brakes.

1175
01:18:08,461 --> 01:18:09,961
And at the end of that road,

1176
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:12,401
I met you.

1177
01:18:20,911 --> 01:18:24,181
And that is how this story begins.

1178
01:18:30,621 --> 01:18:33,451
(A Hundred Memories)

1179
01:18:52,171 --> 01:18:54,910
So did you end up meeting Giant or not?

1180
01:18:54,911 --> 01:18:57,011
I'm going to forget all about Giant.

1181
01:18:57,411 --> 01:18:59,481
And I'm going to apply for that instead.

1182
01:18:59,581 --> 01:19:01,580
Apparently, you need a diploma to be in the Miss Korea pageant.

1183
01:19:01,581 --> 01:19:03,881
Gosh. Back to school.

1184
01:19:05,621 --> 01:19:06,651
School.

1185
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:09,490
Hey. I'm planning a killer event.

1186
01:19:09,491 --> 01:19:11,331
Let's go on a 4-on-4 group date.

1187
01:19:11,531 --> 01:19:13,391
A group date? Forget it.

1188
01:19:14,661 --> 01:19:16,460
- What?
- Aren't you a pretty little thing?

1189
01:19:16,461 --> 01:19:17,771
- Don't touch me!
- Oh, my gosh.

1190
01:19:18,301 --> 01:19:19,401
I've started keeping a diary lately.

1191
01:19:19,801 --> 01:19:21,501
"Did something with Yeong Rye."

1192
01:19:21,701 --> 01:19:24,311
"It was fun. I was happy."

1193
01:19:24,941 --> 01:19:27,571
Words like those weren't really part of my vocabulary.

1194
01:19:27,781 --> 01:19:29,911
But thanks to you, life's gotten a little more fun.

1195
01:19:30,311 --> 01:19:33,381
Manager, can't you make just one exception?

1196
01:19:36,751 --> 01:19:42,861
(6 months ago)
