(7 years ago)

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,110
Seo Jong Hee?

9
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,219
What's wrong?

10
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,260
What happened?

11
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,230
Yeong Sik.

12
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,030
Please.

13
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,600
Help me.

14
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,900
Here. This is the last bus to Seoul.

15
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,680
Thank you so much.

16
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,650
Wear this. The night air's cold.

17
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,450
You're empty-handed.

18
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,430
Aren't you going to ask...

19
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,830
what happened to me?

20
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,670
Most things in life happen for a reason.

21
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,740
But sometimes, it's better not to know what that is.

22
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,390
Sorry. This is all I have on me.

23
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,100
Thank you.

24
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,130
I'll never forget...

25
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,710
what you did for me today.

26
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,540
All right.

27
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,610
Did anyone here go into Room 948 to clean it today?

28
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,680
Well...

29
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,479
There was a Do Not Disturb sign hanging on the doorknob.

30
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,350
Gosh. This is really making me anxious.

31
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,620
For the time being,

32
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,960
I want you all to keep a close eye on it.

33
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,259
It's been four days since check-in,

34
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,170
and the guest hasn't even stepped outside the room.

35
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,599
They haven't ordered any room service,

36
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,970
so I bet they're skipping meals, too.

37
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,600
And you all know what that means, right?

38
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,970
Solo guests who lock themselves away are the ones we fear most.

39
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,349
If someone dies on our watch,

40
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,080
our jobs are on the line.

41
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,290
Oh no.

42
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,419
What's happening? Do you think something's wrong?

43
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,289
No way. It can't be.

44
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,759
Shouldn't we go inside and check?

45
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,390
How? I'm too scared to go in.

46
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,930
(I'm leaving food in front of the door. Please eat a little.)

47
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,340
(Thank you for caring about me.)

48
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,780
Hello?

49
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,180
Hello? Are you in there?

50
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,650
Hello? Please open the door!

51
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,890
Manager, the spare key for Room 948! Hurry!

52
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,760
Hello?

53
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,859
- Ma'am! - Stay away!

54
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,370
Don't come any closer.

55
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,869
Please, just try to calm down a little.

56
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,470
Just don't come any closer, please.

57
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,740
Okay.

58
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,340
I won't come closer.

59
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,509
You have to stop her, no matter what.

60
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,350
I'm calling 911, got it?

61
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,650
It's me.

62
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,350
The one who left you the note.

63
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,630
My parents...

64
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,530
I lost them in a childhood accident. Both of them.

65
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,700
Back then, it really felt like my world had come to an end.

66
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,710
Life felt like a punishment,

67
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,110
and I had more bad days than good ones.

68
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,180
But I'm still here, just trying to get through it all.

69
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,590
Just hoping that all this misery will finally come to an end.

70
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,560
So, please...

71
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,900
don't give up.

72
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,370
It will all pass eventually. All of it.

73
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,410
I suppose it will.

74
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,410
The pain will grow dull,

75
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,750
and I'll start to forget my daughter who passed away.

76
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,790
I don't want that to happen.

77
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,660
I want to go see her as soon as I can.

78
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,290
I miss her so much.

79
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,900
- So much... - But even if you do that...

80
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,630
do you think your daughter would be happy to see you?

81
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,570
Because if it were me, I don't think I would be.

82
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,080
I think I'd be devastated.

83
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,310
Knowing my mother gave up her life because of me.

84
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
Your daughter...

85
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,860
She would want you to live a good life.

86
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,830
And to be happy enough for the both of you.

87
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,140
She'd want you to see the flowers in the spring,

88
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,340
And in the fall,

89
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,080
to look up at the clear, crisp sky,

90
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,720
and just miss her every once in a while.

91
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,960
Do you really think so? Really?

92
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,950
Looks like all the new arrivals this season are power suits.

93
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,119
My style is a bit more classic, though.

94
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,850
I guess they're in style right now.

95
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,420
I'm not a huge fan of this style either.

96
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,119
As the nation's economy grows,

97
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,030
the big look that flaunts wealth becomes the trend, I suppose.

98
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,270
Why don't you take this chance to try a new style?

99
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,010
Your outward appearance can change your entire mindset.

100
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,209
You do have some classic pieces, right?

101
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,280
Yes.

102
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,790
My goodness.

103
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,320
It's beautiful. It really is.

104
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,359
I've never worn a style like this. I feel so awkward.

105
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,399
Not at all. It suits you better than you think.

106
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
See?

107
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,169
What do you think? It looks like it was made for her, right?

108
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,700
Yes, Madam Chairman, she looks absolutely stunning.

109
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,310
I didn't realise you had a second daughter, though.

110
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,210
She takes after you, Madam Chairman.

111
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,440
She's such a beauty.

112
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,610
Isn't she?

113
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,450
My second daughter is my spitting image, isn't she?

114
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,090
I only came to help you with your shopping,

115
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,490
but I'm the one who bought way too much.

116
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,359
I haven't even taken the tags off the clothes you bought me last time.

117
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,800
Wear them. Why are you saving them for a special occasion?

118
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,729
I'll just buy you new things when the styles change next season.

119
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,239
Wear them while you're young and beautiful, okay?

120
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,570
I already have more than enough.

121
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,410
No, it's too much. It's more than I deserve.

122
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,640
You're really something.

123
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,480
You're so perfectly balanced.

124
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,750
Never too much, and never too little.

125
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,750
Thanks to you, Jong Hee, I've felt so much more at peace.

126
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,059
Sometimes I start to think that my Seung Yeon...

127
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,060
must have sent you to me.

128
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,230
I'm happy about it, too.

129
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,100
Thanks to you, I get to go shopping at department stores...

130
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,400
and have tea at beautiful places like this.

131
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,339
If it weren't for you, Madam Chairman,

132
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,100
how would I ever get to enjoy such a luxurious life?

133
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,970
Speaking of which...

134
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,440
How would you like to stay with me like this from now on?

135
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,209
Excuse me?

136
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,450
I'm making you a proposition, Jong Hee.

137
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,990
Why don't you be my daughter? My adopted daughter.

138
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,899
I only had the wallpaper redone. Everything else is just as it was.

139
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,330
I hope you like it.

140
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,800
Gosh.

141
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,799
It's so beautiful.

142
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,870
You think so?

143
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,310
It is, but I've never had a room this big before.

144
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,209
Back when I was a bus conductor, the dorm room...

145
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,679
had almost ten of us.

146
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,880
We would share a dorm room not even half this size.

147
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,690
Listen.

148
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,170
From now on, I don't want you to talk about your past.

149
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,700
And I don't want you contacting people you used to know.

150
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,380
Because you're starting a new life now. With me.

151
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,910
Understand?

152
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,010
Yes.

153
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:42,000
(Episode 8: Among So Many Stars)

154
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,739
- Jong Hee. - Mom.

155
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,280
I don't have much time today.

156
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,479
My schedule is packed with classes.

157
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,509
I know.

158
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,679
But you have about an hour to spare, right?

159
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,689
Your daughter is so gorgeous, by the way.

160
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,919
How should I put this?

161
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,959
As an artist, I'm dying to give her a makeover.

162
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,859
To give her a complete style makeover.

163
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,029
She's such a perfect canvas to work with.

164
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,259
Really?

165
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,499
I'm sure that's just flattery, but it's lovely to hear.

166
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,199
Ma'am. Flattery? Not at all.

167
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,539
I may not look it, but I can't say something if I don't mean it.

168
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,110
Ma'am, people sometimes tell me I'm too honest to be in business.

169
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,849
Shall we head on up now?

170
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,780
You'd probably want to sit together while you get your hair done, right?

171
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,590
Right this way.

172
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,590
Watch your step.

173
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,570
Hello, I'm Cho Yong Won, the head stylist here at Juri.

174
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,880
Hello.

175
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,220
Staff stylist...

176
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,190
My name is Koh Yeong Rye.

177
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,730
Hi, nice to meet you.

178
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,200
Please take good care of me today.

179
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,239
Excuse me.

180
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,400
Yes?

181
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,869
My daughter doesn't want to look like she just came from the salon.

182
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,640
Please give her a natural, effortless look.

183
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,809
She really doesn't like to stand out.

184
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,250
Yes, of course, ma'am.

185
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,750
In that case, we'll skip the cut and just do a simple blow-dry.

186
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,760
Oh, my goodness!

187
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,189
Oh my!

188
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,630
That must have startled you.

189
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,659
You should have been more careful!

190
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,170
Sharp things scare my daughter. She's sensitive to anything pointy.

191
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,940
I'm so sorry.

192
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,870
I'm usually not this clumsy. I don't know what came over me.

193
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Are you okay, sweetie?

194
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:03,280
Yes, I'm fine.

195
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,379
I'm so very sorry.

196
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,949
I'm so terribly sorry, ma'am. She's not usually like this.

197
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,120
Apologise to her again, now.

198
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,620
I'm so sorry.

199
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,929
Ma'am, we're terribly sorry. That must have frightened you.

200
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,260
I am so, so sorry.

201
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
Excuse me.

202
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,660
Yes? How can I help you?

203
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,170
I'm sorry to ask, but...

204
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,970
for today,

205
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,640
I'd like her to do my hair. Is that possible?

206
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,670
Pardon?

207
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,749
- Well... - Of course! Absolutely.

208
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,820
Our Ms. Koh here is very deft with her hands.

209
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,450
Ms. Koh.

210
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,020
Yes?

211
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,920
The styling cape.

212
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,630
All right then, for today,

213
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,230
I'll be the one taking care of you.

214
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,069
If you leave these in for a bit and then take them out,

215
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:11,279
it'll get super curly, just like you used a curling iron.

216
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,550
- Really? - Yes.

217
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,779
Where on earth did you learn a trick like this?

218
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,049
A little secret from my mom.

219
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,549
But just in case,

220
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,590
I'm thinking about maybe getting a cosmetology license too.

221
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,060
Let me see.

222
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,620
Again, I am so, so sorry for startling you earlier.

223
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,730
I'll be sure to train her properly so it never happens again.

224
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,099
So, were you pleased with your hair today?

225
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,230
Yes, I love it.

226
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,270
That's such a relief.

227
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,469
All right then, take care on your way out.

228
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,880
All right. Thanks for all your hard work.

229
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,420
Get home safe.

230
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,270
Goodbye. Thank you for choosing Juri Beauty Salon.

231
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,740
Good work, Ms. Koh.

232
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,010
Get this out of here!

233
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,750
Director.

234
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,269

236

(Love and Salted Seafood for You)

237
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,550
What did I say is most important about sales?

238
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,550
The display. The window display rule.

239
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,749
In three seconds of seeing the clothes in the window display,

240
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,319
the brand's image is cemented in the consumer's mind.

241
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,489
Look at this. Doesn't it just make you want to buy it?

242
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,729
You can't even get this one simple thing right?

243
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,899
Ta-da! Looking good.

244
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,230
It's a dud.

245
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,929
What do you mean, "It's a dud?"

246
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,299
This thing right here. It needs to be in the center.

247
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,539
"Love and Salted Seafood for You" needs to be seen, loud and clear.

248
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,839
The brand name, get it?

249
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,339
- Okay. - Is that so hard?

250
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,539
By size.

251
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,280
Uncle!

252
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,849
Our little Su Jin!

253
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,279
Hey, that's enough. You'll make the poor girl dizzy.

254
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,419
She just ate a plate of dumplings. What if she throws it all back up?

255
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,119
Su Jin, come on down, okay?

256
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,859
You're as heavy as a sack of rice. Uncle's arm is getting tired.

257
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,619
Are you worried about me...

258
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,990
or are you worried about the kid?

259
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,590
You should pick a side.

260
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,160
- You're confusing me. - How am I confusing you?

261
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,599
I don't have time to bicker with you.

262
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,900
Just put her down already.

263
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,600
What a mouth on you.

264
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,880
Well...

265
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,450
Day off today?

266
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,479
I can tell since you're not wearing that crazy-red lipstick.

267
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,250
Mind your own business.

268
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,790
Hey!

269
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,730
Actually, I was just about to ask you...

270
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,960
Did Su Jin get her shots?

271
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,629
What shots?

272
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,229
Would you look at this?

273
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,329
You forgot again, didn't you?

274
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,499
Last month, I asked...

275
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,169
if Su Jin got her second chickenpox shot,

276
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,299
and you told me you'd do it this month and to mind my own business.

277
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,310
After you bit my head off about it,

278
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,770
you're telling me you still haven't done it?

279
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:03,379
I can just do it now. It completely slipped my mind.

280
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,450
How could you forget something so important?

281
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,079
Unbelievable.

282
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,949
And you call yourself her mother.

283
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,250
In this cruel world, who's Su Jin supposed to trust?

284
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,349
Hold on a second.

285
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,420
Why does she feel so warm?

286
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,219
- Does she have a fever? - Stop being so dramatic.

287
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,660
- A fever? What fever... - Wait.

288
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,060
What is with you? What...

289
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,570
She's running a fever.

290
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,140
For crying out loud!

291
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,109
For kids, even a low-grade fever is a fever!

292
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,510
Temperature is key for salted seafood. You think I'd get it wrong?

293
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,080
Su Jin, let's go see a doctor. Okay?

294
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,919
No, wait a second.

295
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,950
Hey, I'm coming with you!

296
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,070
The young lady sent us to escort you.

297
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,800
Koh Yeong Rye!

298
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
Hey!

299
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,170
It really is you, isn't it?

300
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,279
I missed you so, so much.

301
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,380
Jong Hee?

302
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,510
This isn't a dream, is it? It's you, right?

303
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,950
Yes, it's me.

304
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,280
Closet oddball Koh Yeong Rye.

305
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,289
Look who's talking.

306
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,760
Are you really Seo Jong Hee? The Seo Jong Hee I used to know?

307
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,459
That's right. It's me.

308
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,790
The wild and reckless Seo Jong Hee.

309
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,330
Hey!

310
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,840
So that's how you became her adopted daughter.

311
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,740
I guess there really is such a thing as fate.

312
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,479
Tell me about it.

313
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,910
I never thought my life would turn out like this either.

314
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,979
You were a little hurt earlier, weren't you?

315
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,380
Because I acted like I didn't know you.

316
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,989
I was definitely surprised,

317
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,460
but I figured you must have had a reason.

318
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,260
My mom doesn't really like talking about the old days.

319
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,859
Or meeting people from the past.

320
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,069
Really?

321
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,399
Does that mean I shouldn't be here?

322
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,739
She won't be back today.

323
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,270
She went to some business conference or something out of town.

324
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,550
This feels so surreal,

325
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,080
sitting here across from you.

326
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,990
I know.

327
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,319
- How about now? Does it hurt? - Gosh.

328
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,589
It hurts.

329
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,360
It really hurts.

330
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,430
You caught me off guard, closet oddball Koh Yeong Rye.

331
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,770
Still,

332
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,599
you've really changed. Your whole vibe is different.

333
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,840
- You think so? - Yes.

334
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,310
Not as much as you.

335
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,640
I've only changed on the outside.

336
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,920
But you seem stronger and more grounded.

337
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,290
It's hard to explain, but...

338
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,420
It's like you've become more impressive.

339
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,990
At the salon, you looked like a total pro.

340
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,960
Well, it's my job.

341
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,759
You know how I get obsessed with things.

342
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,959
That's true.

343
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,630
You're really one of a kind.

344
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,499
Let me show you my room. Come on.

345
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,670
- Okay. - Let's go.

346
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,640
It's a little pink, right?

347
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,850
It's my mom's style, not mine.

348
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,120
I'm a replacement for the daughter she lost, you know.

349
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,050
So I try to give her whatever she wants.

350
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,890
Want one?

351
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,390
I quit a while ago. My mom can't stand it.

352
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,230
I still use them to calm my nerves.

353
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,570
Right.

354
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,339
Yeong Rye, you should try this on.

355
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,509
I think it'd look great on you.

356
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,979
No, it's okay. Why would I wear your clothes?

357
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,020
Hey, since when have we ever been about yours and mine?

358
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,820
Go on, it's a gift.

359
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,290
All right.

360
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,690
Thank you. I'll put it to good use.

361
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,049
You're in college too?

362
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,420
Yes.

363
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,289
My mom said though it's late, she wants me to get a degree.

364
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,390
For equestrian studies.

365
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,460
What about you?

366
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,590
Did you give up on college?

367
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,390
Going to college was your dream, wasn't it?

368
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,430
I haven't given up. Not yet.

369
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,130
I'm planning to apply for night school this year.

370
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,300
I still have to help out with the bills for now.

371
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,910
It must be so tough, working and studying at the same time.

372
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,640
- Have a seat. - Okay.

373
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,009
How's your mom? And Yeong Bae and Yeong Mi?

374
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,979
My mom is at Youngeun Market.

375
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,619
She runs a small diner there called Yeong Sik's Restaurant.

376
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,589
Yeong Bae and Yeong Mi are in middle school now.

377
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,590
Already?

378
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,590
I miss them so much.

379
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,659
What about Yeong Sik?

380
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,800
Yeong Sik passed the bar exam and is now in judicial training.

381
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,169
Really? Gosh.

382
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,000
I knew he would make it.

383
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,100
That's so impressive.

384
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,140
What about Jae Pil?

385
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,910
Are you still in touch with Jae Pil?

386
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,280
Yes.

387
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,680
He's doing great.

388
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,890
He got into med school and is now an intern at a university hospital.

389
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,460
Jae Pil went to med school?

390
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,420
Well, he's been through a lot.

391
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,790
His family's department store suddenly went bankrupt,

392
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,260
and his father collapsed.

393
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,199
All Jae Pil could do was study.

394
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Do you have a high pain tolerance?

395
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,510
You see, for an inpatient, the most dangerous thing is a fall.

396
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,749
If you wander around like this again without a guardian and get hurt,

397
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,450
you'll be in big trouble with me.

398
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,649
Does it hurt?

399
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,750
Yes.

400
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,889
If you're curious, we could all meet up sometime.

401
00:29:58,890 --> 00:29:59,890
Hold your breath.

402
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,060
No.

403
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,730
I've thought about it, and I don't think it's a good idea.

404
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,970
I'm the one who dumped him, remember?

405
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,039
But Jae Pil still worries...

406
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,709
Hey, it's getting late. You should take our car home.

407
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,179
I'll let the driver know.

408
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,909
No, it's fine. I can just take the bus.

409
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,379
I'll just take the bus.

410
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,780
I was a bus conductor, remember? I'm more comfortable on the bus.

411
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,720
You don't get carsick anymore?

412
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,820
Well, every now and then.

413
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,660
Just when I'm not feeling well or when it rains.

414
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,860
Still a country girl, you see.

415
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Here.

416
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,040
This is the diary I would write in whenever I thought of you.

417
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,110
I don't think I'll be needing it anymore.

418
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,570
So I want you to have it.

419
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,510
Okay.

420
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,090
You have no idea...

421
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,760
how much I missed you.

422
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,230
I once snuck out without Mom knowing and went to your neighbourhood.

423
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,700
But I couldn't find your house because of all the redevelopment.

424
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,630
Me too.

425
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,800
I missed you so, so much too.

426
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,480
I just had no idea where to even start looking for you.

427
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,880
You didn't even show up in my dreams.

428
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,879
Really?

429
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,080
Yes.

430
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,290
Well then, you can't run away from me now.

431
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,620
I've got you now, and I'm not letting go, okay?

432
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,929
You're one to talk. Don't you go running off again.

433
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,460
I'll never let you go again. Ever.

434
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,369
Go on, get inside and get some sleep.

435
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,599
Don't get all worked up and lose sleep over it.

436
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Okay.

437
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:52,270
- I'm going now. - Go on.

438
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,840
I'm leaving.

439
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,010
Yeong Rye.

440
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,910
I'll be in your dream tonight.

441
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,480
See you in your dreams.

442
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,850
- I'm off! - Bye.

443
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,450
Bye!

444
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeong Rye.

445
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,730
Every single day is so tedious.

446
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,910
I wake up, work, eat just to survive,

447
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,210
and sleep when I can't sleep at all.

448
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,040
And I'm terrified of the tomorrow that will follow.

449
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,950
Days that sparkle and shine like the ones I spent with you,

450
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,720
Will I ever have days like that again?

451
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,100
Yeong Rye, a miracle happened to me.

452
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,270
I'm a rich girl now.

453
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,940
If you were here with me, you'd be just as happy for me.

454
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,180
That I finally have a family that loves me.

455
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,520
I craved ramyeon so much I had to sneak out for some behind her back.

456
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,360
But it didn't taste the same as when we ate it on the rooftop.

457
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,200
It's not the ramyeon I miss.

458
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,530
It's you I miss so much.

459
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,540
I had a dream.

460
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,440
A dream that he was chasing me, bleeding profusely.

461
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,820
There was nothing in the papers, so I don't think he's dead.

462
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,520
So why didn't he report it?

463
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,490
I'm still so scared, Yeong Rye.

464
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,679
Sir? Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry.

465
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Could you please open the door again?

466
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,480
Thank you.

467
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,370
Hey!

468
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,210
What did you just say?

469
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,309
Once I started digging into one thing,

470
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,610
like pulling a thread, all sorts of corruption started to unravel.

471
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,750
You framed the innocent conductors for skimming money.

472
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,850
When really, the personnel manager who was meant to supervise them...

473
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,319
was the one who cooked the books and embezzled the funds?

474
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,760
For over ten years to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars?

475
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,330
And if that wasn't enough, you used it to bribe the police.

476
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,459
If headquarters finds out about this...

477
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,559
No.

478
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,399
Actually, no. Headquarters is the least of your worries.

479
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,500
Hey, Koh Yeong Rye.

480
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,700
What are you getting at?

481
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,940
What happened that night.

482
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,450
I'm telling you to take it to your grave.

483
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,850
Besides, what Jong Hee did was self-defence.

484
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:16,690
If you press charges, I'll testify to that until the end.

485
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,560
The one who gets burned in the end...

486
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,690
is going to be you, Manager.

487
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,900
So...

488
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,300
Just bury it.

489
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,170
The whole thing.

490
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,420
Wait, but...

491
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,920
Why do bean sprouts have heads?

492
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,890
Wouldn't it be easier if they didn't so we didn't have to pick them off?

493
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,459
We're only picking them off because we're making braised monkfish.

494
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,969
The heads are more nutritious, you know.

495
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,970
Really?

496
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,270
Are they really more nutritious?

497
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,409
No part of a bean sprout goes to waste.

498
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,909
They're easy to grow, too.

499
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:44,480
The head and the stem, they're both full of nutrients.

500
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,979
Like Yeong Rye?

501
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,379
What does Yeong Rye have to do with this?

502
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,389
Yes, that's just like her, isn't it?

503
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,489
She's smart and so good at what she does.

504
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,789
And she has such a great personality.

505
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:02,429
She's a good daughter and very devoted to her siblings.

506
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,759
Gosh, even that stiff Mr. Han Gi Bok...

507
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,730
is wrapped around her little finger, right?

508
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,200
There isn't a single thing to dislike about that girl.

509
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,670
You think so?

510
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,180
- So, speaking of which... - Yes?

511
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,209
I'll be blunt. What about my Jae Pil for her?

512
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,579
What? Where in the world did that come from?

513
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,149
Why bring up Jae Pil all of a sudden?

514
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:29,689
Come on, can a man and a woman really be just friends?

515
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,459
They've known each other for ages.

516
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,960
Always attached at the hip, there has to be something going on.

517
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,230
Everyone at the hospital already thinks they're a couple.

518
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,630
Well, I guess I can see why people would think that.

519
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,139
No, this is terrible for our Yeong Rye.

520
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,840
It could ruin all her marriage prospects.

521
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,939
This is no laughing matter.

522
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,850
That's why we should set them up before that happens.

523
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,949
I mean, honestly, since we're on the subject...

524
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,389
My Jae Pil is quite a catch, wouldn't you say?

525
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,989
He's well-mannered and handsome.

526
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,620
He has a stable career.

527
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,429
The only drawback, if there is one, is that his family went bankrupt.

528
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,900
That's not a drawback at all.

529
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,399
Hey, but even if we agree on it, is that going to make it happen?

530
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,970
They're the ones who have to want it.

531
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,209
If a couple is meant to be, they'll find each other.

532
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,839
And if they're not, nothing you do will make it happen.

533
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,139
It's like how a doctor can't heal himself.

534
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,249
So anyway, you're on board, right?

535
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,779
Never mind being on board.

536
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,220
Didn't you have an appointment? Shouldn't you be going?

537
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,519
Oh, my gosh, you're right. When did it get so late?

538
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,389
Oh, no. what do I do? I'm so late.

539
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,029
- Hurry up and go. Goodness. - Okay, I'm going!

540
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,790
Anyway, I'm taking that as a yes, okay?

541
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,340
Those two?

542
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,229
Sook, put this away inside.

543
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,859
And boil a pot of water for me.

544
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,030
Okay.

545
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,769
Excuse me.

546
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,699
- Yes, please come in. - Welcome.

547
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,400
- Are you here for a meal? - No, I'm not.

548
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,740
This is...

549
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,110
Well, then.

550
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,980
Wait, what is all that?

551
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,579
What is all this?

552
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,650
- Were we expecting something? - Are you sure this is for us?

553
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,590
- I have no idea. Why would he... - Who sent it?

554
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,960
- Why did he just leave it here? - What is it?

555
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,959
- Bananas cost a fortune! Gosh. - What is all this?

556
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,260
Oh, my goodness.

557
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,430
Who ordered all this?

558
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,070
Are you here for a meal?

559
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,470
Ho Suk.

560
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:02,979
Auntie.

561
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,810
- Who are you? - Who is it?

562
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,120
It's me, Jong Hee. From a long time ago.

563
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,020
I was a close friend of Yeong Rye's at Cheongah Bus.

564
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,490
Wait, if you're Jong Hee...

565
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,159
The one who used to visit us all the time...

566
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,590
Yes, that's right. I'm that Jong Hee.

567
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,130
Oh, my goodness! I can't believe it.

568
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,470
Dear! Oh, my!

569
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,869
My dear child. It really is you.

570
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:34,869
My goodness, how have you been all this time?

571
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:38,309
We didn't know if you were alive. You could have at least sent word.

572
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,679
Our Yeong Rye was so worried, waiting for word.

573
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,780
I'm sorry.

574
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,849
I'm so very sorry, Auntie.

575
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:46,219
Goodness. I'm just so glad you're alive.

576
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,649
I'm so glad to see you're alive.

577
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:50,119
- My, you've gotten even prettier. - I'm home!

578
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,160
Me too.

579
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,900
Yeong Bae, Yeong Mi?

580
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,670
Hey, kids.

581
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,640
They've grown so much, haven't they?

582
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,510
What? Jong Hee?

583
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,980
Daeyang Group's only daughter is the Seo Jong Hee we know?

584
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:23,160
I was so shocked, my jaw just about hit the floor.

585
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,660
At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.

586
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:30,430
But it was definitely her.

587
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,230
I'm hearing it now, and I still can't believe it.

588
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,900
How could Jong Hee...

589
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,039
My goodness.

590
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,540
Apparently, she saved her life, and she adopted her.

591
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,110
It's like something out of a drama, isn't it?

592
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,450
That's so Seo Jong Hee.

593
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,789
Yesterday, I was in such a daze, I just couldn't process any of it.

594
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,290
That's why I couldn't tell you.

595
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:11,770
Jong Hee.

596
00:45:11,771 --> 00:45:13,370
Yeong Rye. You're here.

597
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,369
Jong Hee, you...

598
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,379
What are you doing here?

599
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,110
What's going on?

600
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,950
My goodness.

601
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,920
Well, look who it is.

602
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:31,519
It is. It really is our Seo Jong Hee.

603
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,130
Yes, it's me.

604
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,660
You rotten brat!

605
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,829
Where have you been all this time?

606
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:39,999
I know, right?

607
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,100
I'm sorry.

608
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,900
You made it.

609
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,540
You're here?

610
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:49,910
I told her to go upstairs and rest, but she insisted on helping out.

611
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:53,150
And, she's so quick, that Jong Hee.

612
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,379
When the dinner rush hit...

613
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,449
I don't know what I would've done without her today.

614
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,989
Still, Mom, why would you have her doing this...

615
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,220
I begged her to let me.

616
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:05,360
If I want to earn my supper, I have to do something, right?

617
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:08,930
You haven't eaten, have you? You can eat with me.

618
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,460
Just a minute.

619
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,010
Go on.

620
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:27,149
And about your driver...

621
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,249
Don't worry.

622
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,820
I told him you're old friends who helped me out a long time ago.

623
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,490
He's tight-lipped.

624
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,490
That's a relief, then.

625
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,789
I'll be going. You head inside. I'll wait until you're in.

626
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,129
But I'm okay.

627
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,329
Go on, hurry.

628
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:41,489
Okay.

629
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,329
Okay, I'm going. Get home safe.

630
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,330
Yes.

631
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:47,530
- Go. - Okay.

632
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,170
Take care.

633
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,650
Seo Jong Hee!

634
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,190
Yeong Sik?

635
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,190
It really is you.

636
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,139
I called the house, and Yeong Bae...

637
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,109
said you were here, but I had to see it for myself.

638
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,210
I'm glad you did.

639
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,610
You haven't changed much, though.

640
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,420
Or maybe you have. You're even more handsome now.

641
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,590
You, on the other hand, have changed so much.

642
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,790
If I'd seen you on the street, I wouldn't have recognised you.

643
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:45,990
Right?

644
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:47,890
That's what I think, too.

645
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,560
I keep getting surprised when I look in the mirror.

646
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,570
I even wonder if it's really me.

647
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,810
I always told myself I had to see you again someday.

648
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,380
You're my lifesaver, you know.

649
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,480
A lifesaver? Come on.

650
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,020
What do you mean?

651
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,390
If it hadn't been for you that day,

652
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,820
I never would have even thought about coming to Seoul.

653
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:18,390
We're not even close to even.

654
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,429
Remember when my mother had her accident?

655
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,459
It was thanks to you that we could restart our business.

656
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,660
Don't you remember?

657
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,770
Once I start making some real money,

658
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,199
the first thing I'm going to do is pay you back.

659
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,440
Forget about it.

660
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:33,270
Then treat me to a meal instead. Maybe 100 times?

661
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,410
These last few days have felt like a dream.

662
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,480
Yeong Rye, her mother,

663
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,790
Yeong Bae, Yeong Mi, Jeong Bun, and Ho Suk.

664
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,160
And on top of that, you too.

665
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:52,960
I'm getting to see all the people I've missed so much.

666
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,700
What?

667
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,970
Are you sure you've seen everyone you wanted to see?

668
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,210
Isn't there someone else?

669
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,949
Gosh, you.

670
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,480
You've always had a knack for seeing right through people.

671
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,020
Do you know what I envied most about Yeong Rye?

672
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,360
Having a big brother like you.

673
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,470
I've taken up way too much of your time.

674
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,630
And I plan on taking up a lot more.

675
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,400
Should we get going?

676
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,220
There was a call from the house a little while ago.

677
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:53,990
The Chairwoman has arrived.

678
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,890
- My mom? - Yes.

679
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,540
Thank you for the ride.

680
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:22,749
Mom.

681
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,119
You're back.

682
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,690
What are you doing here so early? I thought you were coming tomorrow.

683
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,319
That was the plan, but I was exhausted.

684
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,960
So I just hitched a ride with the President of Shinil.

685
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,400
You should've called. I'd have sent the driver right away.

686
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,899
But that car outside...

687
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,600
You saw it?

688
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,469
Today is a perfect example.

689
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,639
It would've been much better if you had your own car.

690
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,339
Stop refusing and take it. It's your gift.

691
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,909
Mom, I told you I'm fine.

692
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,650
Just use it. It's a dangerous world out there.

693
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:55,979
You know what they say. Strike while the iron is hot.

694
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,979
I just finished interviewing a driver for your new car.

695
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,050
Introduce yourself. This is who you'll be driving.

696
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:07,059
A pleasure to meet you. My name is Kim Jeong Sik.

697
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,530
You can just call me Driver Kim.

698
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,960
Gosh.

699
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:14,469
By any chance...

700
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:16,240
Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you.

701
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,970
Yes.

702
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,279
It's just that you look so much like an old friend of mine.

703
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,439
For a second there, I thought you were her.

704
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,449
But that's impossible, right?

705
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,280
I look forward to working with you.

706
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,780
Right.

707
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,020
Tomorrow, at the Operia Hotel. It's Sungwoo Group's second son.

708
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:38,219
You're just meeting for coffee, so don't feel too much pressure.

709
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,790
And if it goes well, all the better.

710
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,179
I've polished it to a perfect shine.

711
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,779
To make sure it's worthy of its beautiful passenger.

712
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,880
Get in.

713
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,720
It is you, isn't it?

714
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,359
Your name was...

715
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,289
Seo something.

716
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,400
Seo Jong Hee.

717
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,530
That's right, Seo Jong Hee.

718
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:54,330
Ms. Seo. How in the world?

719
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,400
Gosh. What a life you're living.

720
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,099
It's seriously like something out of a movie.

721
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,310
To be honest, yesterday, I wasn't completely sure it was you.

722
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:05,179
But seeing you today, it's unmistakable.

723
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:09,050
It's the eyes and that slender jawline.

724
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:11,380
I knew it. I mean...

725
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:14,989
I've got a pretty sharp eye for a guy.

726
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,290
I'm sure you do.

727
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:19,120
To scope out women to hit on.

728
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:22,060
Did you have to be so blunt?

729
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,760
How embarrassing.

730
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,300
I've changed a lot.

731
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,199
Please, just forget the old Driver Kim,

732
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,200
the one who was so unbearably flaky.

733
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,510
I will. On one condition.

734
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,710
You have to forget my past, too.

735
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,919
Especially in front of my mom.

736
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,620
Of course. I figured as much.

737
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,820
Don't you worry. Once I put my mind to something,

738
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,620
I can be incredibly tight-lipped.

739
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,830
So, the Operia Hotel, right?

740
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,630
Ma'am?

741
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,439
What brings you here?

742
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,840
You're so busy.

743
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:09,979
Well, I was going to head straight to the hospital after work.

744
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:14,049
But I got called by a regular client who lives around here.

745
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,119
She insisted today was the only day she was free.

746
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,149
She was begging me to please just stop by.

747
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,120
She pleaded so much that I had to come.

748
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:23,690
Here.

749
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,559
Could you take this to Jae Pil for me?

750
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,559
It's a change of clothes, underwear, socks, and other things.

751
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,029
He's completely out, so I'm sure he's desperate.

752
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,030
Yes, I'll do that.

753
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:37,139
I'm not on the closing shift today, so I can go a little earlier.

754
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,370
Really?

755
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,740
That's even better then.

756
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:42,909
In that case,

757
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,109
since you're going anyway,

758
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:47,679
ask him to at least buy you a meal at the hospital cafeteria.

759
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,349
The food there is actually pretty good.

760
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,349
They even serve Western-style food sometimes.

761
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:52,649
No, it's okay.

762
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,289
Jae Pil's busy. I couldn't possibly.

763
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,920
Busy? What are you talking about?

764
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,859
He's busy.

765
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,629
Right, he's busy, but...

766
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,489
Ask him anyway.

767
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:04,899
I'm sure he'll treat you. Of course, he will.

768
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,700
It's not like you're a stranger. It's you, Yeong Rye.

769
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:13,239
All right, in that case... I'll make sure to get a good meal.

770
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,240
Don't you worry.

771
00:55:14,241 --> 00:55:16,109
Okay, good.

772
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:18,279
All right, that's settled.

773
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,649
You'd better get going.

774
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,210
Okay, thank you.

775
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,720
All right.

776
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,330
(Ms. Seo Jong Hee)

777
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,760
Mr. Jo Hyeon U?

778
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:07,390
Yes.

779
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,190
You must be Ms. Seo Jong Hee.

780
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,460
I've heard a lot about you.

781
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,340
Please, have a seat.

782
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:46,630
How radiant.

783
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,200
The colour...

784
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,500
Is she a foreigner?

785
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,490
I'll be on my way.

786
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,889
How about...

787
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:14,959
Maybe next time, we could catch a movie...

788
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,089
No.

789
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,030
I'm afraid I'll be busy that day.

790
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,800
Well, then.

791
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:44,460
I didn't even say when.

792
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,840
So, I take it you weren't impressed?

793
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,180
The guy.

794
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,109
I could tell just by looking at him that he was a bit of a bore.

795
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:13,389
You know the type. A real hothouse flower.

796
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:16,319
Anyway, he clearly grew up without facing any hardship.

797
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,390
- But there's just something... - Can we please drive in silence?

798
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,560
Yes, ma'am.

799
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,340
(Yeonseo University Hospital)

800
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,850
Are you sure you've seen everyone you wanted to see?

801
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,380
Isn't there someone else?

802
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,690
Driver, please turn the car around.

803
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,760
There's somewhere I need to make a quick stop.

804
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:55,490
Yes, ma'am.

805
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,170
Han Jae Pil.

806
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,740
Yeong Rye?

807
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,680
Go on, I'll catch up.

808
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,780
What's up?

809
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,150
This is for you.

810
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,319
- What's this? - It's an errand from your mom.

811
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,019
She said it's your clothes and some other things.

812
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,749
She said she's going to be late today.

813
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:58,260
It was urgent, so she asked if I could drop it off for you.

814
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,589
Wait, why would she...

815
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:03,759
I still have plenty left, so there was no rush.

816
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,059
Really?

817
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,100
Why'd she do that then? Maybe she got mixed up.

818
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,769
Wait a minute. You didn't look inside, did you?

819
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:12,840
What?

820
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,370
I mean, you know...

821
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,639
You know, my underwear...

822
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,009
Hey!

823
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:21,909
What do you take me for, a pervert?

824
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,479
Why would I look at that? Seriously.

825
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,880
You're ridiculous, you know that?

826
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,550
If you didn't, fine. Why are you getting all red in the face?

827
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:32,860
You totally looked.

828
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,090
- I said I didn't look! - Why'd you look at my underwear?

829
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,129
I didn't! What is your problem?

830
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:41,200
Gosh. Let go! That hurts.

831
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,369
Seriously.

832
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:45,399
Stop with the nonsense and just buy me a meal.

833
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,740
Ms. Man Ok said you should treat me to a meal today.

834
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:50,810
Hey, your eyebrow.

835
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:55,950
I told you to get a haircut. Why trim your eyebrows instead?

836
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,850
You're such a mess.

837
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:00,990
So, why'd you look?

838
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,760
All right. I'll buy you a meal. Let's go.

839
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:15,929
Should I park here? Or...

840
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:16,940
No, let's go.

841
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,910
I'm all done here.

842
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,879
Do you know how much plant-based protein is in these beans?

843
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,019
For bone density, breast cancer, vascular health... You know?

844
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,919
It's a world-famous superfood.

845
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,060
So why won't you eat them?

846
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,759
My mom made me eat rice and beans so much when I was a kid.

847
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,129
I'm just sick of them, okay?

848
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:44,399
Look who's talking.

849
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,030
You're a grown man, and you still can't handle spicy food?

850
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,600
You're such a baby. Little kid, Han Jae Pil.

851
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:54,810
Hey, for your information, I can handle spicy food.

852
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:57,480
I just don't like it, that's all.

853
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,010
Want me to prove it?

854
01:02:01,011 --> 01:02:03,149
No, it's fine.

855
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:06,080
Don't force it and fill up on water. Here.

856
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:08,049
Just eat these anchovies instead.

857
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:09,390
Here. Eat up.

858
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,420
All right.

859
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,430
I listen to you well.

860
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,010
I've thought about it, and I don't think it's a good idea.

861
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:30,010
I'm the one who dumped him, remember?

862
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,410
Jae Pil.

863
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:36,510
Yes?

864
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,820
Actually...

865
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:41,750
The other day...

866
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:43,859
Jae Pil! Code red!

867
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:44,960
Code red.

868
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:49,389
Chang Ui is flipping out again.

869
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,399
He's calling everyone in.

870
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,360
- Gosh! - Hurry up.

871
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:54,869
I'm so sorry. I got to go.

872
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,099
Yes, it's fine. Go on.

873
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,799
Finish all this before you leave, got it?

874
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,809
- All of it, okay? - Yes, just go.

875
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,369
I'll treat you to something good next time. Sorry.

876
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:03,740
- Okay. - Sorry!

877
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,819
Good work today.

878
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,020
Yes, I'll see you tomorrow then. Have a good night.

879
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,090
Right.

880
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,930
Gosh. Look at the talent here.

881
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:06,499
They weren't kidding when they said Seoul is the place to be.

882
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:07,829
It really is something else.

883
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:09,670
And Gangnam is the best of the best.

884
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,940
Hey, isn't that Choi Jeong Bun?

885
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:22,110
Jeong Bun!

886
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,280
It is. Choi Jeong Bun.

887
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,219
You know, I wasn't sure if it was you at first.

888
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,520
But of all the...

889
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,419
places for us to...

890
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:34,960
I mean, I was just passing by,

891
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:38,159
and I saw your exact look-alike walk right out.

892
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,300
Gosh. How have you been?

893
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,700
You're looking even prettier.

894
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:46,399
You and I...

895
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,909
I don't think we're on good terms to be saying hello like that.

896
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,980
What? Come on, even so...

897
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,579
You can't just walk away like this.

898
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,480
We go way back.

899
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,650
How about we go grab tea or something?

900
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,659
If I had time to sit around and chit-chat with you,

901
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:12,159
I'd rather go home, wash my feet, and just pass out.

902
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,160
Don't you agree?

903
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:14,670
We're done here.

904
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:24,080
Talk about an ice queen.

905
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:28,150
That just makes her more charming.

906
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,120
Jeong Bun!

907
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,250
I'm here.

908
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:31,580
Yes? What is it?

909
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:33,880
Mister, who are you?

910
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,349
And who might you be?

911
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:38,219
I'm Su Jin. Choi Su Jin.

912
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,449
Okay, Su Jin.

913
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:41,849
You shouldn't wander the market all by yourself.

914
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,119
Where are your mom and dad?

915
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,189
My mom's over there working.

916
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,720
And I don't have a dad.

917
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,160
You don't have a dad?

918
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,069
Why? Where'd he go?

919
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,939
No, I just don't have one.

920
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,940
I've never had one.

921
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,040
Dear.

922
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:03,269
- Su Jin! - Mom!

923
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,280
What?

924
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,779
I already told you to get lost. So why did you follow me here...

925
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:13,749
to bother someone else's child? What is wrong with you?

926
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,649
Bothering her? I was doing nothing. I was just asking who she was.

927
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:17,690
Save it.

928
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,459
Just go, okay?

929
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,030
Just hurry up and go!

930
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:24,959
Seriously, what is your problem?

931
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,329
Why are you being like this to a customer who just wants a meal?

932
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:30,200
I'm not serving you, so hurry up and get out!

933
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,700
Do you not hear me?

934
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:36,639
Just the sight of you makes my skin crawl.

935
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,509
I said, get out!

936
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:41,980
Gosh, all right, I'll go. I'm going, okay?

937
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,120
No need to get so worked up.

938
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:51,490
I'm sorry Mommy yelled like that.

Yeong Rye.

941
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:07,140
There's a flower basket at the door. I think it's for you.

942
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:11,710
Who in the world would send me this?

943
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,749
I wonder who it's from.

944
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,079
Hey, don't you think Jae Pil sent it?

945
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,720
Who else but Jae Pil would send something like this?

946
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,719
You're right. It must be Han Jae Pil.

947
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:25,320
How many flowers is this? Gosh, there are so many.

948
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:28,860
There's no way Jae Pil would send something like this.

949
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:31,700
You're right. I'm the one who sent them.

950
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:35,870
It wasn't Jae Pil.

951
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:38,040
You?

952
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:48,249
I mean, why are so many clients asking for her these days?

953
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,079
At this rate, she'll make manager in no time.

954
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,520
I know, right?

955
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,690
Maybe she has some kind of special trade secret or something?

956
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:56,690
Let's go.

957
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,229
I can't begin until you tell me what style you want.

958
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:09,729
I won't say a thing even if you make it a choppy mess.

959
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:12,339
So, please, just do whatever you'd like.

960
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:13,640
I'm telling you,

961
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:15,809
I'll be your personal model.

962
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:17,479
Go ahead and try a revolutionary new style.

963
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,909
What if I take you up on that and just shave it all off?

964
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:23,079
I'm handsome enough that it wouldn't matter.

965
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,380
My looks don't rely on my hair, you know.

966
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,220
Well, you're not wrong, so I can't even argue.

967
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,090
Honestly,

968
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,290
you have a really nice head shape.

969
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,460
I suppose I do.

970
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,529
But you know, Yeong Rye, you seem to have changed a lot.

971
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,639
I have?

972
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,840
How so?

973
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:49,340
You remember how we talked about the right to pursue happiness?

974
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:53,240
Now, it feels like...

975
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:56,350
It feels like you're truly living it.

976
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,590
You smile more, and you're quicker and more confident with your words.

977
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,889
Now it seems like I don't need to be...

978
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:06,559
your Daddy-Long-Legs anymore, and I'm a little disappointed.

979
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,459
I've still got a long way to go.

980
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:10,459
I'll still be sending out an SOS from time to time.

981
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,360
So, please, keep being my Daddy-Long-Legs.

982
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,500
No!

983
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,639
I took too much off.

984
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,409

985
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:22,410
Hey.

986
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,580
I'm kidding.

987
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,879
You said you wouldn't say a word. How many complaints was that?

988
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,650
I was just playing along.

989
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:35,220
So, what time do you get off, Ms. Koh Yeong Rye?

990
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:40,189
I'm not on the closing shift, so I get off in a few hours.

991
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:41,190
Really?

992
01:11:41,191 --> 01:11:43,359
In that case, should I wait and treat you to dinner?

993

Someplace expensive and fancy.

994
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,129
I would absolutely love to,

995
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:48,469
but I have other plans.

996
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,470
You do?

997
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,400
What kind of plans?

998
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:29,839
Do you have a death wish?

999
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,639

Her vitals are relatively stable, but...

1006
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,999
I think there's a chance she sustained a head injury.

1007
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,029
Right, I've been briefed. Thank you.

01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:27,469
- Take care. - You too.

01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:29,600
- Let's get an IV line started. - Yes, Doctor.

1010
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,359
Ma'am, you need to lie back down.

1011
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,859
Ma'am, please relax. It's okay. You're in the hospital.

1012
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:57,090
- Ma'am, please calm... - Ma'am, calm down.

Get yourself checked out before you go.

1017

You haven't changed one bit.

1018
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:58,690
You're still as good at scaring people as ever.

1019
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,209
Thank you so much.

1020
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,570
