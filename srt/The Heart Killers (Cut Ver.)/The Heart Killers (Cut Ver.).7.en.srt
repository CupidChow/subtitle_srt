1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,600
Why don’t you try telling him the truth?

2
00:00:06,942 --> 00:00:10,184
See if he wouldn’t shoot you dead immediately.

3
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:12,320
It’s been a good night.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,133
I don’t want it to end.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,817
But after that,

6
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:17,930
you’re the only one I’ll make any promises with.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,382
You’ll be in all of my plans, Kant.

8
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:23,631
Babe!

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,074
Is there anyone suspicious in your life right now?

10
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,175
Fadel.

11
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:31,642
They’re the snitches.

12
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:34,553
I think… I’m in love with you.

13
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:46,193
You think they’ll let you live
once I get those two arrested?

14
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:47,910
Why don’t you try telling him the truth?

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,367
See if he wouldn’t shoot you dead immediately.

16
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,908
Hitmen are hitmen.

17
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:54,665
If you want to refuse,

18
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:56,995
you might need to think about your brother.

19
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:04,715
Where have you been, Kant?

20
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:15,453
I had to meet up with some client.

21
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:19,100
Bison has been waiting for ages.

22
00:01:19,658 --> 00:01:20,712
It’s no problem, Babe.

23
00:01:20,712 --> 00:01:22,431
I don’t have to be anywhere anyway.

24
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:24,816
Plus, it’s fun talking to you about books.

25
00:01:25,777 --> 00:01:27,888
You should have let me know you’d come over.

26
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,110
I could have hurried back home sooner.

27
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:31,978
I wanted it to be a surprise.

28
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,461
What?

29
00:01:33,647 --> 00:01:35,142
We’re dating now.

30
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,629
Do I need your permission to be here?

31
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:40,534
Of course not.

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,888
What’s with you today?

33
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:43,972
You seem especially clingy, you know?

34
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:47,645
I should probably go

35
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:49,370
since you guys are in your own world.

36
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,359
Am I air to you now or what?

37
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,561
See you, Bison.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,293
I’ll recommend some more books later.

39
00:01:57,293 --> 00:01:58,205
See you, Babe.

40
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:58,919
Yeah.

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,313
I’m glad you get along with him.

42
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,366
It’s good he gets to talk about books with someone.

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,340
Your brother is my brother.

44
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,889
We’re dating.

45
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,095
I’ll love who you love.

46
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:22,393
You’re really being weird today.

47
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,619
You’re way more affectionate than usual.

48
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,142
Just tell me what you want.

49
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:28,017
Nope.

50
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,362
Tell me!

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,877
Ow, ow!

52
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:33,832
Tell me!

53
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:36,104
Will you tell me now?

54
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:38,018
I will. I will!

55
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:39,406
Alright, I will, I will!

56
00:02:43,744 --> 00:02:45,093
Tomorrow is my birthday.

57
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,132
Why didn’t you tell me sooner?

58
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,121
I would have gotten you something.

59
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,629
I don’t want anything.

60
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:57,129
I just want to spend time with you on my birthday.

61
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,700
That’s cute.

62
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:13,786
Hey.

63
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:18,238
Hey, you’re gonna bruise me.

64
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:21,752
Tell me what you want for your birthday.

65
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,693
I already told you.

66
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:31,200
Can I stay over?

67
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:36,603
Are you expecting something, penguin?

68
00:03:37,373 --> 00:03:38,801
Whatever you’re willing to give me.

69
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,791
Hey, who’s that?

70
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:03,328
Fadel!

71
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:05,937
What if my dad sees us?

72
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,009
Why?

73
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:09,876
You scared of him?

74
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,369
This is no time for kisses.

75
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:22,589
That’s not even a kiss.

76
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:24,258
It’s just a peck.

77
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,400
A kiss… would be this.

78
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:30,978
Hold on.

79
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:35,767
Why are you here?

80
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:37,452
You could have let me know you were coming.

81
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:39,569
We’re dating.

82
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:41,188
Can’t I just pop by and see you?

83
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:43,849
What is this?

84
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:46,024
You’re being weirdly nice.

85
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:48,125
What’s with you?

86
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,839
You don’t like me being nice.

87
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:52,993
You complain when I’m cold.

88
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,883
What do you even want?

89
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:58,203
It’s not like that.

90
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,473
I’m just not used to you like this.

91
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:02,494
You don’t sound like you, you know?

92
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,410
Don’t you ever think

93
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
that I’m only like this

94
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:11,672
because of you?

95
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:22,881
Hey, what’s this?

96
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:26,607
Hello, sir.

97
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,553
Hey.

98
00:06:29,553 --> 00:06:30,903
You’re late, Dad.

99
00:06:30,903 --> 00:06:32,544
I just got back from returning a car to some customer.

100
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:34,775
Whatever were you guys doing just now?

101
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,200
What?

102
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,560
It was nothing.

103
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,320
He was just wiping off something from my face.

104
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:41,706
You’re here so late.

105
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:42,653
Where are you guys going?

106
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:43,700
Oh…

107
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:45,539
We’re not going anywhere.

108
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:47,395
I’m just staying over.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,263
That’s good.

110
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:53,721
Just stay over so I don’t have to worry.

111
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:58,115
Come help me carry some stuff before you go to bed.

112
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:00,250
He’s not here to work for you, Dad.

113
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,456
Let me do it.

114
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:02,621
He has to.

115
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:04,289
I want to get to know him.

116
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:07,513
Of course.

117
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:15,428
Hey.

118
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,037
Why didn’t you tell me you wanted to stay over?

119
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,838
It’s only normal

120
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:33,136
for boyfriends to cuddle to sleep, right?

121
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:57,687
Well.

122
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,110
Good thing you’re here.

123
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,409
Put these in the box.

124
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:01,306
Yes, sir.

125
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,595
Hey.

126
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:13,162
So I take it you’re serious about him, then?

127
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:17,611
What do you mean?

128
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:21,052
You’re really dating him, aren’t you?

129
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:23,189
He’s not being led on, is he?

130
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:28,006
Of course not.

131
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:30,645
Good.

132
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,385
I was worried since he made the first move and all that.

133
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,163
I won’t have to worry anymore.

134
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:39,561
I don’t know anything about dating boys,

135
00:08:40,615 --> 00:08:41,841
but if you’re gonna date him,

136
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:43,241
I hope it’s steady.

137
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,852
My son may talk big and annoy people,

138
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:51,220
but when he loves, he does with his whole heart.

139
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:53,318
Just like his old man does.

140
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:02,408
Hey.

141
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,533
Is something on your mind?

142
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:08,632
I didn’t know you smoke.

143
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:15,764
I do sometimes

144
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:17,788
when I have something to think about.

145
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,513
What is it?

146
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:23,513
You can talk to me.

147
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:26,686
I want to help any way I can.

148
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,586
It’s nothing serious.

149
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:33,155
Just work and family and stuff like that.

150
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,663
Never mind me.

151
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:39,763
It’s your birthday, after all.

152
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:42,470
Not yet.

153
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,592
That’s tomorrow.

154
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:46,799
Tomorrow has come.

155
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,089
It’s past midnight.

156
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:48,912
Really?

157
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:49,524
Yeah.

158
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,127
Look.

159
00:10:58,772 --> 00:10:59,728
Here.

160
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:02,719
I know it’s not exactly a cake.

161
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,061
But you should get to blow out a candle.

162
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:08,125
I’ll take it.

163
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,174
Make a wish first.

164
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:15,987
But I don’t wish for anything.

165
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,837
Having a boyfriend like you is amazing enough.

166
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,344
I’m really so lucky to have met you.

167
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:27,585
No matter what happens,

168
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:30,340
I’ll keep all the good memories.

169
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,190
I love you, Kant.

170
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:50,429
I love you, too, Bison.

171
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,564
Smells great.

172
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:21,901
Smells like you.

173
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:24,013
That ain’t me.

174
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,942
It’s the fabric softener.

175
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,764
Soft like you.

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,900
I think something’s wrong with you.

177
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:35,097
It’s not like you to talk so sweet.

178
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:39,661
Nothing’s wrong with me.

179
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:47,006
Meeting you has brought out a different side in me, is all.

180
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:49,193
Didn’t you notice?

181
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:51,796
I’m happier.

182
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:53,047
I smile more.

183
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:55,808
You’re right.

184
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:58,849
You were like a vicious dog before this.

185
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:00,039
You even beat me up.

186
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,601
I should get the credits

187
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,710
for bringing out this sweet side in you.

188
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:10,628
Hey.

189
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:11,878
What are you getting so close for?

190
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,921
I smell like gasoline.

191
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:17,750
I don’t mind.

192
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,123
I love it.

193
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:20,442
It’s your smell.

194
00:13:21,186 --> 00:13:22,995
Something must be seriously wrong with you

195
00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:24,878
if you love the smell of gasoline.

196
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,713
You know some people are addicted to that?

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,770
Do they?

198
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,508
I’m an addict, then.

199
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:35,802
I love it.

200
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:42,608
Guess it’s incurable.

201
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,539
Stop it.

202
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,316
I’m gonna go get a shower.

203
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:49,682
I can’t stand myself.

204
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,206
Hey.

205
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:57,187
I said I’m gonna get a shower.

206
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:09,505
Happy?

207
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:11,718
Happy now?

208
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,856
Be right back.

209
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,405
Style.

210
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,394
What’s with you?

211
00:14:24,642 --> 00:14:26,244
You’re so weird today.

212
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:30,142
No.

213
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,123
I just want to ask

214
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,945
if you want to go on a date tomorrow.

215
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,611
Let’s ask Kant and Bison.

216
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:41,504
It’s Bison’s birthday tomorrow.

217
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:44,519
Of course.

218
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:46,410
Let me buy him a gift.

219
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:47,919
What does your brother like?

220
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,913
I don’t know.

221
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:53,603
You don’t have to buy him anything.

222
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:56,060
Leave that to Kant.

223
00:14:57,547 --> 00:14:58,899
I don’t mind you giving me something, though.

224
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:01,665
When’s your birthday?

225
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:02,910
On Christmas.

226
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:06,707
Lucky you.

227
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:08,788
That’s a good day to be born on.

228
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:11,153
I’ll be your Santa Claus

229
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:13,414
sneaking in your house and leaving a present for you.

230
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:15,784
What will you give me?

231
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:42,986
(Fadel.)

232
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:45,491
(They’re the snitches.)

233
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,306
Wait here.

234
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,123
Follow me.

235
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:17,209
You take care of Style.

236
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,357
I’ll deal with Fadel.

237
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:19,538
Yeah.

238
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:21,045
I saw him running over there.

239
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:21,824
I’ll get him.

240
00:16:27,525 --> 00:16:28,719
Be careful.

241
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:34,288
Hey, don’t make it sound like I’m leaving for war.

242
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:35,700
These are BB guns.

243
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:37,197
I’ll be alright.

244
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:42,536
I don’t know.

245
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:45,545
It’s just that the getup and the props

246
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:49,518
make me feel like we’re lovers in the trenches.

247
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:52,119
You know, like, we’re going to die together and all that.

248
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:53,772
Oh.

249
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:55,906
You’re sure full of imagination.

250
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:58,464
But you know,

251
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:00,600
even in the trenches,

252
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:02,039
we won’t die.

253
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:06,039
Because we’ll fight through it hand in hand.

254
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:09,732
Well?

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,866
Does that add to your lovers-in-the-trenches imagery?

256
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,636
You’re so cool.

257
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,137
You gotta protect me, then.

258
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:19,914
Don’t let anyone harm me.

259
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:25,526
Don’t worry.

260
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,168
I’ll be your shield.

261
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:51,222
I can handle it.

262
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,356
No.

263
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:55,216
Kant has to deal with me.

264
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,275
He started all this, after all.

265
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:01,466
What do you mean?

266
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:03,941
What I mean is…

267
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,109
Because he hit on my brother,

268
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:08,678
you got to know me.

269
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:12,175
He started all of this.

270
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,015
What did you think I mean?

271
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,723
No.

272
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:18,751
Nothing.

273
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:21,234
But you gotta let me play, too.

274
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:24,577
You’re not my bodyguard, you know?

275
00:18:25,878 --> 00:18:27,735
I know you’re good at this.

276
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:30,703
But I ain’t no loser, either.

277
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:32,843
How’d you know I’m good at this?

278
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:33,997
Well…

279
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:36,748
I can tell from how you hold your gun.

280
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:39,741
It’s obvious you’re a professional.

281
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:46,228
Professional what?

282
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:49,819
Pro…

283
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:53,617
Professional BB gun shooter.

284
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,334
I can’t help but get protective over my boyfriend.

285
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:01,287
How about this?

286
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:03,856
You watch my six.

287
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:06,240
Make sure no one shoots me in the back.

288
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,530
Can I trust you to do that?

289
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:18,545
You can trust me.

290
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:21,633
Okay.

291
00:19:23,182 --> 00:19:24,403
Don’t let me down.

292
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:55,646
Be careful!

293
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:47,996
What are you doing?

294
00:20:55,277 --> 00:20:56,607
Do you want to spook him or something?

295
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:00,221
Don’t forget what our plan is.

296
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,579
2 NIGHTS AGO

297
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:18,245
Congratulations to our winners.

298
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:19,481
Let’s give it up for them!

299
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,478
Congratulations!

300
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:29,216
Thank you.

301
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:47,700
Say it.

302
00:21:48,103 --> 00:21:49,995
Say you told me so.

303
00:21:50,553 --> 00:21:51,789
I’m ready to hear it.

304
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:55,450
What would that do?

305
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,587
I was responsible for this whole mess!

306
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:06,800
I told Kant to ask Style to take you out

307
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,720
just so you get out of my way.

308
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:14,870
You hired him?

309
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,374
Fadel, I didn’t.

310
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:19,142
But it was my idea.

311
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,977
Kant handled the rest,

312
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:22,964
and then Style just came along and—

313
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:35,924
Fadel, listen to me.

314
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:37,313
I’m your brother.

315
00:22:38,614 --> 00:22:39,834
I am your brother.

316
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:41,550
I trust you more than anyone.

317
00:22:43,192 --> 00:22:44,956
And you did that to me?

318
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,454
How could you?

319
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,956
I just wanted to see you happy.

320
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,835
I wanted to see you in love with someone.

321
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:52,522
Is that wrong?

322
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:53,802
Well, look around!

323
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,967
Look what love does to you.

324
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:59,853
I don’t need anyone to tell me how to live my life.

325
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,903
I was happy.

326
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:05,264
Fadel, I’m sorry.

327
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:06,308
I’ll handle everything.

328
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:07,288
Don’t say another word.

329
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:08,310
Not right now.

330
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,773
Fadel, listen to me!

331
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:11,143
I said shut up!

332
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:19,138
I’ll make you pay for this later.

333
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:22,761
But for now, we’re on the same team.

334
00:23:24,124 --> 00:23:26,052
We need to take care of them first.

335
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:29,814
Do you want me to kill them now?

336
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:32,950
No.

337
00:23:35,398 --> 00:23:36,613
That’s not good enough.

338
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:39,642
Then what are you gonna do?

339
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:42,422
Do what they did to us.

340
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,374
Make them fall in love with us.

341
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:50,578
Head over heels.

342
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,384
That’s when we kill them.

343
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,870
Trust me…

344
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:09,637
Nothing hurts more than betrayal.

345
00:24:12,302 --> 00:24:13,790
Be patient.

346
00:24:14,813 --> 00:24:16,509
They think we’re fools.

347
00:24:17,129 --> 00:24:18,278
So that’s what we’ll be.

348
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:20,294
Just pretend you’re crazy about him.

349
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,594
And I meant crazy in love,

350
00:24:23,935 --> 00:24:25,075
not crazy like a psycho.

351
00:24:25,075 --> 00:24:26,964
Yeah. I know that.

352
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:29,371
I’m done playing this.

353
00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:30,583
Kill me.

354
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,575
Hey.

355
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,127
Hey.

356
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:48,384
I’m dead.

357
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:49,496
Sorry.

358
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,986
It’s alright.

359
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:52,100
No need to apologize.

360
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:53,940
I’ll handle them.

361
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:58,633
My boyfriend’s the best.

362
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:01,177
What did you say?

363
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,010
I said my boyfriend is the best.

364
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,775
Love sure makes you do something stupid.

365
00:25:28,358 --> 00:25:29,319
Well?

366
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,308
Isn’t my boyfriend the best?

367
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:37,775
I’m sorry.

368
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:40,500
It’s alright.

369
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:42,284
He caught me when I was off guard.

370
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:08,985
Bison.

371
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,088
I love you.

372
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:12,557
I love you, too, Kant.

373
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:34,494
Bison.

374
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:38,016
I love you.

375
00:26:50,557 --> 00:26:52,008
I love you, Kant.

376
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:54,379
I love you, too, Bison.

377
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:25,992
Fadel.

378
00:27:26,364 --> 00:27:27,337
What the hell are you doing?

379
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:28,600
You scared me for a sec.

380
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:32,384
People blow out candles on their birthday, you see.

381
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:35,156
And it’s your birthday.

382
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:40,927
You’re not mad at me anymore?

383
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:42,747
That’s beside the point.

384
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:45,811
It’s your special day.

385
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:48,642
I sure am mad,

386
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:50,488
but I’m still your brother.

387
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,384
Just be a jerk, alright?

388
00:27:57,725 --> 00:27:59,013
You’re making me feel even worse than I already do.

389
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,790
Don’t get mushy on me.

390
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,494
Blow out the candle

391
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:05,297
before it burns our place down.

392
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,686
Let’s get this over with tonight.

393
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:40,951
Take care of them

394
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,350
so we can get back to our life.

395
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:55,644
You think those brothers are weirdly in love with us lately?

396
00:28:55,892 --> 00:28:57,105
Weird?

397
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,921
Look who we are.

398
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:01,692
It’s only normal that they're crazy about us.

399
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,935
I think this is an abnormal level of normal.

400
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:08,154
He’s being too nice and cute.

401
00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:09,516
It’s suspicious.

402
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:11,843
You think too much.

403
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:14,211
Their last mission fell through.

404
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,001
I bet they’re discouraged from the job now.

405
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,785
They didn’t have a choice then,

406
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:22,562
but now we’re like the handsome way out for them.

407
00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:24,735
I bet that changed their minds.

408
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,810
You really think so?

409
00:29:27,151 --> 00:29:28,345
Hell yeah.

410
00:29:28,345 --> 00:29:30,883
I believe in the power of love.

411
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:36,698
Love can turn a bad guy good.

412
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:39,899
Speaking of which…

413
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,627
How’s the situation with the captain?

414
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:43,375
You still work for him?

415
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,257
He’s not letting me go easy.

416
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:47,902
He wants me to find out who the big fish is.

417
00:29:48,274 --> 00:29:51,709
But I think… I’ve had enough.

418
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:54,027
It’s too risky for me.

419
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:55,699
I have a brother to take care of.

420
00:29:56,443 --> 00:29:58,395
Yeah, I think that’s for the best.

421
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:02,102
If you wanna be serious about Bison,

422
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:04,222
I think there’s a chance for you.

423
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:06,342
You have a bad past.

424
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,326
So does he.

425
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:10,227
You’re both on par.

426
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,458
I’ve got something for you.

427
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:16,301
Open it.

428
00:30:18,037 --> 00:30:19,150
What’s going on?
