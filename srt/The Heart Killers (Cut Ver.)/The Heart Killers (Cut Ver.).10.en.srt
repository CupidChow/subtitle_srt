1
00:00:07,393 --> 00:00:08,777
You brought all this on us!

2
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:11,090
If you’re going to kill him,

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,245
kill me, too.

4
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:14,648
What the hell are you doing?

5
00:00:14,843 --> 00:00:18,733
I’m going to keep walking until you give me a chance.

6
00:00:20,373 --> 00:00:21,670
Who is he?

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,063
He’s my ex.

8
00:00:23,063 --> 00:00:24,489
But one day, he’s just gone.

9
00:00:24,684 --> 00:00:26,443
Won’t you just let Ruerat go?

10
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,808
I told you

11
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:29,445
this would be the last mission.

12
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:31,552
Do you think we’d get to come back here again?

13
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:33,690
Once we wrap up the last mission,

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,509
we can go anywhere and do anything.

15
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:42,241
Don’t forget to change your bandage regularly.

16
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:48,511
So we’re not…

17
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,826
sleeping together tonight?

18
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:52,928
I can’t.

19
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:55,563
I have to get this job done.

20
00:00:58,315 --> 00:00:59,723
We’ll be away for a while,

21
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:01,430
but I’ll see you soon.

22
00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:03,958
There’s nothing I can do to change your mind, is there?

23
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:11,985
Hey.

24
00:01:14,403 --> 00:01:15,743
Call me.

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,163
Keep me updated.

26
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:21,513
Of course.

27
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:25,254
But let’s not stay in contact for a little while,

28
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:28,108
just to keep everyone safe.

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,002
Okay?

30
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:40,429
We have to go.

31
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:17,191
Why do I have a feeling

32
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:20,258
that we won’t see them again?

33
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:22,878
Don’t jinx it, dude.

34
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:48,479
I looked up and found that
Ruerat has bought all the land around here to build a condo.

35
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:53,797
Look here.

36
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:00,511
This is our new identity.

37
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:06,549
When should we do it?

38
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,836
Ruerat’s secretary wants to meet us tomorrow.

39
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:12,936
Good.

40
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:15,094
Let’s tell Mother.

41
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,753
We’ll deal with this and get it over with.

42
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,432
We’ll finally get to be with the ones we love.

43
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:44,031
Here is the sale and purchase agreement.

44
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:46,883
The price is 80 million baht,

45
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,052
as specified by the landowner.

46
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,096
All you need to do is sign here,

47
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:53,921
and the land is yours, Mr. Ruerat.

48
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:22,385
Allow me.

49
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:32,243
I’ve been trying to contact the owner for nearly a year,

50
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:33,834
but I never got through.

51
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:37,023
How did you two get to them?

52
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,059
It’s our trade secret.

53
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:50,236
But since you’re a very special client,

54
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:52,875
I’ll tell you.

55
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,726
Do you happen to know

56
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:01,062
Empire Estate and Property

57
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:05,967
and Punlert Development?

58
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:13,282
Dad.

59
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:14,383
Mom.

60
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:22,805
What do you mean?

61
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:29,795
We mean to ask…

62
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:31,483
Why did you kill them?

63
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:33,639
What do you want?

64
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,805
Who sent you?

65
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:37,690
It doesn’t matter who sent us!

66
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,768
Just answer my question.

67
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:40,370
Why did you kill my parents?

68
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,361
I didn’t!

69
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,839
Answer me!

70
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:45,478
You’re Lilly’s boys, aren’t you?

71
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,049
Aren’t you?

72
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:48,653
Answer my question!

73
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:52,481
Did you kill them just because they refused to sell their lands?

74
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:55,159
I didn’t kill them.

75
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:57,120
This is no excuse.

76
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:58,261
Listen to me.

77
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,892
There’s been a misunderstanding.

78
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:06,752
Don’t lie.

79
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:07,882
I’m not lying!

80
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:10,481
The person who killed your parents

81
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:12,289
was your mother!

82
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,603
What the hell are you saying?

83
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:17,445
Lilly killed your parents

84
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:18,753
with her own hands!

85
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:24,639
You know I’m not above putting a hole through a liar’s skull.

86
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:26,977
Listen to me.

87
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:28,263
Hear me out.

88
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,779
Lilly was once a hired gun,

89
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,405
just like you two.

90
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,178
She used to work for me.

91
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:44,165
I hired her to poison people,

92
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:45,225
to kill people.

93
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:48,799
One day, she said she’d quit and start a family.

94
00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:51,725
So I thought she was getting married and having children.

95
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:55,839
But in the end, she just adopted the children of the people she killed

96
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:57,473
and raised them as hitmen.

97
00:07:57,612 --> 00:07:59,605
All just to get rid of me!

98
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:03,838
You’re lying!

99
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:06,185
Mother would never do that.

100
00:08:09,993 --> 00:08:11,747
Say what you want, but I call that bullshit!

101
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:12,515
Bison, stop!

102
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,898
Hold on.

103
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,115
You believe him?

104
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:22,485
Think about it,

105
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,975
if she wasn’t a hitman before,

106
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:28,777
how’d she know how to train you into one?

107
00:08:31,306 --> 00:08:33,558
You bastards are more dumb than I thought.

108
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,141
Damn it!

109
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:05,418
So Mother has been using us all along?

110
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:09,219
What even was real?

111
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:13,305
You’re still calling her “Mother”?

112
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:17,140
What about the lives we’ve wasted?

113
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:19,712
What about the freedom I long for,

114
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:22,431
the love I refrain from?

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,859
We killed people we didn’t even want to kill.

116
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:27,819
I told you not to indulge her so much!

117
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,737
Crap…

118
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:34,094
Maybe Ruerat was just trying to mess with our heads.

119
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:35,984
What the hell would he do that for?

120
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,730
He was on death’s door.

121
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:42,429
Nobody would lie at a time like that.

122
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,228
I’m telling you

123
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,302
I’m not letting my parents’ murderer

124
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:51,673
get away with it.

125
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:54,460
What do you say?

126
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:56,928
What do you want to do?

127
00:09:58,901 --> 00:09:59,966
Should we kill her?

128
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,724
She taught us to kill bad people.

129
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:06,807
What she did to us was beyond evil.

130
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,886
Kill her!

131
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:13,099
Let’s kill her, Fadel!

132
00:10:13,377 --> 00:10:15,380
Kill her!

133
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:16,459
- Kill her!
- Bison!

134
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:20,608
I know you’re angry.

135
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,515
I am, too.

136
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,936
Listen to me.

137
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:35,727
We need to pull ourselves together
if we want to deal with someone like her.

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,217
We need plans.

139
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:41,536
She raised us.

140
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:44,413
She knows how we think,

141
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:46,374
what we would do.

142
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,042
That’s why…

143
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:53,266
You need to calm down.

144
00:10:58,714 --> 00:10:59,829
It’s not in my nature

145
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:03,734
to let someone who’s been using me

146
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,266
continue to live a happy life.

147
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:33,729
I think he’s turned off his phone.

148
00:11:34,146 --> 00:11:35,132
Can you reach your guy?

149
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:37,852
Same here.

150
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:40,421
He texted me before he went silent, though.

151
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:42,025
What did he say?

152
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:47,281
“Let’s stay away from each other for a bit just to be safe.”

153
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:51,753
What’s with that?

154
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,992
Do they think we’ll just sit here carefree?

155
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:55,792
We couldn’t stop them,

156
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,047
and they refused to let us help.

157
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:58,807
Do they think they’re superheroes or something?

158
00:11:59,696 --> 00:12:00,364
Agreed.

159
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:05,994
Why don’t you

160
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:08,417
find out what they’re up to?

161
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,013
It’s worth trying.

162
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:12,954
I know what they’re up to.

163
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:14,796
The point is he wouldn’t listen to me.

164
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:16,253
Why don’t you try and stop Fadel?

165
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:17,236
See if you can.

166
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:20,062
You’re right.

167
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,984
In the end, all we can do is

168
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:26,239
wait for them to come back.

169
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,485
I thought you two abandoned me.

170
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:57,827
We’re sorry we’ve been out of contact.

171
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,048
We felt really bad for messing up last time,

172
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,976
so we just needed some time to recoup.

173
00:13:09,757 --> 00:13:14,624
It was my idea to keeping our distance from you
until we killed Ruerat.

174
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,614
What do you think?

175
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,419
Is it a surprise?

176
00:13:20,226 --> 00:13:21,419
Not at all.

177
00:13:22,698 --> 00:13:25,056
You two never disappoint me.

178
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,093
Well, now that it’s mission accomplished,

179
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,271
can we finally quit?

180
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,409
As you wish.

181
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:38,430
You can do whatever you want.

182
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:42,187
Thank you, Mother.

183
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:45,562
If you need us for anything,

184
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:46,514
just let us know.

185
00:13:47,154 --> 00:13:49,358
You’ve raised us.

186
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:51,200
We can never repay you.

187
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:56,793
You don’t need to think about that.

188
00:13:57,432 --> 00:13:59,188
Just seeing you two happy

189
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:01,187
makes me happy.

190
00:14:02,827 --> 00:14:05,882
If you ever need anything,
just let Keen know.

191
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:07,808
He’ll take care of it for you.

192
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:30,864
Of course.

193
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,420
Thank you.

194
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:36,206
If you’ll please excuse us for now…

195
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:38,751
Goodbye.

196
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,486
They don’t know about your mess-up, do they?

197
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,649
I don’t think so.

198
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,884
Good.

199
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:05,237
At least Ruerat is now taken care of.

200
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:07,096
As for those two,

201
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:11,941
we’ll let someone professional deal with them.

202
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,912
In this industry,

203
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:17,258
once you’re in,

204
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:18,826
you don’t get to walk away easily.

205
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:21,090
And if you want to quit,

206
00:15:23,008 --> 00:15:24,573
this is the only way out.

207
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:59,383
If you miss him so much,
why don’t you just go and see him?

208
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:04,355
I can’t.

209
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:05,767
He won’t see me.

210
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:08,060
What’s in your way now?

211
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:10,323
You already got his brother’s approval.

212
00:16:10,323 --> 00:16:11,086
So what now?

213
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:12,283
Do his parents disapprove?

214
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,520
Do you think you’ll be shunned by society?

215
00:16:13,715 --> 00:16:15,097
What is it?

216
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,042
Don’t make it sound like the plot of a novel.

217
00:16:17,598 --> 00:16:19,625
But what’s in my way is even worse than any of those.

218
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:22,117
If you love him,

219
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:23,570
you have to fight for him.

220
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:25,946
Don’t let him do it alone.

221
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:28,065
You gotta push back when he refuses your help.

222
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,824
You gotta show him

223
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,434
that you’re on his side.

224
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,202
Romantic, aren’t I?

225
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:39,424
You’re quite a casanova, huh?

226
00:16:40,647 --> 00:16:41,891
I only know the theories,

227
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:42,998
never put any to practice.

228
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,978
Bison.

229
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:26,018
Bison!

230
00:18:27,852 --> 00:18:28,605
Hey!

231
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:33,884
Bison.

232
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:36,744
Bison.

233
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:39,760
I know you’re here.

234
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,445
Bison!

235
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:48,661
Kant!

236
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,448
Look where you’re going!

237
00:18:55,643 --> 00:18:57,398
Don’t you know how to use the damn brake, jackass!

238
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,272
That jerk…

239
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:01,135
Hey.

240
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:03,678
You hurt?

241
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:04,555
Hey—

242
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,547
Does it hurt?

243
00:19:28,826 --> 00:19:29,816
No, it doesn’t.

244
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:32,824
Nothing hurts more than not seeing you.

245
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:38,667
I don’t want you getting involved with my mess.

246
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:42,007
Once I tidy up everything on my end,

247
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:43,313
we can be together.

248
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:46,617
So?

249
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,298
You’re just going to keep living like this?

250
00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:52,586
If you worry about me so much,
why not just keep me on camera?

251
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:54,328
I’ll be under your surveillance all the time.

252
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:03,474
I don’t like uncertainty.

253
00:20:07,143 --> 00:20:08,266
I just want to be sure

254
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:10,560
that I’ll get to be with you.

255
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,971
I can’t promise anyone anything with the way I live.

256
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,785
But I’ll try.

257
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:24,585
No, I don’t want that.

258
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,383
You think I’ll go on living

259
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:29,913
if you die?

260
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:33,469
I won’t die.

261
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,479
I’m good at what I do.

262
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:47,072
How about this?

263
00:20:48,156 --> 00:20:49,378
Let me help you.

264
00:20:50,156 --> 00:20:52,078
Let me help you deal with the person who hurt your parents.

265
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:54,038
No. It’s too dangerous.

266
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:55,886
You weren’t trained to do it like I was.

267
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:56,659
Train me, then.

268
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:58,474
Train me to be like you.

269
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:00,668
It’s not easy, you know?

270
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:04,260
Did you forget

271
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:07,187
I was a thief and even a narc?

272
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:10,339
The audacity.

273
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,307
You want another scratch or something?

274
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,499
I’ll help you start over with me.

275
00:21:26,556 --> 00:21:28,478
We will take care of each other.

276
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:32,638
This isn’t just an empty promise.

277
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:36,810
I’ll make it happen.

278
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,825
Hey—

279
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:30,558
Fadel.

280
00:22:31,086 --> 00:22:32,444
You scared me.

281
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:35,153
I’m sorry.

282
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:39,657
Didn’t you say we needed to stay away for a while?

283
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,240
I can’t help thinking about you.

284
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:45,754
How’s your wound?

285
00:22:46,338 --> 00:22:47,332
Does it still hurt?

286
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:51,597
No.

287
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:54,131
My heart hurts more.

288
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:57,251
What are you talking about?

289
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:00,578
You hurt my feelings.

290
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:02,691
I thought you trusted me.

291
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:07,027
You know I know everything,

292
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:09,966
but still you push me away.

293
00:23:13,524 --> 00:23:14,735
I’m doing this for you.

294
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,271
I don’t want you getting caught in the crossfire.

295
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,889
So you’d rather I wonder whether you’re dead or alive?

296
00:23:21,862 --> 00:23:23,704
You think that’ll make me happy?

297
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:26,444
It hurts more than getting shot.

298
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:29,829
You’re so dramatic.

299
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:32,496
You love calling me that.

300
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:35,810
If you really believe that,

301
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,105
just go.

302
00:23:38,328 --> 00:23:41,227
Go, and don’t come back.

303
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:45,255
Style.

304
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,386
I don’t want to lose you.

305
00:23:53,748 --> 00:23:54,744
Neither do I.

306
00:23:57,523 --> 00:24:01,029
That’s why you need to let me help you.

307
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:23,790
What cabbie makes out with his boyfriend so openly, right?

308
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,781
He was trying to kill us.

309
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:27,261
This guy—
