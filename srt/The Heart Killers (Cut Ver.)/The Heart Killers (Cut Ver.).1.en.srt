1
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:11,961
Hello, sir.

2
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:13,682
What are you looking for tonight?

3
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,833
We’ve got several newcomers this week.

4
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:17,760
Some of them just got here, even.

5
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:20,489
Whatever it is you want, I’m sure we have it.

6
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:34,388
88, you’re up.

7
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,238
Your drink, sir.

8
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:02,888
You must have been tired after a long day on the road.

9
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:04,177
Sure am.

10
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:05,863
Traffic was bad today.

11
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:07,376
It always is.

12
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,543
My leg’s so worn out from hitting the brake all day.

13
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:14,733
Why don’t you let me…

14
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:19,310
give you a little massage?

15
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:28,761
Not too fast, sir.

16
00:01:29,092 --> 00:01:30,784
Let’s wait for the food to arrive.

17
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:32,868
We can go all out with no interruptions after.

18
00:01:34,263 --> 00:01:35,838
Sing with me, then.

19
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,317
How are you feeling?

20
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,086
It feels so good.

21
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,687
Do you like it rough or do you prefer something gentle?

22
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,825
I don’t mind both ways.

23
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,828
I think your food is here.

24
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:54,374
Go take a look.

25
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:12,135
You’re always right on time, man.

26
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:17,161
What?

27
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:18,651
You two know each other?

28
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:19,952
We do.

29
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:23,052
A bit too well, I suppose.

30
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,826
Who the hell are you people?

31
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,904
We’re the guys who’ll take you to heaven, sir.

32
00:04:57,386 --> 00:05:00,240
How many times did I tell you
not to dress up on the job?

33
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:02,427
You stand out like a sore thumb.

34
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:05,069
But I like it.

35
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,704
We’re off duty so I can just be myself.

36
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:10,852
Not everyone wants to dress like 
it’s always a funeral like you do.

37
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,139
Well, black makes me blend in easily.

38
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:18,170
If you sneak around in the color you’re wearing,

39
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,854
people would recognize you right away.

40
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,037
What’d you do if you got caught?

41
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:23,543
Don’t worry about me.

42
00:05:23,827 --> 00:05:24,976
Worry about your job.

43
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:26,308
Did you check the security camera?

44
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:28,032
I always get my job done, don’t I?

45
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:28,830
’Kay.

46
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:30,365
I’m off, then.

47
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:31,351
It’s Friday.

48
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:32,376
I’ve got plans.

49
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:33,986
Plans?

50
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:35,799
You going out?

51
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,632
We literally just clocked off.

52
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,299
Shouldn’t you be laying low?

53
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:43,010
Are you my brother or my father, Fadel?

54
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,606
You nitpick too much.

55
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:46,106
Because you give me so many reasons to.

56
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,590
The streets are littered with cops out there
and you don’t give a damn.

57
00:05:50,796 --> 00:05:52,043
What’d you do if you got caught?

58
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:53,267
Have I been?

59
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:55,083
I never make mistakes, do I?

60
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,410
I do what I have to do.

61
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:58,558
Now I want to do what I want to.

62
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:01,230
Can’t I just live a little?

63
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,675
Fine.

64
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:08,681
Just be careful.

65
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:10,573
’Kay.

66
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:11,386
Bye.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,988
My ride’s here.

68
00:06:17,198 --> 00:06:17,789
Hey.

69
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:20,651
Hit it.

70
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:24,347
Bye-bye.

71
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,058
OLD FART

72
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,235
Hey.

73
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:21,729
What’d you think of this tattoo?

74
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:24,079
Ain’t it a classic?

75
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:36,000
Are. You. Listening. To. Me?

76
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,686
The hell’d you do that for?

77
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,635
Should I get this tattoo?

78
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:45,600
It’s not bad.

79
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:47,991
I can make it look better, though.

80
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:49,807
It looks a bit too cartoonish here.

81
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:54,513
I guess.

82
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,418
What’s with you tonight?

83
00:07:57,962 --> 00:07:59,728
You’re with your best friend,

84
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:03,124
but you keep looking around for your next body count.

85
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,444
Aren’t you a damn player?

86
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:08,711
For real, man.

87
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:11,058
Quit it with your one-night-stands and just get a real lover.

88
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:13,745
But I’m not looking to commit.

89
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:15,991
I’ve got my hands full as it is.

90
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:20,456
I’d rather someone I can just chat with,
someone I can count to split in the morning.

91
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:21,220
It’s easier that way.

92
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:27,793
But you’re in no position to call me out
when you’ve been playing around just the same.

93
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,799
This is why we’re friends, man.

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,145
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

95
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:35,638
I’m just making sure I’m still at the top of the game.

96
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:58,097
That guy’s cute.

97
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,876
Which one?

98
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:03,045
The shortie in red.

99
00:09:07,184 --> 00:09:08,238
What are you waiting for, then?

100
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:09,936
Go for it.

101
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,056
Be right back.

102
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,736
Left behind, once again.

103
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:40,820
Shift the weight to your other leg just a bit,

104
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,430
and I bet you could have made it a strike just now.

105
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:46,173
Thank you…

106
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:48,741
for the unsolicited advice.

107
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,066
Feels like I just got politely told to get lost.

108
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,323
I’m sorry.

109
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,111
I’ll be straightforward.

110
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,115
I was just making small talk

111
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:12,068
because I thought you’re cute.

112
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,731
See, that ain’t so hard, right?

113
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:20,333
No need to be patronizing.

114
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:32,847
Weren’t you trying to teach me how to hit a strike?

115
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,328
A bit close, huh?

116
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:51,832
Thought you wanted to throw a strike.

117
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:08,080
See?

118
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,181
Alright.

119
00:11:10,613 --> 00:11:12,135
I’ll admit you’re good at bowling.

120
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,794
Anything else to show off?

121
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,827
Why don’t you come with me and find out?

122
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:19,087
Your place?

123
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:19,901
Can’t.

124
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:20,743
I live with my little brother.

125
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:21,530
How about your place?

126
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,387
Can’t.

127
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:23,194
I live with my big brother.

128
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:24,727
We’ll book a hotel, then.

129
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,092
Okay.

130
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:31,933
Deal.

131
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:53,470
(Sorry, man.)

132
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,773
(I’ll see you at your garage.)

133
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:55,609
(The tattoo’s on me.)

134
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,062
Oh, bastard.

135
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:10,588
Shit!

136
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,516
Ugh, shit.

137
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:46,423
You alright?

138
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:48,661
I am.

139
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:50,432
My car isn’t.

140
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:52,689
Were you distracted or something?

141
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,140
I’m sorry.

142
00:12:54,471 --> 00:12:55,523
Are you drunk?

143
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:56,804
I’m not.

144
00:12:57,182 --> 00:12:58,721
I literally had one can of beer.

145
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,854
Hey, that’s already one too many.

146
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:03,583
You shouldn’t even be behind the wheel.

147
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,382
But I’m really not drunk.

148
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:07,325
I was just texting my friend.

149
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,404
Texting?

150
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:11,603
You were on the phone while driving?

151
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,253
Be considerate for everyone else on the road, will you?

152
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:16,922
Do you even have a driver’s license?

153
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,109
Of course I do!

154
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:20,804
Will you calm down?

155
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:21,512
How about this?

156
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,051
I’ll take responsibility for your—

157
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:34,662
It’s okay.

158
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,082
I got it.

159
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:39,297
No can do.

160
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,066
It ain’t like me to hit and run.

161
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:44,456
I’ve fixed the same model before.

162
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,685
I’ll get that tail light replaced

163
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:48,701
and throw a free checkup in for you.

164
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:49,241
Let me see.

165
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:54,334
Are you a mechanic?

166
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:01,212
Yeah.

167
00:14:02,395 --> 00:14:04,384
My garage is called Style Auto.

168
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:05,467
Look it up.

169
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,527
Will you just let me take a look at the damage?

170
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:13,770
What’s your problem?

171
00:14:14,574 --> 00:14:16,064
Let me assess the damage.

172
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,336
How else would I repair it?

173
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:20,123
The parts for your model aren’t easy to come by, you know?

174
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:20,912
Listen.

175
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:22,495
I’m in a rush here.

176
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,396
I don’t have time for this.

177
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:26,627
I’ll bring it to your garage when I can later, alright?

178
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:28,737
Come on.

179
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:30,682
It takes no time at all so let me—

180
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:32,264
I said I’m in a rush!

181
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:36,106
Fine.

182
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,893
I’ll see you at the garage.

183
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:40,754
Drive carefully.

184
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:43,461
You’re not the only guy on the road.

185
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,062
Thanks for the lecture, Dad!

186
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,606
Are we kissing before we even know each other’s names?

187
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:09,717
Do we need to?

188
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:11,524
We’ll forget it tomorrow anyway.

189
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:13,580
Okay, then.

190
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:15,239
Perfect for me.

191
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:26,986
You got it?

192
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:00,571
You’re not doing this solo, you know?

193
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:43,643
Oh?
