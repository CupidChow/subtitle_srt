1
00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:05,599
Kant.

2
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:07,588
I’m done running.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,482
Five years behind bars…

4
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:11,286
That’s still better than running all our lives.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,447
We have one day together.

6
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:14,809
I want to make the most out of it.

7
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,805
Let’s do something that will become good memories.

8
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:23,092
What you want to do, where to go, what to eat,

9
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:25,262
just let me know.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,621
YEAR 1

11
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:36,266
What’s wrong?

12
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,931
No energy?

13
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,742
Yeah.

14
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:40,190
How’d I have any

15
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,428
when I barely got any sleep last night?

16
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:43,781
The guy next to me kept putting his leg on me all night.

17
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:47,396
We have to be here for five years.

18
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:49,455
Get used to it.

19
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,776
If he puts his leg on you,

20
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,630
just do the same to him.

21
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:56,378
Easier said than done.

22
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:57,976
Dude looks super scary.

23
00:01:58,513 --> 00:01:59,938
Just exhaust yourself with exercises.

24
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:01,745
It’ll help you sleep at night.

25
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:11,926
Hey.

26
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,478
That’s my place.

27
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:17,447
Come on.

28
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:20,461
The equipment is for everyone, isn’t it?

29
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,672
What, pretty boy?

30
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,520
You wanna get in trouble?

31
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:27,489
It’s my workout time.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,172
It’s not like you can book this in advance,

33
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:33,379
can you?

34
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:36,397
I don’t see anyone’s name on these things.

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,660
Or did your daddy book it ahead for you?

36
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,057
Hey, newbie.

37
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:41,527
You run your mouth.

38
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,820
Just watch your back.

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,129
A petite pretty boy like you is just my type.

40
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,227
You should be my plaything.

41
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:04,089
Let’s stay out of each other’s way.

42
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,020
You can exercise here all you want.

43
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:20,877
Why’d you let him have it?

44
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:23,861
It’ll just get to his head that he’s all that.

45
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:26,877
It’s not worth it.

46
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:29,686
We have to be here for another five years.

47
00:03:30,393 --> 00:03:31,851
Don’t get yourself an enemy so fast.

48
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,285
How are you?

49
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:57,375
You have bags under your eyes.

50
00:03:58,025 --> 00:03:59,096
Do you get any sleep at all?

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,243
Hardly.

52
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:02,717
I can’t really sleep much.

53
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:06,401
I’m worried about you…

54
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,521
Are you sure you got this?

55
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,256
Of course.

56
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:12,599
Don’t worry about me.

57
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:15,528
I’m just not used to it yet.

58
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:16,728
It’ll take some time.

59
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:21,363
What about you?

60
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:22,235
How are you?

61
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:25,719
I’m so-so.

62
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:29,298
Some TV star got a tattoo from me and posted it online.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,015
People showed up at my studio after that.

64
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,436
So I’ve been busy lately.

65
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,639
But that’s good.

66
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:36,998
It’s making really good money.

67
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,806
You’re a celebrity tattoo artist now.

68
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:41,823
Don’t you forget me when you’re famous.

69
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:43,672
I won’t.

70
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:45,439
How could I?

71
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:48,321
You have my heart and my body…

72
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:51,252
Penguin.

73
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:58,253
Babe asked me to give you a book.

74
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,375
He said it’ll keep you company when you’re bored.

75
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:03,684
Thank him for me.

76
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:11,058
How are you?

77
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,211
I’m okay.

78
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:14,487
It’s not that bad here.

79
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:15,338
I’ll get by.

80
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:17,846
Really?

81
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:21,072
You sure you’re not saying that just to make me happy?

82
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:23,655
I’ve seen some interviews,

83
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:26,785
and the people who have been here said it was awful.

84
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,043
It’s not that bad.

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,483
I really miss you, though.

86
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:37,560
When you do, just come visit.

87
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:44,078
How’s the garage?

88
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:46,341
It’s been busy.

89
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:48,981
Dad’s pretty much retired,

90
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,921
so I’m taking over everything.

91
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,563
Do you know how my burger joint is?

92
00:05:55,694 --> 00:05:57,213
The landlord sold the place.

93
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:01,305
But it’s still a burger joint.

94
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:04,028
Not a thing has changed.

95
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:05,202
Except the name, though.

96
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:10,146
I’ll find a way to buy it back when I’m out of here.

97
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:13,009
We can deal with that later.

98
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:15,486
If you can’t get the place back,

99
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:16,856
I’ll help you find another location.

100
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,872
Is there anything you want?

101
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,513
I’ll leave it with the warden.

102
00:06:24,937 --> 00:06:26,214
I don’t want anything.

103
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,724
Just seeing your face will last me a whole month.

104
00:06:34,947 --> 00:06:36,486
What did they feed you in there?

105
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:38,310
You’re way too sweet.

106
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,932
If you say such sweet things,

107
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,383
it’ll only make me want to hold you

108
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:48,609
and kiss you even more, you know?

109
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,377
Kant, I can’t do this.

110
00:07:13,526 --> 00:07:16,636
Who’d be able to just watch their boyfriend go to jail, really?

111
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:21,527
The worst part is only getting a few minutes to talk to him.

112
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,808
I see him but I can’t touch him.

113
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,556
We’re so close but it feels so far.

114
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:31,846
I get your drift.

115
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:35,215
I wanna break through the bars just to get to him.

116
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:38,042
It makes me feel bad just seeing the look in his eyes.

117
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:44,859
Is there no way we could hold them in our arms again?

118
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:49,327
There’s a special visit day, but only once a year.

119
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:54,278
Once a year is hardly enough.

120
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:05,592
I think I have an idea

121
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:07,534
that will give us more than just a hug.

122
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:10,188
What are you thinking?

123
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,524
Hey, pretty boy.

124
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,289
Where are you off to?

125
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:20,470
Let’s have a little chat.

126
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:22,788
What do you wanna chat about now?

127
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:24,293
I gave you back your dumbbells, didn’t I?

128
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:25,215
They’re all yours.

129
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:27,995
I’m done lifting weights.

130
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:29,861
I want a different kind of exercise,

131
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,339
something strenuous and sexy.

132
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,208
Will you just leave me alone?

133
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:47,670
Be my baby,

134
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:49,511
and I’ll take you under my wing.

135
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:52,260
I promise you your life here will be darn comfy.

136
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:53,859
Not interested.

137
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:55,712
I have a boyfriend,

138
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,673
and he’s waiting for me out there.

139
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:00,960
He already takes good care of me.

140
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:04,896
How lovely.

141
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,902
Whatever your boyfriend can’t do,

142
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:09,082
I’ll do it.

143
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,506
Hey.

144
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,005
Let go of me!

145
00:10:24,563 --> 00:10:27,215
Don’t think you can just make me your baby!

146
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,779
If you want a lover, then be nice and not force it on them!

147
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:38,113
I know I’m cute, but I can’t be messed with!

148
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:40,202
Hey, what’s going on here?

149
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,160
What are you doing?

150
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:47,759
He was trying to force me down, but I wouldn’t let him.

151
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:09,834
They’ll leave you alone from now on, I take it?

152
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:16,488
Being smashed by a dipper repeatedly did the job, I guess.

153
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:21,047
You’re lucky the warden was understanding.

154
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:23,024
Or else you’d have been locked up alone.

155
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,448
As if a man like me would let just anyone have me,

156
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:28,711
and he ain’t even good-looking.

157
00:11:30,804 --> 00:11:32,316
Hey, you two.

158
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:36,971
I heard you worked in a restaurant when you were outside.

159
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:39,289
Yes.

160
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,835
I worked at a burger joint.

161
00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:44,947
The kitchen is short-staffed right now.

162
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:47,187
Can you cook Thai food?

163
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:48,906
Yes.

164
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:52,147
I can make the basics like stir fried dishes and soups.

165
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,275
Good.

166
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:54,930
Go help out in the kitchen, then.

167
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:56,886
Of course.

168
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,498
Can I bring my brother with me?

169
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,676
I think I’ll need an extra pair of hands.

170
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,705
Fine.

171
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:07,912
Don’t let me see you two slacking off.

172
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,186
If you don’t do your job,

173
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,619
I’m putting you on crap-cleaning duty.

174
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:14,565
Oh, I won’t slack off at all, sir.

175
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:15,942
I’ll be the perfect sous chef.

176
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,695
Yes, chef!

177
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,249
Good.

178
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,926
Before you go to the kitchen,

179
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:22,424
make sure the floor’s clean.

180
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:24,708
Yes.

181
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,765
Of course.

182
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:30,165
Yes, chef.

183
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,569
Do your job.

184
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:41,660
What?

185
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:44,834
You want me to put you in jail?

186
00:12:45,117 --> 00:12:46,304
Yes, Cap.

187
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:47,730
We want to go to jail.

188
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:49,086
You dimwits.

189
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:50,896
What do you want to go there for?

190
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:53,547
I wanna see my boyfriend.

191
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:56,439
You two are crazy.

192
00:12:57,853 --> 00:12:59,997
Can’t you just visit them?

193
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:01,857
It’s not enough.

194
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:04,042
All we can do is talk to them through a glass window.

195
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:06,696
I want to touch him,

196
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:09,492
to feel him,

197
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:12,364
to hold him,

198
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:16,835
to kiss him.

199
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:22,009
And I want to…

200
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:29,665
You’re one crazy in love bastard.

201
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,919
So?

202
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,320
You’re gonna steal, kill, and sell drugs just to get locked up?

203
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,988
Think about it.

204
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:44,041
I literally just helped you wipe your slate clean.

205
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:45,986
That’s not what I have in mind.

206
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,145
I have a better way.

207
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,670
I just need you to pull some strings for us.

208
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,290
Do you know someone on the inside?

209
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,170
A few.

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,293
Don’t tell me you want me to help you reenact Prison Break?

211
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:09,106
Do you have a tattoo of a map or something?

212
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:13,262
You watch too much TV, Cap.

213
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:16,525
My plan is even better than that.

214
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:28,812
It’s so much better in the kitchen, don’t you think?

215
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:32,334
I can easily get through five years if we’re here all the time.

216
00:14:33,324 --> 00:14:35,431
At least it’s something I’m good at.

217
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:36,450
You’re right.

218
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,727
I miss your cooking.

219
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:40,575
The last guy was too heavy-handed on the salt.

220
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:43,511
Thought I’d have to get my kidney replaced when I’m out.

221
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:44,657
Am I right?

222
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:47,028
Get your hands busy, not your mouth.

223
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:49,871
The prisoners will be here soon.

224
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,829
And don’t get too giddy,

225
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:53,892
’cause you won’t get to be in the kitchen all day.

226
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:56,394
You’re taking vocational training, too.

227
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:58,390
What kind of vocational training?

228
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,146
All sorts of kinds.

229
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:05,054
There’s carving, fortune telling, drawing, fixing cars.

230
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:06,948
All sorts of things for you to choose from.

231
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:08,852
Hurry up and finish it.

232
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:10,650
Yes.

233
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:15,993
I think I’ll go for drawing.

234
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,206
You wanna join me?

235
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:21,210
I don’t like drawing.

236
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:22,691
You go for it.

237
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,383
What will you do?

238
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,864
Just sit around being bored?

239
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:30,447
Don’t worry about me.

240
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,497
I’ll find something to do.

241
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,904
[VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR PRISONERS: ART]

242
00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:56,080
Hey, is this seat taken?

243
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,199
Nah.
You can sit.

244
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,111
Hey.

245
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,489
Where’s the teacher?

246
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,339
Are we allowed to just paint whatever we want?

247
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:16,576
He went to get more supply.

248
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,621
He’ll be back soon.

249
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:22,865
Sorry, guys.

250
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:24,239
I had to get us more supply.

251
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,706
Kant?

252
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,038
We’ll draw some flowers and vases today.

253
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:40,536
We’ll learn about light and shadow.

254
00:16:40,536 --> 00:16:42,886
Has anyone taken an art course before?

255
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:51,511
So everyone has, except you.

256
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:58,480
Why did you want to study art now?

257
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:03,517
I think I’m too rough around the edges

258
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,442
and too brutish.

259
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:08,973
I think art might be able to soften me up.

260
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:11,615
Alright.

261
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:19,813
I guess I’ll have to pay attention to you especially

262
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:22,846
so you know all the basics.

263
00:17:31,895 --> 00:17:34,834
[THE INSIDE OF AN ENGINE]

264
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:43,370
…It’s pretty exciting.

265
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,736
It makes you feel energetic and happy.

266
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:48,541
I’ll be teaching you the basics of auto repair today, though.

267
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,468
Let’s save dancing for later.

268
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh, hey.

269
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,638
Don’t just stand there.

270
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:03,121
You wanna join this class or what?

271
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,656
I do want to join.

272
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,737
Is it okay if I don’t know the first thing about fixing cars?

273
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:10,529
It’s alright.

274
00:18:10,784 --> 00:18:12,610
You’ll get to learn all about it.

275
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,541
If you want to, that is.

276
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:24,618
I’ll show you every nook and cranny of a car.

277
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:28,404
You’ll definitely find some use for what you learn from me.

278
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:31,156
But if you still can’t fix cars after that,

279
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:33,750
I’ll fix them for you.

280
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:45,614
You said you didn’t know the basics,

281
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,136
but you nailed this light and shadow lesson.

282
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:50,706
I have a gift for it, I guess.

283
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:54,957
There’s something you’re just good at without learning.

284
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,279
I guess I have nothing to teach you, then?

285
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:00,626
Do teach me.

286
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,490
I still need some advice from a pro.

287
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:12,488
Follow me.

288
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:27,537
You seriously broke your pencil?

289
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:30,750
Oh…

290
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,845
Yes.

291
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:34,480
I must have used too much strength when I was drawing.

292
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:36,514
It’s quite okay.

293
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:38,384
But we’re out of pencils right now.

294
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,743
I’ll go get some from behind the meeting room.

295
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:46,590
Sir.

296
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:49,197
I’m going to get some pencils for the students.

297
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:50,245
Yes.

298
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:51,109
Thanks.

299
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:01,957
Warden, may I go to the toilet, please?

300
00:20:01,957 --> 00:20:03,734
I’ll be back to finish my drawing.

301
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,092
Told you I’d never stay away, didn’t I?

302
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:30,135
I thought you’d do something illegal just to get in here.

303
00:20:31,662 --> 00:20:33,767
This is way better.

304
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:39,166
I get to be close to you

305
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,723
and to touch you just like I wanted to.

306
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,871
Style!

307
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:47,520
You’ll be in trouble if the guard sees you.

308
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,190
So?

309
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:53,684
Why would I come here if I don’t get to do anything with you at all?

310
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:01,696
I can’t help you.

311
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:05,062
You said you’d be patient,

312
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:06,689
and you’re already losing it?

313
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:10,515
A guy has wants and needs, you know?

314
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:24,802
Guys.

315
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:28,716
Do you mind putting the tools back in place when you’re done?

316
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:31,310
That’s all for today.

317
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,958
I’ll see you again next week.

318
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,185
I’ll make sure you can all run a garage one day.

319
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,631
Kant.

320
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:53,278
How’d you get here?

321
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:57,379
Let’s say I have some strings I could pull.

322
00:21:57,831 --> 00:21:59,185
But you won’t get into any trouble for this, will you?

323
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,319
I’m worried about you.

324
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:02,464
Don’t be.

325
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,761
Captain talked to some people for me.

326
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:07,883
We just can’t be too obvious about this.

327
00:22:11,153 --> 00:22:13,257
I’ll be coming here to teach from now on.

328
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,032
But.. won’t it be a waste of time for you?

329
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:24,399
Seeing you will make me happy.

330
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:27,377
I’ll get to meet you,

331
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:31,398
and touch you just like this.

332
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,810
I’ve been dying to do that since the moment I saw you.

333
00:23:14,874 --> 00:23:16,770
You’re crazy.

334
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:20,397
Love will make people do crazy things.

335
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,225
Save your sweet words.

336
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:28,339
How did you get in here?

337
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:32,312
It’s thanks to Kant’s connections.

338
00:23:32,312 --> 00:23:33,952
I’ll be teaching here regularly.

339
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:36,008
So I’ll see you every week.

340
00:23:45,114 --> 00:23:46,420
You know…

341
00:23:47,664 --> 00:23:49,413
You don’t have to do this.

342
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:56,202
I don’t mind seeing you once a month

343
00:23:56,966 --> 00:23:58,359
or once every three months.

344
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:08,210
I did everything I could to be with you, you know?

345
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:10,160
You don’t appreciate that?

346
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:13,156
Or did you already find someone here?

347
00:24:13,721 --> 00:24:14,896
I’d expect it of a popular guy like you.

348
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:19,689
Come here.

349
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:24,459
No matter where I am,

350
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:26,671
you’re the only one for me.

351
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:49,772
Once you’re done cleaning that,

352
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,466
put it back where it comes from.

353
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:53,716
Yes, sir.

354
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,436
I’ll see you again next week.

355
00:24:56,878 --> 00:24:57,750
I’m counting on ya.

356
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:14,315
Well, what are we doing that needs hiding?

357
00:25:14,824 --> 00:25:17,008
You’re the most important thing to me.
