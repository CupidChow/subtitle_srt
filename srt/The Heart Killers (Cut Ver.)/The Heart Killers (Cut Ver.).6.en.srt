1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,101
I want to know more about you.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,874
You don’t tell me anything.

3
00:00:09,874 --> 00:00:12,280
Can you ask Fadel out on a double date tonight?

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,080
Babe got ganged up on by his bullies at school.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,191
He’s hiding right now.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,007
(The mad buffalo is heading to your place.)

7
00:00:24,336 --> 00:00:25,993
Hey!

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,105
I’m really lucky to have met you.

9
00:00:29,492 --> 00:00:32,235
I can feel that my life is about to change.

10
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:34,236
One day,

11
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:36,912
I’ll be your 100%.

12
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:56,052
Style.

13
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:58,264
Wake up.

14
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:03,340
Five more minutes, Papa.

15
00:01:12,644 --> 00:01:13,544
Who are you calling Papa?

16
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:15,559
Wake up.

17
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:18,624
I told you last night, didn’t I?

18
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,024
You should have set an alarm.

19
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:25,029
I told you to hold back

20
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,620
and you didn’t listen to me, either.

21
00:01:28,457 --> 00:01:29,607
My entire body is sore.

22
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:31,032
I can’t go to work today.

23
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:41,019
I’m sorry.

24
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:45,429
I’ll take you to the hospital.

25
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:46,933
Alright, get up.

26
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,923
Hey. Stop it.

27
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:52,656
What are you doing?

28
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:55,255
I was just being overdramatic.

29
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:57,654
I know you’re like a block of walking ice,

30
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,807
but you should learn to read between the lines.

31
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,459
They say we should hit it right where it hurts.

32
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:16,983
It’s like exercising.

33
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,133
That’s how your body builds stronger muscles.

34
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,424
Thanks for the trivia,

35
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:25,659
but I don’t see why you’re telling me this.

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,212
You need to exercise daily.

37
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:47,390
Hey, who the hell are you?

38
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,838
How’d you get in my house?

39
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:51,128
I…

40
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,704
I’m a friend of Style’s.

41
00:03:53,695 --> 00:03:54,621
Tyle’s friend?

42
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:56,281
I’ve never seen your mug before.

43
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,142
I haven’t known him long.

44
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:00,742
Did you stay the night?

45
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,200
Yes.

46
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,198
You slept with him, did you?

47
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,339
Uh…

48
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:11,949
I…

49
00:04:12,843 --> 00:04:14,649
I’m not calling you out or anything.

50
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:16,836
I’m just telling you to use protection.

51
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:19,327
There’s all kinds of diseases you can get from this.

52
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,173
I read up on those kinds of things, too, you know?

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,631
Well?

54
00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:28,374
Are you his one-time thing
or are you taking him seriously?

55
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:34,685
Dad?

56
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:38,501
When did you get back?

57
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,632
Just right the moment this handsome mug left your room.

58
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,549
What?

59
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,803
Rough night?

60
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:47,698
What are you talking about?

61
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,855
This ain’t no business for you, old man.

62
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,888
This is Fadel, my friend.

63
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:53,745
It’s nothing.

64
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:56,671
It’s not like I forbid you from dating, you know?

65
00:04:57,783 --> 00:04:59,553
Just make sure you’re not a bad influence on him.

66
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:01,950
Can you just stop, Dad?

67
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:03,185
You’re embarrassing me.

68
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:09,985
You can go.

69
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:13,438
Goodbye.

70
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:24,928
Oh, well, who’d have guessed that’s your type?

71
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,385
We’ve got a whole lot of mechanics looking exactly like him, you know?

72
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:28,777
I can set you up.

73
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:29,642
Dad, please.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,522
Stop trying to set me up with someone.

75
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,096
How was your fishing trip?

76
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:35,047
Tell me all about it.

77
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:36,507
Got loads of fish for ya.

78
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:37,825
Let’s get in the kitchen.

79
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:38,420
Really?

80
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,290
What would you like to eat?

81
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,434
I want them fresh and raw.

82
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:42,365
Alright. Sashimi coming right up.

83
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:43,427
Sashimi, huh?

84
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,193
You know me well!

85
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,213
What’s that you’re reading, Babe?

86
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:56,568
It’s Shakespeare’s Othello.

87
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:57,739
What is it about?

88
00:05:58,222 --> 00:05:59,817
It’s about a man who is being used.

89
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:01,355
How so?

90
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,946
The main character, Othello,

91
00:06:04,357 --> 00:06:06,263
is being manipulated by someone he trusts.

92
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:09,339
He’s so in love that it hurts him in the end.

93
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:10,830
Something like that.

94
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:12,388
Whoa.

95
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:13,246
Sounds intense.

96
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:14,709
I want to try reading that.

97
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:18,451
Hey, don’t go along with him.

98
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:21,545
He reads a lot so everything sounds like a novel to him.

99
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:24,537
Hey, my reading is getting me a scholarship soon.

100
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:26,455
I won’t be depending on your tattooing money anymore.

101
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:30,482
Who did you take that big mouth after?

102
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:32,730
Who do you think raised me?

103
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:35,733
Oh, hey.

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,820
The grilled pork is pretty good.

105
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,614
Where did you buy it?

106
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:39,639
It’s an old recipe.

107
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:41,451
The place is really good.

108
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:42,677
They’re always sold out.

109
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:44,273
It’s the old recipe with no-milk marinate.

110
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:46,451
Oh, yeah, I hate when they add milk to the marinate.

111
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:47,915
I think this recipe tastes better.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,601
With some fat like this.

113
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:51,095
It’s so good when it’s a little charred.

114
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:52,720
Okay.

115
00:06:53,131 --> 00:06:54,257
Noted.

116
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:05,192
Oh, hey.

117
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:06,849
I have to go.

118
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:08,290
Don’t want Fadel blowing my ear off.

119
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:09,910
Okay.

120
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:12,483
Come by any time.

121
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:14,476
You’re always welcomed here.

122
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:16,975
Bye, Babe.

123
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:18,116
Gotta bounce.

124
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:19,398
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

125
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,267
Will you tell me now

126
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,358
why you had me lie about being bullied?

127
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,195
There are things

128
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,093
you’re better off not knowing.

129
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:39,340
It keeps you safe.

130
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,481
I think Ruerat is their next victim.

131
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:59,669
You certainly lived up to my expectations.

132
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:05,737
If that’s all you need,

133
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,272
then, we’re done here.

134
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,181
Keep your word.

135
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,731
Who said we are done?

136
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:18,551
What the hell does that mean?

137
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,795
You haven't figured out who their boss is.

138
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,855
So this is your ploy, Cap?

139
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:29,910
I’m not doing it.

140
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,063
I don’t want to.

141
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:33,354
And if you force me into this,

142
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:34,948
I’m going to come out with your bullshit.

143
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:41,087
You think they’ll let you live
once I get those two arrested?

144
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:49,001
I’d say you actually fell for Bison.

145
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,690
Why don’t you try telling him the truth?

146
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:58,466
See if he wouldn’t shoot you dead immediately.

147
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,170
Hitmen are hitmen.

148
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,259
If you want to stay safe,

149
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,346
help me root out their whole organization.

150
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:16,156
What do you say?

151
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:19,846
Think about it.

152
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:23,738
Yeah.

153
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:24,978
I’m checking the CCTV footage.

154
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:25,823
I’ll be right in.

155
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,114
(Wanna meet up tonight?)

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,431
(Let’s do something fun.)

157
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:48,434
(Sure.)

158
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:50,254
(But it’d better be fun.)

159
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:52,792
(Or else…)

160
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:44,550
Fadel.

161
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:47,733
Honestly.

162
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:50,068
What do you think of Style?

163
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,216
Stay out of my business
and focus on the work at hand.

164
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:56,717
What?

165
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,980
We’re brothers.

166
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,434
We gotta talk about this kind of thing.

167
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:04,739
Kant and his brother talk about everything, you know?

168
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,631
They even mess around sometimes.

169
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:08,051
I want something like that, too.

170
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:09,602
Can’t I?

171
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:14,073
Fadel!

172
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,938
That’s the kind of brother you want, isn’t it?

173
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,135
I’m being serious, jerk.

174
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:21,037
Why is everyone so eager to know?

175
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:23,650
First, his dad, and now you?

176
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,484
The easy way out is to just tell me.

177
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:30,020
Fine. I like him.

178
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,154
What do you like about him?

179
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,665
His damn cockiness.

180
00:12:34,632 --> 00:12:35,642
It’s funny.

181
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:39,506
What about his appearance?

182
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:41,647
Anything you like in particular?

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,080
What’s with that question?

184
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,760
Just answer me.

185
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:49,189
I like his lips.

186
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:54,552
Full lips make for a good kisser, huh?

187
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,330
I like Kant’s eyes.

188
00:13:03,674 --> 00:13:05,708
When I get close to him for a kiss,

189
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:10,316
I think I might get lost in those eyes.

190
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,851
It’s mesmerizing.

191
00:13:14,824 --> 00:13:15,743
And when we’re doing it—

192
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:17,233
Hey, hold it.

193
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,322
I don’t need the details.

194
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:21,879
Brothers don’t need to know everything about each other.

195
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:25,337
Hey.

196
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:29,944
I don’t know if you feel for Style what I feel for Kant,

197
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:33,431
but Kant makes me want to wake up every morning,

198
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:37,591
hoping my life would be different.

199
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,834
I want to tell him about myself

200
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,846
without lying.

201
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:46,402
I’m tired, Fadel,

202
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,607
of keeping to myself.

203
00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:53,449
What about you?

204
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,389
You don’t want that?

205
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:04,161
I just want him to accept me for who I am.

206
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:12,254
I think it’s time for us to quit.

207
00:14:14,912 --> 00:14:16,754
Once we’re done with Ruerat,

208
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,393
I’ll talk to Mother again.

209
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:21,012
Alright.

210
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:23,155
Let’s avenge our parents,

211
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,061
and we can finally date without any worries.

212
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:59,554
If they really decided to carry out their operation tomorrow,
and got arrested by Captain,

213
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,366
what should we do?

214
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:05,032
Kant, I’ll be honest.

215
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,280
Let’s stop them.

216
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:11,114
You want me to walk up to Bison and say,

217
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,761
“Don’t kill people.
A police captain is waiting to arrest you tomorrow”?

218
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,309
If he ever found out the truth,

219
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:19,195
do you think I’ll—

220
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:20,368
You’re a goner.

221
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:24,445
Unless you leave him right now.

222
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:27,045
Can you do that?

223
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:30,399
Whether you can or not is beyond me.

224
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:33,381
But as for me, I’m getting kinda attached to Fadel.

225
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:38,622
Can you hurry up and get this done?

226
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,961
Once their boss gets arrested,

227
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:42,278
this will end.

228
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:44,528
Those two will be free,

229
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,682
and we can go on with our lives.

230
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,504
You think Captain would let them walk?

231
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,213
They kill people for a living.

232
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:54,138
If they ain’t shot dead on the spot,
they’d at least get a life sentence.

233
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:03,562
Does that mean
tonight could be the last night I see him?

234
00:16:07,912 --> 00:16:09,135
You’re meeting up with him tonight?

235
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:10,346
Yeah.

236
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:12,586
At the rock club.

237
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:23,040
Sorry about this, bud.

238
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,686
We have two options today.

239
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:32,841
If we don’t stop them tonight,
then we can only make the most of what we have now.

240
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,805
Why are we at the bowling alley?

241
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:10,380
Isn’t it closed today?

242
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,820
That won’t stop us.

243
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:14,652
I can get you inside.

244
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:18,561
What is this?

245
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:20,496
I thought you weren’t breaking into places anymore.

246
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:22,742
Well…

247
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,078
I want to spend some quality time with you.

248
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,118
I want to do something special.

249
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:36,547
But what’s the… occasion?

250
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:40,759
Nothing in particular.

251
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:44,616
I just want to be with you.

252
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:47,188
Please.

253
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,963
Please?

254
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:50,706
Hey.

255
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,573
You’re being weird.

256
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,495
It’s getting suspicious.

257
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:56,266
Did you do something wrong?

258
00:17:56,894 --> 00:17:57,650
Well?

259
00:17:58,109 --> 00:17:59,761
Which ex of yours decided to show up again?

260
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:00,935
Huh?

261
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,238
None.

262
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:07,275
And I didn’t do anything wrong.

263
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:08,750
Fine, then.

264
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:12,846
Shall we get inside?

265
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,318
You sure?

266
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:18,757
Let’s go.

267
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:21,058
Hey.

268
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:21,813
Hurry up.

269
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:26,593
I’ll go anywhere

270
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:27,787
as long as I’m with you.

271
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:30,612
I’m very happy tonight.
