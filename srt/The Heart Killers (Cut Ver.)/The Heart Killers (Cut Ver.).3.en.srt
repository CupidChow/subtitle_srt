1
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:06,243
Good morning, there.

2
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:11,274
Fadel, Fadel, Fadel!

3
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:12,971
You suddenly live at my pace.

4
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,276
Morning jogging, grocery shopping,
showing up at my burger joint,

5
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:16,491
and now frequenting the same gym?

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,673
Stop following me.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,114
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

8
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:23,043
Don’t you think we should
just keep it casual between you and me?

9
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:24,646
I don’t want no casual.

10
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:25,943
You’ve still got a lot to prove.

11
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:29,100
Make sure he knows he really matters to you.

12
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:44,883
You have a meeting with Senator Vichai at 4.30.

13
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,254
Right.

14
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:48,459
Then dinner with Mr. Boonterm at 7.

15
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:50,482
I’ve got all the documents prepared.

16
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:53,978
What about our important meeting?

17
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:55,352
They’re waiting in your office.

18
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:56,176
Good.

19
00:00:57,594 --> 00:01:00,891
Don’t let anyone in there
until I’m done talking to them.

20
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:01,488
Yes.

21
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:02,284
Of course.

22
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:04,919
Ms. Lilly.

23
00:01:05,454 --> 00:01:08,352
We need you to sign this month’s financial report.

24
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:11,545
You want me to sign it here?

25
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:14,867
Shouldn’t you have put that on my desk?

26
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,166
I’m sorry.

27
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:39,764
Your new job.

28
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:41,164
Who is he, Mother?

29
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:42,568
Someone important.

30
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:43,742
He’s a big shot.

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,624
Why does he deserve this?

32
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:48,712
I see him on the news for helping poor children

33
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:49,759
and charity.

34
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,663
He’s never done anything bad.

35
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:54,208
Bison, dear.

36
00:01:54,743 --> 00:01:57,002
You’ve always been easily deceived by appearance.

37
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:00,439
It’s all for show.

38
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:03,726
He acts like a saint.

39
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:05,058
But it’s just a facade to mask all his crimes.

40
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:12,706
He’s the man behind corruptions, drugs,
human trafficking, and so much more.

41
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:14,385
It would take me forever to list everything.

42
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:16,377
But for this kill,

43
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:19,192
you need to make it a spectacle.

44
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,462
They need to send a message to the other big shots.

45
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:23,187
One more thing,

46
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:26,243
this could be dangerous.

47
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:29,492
But I believe in you two.

48
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,252
Of course, Mother.

49
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:38,718
But it’d be better

50
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:40,497
if you let me take a little break.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,644
Fadel!

52
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,281
What’s the matter, Bison?

53
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:46,860
Do you want to stop?

54
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:48,968
Do I not pay you enough for this?

55
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:49,876
Well?

56
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:52,793
Or…

57
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,608
Are you seeing someone?

58
00:02:57,936 --> 00:02:58,963
Well, Fadel?

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,214
Is your brother seeing someone right now?

60
00:03:00,936 --> 00:03:03,136
You can tell me, love.

61
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:04,923
Well?

62
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:06,848
There’s no one, Mother.

63
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,016
I promise we’ll take care of this thing.

64
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:14,007
Don’t worry.

65
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:18,274
Don’t quit so soon, my dear.

66
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,218
Work with me.

67
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,857
We’re all each other’s got.

68
00:03:24,142 --> 00:03:24,747
Right?

69
00:03:25,523 --> 00:03:27,639
Excuse us.

70
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,307
I guess we’ll do it.

71
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:44,416
If you think Fadel and Bison might not make it,

72
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,752
do you want me to help them out?

73
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:48,813
You’re already doing well at the office,

74
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:51,828
and you’re not as adept on the field as they are.

75
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:54,769
You still have so much to learn.

76
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:09,627
One beer, please.

77
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:10,947
You’re always here alone.

78
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:12,348
Why not go have fun with everyone?

79
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,298
I’m good.

80
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:14,604
I’m having the time of my life here.

81
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:25,213
Hello. Hi.

82
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:26,738
Cheers.

83
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,345
Long live rock and rolls.

84
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:34,715
Oh, hey.

85
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:39,951
To think I’d run into you here.

86
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:41,757
You like heavy metal?

87
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,163
You don’t look the type.

88
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,333
You’re supposed to have fun with your friends
at a place like this.

89
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:58,366
You can’t just sit drinking looking mysterious.

90
00:05:58,767 --> 00:05:59,401
Come on.

91
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:00,711
Let’s go dance with me.

92
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:01,410
Come on.

93
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:04,445
I’ve made so many new friends already, you know?

94
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:07,808
No.

95
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:09,951
I can have a good time all by myself.

96
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:13,914
How’d that even work?

97
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:18,484
You need someone to “scream” with.

98
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:21,725
Well, whatever.

99
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,341
I’m here all the time anyway.

100
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,147
This place is so my thing.

101
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:31,093
I’ll make you scream with me one of these days.

102
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,640
Bro, I need a double.

103
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,260
Coming right up.
Double, it is!

104
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:47,155
Follow me, alright?

105
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:00,175
Double, huh?

106
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:15,173
Hey, I’ll be right back.

107
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:30,143
Did you know
they use heavy metal to torture prisoners

108
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:31,627
so they confess?

109
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,391
If I was the warden,

110
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:36,563
I wouldn’t do that.

111
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,584
What if it was me?

112
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,009
What’d you do
to torture the truth out of me?

113
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:46,982
Would you kiss…

114
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:51,588
or choke me?

115
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:01,689
You’ll know.

116
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:08,561
You look kinda sexy tonight.

117
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:28,990
Mind if I join you?

118
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,259
You’ve been following me.

119
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,740
Me?

120
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,315
This is the nearest onsen around here.

121
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,938
I’m a regular.

122
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:52,287
Maybe it’s you
who’s been following me.

123
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:05,891
You’ve got a tattoo on your back?

124
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:08,757
I didn’t notice it that night.

125
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:09,934
I was busy with…

126
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:13,340
With what?

127
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,224
Can I see?

128
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,997
“If I be…”

129
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:22,982
What does it mean?

130
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,194
“If you piss me off,”

131
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:30,193
“careful of my fist.”

132
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:33,261
Really?

133
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:36,601
Where is that from?

134
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:40,504
It’s from one of Shakespeare’s books.

135
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:42,374
Babe is a fan.

136
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:44,251
I asked him to pick some cool quotes for me.

137
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:46,502
This is my favorite.

138
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:48,170
It’s about bees.

139
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,525
“If I be waspish,”

140
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,269
“best beware my sting.”

141
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,767
Scary.

142
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:06,845
I’m just saying that.

143
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:09,138
You know I’m actually just a baby.

144
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:12,791
You’re much scarier than I am.

145
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,756
I’m scary?

146
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:18,788
Look at me.

147
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:22,718
Do I look like I can hurt anyone?

148
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:28,953
But I get what you mean.

149
00:11:30,425 --> 00:11:31,912
If they did me wrong,

150
00:11:33,063 --> 00:11:34,199
I’d get them back.

151
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:39,410
What’d you do to them?

152
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:41,344
You want to know?

153
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:52,513
Oww, hey!

154
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:55,270
That’s what they’d get.

155
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,865
That’s just a sample.

156
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:01,257
But if you don’t mean me harm,
then you have nothing to be afraid of.

157
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,225
Stop it.

158
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:10,726
Bye.

159
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:38,056
Anything worth reporting?

160
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:40,136
Did you follow me, Cap?

161
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,939
Well, it’s kinda my job to follow through.

162
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:52,565
All I know right now is that

163
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:54,845
they have the same mother,

164
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:55,987
but different dads.

165
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:04,169
Continue investigating.

166
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,585
Better yet, get inside their house.

167
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,924
I’m sure there’s some leads there.

168
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:14,816
You’re asking me to enter the tigers' lair here.

169
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,767
You know I could get clawed to death, right?

170
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,270
You can do it.

171
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:22,384
Up your game and gain his trust.

172
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:24,781
He’ll lead you right into his house.

173
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,588
Trust me.

174
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,003
What about the big brother?

175
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:34,479
How are you dealing with him?

176
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,212
You sure he won’t get in your way again?

177
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:44,047
My friend is handling him.

178
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:48,698
Does your friend know they’re hitmen?

179
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:53,910
No.

180
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,579
I’ll give you a fair warning.

181
00:13:58,435 --> 00:13:59,645
Don’t tell anyone about this.

182
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,675
The more people know,
the more dangerous it is.

183
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:28,157
Good morning.

184
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:30,735
If you’re here, it’s clearly a bad morning.

185
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:34,884
Hey.

186
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:39,460
Starting the day off on the wrong foot
makes the whole day bad, you know?

187
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,481
Do you like doing cardio?

188
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:47,220
I hate doing cardio after weight training.

189
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,526
It’s boring.

190
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,993
I’m looking for some other form of cardio, though.

191
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:54,882
Is that all you think about all day?

192
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:58,101
Go jerk off if it bothers you so much.

193
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,575
I know I can do it alone.

194
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:04,076
But it burns more calories doing it together.

195
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:09,920
Is that why you won’t leave me alone?

196
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:12,072
You want to sleep with me?

197
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:13,627
May I?

198
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:18,920
I want your body and your…

199
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,528
Heart.

200
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,395
You’re not my type.

201
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:35,658
What’s your type, then?

202
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:37,344
Tell me!

203
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,690
I can be that for you.

204
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:39,997
Hey!

205
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:47,817
Excuse me.

206
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,572
What can we get you today?

207
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:52,393
Ground pork?

208
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:56,710
We grind… the pork ourselves here.

209
00:15:57,058 --> 00:15:59,598
It will sure make some good burgers.

210
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,226
Do you work here full-time now?

211
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:04,468
If you’re here every day,

212
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,733
then I’m here every day.

213
00:16:07,322 --> 00:16:11,282
I’ll give you some fresh meat daily.

214
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:16,781
Oh, you don’t want it?

215
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:20,094
My meat is sweet, I tell you!

216
00:16:22,235 --> 00:16:23,422
Auntie, I’ll be back.

217
00:16:23,422 --> 00:16:24,525
I have to win that guy over.

218
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,269
Alright.

219
00:16:26,982 --> 00:16:28,257
I’m rooting for you.

220
00:16:28,257 --> 00:16:29,106
Do your best.

221
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:29,920
Thanks.

222
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,424
Welcome to Heart Burger.

223
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,960
Please have a seat.

224
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,378
Here’s the menu.

225
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:44,322
What would you like?

226
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:47,680
One cheeseburger and some water, please.

227
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:50,836
Please have a seat.

228
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:54,000
Hello.

229
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,172
Here’s the menu.

230
00:16:55,386 --> 00:16:56,353
Come on in.

231
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:57,661
This place is a must.

232
00:16:57,661 --> 00:17:00,661
- It’s cheesy and juicy.
- I’ll be back to take your order shortly.

233
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:02,082
Come on in.

234
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,241
It goes down easy and agrees with your stomach.

235
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,672
Come on over.

236
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,941
Can I have a photo?

237
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:09,233
Of course.

238
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,359
Let’s do it.

239
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:16,790
One, two, three.

240
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:19,886
Alright. Thank you.

241
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:20,925
Come on this way.

242
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:24,012
Come here for some juicy and cheesy burgers.

243
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:25,191
It’s a must.

244
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:26,271
Don’t miss it.

245
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,069
Come right in.

246
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,620
- You won’t regret it—
- What the hell do you think you’re doing?

247
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,214
I’m spreading the word about your place.

248
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:32,667
I’m doing it for free, mind you.

249
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:34,209
Stop it.

250
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:36,128
I didn’t ask you to do this.

251
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:38,422
You didn’t have to.

252
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,105
It’s a great strategy to attract customers.

253
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,849
Don’t you know how many burger joints there are?

254
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:46,757
We gotta stand out to survive.

255
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:47,797
One more thing,

256
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:52,612
who would be able to resist
a handsome guy in a costume?

257
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:54,374
They’re here for my burgers,

258
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:56,069
not your theatrics.

259
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:57,383
Who knows?

260
00:17:57,383 --> 00:18:04,520
Maybe they’re here because
the chef is so damn good-looking.

261
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,832
Don’t try to cozy up to me.

262
00:18:08,615 --> 00:18:09,350
Why not?

263
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:10,950
Did that make you blush?

264
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,487
It did, didn’t it?

265
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:15,734
You’re blushing.

266
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:18,219
Take that thing off and go back to your garage.

267
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:19,343
Why?

268
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:21,819
I said take it off.

269
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,216
I won’t!

270
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:25,086
I said I won’t!

271
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:25,910
No!

272
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:34,755
You hungry?

273
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:38,820
That’s so cute.

274
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:42,122
Please come on in.

275
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,040
Welcome.

276
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:50,567
Leave my restaurant alone.

277
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:54,111
Shouldn’t you be cooking at a time like this
instead of telling me off?

278
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:56,181
Your brother isn’t even here to help.

279
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:58,581
But I am.

280
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:00,401
All I ask from you is a little decency.

281
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,798
No.

282
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,314
This is my job.

283
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:04,599
I can handle it myself.

284
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:07,549
Help me up.

285
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:09,233
I can’t get up.

286
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,044
Help me!

287
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,286
Keep it dry for the time being.

288
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,330
Make sure you avoid water.

289
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:28,371
Here as well…

290
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,682
No soap on your tattoo for the next seven days.

291
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:31,789
Of course.

292
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:34,637
Thank you.

293
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,199
What is this?

294
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,155
Are you getting lonely?

295
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:42,135
Is that why you called me over to your studio?

296
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:45,479
Well, you said I can’t go to your place.

297
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,185
And since Babe is home at night, I can’t have you over.

298
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:51,873
This is the only place we can meet during the day.

299
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:54,001
I don’t see an issue here.

300
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:55,472
We can just book a hotel.

301
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:58,083
Hotels are for hookups.

302
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,994
I want to see you every day.

303
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:02,502
Who meets their boyfriend at a hotel?

304
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:04,421
I’d prefer your place.

305
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:07,508
Jumping the gun, are we?

306
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:10,341
I’m not your boyfriend.

307
00:20:10,662 --> 00:20:11,534
What are you talking about?

308
00:20:12,284 --> 00:20:13,408
One more thing,

309
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:15,314
I don’t think Fadel will let you step foot inside my house.

310
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:20,493
So?

311
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:21,751
You called me over just to chat?

312
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:24,345
Look at this.

313
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:27,896
I called you over for the cat tattoo.

314
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:30,249
You left it here last time, remember?

315
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:36,321
You like it?

316
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,015
It’s nice.

317
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:41,232
But I don’t want a cat tattoo anymore.

318
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,334
I think it makes me look too cute.

319
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:45,100
I want something cool.

320
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:50,423
You can get any cuter than this?

321
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,702
I can barely resist you as you are.

322
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:07,536
Ow!

323
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:25,574
Do you like it rough or something?

324
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:33,938
Can you handle it?

325
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:39,591
If you like it, I can handle it.

326
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:45,802
What if I told you I’m into… bondages and whips?

327
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,498
Are you the S or the M?

328
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:50,184
I prefer to be in control.

329
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:54,701
You didn’t mention that the first night we met.

330
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,147
Who’d tell a total stranger their sexual preference?

331
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,189
Do you trust me now, then?

332
00:22:08,257 --> 00:22:09,550
Not 100%.

333
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:17,039
What do I have to do

334
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,447
for you to trust me 100%?

335
00:22:35,793 --> 00:22:37,616
We could be the perfect match.

336
00:22:38,446 --> 00:22:41,076
Your stuff sure… fits me perfectly.
