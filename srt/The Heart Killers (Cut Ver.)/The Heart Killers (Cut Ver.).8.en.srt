1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,731
Make them fall in love with us.

2
00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:07,718
That’s when we kill them.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,757
Cheers!

4
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:13,477
Bison!

5
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,591
We still have to see the northern lights together.

6
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:16,844
I quit.

7
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:20,436
If you don’t want to get in trouble,
go home and be with your little brother.

8
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:29,157
Untie me and I’ll help you look for your brother.

9
00:00:29,402 --> 00:00:30,913
I know you work for the police.

10
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:31,920
Jump!

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,246
Once I find my brother,

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,928
I’m going to kill you and your friend.

13
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,115
Pull over here.

14
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,992
Why are we at a motel?

15
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:11,184
Did you get turned on while we were on the way or what?

16
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:15,620
Stop talking and hop off.

17
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:17,005
What?

18
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:21,117
I’m just curious so I know what to expect.

19
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:22,197
It’s not like I can just turn the switch on, you know?

20
00:01:25,776 --> 00:01:27,012
I’m not sleeping with you.

21
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:28,873
This is where I told Bison to go.

22
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,395
Now get off.

23
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:35,321
I’ll wait here.

24
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:40,373
No.

25
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:43,136
You come with me.

26
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:45,497
Walk ahead of me, actually.

27
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:47,239
Get off.

28
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:18,623
He used to come here,

29
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:20,639
but I haven’t seen him in a while.

30
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:23,390
Oh, you were always here with him.

31
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,583
You were, last time, too.

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,214
I want to know if he was here recently.

33
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:29,428
No.

34
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:30,649
I don’t think so.

35
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,648
Did something happen?

36
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:35,427
Did he run away from home?

37
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes, actually.

38
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,745
He’s my boyfriend’s brother.

39
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,986
He’s a troubled kid so he ran away.

40
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:44,341
Ran off with a dude.

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,123
We’re worried about him so we’re looking for him.

42
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:47,830
I see.

43
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,851
He didn’t come this way.

44
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,550
And don’t waste your time looking for him.

45
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,798
You ought to let these kids have fun all they want.

46
00:02:55,798 --> 00:02:58,561
They’ll come back when they’re sick of each other.

47
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:01,828
We parents can only do so much to take care of them,

48
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:04,481
but their hearts are out of our control.

49
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:07,618
Well, what about you two?

50
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:08,994
Need a room?

51
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:09,985
Yes.

52
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:10,654
No.

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,329
Hey.

54
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,020
Come on.

55
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:16,044
I’ve been driving all this way.

56
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,116
Can’t we just take a rest for a night?

57
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:21,107
It’s not like we’ll find your brother soon.

58
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,425
Isn’t it better to just get our sleep and think?

59
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,952
We can’t waste time.

60
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:25,911
We need to go.

61
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:29,075
We need to go?

62
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,281
My arms are sore from driving.

63
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:33,359
I can’t possibly drive like this.

64
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:37,001
Come on.

65
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,625
Just stay for the night.

66
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,082
Don’t you feel sorry for your boyfriend?

67
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:44,128
He’s literally begging.

68
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:45,883
He’s not my boyfriend.

69
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:47,674
He’s not?

70
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:49,325
It’s alright.

71
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:52,561
Let me put you up in the suite.

72
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,820
I’ll even give you free condoms and lube.

73
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:25,448
The narc habits are hard to kick, huh?

74
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:43,655
Your house?

75
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:45,196
Yeah.

76
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:47,068
Got a problem with that?

77
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:49,629
No.

78
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:52,917
You’re one hell of a wimp for a snitch.

79
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:56,867
Were you actually weak or faking it?

80
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,672
I wasn’t faking.

81
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:03,497
I just really don’t like the ocean.

82
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:05,543
I need a better excuse than that.

83
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:08,834
People have their fears, you know?

84
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,940
You didn’t seem to fear anything when you decided to fool me.

85
00:07:12,803 --> 00:07:13,698
Think I’m easy, huh?

86
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:16,991
You don’t know me, Kant.

87
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,476
Give me a chance to explain.

88
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,743
I have my reason.

89
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,548
What the hell is that?

90
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:33,636
The only reason is that you’re an asshole.

91
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:37,069
I’ll tell you everything.

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,076
But please give me a chance.

93
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:45,534
Your chance has run out.

94
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,212
The rest of your life

95
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:50,744
is to spend making up to me

96
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:53,162
for the way you made me feel.

97
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:55,914
And what did I make you feel?

98
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:02,513
Say it.

99
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:04,106
Say what you feel for me.

100
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,276
Give me a chance to explain myself.

101
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:15,075
And after that,

102
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:18,190
you can do whatever you want to me.

103
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,552
You’re in no position to negotiate.

104
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:24,424
The rest of your life belongs to me.

105
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,644
You’re going to die here.

106
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,611
Your wound still hurts?

107
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,750
Be careful.

108
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:43,756
Stay out of my business.

109
00:08:57,608 --> 00:08:59,363
So we got out of one car to sleep in another?

110
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,012
Don’t you have any other room?

111
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:03,903
No, I don’t.

112
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:05,791
The place is fully booked.

113
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,731
I don’t know what’s in the air today,

114
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:10,437
but it seems everyone just wants to get laid tonight.

115
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,636
It’s alright.

116
00:09:12,808 --> 00:09:14,230
I love the theme.

117
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:15,701
Fast.

118
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,287
Hard.

119
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:19,355
Furious.

120
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:26,206
Well, get comfy, then.

121
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:27,174
Here’s the complimentary gifts.

122
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:28,374
I’ll put them here.

123
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,364
Damn.

124
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:41,546
I’ve never been to a motel like this,

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,574
and I’ve never had sex in a car as well.

126
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:51,360
Kinda like a fantasy, don’t you think?

127
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:57,341
Doing it in a car

128
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:01,637
with a mechanic.

129
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:09,374
You like that?

130
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,924
What the hell?

131
00:10:45,674 --> 00:10:46,778
I ain’t running away, you know?

132
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:49,636
I don’t trust you.

133
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:52,541
And if I need to take a piss?

134
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:54,725
Tell me and I’ll uncuff you.

135
00:10:56,368 --> 00:10:59,408
What about these complimentary gifts?

136
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,265
Not gonna use them?

137
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,254
How about… chains and whips?

138
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:08,603
I’m all in.

139
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:11,956
Didn’t you say you’re tired?

140
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:15,750
I bet it’s because you run your mouth too much.

141
00:11:17,295 --> 00:11:18,399
Shut up and go to sleep.

142
00:11:45,978 --> 00:11:47,363
Before you kill me,

143
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:51,485
can you do me a favor?

144
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:01,313
Tell my dad I love him.

145
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:07,288
Tell him to take care of himself.

146
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,059
If the garage becomes too taxing on him,
tell him to quit it.

147
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,176
Tell him to spend his savings on traveling and fishing trips.

148
00:12:22,082 --> 00:12:23,343
When I die,

149
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:28,831
I’ll probably see my mother.

150
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:31,841
She died when I was a kid.

151
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:37,064
And just tell Dad…

152
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:43,248
I’ll take care of her up there.

153
00:12:54,746 --> 00:12:56,003
Are you crying?

154
00:12:59,656 --> 00:13:00,455
Duh.

155
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:05,136
I know I talk all big,

156
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,003
but even I am afraid of death.

157
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:21,834
Stop being dramatic and just go to sleep.

158
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:23,927
I don’t want to hear your sob story.

159
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,443
What is this?

160
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:31,365
Don’t you know what a fishing net is?

161
00:14:31,365 --> 00:14:32,666
Of course I do.

162
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,988
I’m asking what you want me to do with it.

163
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,018
I’m hardly asking you to tailor a suit out of it, am I?

164
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:38,867
Oh, come on.

165
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:40,169
It’s not unheard of.

166
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:41,503
I’ve seen it done before.

167
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:42,817
Don’t mess with me.

168
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,252
Catch some fish.

169
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,636
Hey.

170
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:50,773
I’m no fisherman.

171
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,737
And you know…

172
00:14:58,003 --> 00:14:59,199
I can’t get in the water.

173
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,282
Then you’re going to starve to death.

174
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,210
I’m not here to feed you.

175
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:09,699
Okay.

176
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:11,691
I’ll try.

177
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:14,843
But can you at least let me call my brother?

178
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,200
I don’t want him to worry about me.

179
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,520
You ain’t in no place to make requests.

180
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,638
Know how generous I am to spare your brother.

181
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,600
Hey.

182
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:24,843
Don’t hurt him.

183
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,643
This is entirely on me.

184
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,620
My brother and my friend have nothing to do with this.

185
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,600
If you’re going to blame someone,

186
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,734
blame it on me.

187
00:15:35,063 --> 00:15:35,909
Cool as hell.

188
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,207
Too late, though.

189
00:15:38,795 --> 00:15:40,348
If you really loved your brother,

190
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:42,837
you shouldn’t have said yes to this job.

191
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:46,640
That’s exactly why I took it.

192
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:48,084
If I didn’t,

193
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:51,287
Captain was going to reopen my cases.

194
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:54,386
And if I went to jail,

195
00:15:55,072 --> 00:15:56,227
Babe wouldn’t be able to live.

196
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,286
I’m all he has.

197
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,430
You don’t have to feel sorry for me.

198
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:06,113
But please think about Babe.

199
00:16:06,113 --> 00:16:07,111
I don’t freaking care.

200
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,971
It’s a poor excuse.

201
00:16:09,486 --> 00:16:10,817
You’re going to die here.

202
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,049
Don’t think you’ll ever see Babe again.

203
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:19,792
Maybe I’ll be generous, after all.

204
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,486
I might burn you to the ground and send the ashes to your brother.

205
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:28,137
Pick it up and catch some fish.

206
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:35,426
Do it!

207
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:00,006
Get in the water.

208
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,942
You’ll never catch anything in shallow water.

209
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:07,705
Can’t we just eat something else?

210
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:09,190
I really can’t do this.

211
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,252
Sure.

212
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:13,476
What would you like?

213
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,964
Kurobuta pork?

214
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:16,208
Wagyu beef?

215
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,484
Salmon?

216
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:19,332
Really?

217
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:20,743
I love salmon.

218
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:22,157
Sure.

219
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:24,064
I’ll send it as an offering.

220
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,284
You’ll be fed when you’re in hell.

221
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:27,000
How about that?

222
00:17:41,262 --> 00:17:42,231
Keep going.

223
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,009
Hey.

224
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,671
There ain’t no fish around here.

225
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,535
Only trash and plastic bottles.

226
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:17,238
How irresponsible to throw these bottles into the ocean.

227
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:19,469
What if it killed Nemo?

228
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:21,549
This is no time to be environmentally conscious.

229
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,851
Catch some fish!

230
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,312
And pick up the trash.

231
00:18:35,268 --> 00:18:37,416
Yeah, as if I’d catch anything.

232
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,397
What did you say?

233
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,445
I really do love you, Bison.

234
00:18:58,445 --> 00:19:00,047
I said shut up!

235
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,480
Something’s wrong with your car.

236
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,404
Push it.

237
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:03,269
Are you insane?

238
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:04,193
Push it where?
