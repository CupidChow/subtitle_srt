1
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:07,384
Lilly killed your parents

2
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:08,755
with her own hands!

3
00:00:09,673 --> 00:00:11,500
That’s why you need to let me help you.

4
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:13,974
I’ll help you start over with me.

5
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:15,769
We split into two teams.

6
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:17,553
Kant and I will dig up anything we can find on Lilly.

7
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:19,459
You and Style go after Keen.

8
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:21,254
Her birthday is coming up.

9
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:25,226
I want some young things like you
to take care of her and her friends.

10
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:26,966
He didn’t leave you.

11
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:29,163
Mother put a hit on him.

12
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:30,448
There’s no need to be afraid.

13
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,040
You and I will be fine.

14
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:11,582
(Let’s make a deal.)

15
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:13,398
(You get me dirt on Lilly,)

16
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:14,931
(and I’ll spare your boyfriend’s life.)

17
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:17,746
(This is why I never trusted you to take care of these things.)

18
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:19,558
(I knew I was only going to be disappointed.)

19
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:29,386
That’s everything I can dig up on Mother.

20
00:01:30,763 --> 00:01:32,201
Financial transactions

21
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,709
and everything about her employees…

22
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:36,919
That’s all I could find.

23
00:01:38,593 --> 00:01:40,682
You’re not thinking about stabbing us in the back, are you?

24
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:42,956
I’m not!

25
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:45,509
I want to get away from her as much as you do.

26
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:51,336
I just want my boyfriend back.

27
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:53,688
I was used, just like you were.

28
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:57,179
Bison.

29
00:01:58,421 --> 00:01:59,072
Go get him.

30
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:12,465
Nont.

31
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,573
Hold it.

32
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:15,196
You’ll get your hug soon.

33
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:18,915
But if you’re being tricky in any way,

34
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:22,349
I promise you’ll die in each other’s arms.

35
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:24,112
Listen to me.

36
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:26,605
I wanna live a good, normal life, too.

37
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:28,829
I want to be with the one I love.

38
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:33,298
I don’t want anything to do with killing people anymore.

39
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:35,074
All this time,

40
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:37,927
I just thought that

41
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,405
if I could make her happy,

42
00:02:41,323 --> 00:02:42,385
she’d let me go.

43
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,480
But as it turned out,

44
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:49,018
no matter how good I am,

45
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:52,013
she just wouldn’t let me go.

46
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:04,032
Are you okay?

47
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:05,585
I’m alright.

48
00:03:24,952 --> 00:03:26,394
What are you going to do to Mother?

49
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,498
What?

50
00:03:28,254 --> 00:03:29,519
Are you still worried about her?

51
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:30,675
No, I’m not.

52
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,888
I’m just going to say that

53
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:34,443
if you need my help with anything,

54
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,305
I’m here.

55
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:40,246
I want to see her downfall, too.

56
00:03:58,586 --> 00:03:59,980
Whoa.

57
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:04,525
I almost shed tears seeing how much they love each other.

58
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:08,092
I’d have done the same thing for you.

59
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:14,884
What are you going to do with this information?

60
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,176
I’m going to kill her.

61
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:20,535
Don’t do it.

62
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:22,540
I don’t want you to kill anyone again.

63
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,357
What will you have me do?

64
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:28,231
Let me watch my parents’ murderer live a happy life?

65
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:31,009
That’s not what I’m saying.

66
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:34,141
I just think there are other ways.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,591
I want to be sure

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,389
that the two of you have a chance to make it.

69
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:45,919
What do you suggest?

70
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:52,346
I’ll talk to Captain Chris in case there’s anything he can do.

71
00:04:53,346 --> 00:04:54,401
Will he agree to help?

72
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:56,152
Doesn’t he want us in jail?

73
00:04:57,124 --> 00:05:00,417
This is just a matter of negotiating.

74
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:15,603
Don’t worry.

75
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:19,384
We’ll do anything to keep you out of jail.

76
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,662
How was your bath, Cap?

77
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:34,857
What are you doing here?

78
00:06:34,857 --> 00:06:36,263
I definitely didn’t call for you.

79
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:39,419
And I sure as hell won’t work with you again.

80
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,286
We have a deal for you.

81
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:45,664
What deal?

82
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,841
Hurry up and spit it out.

83
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,248
I have to go pick my kid up from school.

84
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:51,116
Tell him, bud.

85
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:56,364
If you can keep Fadel and Bison out of jail,

86
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:59,554
we’ll help you get the people behind their operation.

87
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,073
And how would you do that?

88
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:06,588
You couldn’t even help falling in love with them while investigating.

89
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:10,618
They’ve agreed to cooperate.

90
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:13,499
We’ll get you the big fish you want.

91
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,302
But right now…

92
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,141
I can only give you the smaller fish.

93
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,876
If you can do what you say,

94
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:50,568
I’ll do everything I can.

95
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:54,519
Promise is a promise, Cap.

96
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:04,932
Hey.

97
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:06,558
This is my friend, Tong.

98
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:07,706
He works in Khaosan.

99
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,335
He’s an expert on fake ID and passports.

100
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,292
What are you doing?

101
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:21,287
Making you a fake passport, duh.

102
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:22,076
In case you need to run.

103
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:24,695
Didn’t you say Kant made a deal with that captain?

104
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:27,413
I don’t trust him.

105
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,004
Cops are always looking for ways to up their ranks, right?

106
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,188
What would I do if he had you beat?

107
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:36,035
Where do you think I’ll go with a fake passport?

108
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,384
You can go somewhere close by first.

109
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,780
You just have to cross a border,

110
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,120
then fly from there.

111
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,793
You call me after that and I’ll fly to you.

112
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:47,608
We can fly back here after everything dies down.

113
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:52,572
It takes 20 years for these cases to expire.

114
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:54,898
We’ll be old men by that time.

115
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,288
So what if we’re old?

116
00:08:57,314 --> 00:08:58,447
I’ll still wanna be with you.

117
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:11,898
Thank you

118
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:14,407
for doing all this for me.

119
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,396
I don’t think I love myself half as much as you love me.

120
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:23,776
Trust me on this.

121
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:25,063
Just get this done.

122
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:26,929
We don’t know what could happen.

123
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:28,931
I’ll get Bison one as well.

124
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:33,431
This friend of yours,

125
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,263
can we trust him?

126
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:36,705
Of course.

127
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:38,572
We’ve been friends since high school.

128
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,609
Dude got me into nightclubs since we were barely 20.

129
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,732
Thank you for coming with me to pick Babe up.

130
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:00,651
Of course.

131
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,563
It’s me who has to thank you.

132
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:05,780
I’ve always wanted a brother, you know that?

133
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:07,448
It’s boring being an only child.

134
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:11,531
I’d love you to be my family.

135
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,277
It was difficult, wasn’t it?

136
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:20,498
I’ll have to get it done quickly.
Sure.

137
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:21,343
See you.

138
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:24,310
Bye.

139
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,980
He’s here.

140
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,176
Hey.

141
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,475
How was school?

142
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:38,816
Are the bullies still bothering you?

143
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:40,278
Not at all.

144
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,591
Who’d dare after you kicked their butts that day?

145
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:45,866
You gotta tell me if the bullies are back, alright?

146
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,717
What would you do?

147
00:10:47,717 --> 00:10:49,226
I’ll just teach them a few lessons.

148
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:51,290
They gotta know not to mess with my little brother.

149
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:02,920
You hungry?

150
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:12,444
Hey, I’m gonna go to the toilet real quick.

151
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:14,119
Why don’t you and Babe wait in the car?

152
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:15,408
Okay.

153
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:16,457
Let’s go.

154
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,392
What should we have for dinner?

155
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:21,079
You decide.

156
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,223
He’s a smart kid.

157
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,351
He’s also a good basketball player.

158
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:46,175
Ladies,

159
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:50,119
let’s make a birthday toast for our Lady Anusara Suthasini.

160
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:54,305
- Cheers. 
- Happy birthday.

161
00:11:56,033 --> 00:12:00,022
Thank you for hosting such a fun party for me.

162
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:02,879
It’s been a while since I last enjoyed myself so much.

163
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,412
I’ve still got another surprise for you, ma’am.

164
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:06,446
You do?

165
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:10,510
Guys, come in.

166
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:22,049
These boys are taking care of us tonight, ladies.

167
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:25,604
I guarantee you full satisfaction.

168
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:32,285
Isn’t this boy…

169
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,425
the one we met at the golf club?

170
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,871
Yes.

171
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:41,753
I remember you saying he’s good at what he does.

172
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:43,586
I asked him to come.

173
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:45,087
Well…

174
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:48,637
his friend is quite cute, too.

175
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:50,967
If you like them,

176
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,973
they’re both all yours.

177
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:59,893
You’re the best, dear.

178
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:01,781
You always know just what’s on my mind.

179
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,104
I promise you, after this party,

180
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:10,214
I’ll make sure my husband gives you a seat at the table.

181
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,322
Thank you.

182
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:17,621
You two.

183
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,447
Take good care of their lady.

184
00:13:20,284 --> 00:13:23,399
She is my VIP guest.

185
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:25,564
- Yes, ma’am.
- Yes, ma’am.

186
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:30,404
Would you like some wine, ma’am?

187
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:16,110
Happy birthday to you.

188
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,143
I’m going to make a wish, guys.

189
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:28,725
I wish you more happy and sexy years to come.

190
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:30,252
Thank you, dear.

191
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:32,398
I guess I don’t have to get you a present,

192
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:34,629
since I already gave you two tonight.

193
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,889
I must say…

194
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:42,358
The present is definitely to my taste.

195
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,297
Come sit here.

196
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:51,654
You’re good at your job.

197
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:54,688
Your friend is, too.

198
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:57,329
He knows just what to say.

199
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,511
It’s guys like you who’ll make it in the world.

200
00:15:03,726 --> 00:15:04,757
How so, ma’am?

201
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,638
If you have that lady bewitched,

202
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,208
you’ll be well taken care of.

203
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:13,121
Seize the chance.

204
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:15,225
You don’t know if it’s ever coming your way again.

205
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:18,114
You’re right.

206
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:22,081
When the chance presents itself,
I have to grab it with both hands.

207
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:24,878
I won’t let it slip out of my grasp.

208
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:28,804
Style.

209
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:32,492
Why don’t you pour Ms. Lilly and the lady some more wine?

210
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:33,795
I’m out of wine.

211
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:37,095
Of course.

212
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:39,869
You’re really something!

213
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:56,851
Here you go.

214
00:15:57,769 --> 00:15:58,945
Thanks.

215
00:16:00,295 --> 00:16:01,885
Let’s hear it for our lady.

216
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:05,856
Cheers!

217
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:10,240
Bottoms up, milady.

218
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:24,149
Mind if I pick a song?

219
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,629
I’d love to sing with you, Ms. Lilly.

220
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:28,043
No.

221
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,429
I don’t sing.

222
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:32,473
And don’t you dare try to sucker up to me.

223
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:34,349
You’re here for her.

224
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:36,448
Of course.

225
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:57,499
Here you go.

226
00:16:58,174 --> 00:16:59,904
You should sing us something.

227
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:01,257
What should I sing?

228
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,256
How about “I Love You”?

229
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:07,662
Oh, there it is.

230
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,532
Sing with me, ladies.

231
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:10,207
Of course.

232
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:20,861
What now?

233
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:23,138
I told you I wouldn’t do it again after the last guy.

234
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,065
This is the last hit.

235
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:26,223
You can go your way after that.

236
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:31,672
Fine.

237
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:34,245
How do you want me to kill them?

238
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:37,047
Bullet or poison?

239
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:45,535
I have to grab this chance with both hands.

240
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:48,144
I won’t let it slip out of my grasp.

241
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:53,553
Who are you?

242
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,366
Hello.

243
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:58,608
I’m dating your son, Mother.

244
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:01,468
Dear.

245
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:04,223
What is all this?

246
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,274
What did you do?

247
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:09,232
It’s nothing.

248
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,202
It’s not “nothing.”

249
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:13,147
That’s you on the screen, isn’t it?

250
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,590
I need to go to the bathroom.

251
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,417
That’s Ms. Lilly, isn’t it?

252
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:21,432
It’s her.

253
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:24,285
It’s her!

254
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,596
Fadel.

255
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,622
Bison.

256
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:05,988
What are you doing here, my sons?

257
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,485
We’re not your sons.

258
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:12,059
Bison, how could you say that?

259
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,390
I’m your mother.

260
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:15,636
Mother?

261
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:17,475
Mother?

262
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:19,514
My mother is dead!

263
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:22,026
You killed her.

264
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:28,391
You put a hit on the man I loved,

265
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:30,746
because you didn’t want me to quit this job,

266
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,479
and you still dare call yourself my mother?

267
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,840
You never think of us as your sons.

268
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:39,719
You only keep us for your image,

269
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:42,906
so we could do your dirty work for you.

270
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,178
I did it with good intentions.

271
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,794
There is no point getting your heart broken by some temporary love—

272
00:19:47,794 --> 00:19:48,998
Shut up!

273
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:55,160
You never love anyone.

274
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:57,158
How would you know what love is?

275
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:58,748
She does know love.

276
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:02,003
But the only thing she loves is herself.

277
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:05,266
We will finally live our lives

278
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,330
without her.

279
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:14,328
Listen.

280
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:17,600
If I don’t make it out of this mess,

281
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,736
so won’t you.

282
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:21,704
You kill people.

283
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:24,160
You’re getting locked up just like me!

284
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:26,076
Don’t worry about us.

285
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:27,710
We have plans.

286
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:33,402
We’re getting out of this profession
with your dead body as our final masterpiece!

287
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:38,056
Bison.

288
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:42,638
Can you really kill your own mother?

289
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:44,622
You’re not my mother!

290
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:50,907
Hey!

291
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:55,994
Don’t do it.

292
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:58,999
You promised me.

293
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:01,662
You promised you won’t kill anyone again.

294
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:07,783
Don’t fall for her trick.

295
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:12,989
You said you wanted to live a normal life.

296
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:18,353
It’s going to happen soon.

297
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:23,422
But if you shoot her,

298
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:27,920
there won’t be ‘us.’

299
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:46,446
Fadel.

300
00:21:51,118 --> 00:21:53,168
I want a future with you.

301
00:21:56,544 --> 00:21:57,863
Just forget the past.

302
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:22,862
You two should go.

303
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,236
We’ll deal with things here.

304
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:27,732
Don’t worry.

305
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:29,652
We’ll see each other again.

306
00:22:35,243 --> 00:22:36,211
Take the gun.

307
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:42,168
Be careful.

308
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:02,577
Take this car and drive to the border.

309
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:03,240
Stop!

310
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:05,899
Can I ask you one thing, Cap?
