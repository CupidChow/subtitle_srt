1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,685
I’ve got another job for you.

2
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:08,629
Get close to some hitmen.

3
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:09,698
What’s your name?

4
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:10,568
Bison.

5
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:11,236
What the hell are you doing?

6
00:00:12,374 --> 00:00:13,984
What do I have to do if I want to be the first guy to take you out?

7
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,154
Win Fadel over.

8
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:16,400
You want me to hit on that jerk?

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,563
Give me your dad’s car.

10
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:18,352
- Deal.
- Deal.

11
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,863
I’d be dancing so close to you.

12
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:23,592
Let go!

13
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:26,876
I’m gonna take you out!

14
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,480
You’re friends?

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,698
Ugh, wait.

16
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:44,966
Hold on.

17
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,388
He’s way too heavy.

18
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:48,958
What the hell are you whining about now?

19
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:51,290
We’ve dealt with much heavier trash.

20
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:55,203
You’ve been slacking off.

21
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:57,716
Where’s your mind at?

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,928
Don’t blame me.

23
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:02,412
I’m neat like I always am with all my jobs.

24
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:03,445
Neat?

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,906
You forgot to bring our gloves.

26
00:01:08,387 --> 00:01:09,889
Come on. It happens.

27
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:13,603
Don’t mix things up.

28
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:17,003
Please, Fadel.

29
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:18,914
Can’t you just give him a chance.

30
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:20,796
He’s just a normal harmless tattooist.

31
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:21,551
His parents are both dead.

32
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:22,527
Now he lives with his brother.

33
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,868
What’s so suspicious about him?

34
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:25,883
He only shows you what he wants you to see.

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,369
The same way he doesn’t know who you really are.

36
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:33,147
What if I want him to know?

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,605
I’ll make sure he’s dead.

38
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:38,054
Come on, Fadel.

39
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:41,766
You know damn well

40
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:43,906
Mother doesn’t want us getting involved with anyone.

41
00:01:49,394 --> 00:01:50,858
So we’re just supposed to live like this?

42
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,253
No social life with anyone else?

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,915
What’s wrong with that?

44
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:58,130
You don’t need anyone else.

45
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,412
Hurry up.

46
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:05,017
Too bad I have an actual beating heart,

47
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:07,000
unlike the dead cold thing in your chest.

48
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:11,359
You talk too much.

49
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:14,489
Uncle.

50
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,444
Three sticky rice and fried pork, please.

51
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:17,550
Of course.

52
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,769
You mind waiting, son?

53
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:20,149
It’s better fresh off the stove.

54
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:21,646
No problem.

55
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:39,720
Excuse me. Make way.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,462
Make way, please.

57
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:44,905
Uncle!

58
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:48,228
I’ll be back.

59
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,389
Can I borrow your cart?

60
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:53,983
What do you need it for?

61
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,316
I’m on my way to sell the fresh produce.

62
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:56,471
Please.

63
00:03:56,724 --> 00:03:58,138
I’ll help you sell it.

64
00:03:58,694 --> 00:04:00,032
I’ll sell it all.

65
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:09,145
Thank you.

66
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:15,525
Excuse me. Make way.

67
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:16,763
Heavy stuff incoming.

68
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:17,725
Make way, please.

69
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:21,286
Oh, I’m sorry.

70
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:22,226
You!

71
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:33,213
You’re in the way.

72
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,114
Look how you ruined my produce.

73
00:04:35,737 --> 00:04:37,348
You work pushing carts in the market?

74
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,970
Yeah, what about it?

75
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,433
You got a problem with that?

76
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,608
Are you looking down on me?

77
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,428
Hey.

78
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:44,045
I haven’t said a thing.

79
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:45,480
I can see it in your eyes.

80
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,347
See how you don’t seem to help me pick them up?

81
00:04:47,347 --> 00:04:48,509
You’re blowing my ears off.

82
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:49,659
When’d I have time to pick them up?

83
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:51,216
And I didn’t do anything wrong.

84
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:53,119
I was just walking when you knocked into me.

85
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,668
If this is the best you can do with a cart, don’t bother.

86
00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:56,085
You’re a menace to everyone else.

87
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,255
Now how’d I sell anything today?

88
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,187
You have to take responsibility for this.

89
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:05,646
What are you talking about?

90
00:05:05,646 --> 00:05:08,213
Don’t you realize every baht I make is hard earned?

91
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:09,830
How unlucky I am to run into a mean guy like you.

92
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,951
My dear fellow hardworking people,

93
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:18,517
listen up.

94
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:23,546
This guy ruined my produce,
and then blamed me and looked down on me.

95
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:25,110
This is just unacceptable!

96
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:27,279
Enough.

97
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,696
- My dear fellow hardworking people.
- Hey!

98
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:29,502
Look at him!

99
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,490
That’s enough!

100
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:33,499
I’ll take responsibility for it.

101
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:38,227
So this is as little as you think of me?

102
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,763
Hey, take it or leave it.

103
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:46,427
Thank you.

104
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:48,995
You humiliated me.

105
00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:51,000
Now it’s my turn.

106
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,418
We’re even.

107
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:00,281
Your produce are all dirty now.

108
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:02,050
I don’t think you can sell them like this.

109
00:06:05,717 --> 00:06:06,762
I’ll clean them up.

110
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:11,435
Excuse me.

111
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes?

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,546
- Can I borrow this?
-  Of course.

113
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:14,171
Thank you.

114
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:15,228
Take it.

115
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:16,269
Thanks.

116
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:34,631
Hey!

117
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,616
You’re supposed to clean the vegetables, not me!

118
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:38,357
Watch out!

119
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:39,675
Hey!

120
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,323
Hey!

121
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,264
There you go.

122
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:07,846
Is this your cat?

123
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:10,824
No.

124
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,155
Just something I came up with.

125
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:16,656
You want a cat tattoo but you don’t have a cat?

126
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:17,881
That’s weird.

127
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,434
I like that they’re unpredictable.

128
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,178
Sometimes they act like they love you and want you,

129
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:26,249
and then go ahead and ignore you.

130
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:28,339
Treat you like a total stranger.

131
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:29,797
It’s challenging.

132
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:32,150
So you love a challenge.

133
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,942
But this is quite detailed.

134
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:35,982
It’s going to take some time.

135
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,515
You’re not afraid of needles, are you?

136
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:41,528
Pain kinda excites me, really.

137
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:46,108
Where would you like it done, dear customer?

138
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:52,085
I don’t know.

139
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:55,745
I’ll print it out and see where it fits.

140
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,794
You decide where you want it.

141
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:14,550
This doesn't look bad.

142
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:16,659
It lines up nicely.

143
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:17,640
I think it’s going to look great.

144
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:20,255
I was thinking I wanted it done on my thigh.

145
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:21,485
What do you think?

146
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,823
It’d peak out when I wear shorts.

147
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:25,469
Quite cool, isn’t it?

148
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:28,209
Let’s try it.

149
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:01,600
How about here?

150
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,440
A little higher.

151
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:15,867
Here?

152
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:18,147
A little higher.

153
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,284
Higher.

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,025
Hey.

155
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:27,578
Any higher than this

156
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:29,780
and it’s not inking we’re doing soon.

157
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:31,930
What are you gonna do?

158
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:39,304
If I start anything here,

159
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:42,048
don’t blame me, Mr. Customer.

160
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:46,246
Inappropriately touching a client is illegal, you know?

161
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:48,812
But I can’t help myself

162
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:50,979
when you’re literally coaxing me into it.

163
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,867
Well, then…

164
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,810
I’ll think about where I want the tattoo to be
and I’ll tell you.

165
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,972
I want it somewhere I can show it off,

166
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:25,650
but also somewhere I can hide easily.

167
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,327
I think…

168
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,093
Having it somewhere discreet might not be bad.

169
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:35,600
Make it exclusive for your special someone.

170
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:39,288
Then I guess no one will ever get to see it,

171
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:42,068
seeing that I don’t have someone like that.

172
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:45,621
It’s all up to you, then.

173
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,038
Just let me know where you want it.

174
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:49,640
I can do it anywhere.

175
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:53,899
Do what?

176
00:11:54,126 --> 00:11:54,948
What’s on your mind?

177
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:57,645
I’m talking about the tattoo, of course.

178
00:11:58,353 --> 00:12:00,307
Anywhere on your body, I’ll etch it.

179
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:04,081
Every nook and cranny.

180
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,125
I’m leaving.

181
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:08,343
See you.

182
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:10,181
I have to help my brother out at the restaurant.

183
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:12,598
Bye.

184
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:21,150
Ain’t no way I’m doing it.

185
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:22,171
Style.

186
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:23,609
You can’t give up now.

187
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,303
You promised you’d help me.

188
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:26,453
It’s impossible.

189
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:28,703
Taking that mad dog out is impossible.

190
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,573
Did you know he literally threw me out of his joint?

191
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,993
He’s a damn barbarian.

192
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:35,248
Don’t be a puss.

193
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:36,396
You gotta give it a try, dude.

194
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:38,964
You said you’d do anything for my car, right?

195
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:41,895
Help me out, then.

196
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:43,119
Meet me halfway.

197
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:46,368
Find out what that mad dog does all day.

198
00:12:46,368 --> 00:12:47,282
I’ll find a way to get close to him.

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,512
How’d I even know that?

200
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:50,832
I don’t care.

201
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,729
Ask your man or whatever.

202
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,524
They’re brothers, aren’t they?

203
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:57,179
Help me,

204
00:12:57,887 --> 00:12:59,134
and you might get with him sooner.

205
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,298
Aww, did you miss me?

206
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:12,453
Look at you.

207
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:17,333
Bison.

208
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:18,904
Don’t even think about it.

209
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,128
You know cats tend to stay in one place.

210
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:22,404
Don’t even think about taking it in.

211
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,618
I’m not.

212
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,894
But look at him.

213
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:28,468
He’s so damn cute.

214
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:30,450
How could I resist?

215
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,648
Am I right, little guy?

216
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:36,288
If you play with him every day like that,

217
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:37,882
you’ll only regret it when we have to move again.

218
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:43,078
I don’t want to move.

219
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:44,890
I told you, Fadel.

220
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:45,919
I need a break.

221
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:53,511
Fine. I’ll talk to Mother.

222
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:55,447
But before that, come help me out inside.

223
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:57,133
We get a lot of customers during lunch break.

224
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,126
I can’t handle everything myself.

225
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:02,317
Do it yourself.

226
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:03,152
Right?

227
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:05,567
Bison!

228
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:07,876
Yeah.

229
00:14:07,876 --> 00:14:08,731
I’m coming.

230
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:10,649
Hurry up.

231
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:12,153
Yeah.

232
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:19,479
Let me repeat your order.

233
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:22,303
So there’s one cheeseburger,

234
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:23,278
one fries,

235
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,988
one beef burger,

236
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,734
and one carbonara.

237
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:29,330
One water with two ice.

238
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:30,544
Is that correct?

239
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:31,230
Yes.

240
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,494
Okay.

241
00:14:32,494 --> 00:14:33,465
Please wait a moment.

242
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:39,761
Here’s the menu.

243
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,228
TOILET

244
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:57,098
You…

245
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:18,549
Kant.

246
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:20,163
Kant.

247
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:29,667
Hey.

248
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:30,567
What are you showing up here for?

249
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:31,564
Aren’t you scared of my brother?

250
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:34,684
Your place is crawling with customers.

251
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:36,821
I doubt your brother has time to welcome me.

252
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:40,089
Who knows?

253
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:44,590
What are you doing?

254
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,054
We can’t do it here.

255
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:48,422
But I miss you.

256
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,796
No can do.

257
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:53,802
What are you here for, honestly?

258
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:55,943
Well…

259
00:15:57,334 --> 00:15:59,030
The friend I asked to take your brother out said

260
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:02,218
he wanted some information on Fadel.

261
00:16:03,204 --> 00:16:04,593
He wants to know how he spends his day.

262
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:06,737
So he knows how to approach him.

263
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:09,486
What does that have to do with me?

264
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,673
I need your help.

265
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,029
Please.

266
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,528
I don’t know anything like that.

267
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,959
We might be brothers,
but he doesn’t tell me stuff.

268
00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:23,421
You sure your friend knows what he’s doing?

269
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:24,872
This isn’t very promising.

270
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:26,012
Find someone else.

271
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:29,744
I swear no one is as shameless as this guy.

272
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:32,389
Give Style some time.

273
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:34,751
Once he gets your brother hooked,

274
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:37,860
we can…

275
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:43,849
Bison?

276
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:46,332
Bison!

277
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,158
Yeah?

278
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:49,111
What?

279
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:50,682
What the hell are you doing in there?

280
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:52,668
Hurry up and help me out.

281
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:53,792
We’re busy as hell.

282
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,710
Ow!

283
00:17:00,115 --> 00:17:01,282
Ow, my tummy!

284
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:04,375
I’m having some stomach issues here, man.

285
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,074
Just make it quick.

286
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:08,553
And wash your hands.

287
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,396
Yeah, alright.

288
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:26,198
See?

289
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:28,452
You can’t see me here anymore.

290
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,773
It’s too dangerous.

291
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,130
We’ll meet outside.

292
00:17:32,243 --> 00:17:33,489
Okay.

293
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:36,433
But I can’t wait to spend more time with you.

294
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:40,717
With no interruptions, that is.

295
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:43,032
Okay?

296
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:44,159
Alright.

297
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,813
I’ll try to look something up.

298
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:48,174
Okay?

299
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:51,530
Enough.

300
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:52,465
Let’s go.

301
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:16,500
Fadel.

302
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:18,139
Fadel.

303
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:19,760
Fadel.

304
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:20,998
Fadel.

305
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:24,137
What’s your problem?

306
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:25,933
Look at this.

307
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:32,259
Who the hell did this to us?

308
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:36,632
Who could it be?

309
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:38,913
Where did you get this?

310
00:18:54,214 --> 00:18:56,001
Someone sent it into our restaurant’s inbox.

311
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,600
I think it’s some kids in the area.

312
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,102
I’ve seen them around for a while.

313
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,863
We might need to teach them kids a lesson or two.

314
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:07,130
Alright.

315
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:08,037
Let’s go.

316
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,007
What is it?

317
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,194
My tummy hurts.

318
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,470
Since this morning.

319
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,495
I don’t know what happened.

320
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,504
Does it hurt that bad?

321
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,563
Shouldn’t you see a doctor?

322
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:29,481
I just need a little rest.

323
00:19:31,782 --> 00:19:33,962
Why don’t you just go before they ruin our place?

324
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:35,496
Fine.

325
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:44,755
I’ll be back quickly,

326
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:45,774
with some medicine.

327
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,339
Bye, big bro.

328
00:20:13,116 --> 00:20:14,473
You’ve still got a lot to prove.

329
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:15,630
Good morning, there.
