1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,503
Where are you guys heading to, anyway?

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,113
We’re heading south.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,664
Kinda hoped it was going to be a romantic road trip date.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,275
Just do it.

5
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:16,795
Just knock me out and leave.

6
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:18,220
I can’t do that.

7
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:19,946
I love you, Bison.

8
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:22,750
With all my being.

9
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:24,541
You’re not fooling me again, are you?

10
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,478
As long as I’m alive,

11
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:29,325
I’ll make you kiss me again.

12
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,181
I think I know now where Bison is.

13
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:39,355
You like The Beatles?

14
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:41,216
My father did.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,462
He had a big collection of them.

16
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:52,444
You know,

17
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:54,737
when we used to come here,

18
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:56,925
my dad loved playing frisbee.

19
00:00:57,714 --> 00:00:59,651
He would throw it in the ocean,

20
00:01:00,272 --> 00:01:01,473
and made me fetch it.

21
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:04,364
I felt like a puppy.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,561
You really are like a puppy.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,696
My parents loved traveling.

24
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:17,308
I went abroad with them a lot when I was a kid.

25
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:20,469
When the plane went down,

26
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:23,553
we were on our way back from Europe.

27
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:26,400
Babe was very young at the time,

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,530
so we didn’t take him with us.

29
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:31,492
I honestly can’t say

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,426
that I was lucky to have survived.

31
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:36,712
God must have wanted you to live.

32
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,074
For Babe.

33
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:45,913
For you, too.

34
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:02,439
You know

35
00:02:03,897 --> 00:02:07,909
what’s another thing
that I really miss?

36
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,002
What?

37
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:12,742
My childhood.

38
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:16,279
I remember, after my parents died,

39
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:19,433
I was so depressed and lonely.

40
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:21,390
It stayed that way for a long time.

41
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:27,678
I barely got to go out and play like the other children.

42
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,070
It’s fine now, isn’t it?

43
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:32,147
I was like that, too.

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,996
I forced myself to be mature

45
00:02:37,263 --> 00:02:38,399
just to take care of Babe.

46
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:43,691
You know, I’m only 29,

47
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:47,052
but I keep being told I dress like I’m in my 40’s.

48
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:48,617
Do I look old?

49
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:51,909
Not at all.

50
00:02:52,076 --> 00:02:53,106
It’s pretty cool.

51
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:54,706
What’s wrong with being 40 anyway?

52
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:55,801
Kinda hot, really.

53
00:02:56,757 --> 00:02:58,358
You can be my daddy.

54
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:01,956
Okay, then, baby.

55
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:11,669
We have a lot in common, don’t we?

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,630
I guess we’re just perfect for each other.

57
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:19,336
Can’t argue with that.

58
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:25,440
Oh, hey.

59
00:03:26,587 --> 00:03:28,529
If the cops want to reopen your cases,

60
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:30,143
what are you gonna do?

61
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:34,809
I don’t know.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,861
All I know is I gotta have everything in order.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,756
If I ever get go to jail one day,

64
00:03:45,118 --> 00:03:46,548
I want Babe to be able to take care of himself.

65
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:56,256
Why don’t we just get locked up together?

66
00:03:57,762 --> 00:03:59,917
I don’t want to go anywhere without you anymore.

67
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:02,864
You’re my home, Kant.

68
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,467
Hey.

69
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,620
Alright.

70
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:19,435
You’re home now.

71
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:39,128
Oh?

72
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:40,798
Ow, come on!

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,500
Does he have any CDs?

74
00:06:13,095 --> 00:06:14,104
We–Well?

75
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,151
How do I drive?

76
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:17,498
You seem to sleep pretty well.

77
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:19,389
Are we there yet?

78
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:20,663
Almost.

79
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:22,393
I’m keeping up the speed.

80
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,647
Are you sure they’re there, though?

81
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,233
Yes.

82
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:32,890
Bison told me his parents had a house on an island.

83
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:36,029
That was before they got murdered.

84
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:43,893
If you’re sure, then alright.

85
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,538
I just hope Kant is still alive.

86
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:52,173
I can’t guarantee that.

87
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:53,960
You’ll have to find out for yourself.

88
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:56,220
Oh, jerk.

89
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:58,668
Can’t you at least lie to make me feel better?

90
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,095
Hey.

91
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:04,679
Can I ask you something?

92
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,066
Can we get me some new clothes?

93
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:11,388
I’ve been wearing yours this whole time,

94
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:12,958
and it’s getting disgusting.

95
00:07:13,627 --> 00:07:15,196
We can just stop by around here somewhere.

96
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:18,155
You sure make a lot of requests.

97
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:20,455
You think we’re on a road trip or something?

98
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,261
No.

99
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:23,570
We are not stopping anywhere.

100
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:25,555
Oh, come on.

101
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,653
If you’re gonna kill me,

102
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:30,804
can I at least die in something that’s actually my style?

103
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,085
I want my corpse to look good.

104
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:36,000
Gotta look presentable on the news.

105
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,615
“Gorgeous man with clear skin found dead in a crop top.”

106
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:42,510
My dad will recognize me right away.

107
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:52,249
Whoa.

108
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,555
These look pretty good.

109
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:58,190
Oh, this is nice.

110
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:03,428
Hey, what do you think of this?

111
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:05,602
Think I can match it with something.

112
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,649
Hurry up and grab what you want.

113
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:08,847
We need to keep going.

114
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:13,576
I hardly feel like a hostage right now.

115
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,471
I feel like a boyfriend.

116
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:19,283
This feels like going shopping with my boyfriend.

117
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,982
Listen to me.

118
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,273
You are not a hostage.

119
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,374
And I’m not using you as leverage for anything.

120
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,159
You don’t matter enough for that.

121
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:35,767
I’m just letting you find a little joy before I kill you.

122
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:39,426
Well…

123
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,596
Can I ask for one more thing?

124
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:44,807
You think I’m a wish granter or something?

125
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:46,490
You’re going to die soon,

126
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:47,613
what else do you want?

127
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,150
When you dispose of my body,

128
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:53,440
can you choose somewhere nice?

129
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,200
The beach or the mountain, for example.

130
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,453
At least my ghost will haunt beautiful places,

131
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,799
like the ocean or the mountain.

132
00:09:02,134 --> 00:09:03,947
I don’t want my ghost to haunt some dumpster.

133
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:05,900
If you don’t choose something right now,

134
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,329
the only place you’re haunting is this damn secondhand store.

135
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:40,607
How about this?

136
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:46,693
What a beauty.

137
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:48,724
I’m going with this one.

138
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,640
I’m gonna try it on.

139
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,354
Well?

140
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,250
What do you think?

141
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:29,960
Now this is more like me.

142
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:33,830
I never saw you in stripes before.

143
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,643
Oh?

144
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,402
Been observing me, haven’t you?

145
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:41,312
You can’t kill me.

146
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:42,916
You love me.

147
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:51,622
Style, duck!

148
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,278
Who the hell is that?

149
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:58,568
How would I know?

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,596
Is he here to kill you or me?

151
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:05,005
Should I go and ask him?

152
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:12,332
Go, go.

153
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:13,564
Go, go, go!

154
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:23,923
I’m out of bullets.

155
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:29,581
Shit, that’s in the car.

156
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:31,575
This is all because of you.

157
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,718
I forgot everything.

158
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:34,453
Why are you blaming me?

159
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:36,364
How should we fight him?

160
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:39,629
I’ll run over there.

161
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:41,852
I’ll distract him.

162
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:43,080
Are you out of your mind?

163
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:45,176
How the hell will you outrun bullets?

164
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:46,397
Trust me.

165
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:47,310
I’m fast.

166
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:49,082
Style.

167
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:50,405
Style, Style!

168
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:52,898
Shit.

169
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,437
Who the hell are you?

170
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:29,450
Who sent you?

171
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,513
Style?

172
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,073
Style!

173
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:47,229
Crap!

174
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,309
Style.

175
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,540
I’m alright.

176
00:12:51,185 --> 00:12:52,158
It’s just a graze.

177
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,506
Shut your trap.

178
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:55,753
Look at how much you’re bleeding.

179
00:12:58,932 --> 00:12:59,979
This is nothing.

180
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:08,325
Keep putting pressure on it.

181
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,037
This is gonna hurt a little.

182
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:17,027
Put pressure on it.

183
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:18,114
Crap…

184
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:28,971
Flip it before you burn it.

185
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,977
I am flipping.

186
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,149
It just won’t flip.

187
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:33,476
Let me help.

188
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:41,671
That’s it.

189
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,828
I told you I’d do it.

190
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:45,286
You nearly burned our food, you see?

191
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:48,402
But I just wanted to help.

192
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:49,833
Just do it yourself next time, then.

193
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,065
You’re stubborn, huh?

194
00:13:54,838 --> 00:13:57,645
I’ll just root for you quietly, then.

195
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,502
Hey.

196
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:01,487
I’m handling hot oil, for God’s sake.

197
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:04,224
If we burn this, we don’t get to eat, you know?

198
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:08,263
Hey, stop it.

199
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,698
Young master.

200
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:12,399
I’m sorry.

201
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,850
I didn’t mean to interrupt.

202
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:15,688
It’s quite alright, Mr. Maew.

203
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:17,341
Is something the matter?

204
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,316
Someone just landed on our shore, sir.

205
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,146
You okay?

206
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:32,053
Why don’t you get in the house and lock the door?

207
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,151
I’ll be right back.

208
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,514
No.

209
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:36,169
I’m going with you.

210
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:38,390
No.

211
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,311
It’s too dangerous.

212
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,072
That’s exactly why I won’t let you do it alone.

213
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:46,739
Okay.

214
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:23,374
That’s Style.

215
00:15:24,784 --> 00:15:25,584
Fadel!

216
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:26,471
Style!

217
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:28,179
Fadel!

218
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:29,365
Style!

219
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,053
What’s going on?

220
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:35,444
What happened to you?

221
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:38,265
Why are you bleeding so much?

222
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:40,310
Kant…

223
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:42,380
You’re alive.

224
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:44,376
I’m happy to see that.

225
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:47,365
You’re the one who’s barely alive, dude!

226
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,023
How did you get here?

227
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:51,154
Save your questions.

228
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:52,565
Help him first.

229
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,835
I’ll help.

230
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:55,718
Stay back!

231
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,912
Let go.

232
00:16:04,986 --> 00:16:05,678
You alright?

233
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:08,033
Just put your weight on me.

234
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,575
Get him up here.

235
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:28,061
Bison, help me.

236
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,328
Gentle.

237
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:32,458
Careful.

238
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:47,694
Hey, what are you doing?

239
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,868
You’re not a doctor.

240
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:51,349
If I don’t do something,

241
00:16:51,564 --> 00:16:52,289
he’s dead.

242
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:57,456
Have you done this before?

243
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:02,308
I stitched Fadel up before.

244
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:07,292
Hold on.

245
00:17:07,674 --> 00:17:08,446
This is going to hurt a little.

246
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:10,425
But Bison’s here to help you.

247
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:18,137
If you’re not doing anything, just leave.

248
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:19,590
I got this.

249
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:21,743
Kant.

250
00:17:22,197 --> 00:17:23,680
Grab some clean cloth for me.

251
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:25,902
I’m taking the bandage off.

252
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:32,205
Crap.

253
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:33,202
Alright.

254
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,660
Hold on.

255
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:36,186
You got it?

256
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:41,590
Hang on, alright?

257
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:43,157
Bite on this.

258
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:47,277
Hold my hand.

259
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:48,012
Hold it.

260
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:50,466
It’ll sting a little.

261
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,757
That hurts!

262
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:02,846
Careful when you get up.

263
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:04,196
The stitches are still fresh.

264
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,140
Fadel, no!

265
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:07,764
You brought all this on us!
