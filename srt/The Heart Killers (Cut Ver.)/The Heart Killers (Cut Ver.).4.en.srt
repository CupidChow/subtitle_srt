1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,591
Your new job.

2
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:09,139
I promise we’ll take care of this thing.

3
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,308
This ain’t no hit-and-run.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,836
I gave you what you wanted.

5
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:13,020
I want to date.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,743
Better yet, get inside their house.

7
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:21,514
You’re asking me to enter the tigers' lair here.

8
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:23,080
You know I could get clawed to death, right?

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,379
If I win,

10
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:25,971
we go back to your place.

11
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:28,171
If we go back to my place,

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,314
can we continue what we left off at your studio the other day?

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,186
I’ll give you a big show.

14
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:40,680
Hey.

15
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:42,127
Hey.

16
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:21,478
Hey.

17
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:07,006
What are you doing?

18
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:15,548
How did you get inside my house?

19
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:23,132
Your brother was dead drunk.

20
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:25,256
I gave him a ride home.

21
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:27,685
I’m looking for a bathroom.

22
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:28,388
I need to pee.

23
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:29,284
The bathroom isn’t here.

24
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:32,220
It’s too dark to see so I can’t find it.

25
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:33,914
What’s in your pockets?

26
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:35,200
Empty them.

27
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:39,123
There’s nothing here.

28
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:40,237
I don’t have anything on me.

29
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:44,104
Can you first, please, calm down

30
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:45,652
and lower your gun?

31
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:46,999
Don’t want it going off now, do we?

32
00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:48,897
What’s wrong with it?

33
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:51,248
It’d be like shooting a thief.

34
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,765
I told you I’m not stealing anything.

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,829
I just gave your drunk brother a ride home.

36
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,192
Empty your pockets.

37
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:00,424
Do it.

38
00:04:05,218 --> 00:04:06,573
Can you let me go pee first?

39
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:07,597
I really have to go.

40
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:08,702
I said empty the damn pockets.

41
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:18,779
It’s just my car key.

42
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,083
I don’t believe you.

43
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:23,083
I’ll do it myself.

44
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:26,891
Hey, you don’t want me to pee right here, do you?

45
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,572
If that gun goes off, it ain’t gonna look pretty.

46
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:33,131
That’d be nice.

47
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,080
Bison needs to get his head straight about you.

48
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:40,829
My cigarettes.

49
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:55,410
Fadel.

50
00:05:03,232 --> 00:05:04,082
Bison.

51
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:07,389
Are you okay?

52
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,194
I was looking for a towel to wipe you down.

53
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:16,055
Didn’t you say you were looking for the bathroom?

54
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:18,404
I was doing both things.

55
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:21,024
Your brother is throwing up
and you’re still nitpicking me?

56
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:22,386
What kind of brother are you?

57
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,556
Save your lecture.

58
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:25,853
I can take care of my own brother.

59
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:26,768
Go home.

60
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:29,781
Are you alright?

61
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,774
I’ll take care of him.

62
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:34,901
I said go away!

63
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:37,941
And don’t come back.

64
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:39,990
If you show up here again,

65
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:43,005
even Bison won’t save you from me.

66
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:45,227
Go!

67
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:50,130
Hey.

68
00:05:51,921 --> 00:05:52,739
I have to go.

69
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:12,355
Crap…

70
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:19,953
Crap. That was close.

71
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,225
One rule here is we do not bring anyone home.

72
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:50,573
And what did you do?

73
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:53,397
What if he was a narc?

74
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:57,702
What’s the big deal?

75
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:00,741
If he’s so troublesome,
just kill him.

76
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:04,117
Don’t say things you won’t do.

77
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:05,973
It’s annoying.

78
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:21,293
Look.

79
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:28,841
Will you believe now that Kant was never here?

80
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,682
It was suspicious enough that he was outside the room.

81
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:39,868
If I didn’t come home right then and he got in,
what’d we do?

82
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,041
Besides being a tattoo artist

83
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,201
and having a brother,

84
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,787
what else do you even know about him?

85
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:46,554
What else is there to know?

86
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,781
You know,

87
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:51,920
I ran a background check on him.

88
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:54,483
He was a thief.

89
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:56,420
He stole cars for parts.

90
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,450
Cops were after him for years.

91
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:00,990
Did you know that?

92
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:04,046
That’s pretty cool.

93
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,137
Everyone has a past.

94
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:07,917
That’s normal.

95
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:10,060
You know what’s not normal?

96
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,440
The fact that he’s never arrested.

97
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:16,465
You think that’s not strange?

98
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,147
He must have made some deal with the police.

99
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:22,316
What’s more,

100
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:24,183
the way you were last night

101
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:26,390
seemed more like you were poisoned.

102
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,479
You threw up exactly like that secretary at the host club.

103
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,657
Did you realize that?

104
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:32,549
You’re overthinking, Fadel.

105
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,689
I know that drug well enough.

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,833
You think I wouldn’t notice it if I ingested it?

107
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,060
You know,

108
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,294
the reason I don’t want to fall for anyone

109
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,612
is because I know once your heart is involved,

110
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,036
you’d become blind

111
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,223
and careless like you are now.

112
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:21,427
If you want it,

113
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:23,943
I’ll give it to you.

114
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:54,657
Crap…

115
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:05,388
Morning, Dad.

116
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:06,932
Hey.

117
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,370
Have breakfast.

118
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,177
Made it for you.

119
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:12,765
You’re not going jogging this morning.

120
00:11:13,017 --> 00:11:14,317
You’ve been going for a while now, haven’t you?

121
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:15,581
I’m still doing it.

122
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:18,292
But absence makes the heart grow fonder, you know?

123
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,607
What are you talking about?

124
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:21,773
Don’t tell me you’re only jogging because of a girl?

125
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:22,703
A girl?

126
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:24,346
A boy, actually.

127
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,261
Oh, yeah, my bad.

128
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:28,215
I forgot you liked men.

129
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:33,812
But hey, if this is how you want to play it,
make sure he’s actually into you.

130
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:37,698
Or else he’s just relieved to see a jerk like you gone.
With a face like mine,

131
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:43,506
I doubt he’ll forget me so easily.

132
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,129
Oh, you’re really something.

133
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:49,252
Oww, it’s hot!

134
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:50,160
Oh, Dad.

135
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,479
Serves you right for talking too much.

136
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:54,791
Well, who’d you think I took after?

137
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:56,358
Watch it!

138
00:11:56,762 --> 00:11:58,035
Should have told me it was hot.

139
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:44,504
Sorry.

140
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:09,759
Thanks.

141
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:13,345
Oh, hey there.

142
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:13,912
Hi.

143
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:14,761
What would you like today?

144
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:16,359
Tenderloin, please.

145
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:17,923
Of course.

146
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:20,727
Excuse me.

147
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:21,525
Yeah?

148
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:23,294
Where’d the guy who was always here go?

149
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,615
Who?

150
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:27,880
The guy who’s about my height.

151
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:31,793
Oh, you mean the boy who always messes with you?

152
00:13:31,793 --> 00:13:32,451
Yes.

153
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,486
He’s not coming here anymore.

154
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:37,015
Too bad.

155
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:37,826
He was good for business.

156
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,221
I actually wanted to hire him for real.

157
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,457
He’s such a sweet talker.

158
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:45,421
Got me blushing from ears to ears.

159
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:49,026
Gave this old woman something to look forward to, alright.

160
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:15,567
Hello.

161
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:17,010
I’ll be late to work.

162
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:18,304
Take care of things on your end.

163
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:19,744
Yeah.

164
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:21,647
You don’t have to come to work today.

165
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,319
Just make sure you take care of him.

166
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:40,415
Oh, hey.

167
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:41,555
You’re alright now?

168
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:42,952
Yeah.

169
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:44,319
I feel so much better.

170
00:14:52,544 --> 00:14:54,604
I learned my lesson not to drink with you anymore.

171
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:56,216
You really know how to hold your liquor.

172
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:57,920
As if.

173
00:14:58,223 --> 00:14:59,491
I was throwing up all night.

174
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:04,068
What’s this?

175
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:06,124
Faux leather.

176
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:07,153
I use it to teach.

177
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:08,346
Cool.

178
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,160
I didn’t know you teach.

179
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,985
Just the basics, really.

180
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:16,368
You gotta learn this kind of thing on the job.

181
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,448
Can you teach me?

182
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:20,551
I want to learn how to tattoo.

183
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:21,544
You serious?

184
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:22,781
Yeah.

185
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:24,717
Maybe one day I can do it on you.

186
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:30,366
You think?

187
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:33,950
Sure.

188
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,703
I’ll teach you very exclusively.

189
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:42,360
Let me get the tools.

190
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:05,794
You’re back.

191
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,880
How was it?

192
00:16:07,006 --> 00:16:08,010
Everything went well?

193
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:10,046
I am back.

194
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:13,622
Did you miss me?

195
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:16,453
We’re not open yet.

196
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:17,593
Why are you here?

197
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,522
I wasn’t going to come.

198
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:22,249
But some auntie told me someone asked about me.

199
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,920
Missed me, didn’t you?

200
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,778
Missed you, my ass.

201
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,501
You annoy the hell out of me.

202
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,376
You mess up my routine.

203
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:37,963
I won’t hold what happened last night against you.

204
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:39,414
I was asking for it.

205
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,084
I’m just here to tell you that

206
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,500
it doesn’t matter how scary you are,

207
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,007
I’m hooked.

208
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:55,422
Hey.

209
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:56,967
Can I ask you something?

210
00:16:57,547 --> 00:17:00,170
What do I have to do to win you over?

211
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:02,346
Easy.

212
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:04,957
Get out of my face.

213
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:19,675
I know
a guy like you just needs a little nudge.

214
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:22,877
You don’t know me.

215
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:27,186
You’re turned on

216
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:30,003
when I mess with you.

217
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:45,224
Don’t try to control everything.

218
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,163
If you bottle it up,

219
00:17:50,273 --> 00:17:51,260
it could explode one day.

220
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:09,337
Oh, we’re doing it in the kitchen?

221
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:13,905
Wild.

222
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:14,605
I like it.

223
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:28,701
You won’t ever get what you want.

224
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,488
Get out of here.

225
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:38,704
I said get out.

226
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:42,101
You’re ditching me?

227
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:43,496
I ain’t letting you.

228
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,481
Nobody gets to nail and bail me.

229
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:07,519
I’ll be the first.

230
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:10,838
You okay?
