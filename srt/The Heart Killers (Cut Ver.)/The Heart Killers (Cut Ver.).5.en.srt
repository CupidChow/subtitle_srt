1
00:00:05,485 --> 00:00:06,899
I’m looking for the kids who hurt my brother.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,903
You have my heart now,

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,444
so take good care of it.

4
00:00:15,544 --> 00:00:18,316
I don’t like you being in my life and changing it.

5
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:20,597
I don’t like that I miss you.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,864
Be my boyfriend.

7
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,909
Give me a chance.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,255
Fine, I’ll be your boyfriend.

9
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:30,383
You made me hit on a gunman?

10
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:31,551
Not a gunman.

11
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:32,572
A hitman.

12
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:33,946
They don’t just use guns.

13
00:00:34,103 --> 00:00:36,655
Ruerat was behind the death of our parents.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,449
If the two of us work together,

15
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:41,143
they’ll never catch us.

16
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,200
I’m sorry I didn’t have time to meet you two before.

17
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:53,666
It’s okay, Mother.

18
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:56,149
We know you’re busy.

19
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:02,381
It’s obvious what this is.

20
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:04,084
What more answers do you need?

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,028
So Ruerat really was behind our parents’ death?

22
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:11,172
Yes.

23
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:13,559
Your parents refused to sell him their lands.

24
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,163
He had them killed.

25
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:17,880
That was how you became orphans,

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,459
and I took you in.

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,447
Why didn’t you tell us sooner?

28
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:25,570
We could have dealt with him long ago.

29
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:31,208
Taking out someone of his status isn’t easy.

30
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,503
We must wait for the right moment.

31
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:38,757
I see that you two are ready now.

32
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:44,368
It’s a big job.

33
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:46,836
So I’ll give you what you ask for.

34
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:48,252
Get this done,

35
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,687
and if you want to take a long break,

36
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,422
or even quit,

37
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:54,423
I’ll let you.

38
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,005
There’s going to be a party.

39
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:04,240
It’s a good opportunity to carry out the operation.

40
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,958
I will have Keen take care of everything for you.

41
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:09,578
What do you think, Keen?

42
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:19,651
Yes, Mother.

43
00:02:25,836 --> 00:02:29,213
It’s time to take revenge for your loved ones.

44
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:33,983
Get it done.

45
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:57,295
What’s wrong?

46
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,953
You look pretty bummed.

47
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,109
I’m just sick of work.

48
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,063
It’s just all admin tasks.

49
00:03:04,929 --> 00:03:05,822
No challenge at all.

50
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:09,507
What do you want to do instead?

51
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:12,843
You’re pretty good at helping people.

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,128
You’re cheeky now, you know that?

53
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,451
I thought you liked that.

54
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:25,712
I do.

55
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:30,866
I’ll get you back for this comment after work.

56
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,660
How would you do that?

57
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:44,663
Keen.

58
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:55,173
Are you and Tanont going out?

59
00:03:58,165 --> 00:03:58,871
No.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,342
We were just chatting.

61
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,096
Just chatting.

62
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:05,601
Yes.

63
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:08,067
Good.

64
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:10,372
I thought you’d start dating

65
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,168
and leave me, too.

66
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,457
What’s with you?

67
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,788
Oh, it’s just hot

68
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:01,809
and uncomfortable in here.

69
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:03,126
Sorry.

70
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:05,686
That’s kinda the point of a sauna.

71
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:09,485
You seem strange today.

72
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:11,702
I’m fine.

73
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:14,415
I’m just not used to this.

74
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:17,553
It’s usually me running after you,

75
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:19,033
but now you’re with me.

76
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:22,222
You wanted us to be boyfriends.

77
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,178
Well, I’m your boyfriend now.

78
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:26,480
Or did you change your mind?

79
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:29,545
I don’t mind, you know?

80
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:31,868
I don’t like you that much.

81
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,195
I’ll get over it.

82
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:46,115
Bye, then.

83
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:47,075
Hey, hey.

84
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:49,677
Wait.

85
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:54,463
Are you sure?

86
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,400
Are you intimidated by me?

87
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:00,140
I’m not intimidated.

88
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:05,435
I just can’t believe my persistence actually worked.

89
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:08,890
It didn’t.

90
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:11,158
I told you.

91
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:12,545
We’re on trial.

92
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:36,033
Should we go back to your garage?

93
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,428
You’ve been to my restaurant too many times already.

94
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:39,602
Nah, let’s not.

95
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,307
The garage is messy and full of cars.

96
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,648
We can do it here and get it over with.

97
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:46,462
Well?

98
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:48,811
No.

99
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:50,985
Let’s go back to your garage.

100
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,415
You’ve been in my turf.

101
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:56,493
Let me be in yours.

102
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,925
If I don’t have to move again,
I’ll take you in, alright?

103
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,356
Let’s take a snapshot.

104
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:38,096
(Is he cute?)

105
00:08:40,956 --> 00:08:42,570
(The cat is obviously cute.)

106
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,073
(But I’d rather see your face.)

107
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:52,668
Alright, baby.

108
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:55,603
Let’s take another one.

109
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,365
One, two, three.

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,866
(Who’s more adorable?)

111
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:05,548
(I can’t choose.)

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,972
(I want to kiss both cat and human.)

113
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:12,623
See?

114
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:14,316
I’m just as adorable as you are.

115
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:16,279
What do we say?

116
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,563
Should we let him give us a kiss?

117
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:18,603
Hmm?

118
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,446
(I’ll let you give me a few kisses next time, then.)

119
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,384
(Any updates on them yet?)

120
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:32,773
(Did you get in their house?)

121
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,471
He trusts me enough to go out with me now.

122
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:39,917
Well, be careful.

123
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:41,676
Tell your friend, too.

124
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:45,177
These hitmen hate just as hard as they love.

125
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:46,641
Geez, thanks for the fair warning.

126
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,811
I’ll put them behind bars before they catch up to you.

127
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:51,262
Don’t worry.

128
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,439
You could have had that!

129
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:15,418
Look!

130
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:17,906
Okay!

131
00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:28,807
You want to play this?

132
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,992
I’m just gonna try this.

133
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,372
You know,

134
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:13,632
I was on the basketball team in high school.

135
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:14,921
Very popular with the ladies.

136
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,567
If I didn’t have my head wrapped up in other things,

137
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,050
I could probably have made it to the NBA.

138
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:20,534
You could have, huh?

139
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,057
You’re pretty amazing.

140
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,523
Is there anything you can’t do?

141
00:11:28,827 --> 00:11:30,007
I don’t think so.

142
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:32,562
If I got someone as hard to get as you,

143
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,348
I think I’m pretty good.

144
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:39,680
Right?

145
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:41,649
Hey.

146
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:43,007
We’re outside.

147
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,725
What were you good at as a child?

148
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:50,963
I loved drawing.

149
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,804
I loved art.

150
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:54,582
I always got an A in my art classes.

151
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:58,072
PE was never my thing, though.

152
00:11:58,361 --> 00:11:59,673
The only sport I do is swimming.

153
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:02,795
That’s the opposite of me.

154
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,356
I play basketball and football quite well.

155
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,312
Bison doesn’t like basketball or football.

156
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:13,306
What are you doing?

157
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:14,605
Taking notes.

158
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,057
I’m jotting down what you don’t like

159
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,534
so I know not to take you out on basketball dates.

160
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:23,333
What kind of date is that?

161
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:24,737
I’m sure some people do it.

162
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:26,172
You might not play,

163
00:12:26,172 --> 00:12:27,688
but you can always cheer me up on the sideline.

164
00:12:28,187 --> 00:12:30,209
I look pretty cool on the court.

165
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,722
It’ll definitely make you scream.

166
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:47,976
Didn’t know you stopped betting on footballs
and hanging out at arcades now.

167
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:52,923
I stopped football betting ages ago.

168
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,468
But you used to do that all the time.

169
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,331
Don’t you remember?

170
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:59,482
That Manchester derby match

171
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,957
where you bet all your money on Manchester City.

172
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,658
You paid off your car with that money, right?

173
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:05,044
That was long ago.

174
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:07,654
I don’t do anything shady anymore.

175
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,047
To think you’re an upstanding citizen now.

176
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:11,508
How boring.

177
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,759
What about you, Bison?

178
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,546
You into sports betting?

179
00:13:16,202 --> 00:13:17,100
No.

180
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:19,285
I don’t care for it.

181
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:23,930
Does working at a burger joint
pay you well enough?

182
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:27,747
How do you know where I work?

183
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,865
Well…

184
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:34,934
You brought Kant some burger the other day.

185
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,593
I assumed from that.

186
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:42,093
Alright, alright.

187
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:44,713
You’re all exemplary people here.

188
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:46,693
I’ll leave you alone now.

189
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,802
But if you’re ever interested in placing your bets,

190
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:51,287
you know where to find me.

191
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,103
It’s a nightly thing.

192
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,449
So I’ll always be ready for you.

193
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:07,753
He sure clings to you.

194
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:10,372
Was it very serious with him?

195
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:11,969
Is that why he dared say all that?

196
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:14,476
Come on.

197
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:16,105
It’s nothing to worry about.

198
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,991
That’s just how James is.

199
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,367
I’m not saying anything, am I?

200
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:22,163
He probably just doesn’t know me well enough.

201
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:24,407
I might need time to go and introduce myself.

202
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,135
What do you mean?

203
00:14:29,392 --> 00:14:30,822
I was just saying that.

204
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:34,484
As if a waiter like me could hurt anyone.

205
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:36,595
Am I right?

206
00:14:50,374 --> 00:14:52,559
Catch me if you can.

207
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:18,092
Well?

208
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,601
Am I the best or what?

209
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:23,342
It’s just a fluke.

210
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,996
Don’t let it get to your head.

211
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:32,225
Can I ask you something?

212
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,453
Did you become a mechanic

213
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,868
because you wanted to
or because of your family business?

214
00:15:40,595 --> 00:15:42,654
At first, I just wanted to help my dad out.

215
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,712
But when my mother died,

216
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,596
and he lost his bearings for a bit,

217
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:53,487
I was glad to have something I could talk to him about.

218
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,423
But after a while,

219
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:56,931
it just kinda grew on me.

220
00:15:58,637 --> 00:15:59,607
Would you believe

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,934
I even won a car tuning competition?

222
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,165
I know.

223
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:09,971
How’d you know that?

224
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:13,121
It was on the internet, you know.

225
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,462
I’m gonna be honest with you…

226
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,649
You said you liked me from the moment you saw me.

227
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:28,504
What did you like about me?

228
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:35,809
I liked the feeling of chasing after you.

229
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,489
I’m a competitive guy.

230
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:42,493
Being in a race gives me adrenaline.

231
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:45,732
So you only hit on me for the thrill of it?

232
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,967
This ain’t car racing.

233
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,321
Of course not.

234
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,572
I like how you look, too.

235
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,397
I like that you’re so different from me.

236
00:16:57,738 --> 00:17:00,033
It’s an opportunity to learn,

237
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,871
and it’s an experience, you know?

238
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:08,007
You haven’t won, you know?

239
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:10,384
The game isn’t over.

240
00:17:16,998 --> 00:17:18,304
A guy like me

241
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,002
doesn’t know how to accept defeat.

242
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:27,182
Follow me.

243
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,620
Oh, Boss.

244
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,752
You’re back.

245
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:00,898
I’m just about closing up shop for you.

246
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:01,796
It’s alright.

247
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:02,819
Go home.
I’ll take it over from here.

248
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:03,774
Yes, sir.

249
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,856
Where’s your father?

250
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:22,831
On a fishing trip with his buddies.

251
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:24,296
He deserves a break.

252
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:28,786
You’re quite the son, aren’t you?

253
00:18:30,754 --> 00:18:32,277
You take such good care of your dad.

254
00:18:36,135 --> 00:18:37,421
We’re all each other has.

255
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:40,445
When Mom died,

256
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:43,403
Dad became the most important person in my life.

257
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:45,717
You know what?

258
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:49,265
When I came out to him about liking dudes,

259
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:50,923
I was so afraid of disappointing him.

260
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,029
But you know what he did?

261
00:18:53,554 --> 00:18:56,074
He tried to set me up with another mechanic at the garage.

262
00:18:58,462 --> 00:18:59,677
And what did you do?

263
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,201
Look at me.

264
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:02,700
With my god-sculpted face,

265
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,959
of course I’d prefer to choose my own man.

266
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:20,647
And you chose me?

267
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:22,795
You wanna do it here?

268
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:27,444
Don’t tell me you never fantasized about garage sex.

269
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:30,381
That’s straight out of porn.

270
00:19:33,258 --> 00:19:34,534
Well, wanna give it a shot?

271
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:02,288
Excuse me.

272
00:20:03,915 --> 00:20:05,099
My car broke down.

273
00:20:07,146 --> 00:20:08,310
Need it fixed?

274
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:12,599
I don’t have any money.

275
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:14,788
You can pay with something else.

276
00:20:35,338 --> 00:20:37,713
He probably just doesn’t know me well enough.

277
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,027
I might need time to go and introduce myself.

278
00:20:54,662 --> 00:20:55,599
Hey, Otto.

279
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,156
Can I ask you something?

280
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,393
Yeah, bro?

281
00:20:58,393 --> 00:21:00,123
I haven’t heard from you in ages.

282
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,129
Which teams you wanna bet on tonight?

283
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:02,752
I didn’t call to place bets.

284
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:05,093
I wanna know if James is there.

285
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:06,645
He’s not here yet.

286
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:09,305
Why didn’t you just call him?

287
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:12,407
I did, but he didn’t pick up the phone.

288
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:13,387
It’s alright.

289
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:14,391
I’ll call him again.

290
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:16,677
I see.

291
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:17,528
Strange.

292
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,858
Someone just came here and asked after him.

293
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:21,757
Who?

294
00:21:22,544 --> 00:21:23,851
I don’t know the guy.

295
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:24,755
But he’s good-looking.

296
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:26,931
Probably someone James’ hooking up with.

297
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,658
Small and pretty.

298
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,039
Okay, thanks.

299
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,573
What was that?

300
00:21:41,544 --> 00:21:42,891
Hurry up, guys.

301
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,405
What would we do if Bison actually hurt him?

302
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,180
You wanna try me, huh?

303
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,604
You don’t tell me anything.
