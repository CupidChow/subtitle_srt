1
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:17,508
I am...

2
00:00:19,718 --> 00:00:20,718
a comic author...

3
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:35,500
who draws comics...

4
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:37,805
with a 19+ rating.

5
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,781
(Seonho/ Song Seung-hyun)

6
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:04,226
(Muyeong/ Ko Chanbin)

7
00:01:06,237 --> 00:01:07,237
(Minyoung/Seo Hyo-myung)

8
00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:08,382
(Junseok/ Lee Doha)

9
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:18,418
"Oh My Assistant"

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,900
Of course I didn't draw 19-Rated Comics at first.

11
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,004
It's a fierce struggle to produce
work in the comic industry...

12
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:29,239
When I realized,
I was already walking this path.

13
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:31,129
- But...
- Hey, Seonho.

14
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:32,162
Yeah?

15
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:34,810
When you draw 19-rated comics,

16
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:37,115
you need to think about
something erotic, right?

17
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,388
If it's always like that, you must be
so tired that you can't draw.

18
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:42,988
No. I think

19
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:46,318
if you see it every day,
maybe it's not not that great.

20
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,842
After I started drawing adult comics,

21
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:52,401
my junior...

22
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,037
doesn't usually get aroused anymore.

23
00:01:58,381 --> 00:01:59,381
Am I...

24
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:01,537
impotent now?

25
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:05,982
Am I impotent?

26
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,138
I'm impotent.

27
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:13,677
(PD Lee Minyoung/ New message)
Oh, my PD.

28
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,974
(Have you finished drawing?)
(Can you submit the work right now?)

29
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:25,193
Damn.

30
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:26,873
I don't feel like working.

31
00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:39,084
The PD that's in charge of me,

32
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:40,601
PD Lee Minyoung.

33
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:44,373
Her beautiful appearance
is different from...

34
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,398
Mr. Shin.

35
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:47,898
This is an adult comic.

36
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:50,718
Don't be bashful.
Who would spend coins on it?

37
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:53,851
Strip them off. You need to show it all.

38
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:55,718
And this.

39
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:57,514
- When they unbutton one by one.
- Yes.

40
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:58,655
- That...
- It's lame.

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,624
-In fact,
-It's lame.

42
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,983
- Unbuttoning one by one is exciting.
- No.

43
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:05,898
- Like, finally...
- No.

44
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,179
They're not making love in a hotel.

45
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:14,002
They're doing it in a hospital.
How could they have time for that?

46
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,530
That's a six-bed room.

47
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:19,062
- That's why you need to rip it off!
- PD Lee.

48
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:21,960
- Please lower your voice.
- Then put the hands on the wall.

49
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:26,113
Make the man get closer
and look at the shirt.

50
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,436
And reveal that there's no bra.

51
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,792
How's that?

52
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:35,949
You feel it, right? How is it?

53
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:37,394
Crazy.

54
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:41,512
No. She's crazy about her work.

55
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,373
About that too.

56
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:51,199
You're doing it all alone.
Aren't you tired?

57
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:53,022
You should find an assistant.

58
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:56,194
I'm choosing one right now.

59
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:59,170
Let me see. Who are the candidates?

60
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:04,084
(Kim Sanghyuk/20/background design/
assistant/wants to be webtoon assistant)

61
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:05,999
(Park Kichul/35/I'll be your assistant./
Do you want to be famous?)

62
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:07,577
(New message)

63
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:14,000
(Ko Muyeong/26)

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
- Wow.
- Wow.

65
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:16,672
- Who is this?
- Who is this?

66
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:18,571
- Why does he look so good?
- Why does he look so good?

67
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:28,078
His work is great too.

68
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:30,360
These are so beautiful.

69
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:33,227
Or maybe I've been seeing
only my own work for too long?

70
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:36,078
They give off deep feelings and warmth.

71
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:40,086
I wonder what a man who can draw
something like this is like.

72
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:42,883
A handsome man.

73
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:47,008
Oh... right.

74
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:50,250
Nico nico ni.

75
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,266
I'm here for the interview.

76
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,836
Your skills and work experience
seem very good.

77
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:57,852
And you're in good shape.

78
00:04:58,102 --> 00:05:00,883
When the deadline is near,
we need to stay up for a few days.

79
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:02,485
- Is that okay?
- What?

80
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:05,297
I can stay up but...

81
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:08,063
- If I can't do this at home, then no.
- Sorry?

82
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,024
You mean you won't work with me
in the same room?

83
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:13,610
You live very close to here. Why...

84
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:15,594
I can't leave Niko-chan alone.

85
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,391
She's waiting for me.

86
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:23,282
- You used to be an assistant?
- Yes.

87
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:26,821
I used to work with
a lot of famous authors.

88
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:30,555
A skillfull assistant like me

89
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:32,430
is not easy to find.

90
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:34,055
Sir...

91
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:40,500
- One day, you will definitely be famous.
- What?

92
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:42,664
Do you have anything else to say?

93
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,470
Well...

94
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:46,618
There are still
other candidates waiting.

95
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,016
You're still looking for more?

96
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:53,485
- Am I not enough?
- No. You are not.

97
00:05:58,407 --> 00:05:59,407
It's okay.

98
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:01,953
There is one left.

99
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:18,407
What?

100
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:21,477
He looks like a model.
What does he do for a living?

101
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:25,719
Just like what I told you.

102
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:28,312
- This looks very pretty.
- Thank you.

103
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:30,133
If someone like that were my assistant,

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,352
what would it be like?

105
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:39,940
Oh, he's here?

106
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Wow.

107
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:48,846
You look so good.

108
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:50,464
- Excuse me?
- Huh?

109
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,143
No, nothing.

110
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:56,690
Well, first of all...

111
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:59,893
Your portfolio looks great.

112
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,354
Plus, the colors go well together.

113
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:10,800
What? What is this sound?

114
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:16,182
Why is my heart pounding?

115
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,620
- Aren't you going to interview me?
- Yes?

116
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,807
Well, my throat is a bit dry.

117
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:24,893
Please let me go grab some water.

118
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,745
- Oh, right. Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

119
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:30,237
- I'm good.
- I can't do that.

120
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:32,596
Please have some coffee.
I will get you one.

121
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,182
Just a sec.

122
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:43,901
My heart is pounding because of a man?

123
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,589
Or is it because I haven't seen
any girls for a long time?

124
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:49,675
That's right.

125
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,690
I haven't dated anyone for so long.

126
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:04,003
If I pass the interview,
do I have to work here?

127
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:06,198
Yes. Well...

128
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:09,065
I like to work in my own space.

129
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:10,636
Are you okay with that?

130
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,550
I'll do it even if I'm not okay.

131
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:13,855
It's a job.

132
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,581
- About that...
- I can take this job

133
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:20,776
- but I have conditions.
- Conditions?

134
00:08:21,128 --> 00:08:23,932
First, we start working at nine
and get off at six.

135
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:25,471
What? Nine in the morning?

136
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:27,135
I've never woken up at that time.

137
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,228
Eight working hours per day, excluding
lunch. Five work days per week.

138
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:32,612
- Forty hours in total.
- Forty hours?

139
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,682
I don't work on weekends.

140
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:35,643
Don't contact me at night
even if it's the deadline.

141
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:38,065
Is that even a thing?

142
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,245
And you need to provide lunch for me.

143
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:42,409
The only thing I can cook
is instant noodles.

144
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:43,893
I don't do cleaning.

145
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:44,918
Don't speak casually.

146
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:46,667
No pets. No smoking.

147
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,643
- Air must be ventilated 3 times a day.
- Oh.

148
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:51,370
Okay. I can clean the place myself.

149
00:08:51,395 --> 00:08:54,151
I won't speak casually.
I have no pets, and I don't smoke.

150
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:56,026
And I can ventilate
the air 3 times a day.

151
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:59,182
If you agree with my conditions,
then I'm ready to work.

152
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:00,776
I'll try...

153
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:21,248
Your shirt...

154
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,482
They're not making love in a hotel.

155
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:26,174
They're doing it in a hospital.
How could they have time for that?

156
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,270
That's why you need to rip it off!

157
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:33,951
What did... I do?

158
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,232
Gosh. I'm going crazy.

159
00:09:41,036 --> 00:09:43,435
Why is my junior suddenly...

160
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:46,287
It's hot.

161
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,185
Oh, towel.

162
00:09:49,497 --> 00:09:52,412
Well... I'll find you a new shirt.

163
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:54,020
Just a second.

164
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:18,849
I'm really sorry about today.

165
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:21,982
It's okay.
Please be more careful next time.

166
00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:25,794
- If we get to meet again.
- Oh.

167
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,443
Of course. We'll meet tomorrow.

168
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:31,919
- What?
- You passed the interview.

169
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,568
- Please be my assistant.
- Um...

170
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,662
I thought I should pass

171
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,537
but I didn't think it'd be this soon.

172
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:45,584
Please come to work starting tomorrow.

173
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,107
Yes. Understood.

174
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,276
But... why?

175
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:04,222
I thought I'd become impotent.

176
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:07,636
Why is it suddenly...

177
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,940
What are you wearing?

178
00:11:27,507 --> 00:11:30,753
You didn't wear this
to the interview, right?

179
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:32,776
It's a long story.

180
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:34,409
- Can I have the same as him?
- Of course.

181
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:41,683
You seem to be in a good mood.

182
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:46,644
How is he in person?

183
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,292
He's been your favorite comic author
since you're a kid.

184
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:51,871
Is he your type?

185
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:55,824
What?

186
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:57,667
Then it's probably a yes.

187
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:02,198
Should I guess more?

188
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:06,409
He has silky hair.

189
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:08,214
Big smile.

190
00:12:08,832 --> 00:12:10,753
And looks innocent like a puppy.

191
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,144
This one... probably
doesn't suit you, right?

192
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:26,128
I'm right.

193
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:32,440
I know your type through and through.

194
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:35,276
- Your first love...
- That's enough, Han Junseok.

195
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,237
Anyway, try it out.

196
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:41,511
You might have a chance.

197
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:44,940
No way.

198
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:46,511
He is straight.

199
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:49,761
And he draws adult comics.

200
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:55,237
There's no way a straight man
will like me.

201
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:07,362
It seems that you two are here alone.

202
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,526
If you don't mind, I'll buy you drinks.

203
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:12,659
You with the glasses look so handsome.

204
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:16,285
No, thank you.

205
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:20,654
Okay.

206
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:24,734
Hey.

207
00:13:25,277 --> 00:13:28,120
How can you say OK and wink like that?

208
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,105
Why do you keep asking me
to come drink with you here?

209
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:36,019
It's easy to find someone here.

210
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:37,714
Plus, I can talk to you.

211
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:41,893
- Kill two birds with one stone.
- Two birds, my foot.

212
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,908
- Where are you going?
- The restroom.

213
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:01,369
Excuse me.

214
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:09,071
Go away.

215
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,758
He is straight, Muyeong.

216
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,664
Get a grip.

217
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh my.

218
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,007
These are all yours?

219
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:56,898
I brought my own computer
because I'm more familiar with it.

220
00:14:57,702 --> 00:14:58,804
Can I use mine?

221
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:01,186
Of course.

222
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:03,663
I'll have some coffee. Would you like...

223
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:04,688
No, thank you.

224
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:07,398
- This time, I won't...
- I already had coffee.

225
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:10,498
Here.

226
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,148
What is it?

227
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,062
It's been washed.
You can wear it right away.

228
00:15:19,797 --> 00:15:22,452
- You didn't have to wash it.
- It would be rude not to.

229
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:26,906
Well, then,

230
00:15:30,148 --> 00:15:31,437
should we start working?

231
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
What's wrong?

232
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:44,297
Is there a problem with the work?

233
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,290
No.

234
00:15:54,646 --> 00:15:56,271
Why do you keep sighing?

235
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:58,623
Or do you...

236
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:02,021
not like the sketch
I sent to you just now?

237
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:04,458
What? No.

238
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:06,083
It's just that.

239
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,568
I can't come up with a good pose.

240
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:11,060
I've been drawing
the same poses for an hour.

241
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,052
I knew it.

242
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:15,724
If you have a problem again,
just tell me.

243
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:17,427
I'll help you.

244
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:22,561
- I just need to pose, right?
- Really? Thank you...

245
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,772
But are you okay with this?

246
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,288
Spread the legs more.

247
00:16:38,648 --> 00:16:40,842
It's weird, right?

248
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:46,460
No.

249
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:47,789
That's just the nature of this work.

250
00:16:48,144 --> 00:16:49,414
Would you like to take a photo?

251
00:16:50,102 --> 00:16:52,804
Um, if you just pose like that
in the sketch, it should be fine.

252
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,634
The hand... shouldn't it
be placed on something?

253
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:02,431
Oh, then,

254
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:03,975
should we use my bed?

255
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:07,335
If we use the bed,
we should be able to get the pose I want.

256
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,158
Don't think about anything weird.

257
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,843
Mr. Shin is being serious.

258
00:17:20,304 --> 00:17:21,897
Just like that.

259
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:25,061
Tighten up your the core.

260
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:26,358
Tight?

261
00:17:26,383 --> 00:17:29,366
- This part should be hard?
- Hard?

262
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,108
Please wait.

263
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:34,171
I need one more frame.

264
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:55,593
Mr. Shin, why don't you
pick up the phone?

265
00:17:56,195 --> 00:17:57,195
Oh my.

266
00:17:58,453 --> 00:17:59,960
Mr. Shin.

267
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:03,507
What are you doing?

268
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,280
It's not like that, PD Lee.

269
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,302
- He's my assistant.
- Oh.

270
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:11,561
I guess I'm interrupting
your happy time.

271
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:15,015
Sorry for that.
I thought you fainted or something.

272
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,241
Oh, but you just fainted, right?

273
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,858
Well, then,

274
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:23,726
- please keep going at whatever this is.
- PD Lee, he's my assistant.

275
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:26,179
An assistant is totally fine.

276
00:18:26,204 --> 00:18:29,015
I get it. I don't judge.

277
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,999
- It's not that. We're trying on poses.
- Poses?

278
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:34,436
Oh my. What kind of pose do you want?

279
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:36,608
Gosh, Mr. Shin.

280
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:39,485
If you know those poses,
put them in our work.

281
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,124
- Don't just keep it for yourself.
- It's not like that.

282
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:44,987
I'm practicing
so that I can draw it for work.

283
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,276
Practicing?

284
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:48,494
Oh, using a real human body.

285
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:52,408
You're such a dedicated author.

286
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:55,666
- It's really not like that.
- Mr. Shin

287
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:58,791
couldn't come up with a pose,
so I helped him.

288
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,244
And then we fell. That's all.

289
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:02,822
Okay.

290
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,410
PD Lee, I didn't give you my password,

291
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:12,208
so you can just come in
whenever you want.

292
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,715
I don't just come when I want.

293
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,997
I had a meeting nearby,
so I dropped by.

294
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,098
Because I am afraid you
would be late for your deadline.

295
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,106
That's not gonna happen.

296
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:28,856
This is my new assistant.
Mr. Ko Muyeong.

297
00:19:29,122 --> 00:19:33,262
- Oh, the handsome guy.
- Yes. Whose work is very beautiful.

298
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:35,247
I'm lucky I get to work with him.

299
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:37,582
Hello, I'm PD Lee Minyoung.

300
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:39,386
I'm in charge of Mr. Shin Seonho.

301
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,199
Yes. Hello.

302
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:44,636
Since we have a new assistant,
should we go out for a meal?

303
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:45,972
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

304
00:19:45,997 --> 00:19:47,183
I can use my card.

305
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:49,074
Deadlines can be pressing.

306
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:50,605
But does he really have
to give her the password?

307
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,902
There's a lot I want to eat.

308
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:53,957
- Or maybe it's always been like this.
- Tonkatsu, sushi.

309
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:57,144
Or maybe these two...

310
00:19:57,512 --> 00:19:59,050
Are you coming with us?

311
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:00,645
I don't think so.

312
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:03,074
I don't want to interfere
with your work.

313
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:05,847
No, we won't be working.

314
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,254
We'll just eat.

315
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:08,871
That's right, Mr. Shin.

316
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:11,675
And why do you have to go eat together?

317
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:16,019
That's right. Come with us.
Please don't say no.

318
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:18,308
- Let's go.
- Okay.

319
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,746
Wow, they look tasty.

320
00:20:34,113 --> 00:20:35,340
I'm so hungry.

321
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:36,613
You guys are hungry too, right?

322
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:39,230
The sashimi is also good.

323
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:41,699
After we finish the whole story,
let's come back here.

324
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:43,058
- Okay?
- Yes.

325
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,379
Right. Muyeong, are you hungry?

326
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,636
Well, yes.

327
00:20:47,754 --> 00:20:48,754
Let's eat.

328
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:53,621
Oh, by the way,

329
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,300
can I mention work a little?

330
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:59,340
What? We agreed that
we wouldn't be working here.

331
00:20:59,903 --> 00:21:01,136
I won't talk about it, then.

332
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:04,238
- Just a little?
- Yes.

333
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:08,277
This is one of your revised versions.

334
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:11,613
- Look here.
- Okay.

335
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:13,941
When you rip the shirt off like this,

336
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,785
it's very sexy. Very intense.

337
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:18,980
And every scene is a lot better.

338
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:20,715
Really?

339
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,082
I feel as if I was the one ripping it.

340
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:26,465
- Did you try it yourself?
- What?

341
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,490
No.

342
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:31,605
Well... It's not like that.

343
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,590
It's just...

344
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:35,293
Well... It's...

345
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:40,011
The skin exposed in the drawings

346
00:21:40,653 --> 00:21:44,074
really gives off sexual vibes.

347
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,550
Ah, the food was so good.

348
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:51,660
- Mr. Shin, please work hard.
- Okay. Get home safely.

349
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:53,125
See you later.

350
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,261
Weren't the rice balls good?

351
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,355
- You weren't uncomfortable, right?
- No.

352
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:06,715
I need a nap when we get back.

353
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:08,965
I haven't woken up so early
in a long time.

354
00:22:09,403 --> 00:22:12,308
If you're tired, you can take a nap too.

355
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:13,949
No.

356
00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:15,957
I have to work.

357
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:21,441
Right. I'll try
to finish the story as well.

358
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:22,466
Let's keep going.

359
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:28,199
Mr. Shin.

360
00:22:30,512 --> 00:22:32,027
It's 6 p.m.

361
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:50,316
He even looks cute when he's asleep.

362
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:00,738
Muyeong.

363
00:23:03,277 --> 00:23:04,277
Muyeong?

364
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:06,839
Muyeong? Is it Muyeong?

365
00:23:07,582 --> 00:23:08,582
Is it my name?

366
00:23:09,715 --> 00:23:10,715
Wait.

367
00:23:10,926 --> 00:23:13,832
Is it Muyeong or Miyeong?

368
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:16,722
Miyeoung. Miyeoung?

369
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:18,644
Maybe it's Miyeoung.

370
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:21,144
So is it Muyeong or Miyeong?

371
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:24,207
Wait.

372
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:26,777
It can't be about me. That's impossible.

373
00:23:28,043 --> 00:23:29,379
Get a grip, Ko Muyeong.

374
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,238
Hurry and wake him up.

375
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:34,895
But...

376
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:36,589
I want it to be me.

377
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:39,082
If he calls my name...

378
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:54,978
Muyeong.

379
00:23:56,322 --> 00:23:57,892
Ouch!

380
00:23:58,455 --> 00:24:00,603
- Ouch.
- Please wake up, Mr. Shin.

381
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:03,267
Gosh. I'm sorry.

382
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,657
Please hurry and get up.
I'm about to get off work.

383
00:24:08,908 --> 00:24:10,853
You're leaving? Oh, no.

384
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:12,618
You should have woken me up sooner.

385
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:15,400
I did, but you wouldn't wake up.

386
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,790
Anyway, I'm leaving now.

387
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,704
Okay, get home safely.

388
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:24,650
I'll go back to sleep.

389
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:41,665
- Yeah?
- What are you doing?

390
00:24:42,384 --> 00:24:44,564
- I'm going home.
- Oh, yeah?

391
00:24:45,392 --> 00:24:46,392
What about you?

392
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:48,664
I'm in the area.
Wanna have dinner together?

393
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:50,134
Okay. Come to my place.

394
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,501
Okay, then. See you there.

395
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,228
Are you going?

396
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:58,564
Now?

397
00:25:01,861 --> 00:25:03,267
Are you crazy?

398
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:06,032
You said you'd go see the play with me.

399
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:07,829
What should I do?

400
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,306
He seems to have a problem.

401
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:12,954
You choose your friend
over your girlfriend?

402
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:14,821
You know.

403
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:16,962
Muyeong only has me.

404
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:24,369
I'm sorry.

405
00:25:48,689 --> 00:25:50,845
Hey, you have something
on your mind, right?

406
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,290
On my mind? No?

407
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:55,806
- There's nothing.
- I don't think so.

408
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:59,384
There must be something.
I can tell it from your face.

409
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,228
Don't waste time, just say it.

410
00:26:02,314 --> 00:26:04,384
You tell me everything anyway.

411
00:26:06,384 --> 00:26:08,181
What is it about?
Why are you staring like that?

412
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,884
Is it that bad? A disease?

413
00:26:16,806 --> 00:26:19,712
Muyeong.

414
00:26:23,485 --> 00:26:24,485
Huh?

415
00:26:25,098 --> 00:26:26,181
Gosh.

416
00:26:30,282 --> 00:26:33,907
Muyeong.

417
00:26:36,908 --> 00:26:38,321
I think Mr. Shin said that.

418
00:26:38,923 --> 00:26:43,978
You think he called your name?

419
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,892
It's definitely a name.
But it's a mumble.

420
00:26:47,213 --> 00:26:50,196
Do you think it's more like
Muyeong or Miyeong?

421
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:54,540
- Are you talking about that author?
- Why are you laughing?

422
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,470
I'm asking if you're talking
about that author?

423
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,267
- Yes.
- Who is Miyeong?

424
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:02,704
The PD in charge.

425
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:05,220
He should speak clearly
if he wants to speak.

426
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,290
Why did he mumble?

427
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,243
He was talking in his sleep?

428
00:27:11,634 --> 00:27:13,079
Talking in his sleep?

429
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:17,142
Talking in his sleep?

430
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,454
Did you sleep together?

431
00:27:18,478 --> 00:27:20,525
I told you it's not like that.

432
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:22,501
Then...

433
00:27:22,526 --> 00:27:27,314
you don't need to know whose name it is.

434
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:29,463
That...

435
00:27:30,256 --> 00:27:31,650
You fell for him.

436
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:33,931
But it doesn't change anything.

437
00:27:34,624 --> 00:27:37,321
- He's straight.
- You never know.

438
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:39,736
He can be straight or bisexual.

439
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,650
He might not realize yet
that he likes both.

440
00:27:44,853 --> 00:27:45,853
Also,

441
00:27:48,088 --> 00:27:49,939
who knows the hearts of men?

442
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,759
When you fall in love,

443
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,814
the truth will come out
without you even realizing it.

444
00:27:58,447 --> 00:28:00,056
You must have slept together.

445
00:28:05,212 --> 00:28:06,212
The truth...?

446
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:14,423
Muyeong.

447
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:25,703
- It's so cold.
- Yeah.

448
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:28,609
Are you really not going to drink?

449
00:28:29,188 --> 00:28:31,586
No, I don't want to.

450
00:28:32,563 --> 00:28:34,117
And I have a headache.

451
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:35,977
A headache?

452
00:28:37,274 --> 00:28:38,844
Do you have a fever? Let me see.

453
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,984
It's not that. I'm fine.

454
00:28:44,696 --> 00:28:47,031
You should go back. You must be tired.

455
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,512
All right.

456
00:28:50,773 --> 00:28:52,305
- Bye.
- Yeah.

457
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,081
You should have woken me up
before you left.

458
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:05,550
There are so many scenes left.
I'm dying.

459
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:07,091
(Author Shin Seonho)

460
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,971
He probably can't finish all alone.

461
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:30,612
I should have stayed and
helped him a little longer.

462
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,908
I just left
even though it's not finished.

463
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
You know what?

464
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:02,531
If an author hands in their work late,

465
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:04,968
their PD needs to stay and wait.

466
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:07,882
Some PDs have kids,

467
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:10,539
so the teachers
need to stay behind as well.

468
00:30:10,564 --> 00:30:13,851
In that case,
everyone has to work overtime.

469
00:30:15,226 --> 00:30:16,484
That's so good.

470
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:19,631
Right?

471
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,617
I thought I'd bring some food
to cheer you on.

472
00:30:24,642 --> 00:30:26,468
How could you be sleeping like that?

473
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:30,023
And I just told you earlier.

474
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:33,163
What if you can't finish in time?

475
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:34,757
I'm sorry, PD Lee.

476
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,420
I didn't even know when I fell asleep.

477
00:30:38,874 --> 00:30:41,593
It'd be great if you had
an assistant with you now.

478
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,124
He's off work now?

479
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:48,570
His contract says
he'll get off work at six p.m.

480
00:30:49,335 --> 00:30:50,648
Please don't worry.

481
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,265
I'll send it to you before midnight.

482
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,476
Are you sure?

483
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,194
I won't need to come here again, right?

484
00:30:59,005 --> 00:31:01,374
- Of course not.
- I'll believe you.

485
00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:06,788
- I can get off work, then?
- Please trust me.

486
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:09,195
Please keep going, Mr. Shin.

487
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:11,898
- Keep fighting!
- Keep fighting.

488
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:20,351
- Keep fighting!
- Keep fighting.

489
00:31:29,937 --> 00:31:32,374
That's a long nap, but I'm still sleepy.

490
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:38,023
I should go take a shower.

491
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:56,984
Muyeong, thank you.

492
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:58,773
I don't have anyone else but you.

493
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:01,614
All right.

494
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:03,671
Only for today.

495
00:32:04,451 --> 00:32:05,648
Two hours should be enough.

496
00:32:29,737 --> 00:32:30,951
Oh, Muyeong.

497
00:32:36,944 --> 00:32:40,793
His body looks... so good.

498
00:32:48,553 --> 00:32:50,297
- Muyeong.
- Uh...

499
00:32:51,585 --> 00:32:53,912
I thought you must be tired
working alone,

500
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:55,212
so I came to help.

501
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:59,209
I'll just come in late tomorrow.

502
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,881
But only for two hours.

503
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:03,560
Thank you, Muyeong.

504
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:04,912
Please come in.

505
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:25,727
Yay, I sent it.

506
00:33:28,935 --> 00:33:30,242
That's a relief.

507
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:33,162
You must be tired, Muyeong.

508
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:36,599
Now that we've passed the
critical point, should we take a break?

509
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:40,688
By the way, don't you feel cold?

510
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:42,953
Maybe it's because it's late.

511
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,951
- Can I turn on the boiler?
- Well, the boiler...

512
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:48,508
It's broken.

513
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:50,688
I forgot to get it fixed.

514
00:33:51,102 --> 00:33:53,732
- What about the heater?
- The heater?

515
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,344
I think I have one.

516
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:01,623
I did have one,
but I guess not anymore.

517
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:09,560
Do you want a sweater?

518
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:12,224
- No, thank you.
- Or a blanket?

519
00:34:13,032 --> 00:34:14,032
No, thank you.

520
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:18,685
Then, should we have a drink?

521
00:34:19,186 --> 00:34:20,935
It should make you feel warmer.

522
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,460
All right.

523
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:31,113
Muyeong, you know
how to make stuff like this?

524
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:35,167
Cheers.

525
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,000
It's getting warmer now.

526
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,738
You drink vodka too?

527
00:34:50,844 --> 00:34:54,136
Oh, it's a gift from PD Lee Minyoung.

528
00:34:55,414 --> 00:34:57,988
I didn't know how to drink it,
so I just kept it.

529
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,370
Please give me some more.

530
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:07,254
If you drink too much,
you won't be able to work.

531
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:10,053
Then, should we call it a night?

532
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:12,363
We're over the hump now.

533
00:35:12,388 --> 00:35:15,609
Since you started working here,
I haven't officially welcomed you yet.

534
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:17,717
- We should at least drink.
- Okay.

535
00:35:18,779 --> 00:35:20,207
It's been a long day.

536
00:35:20,678 --> 00:35:22,043
You can do as you please.

537
00:35:23,648 --> 00:35:24,648
Cheers.

538
00:35:30,668 --> 00:35:32,738
By the way, Muyeong.

539
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,668
Why are you working as an assistant?

540
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:38,240
With your skills,
you can comfortably go solo.

541
00:35:39,146 --> 00:35:40,510
Back in school,

542
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:42,908
I used to want to be an author.

543
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:45,596
But I don't know
how to draw characters,

544
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,736
or what the next scene should be.

545
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,096
Those things are very difficult to me.

546
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,041
The reason why I started drawing

547
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:58,111
was because of someone I liked.

548
00:36:14,544 --> 00:36:17,189
Muyeong, don't you have a girlfriend?

549
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:18,489
I don't.

550
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:20,884
- What about you?
- I...

551
00:36:22,956 --> 00:36:24,377
have been single for three years.

552
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:26,666
Oh, I see.

553
00:36:27,697 --> 00:36:30,159
So, he's not with PD Lee Minyoung.

554
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:35,026
But I'm still not sure
if there's really nothing going on.

555
00:36:35,304 --> 00:36:36,304
Three years ago,

556
00:36:37,085 --> 00:36:39,018
that friend was my first love.

557
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:42,760
She expected a lot from me.

558
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,471
"Why do you draw comics?"
"Why don't you have a car?"

559
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:48,885
"You have no money,"

560
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,713
"no house, no future?"

561
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,424
He's... such a fool.

562
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:57,018
What about you, Muyeong?
Don't you want to date anyone?

563
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,767
No, it's okay.

564
00:36:59,577 --> 00:37:04,483
I don't like using my energy
on maintaining relationships.

565
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:07,108
But if it's you, I'll do it.

566
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:09,444
What you said is true.

567
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,686
But don't we also receive
some energy from them too?

568
00:37:12,711 --> 00:37:14,233
I just want

569
00:37:14,756 --> 00:37:16,740
the warmth from when we're together.

570
00:37:17,689 --> 00:37:19,741
That should feel good.

571
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:23,922
If he were like me, I'd just hug him.

572
00:37:24,515 --> 00:37:25,515
Wanna drink?

573
00:37:31,634 --> 00:37:32,634
Wait.

574
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,743
What are you thinking?

575
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:37,610
You need to know the truth first,
Ko Muyeong.

576
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:39,430
This drink can really make you warm.

577
00:37:46,673 --> 00:37:47,673
Muyeong.

578
00:37:49,626 --> 00:37:51,881
- I'd like to ask you a favor.
- I'm going to refuse.

579
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:54,735
- Don't do that.
- Don't ask me.

580
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,907
Please help me, just this once. Please.

581
00:37:58,172 --> 00:37:59,172
Please.

582
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:01,826
What is it?

583
00:38:02,935 --> 00:38:05,264
If you want to change
the contract details, then no.

584
00:38:08,268 --> 00:38:09,607
I want to...

585
00:38:11,528 --> 00:38:12,958
draw you.

586
00:38:14,702 --> 00:38:15,779
And...

587
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:18,287
I want...

588
00:38:18,825 --> 00:38:20,717
- your torso.
- What?

589
00:38:21,671 --> 00:38:22,732
Naked?

590
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:27,733
Don't think about anything strange.

591
00:38:28,054 --> 00:38:30,554
I just like to draw.

592
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:32,155
What's with him?

593
00:38:32,398 --> 00:38:35,233
I don't have a lot of opportunities
to draw nudes.

594
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,975
Before I started this job,

595
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:39,577
I'd thought about joining
a nude drawing club too.

596
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,038
- I don't like being naked.
- Just one time.

597
00:38:43,063 --> 00:38:44,616
- Please.
- No.

598
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,068
You won't be naked. Only your upper body.

599
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:49,061
You just saw mine earlier.

600
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:51,280
That's your excuse?

601
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:55,280
- It wasn't my intention to see that.
- I can let you see it all night long.

602
00:38:55,305 --> 00:38:56,819
Mr. Shin, are you drunk?

603
00:38:57,473 --> 00:38:59,943
Yes, I am drunk.

604
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:03,241
- I won't do it.
- Please help me.

605
00:39:05,605 --> 00:39:06,605
Please.

606
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,171
How did I get to this point?

607
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:14,014
Ko Muyeong.

608
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:16,218
Why didn't you say no?

609
00:39:18,953 --> 00:39:20,991
Just one pose, all right?

610
00:39:21,478 --> 00:39:22,491
One minute.

611
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:24,968
- Hurry up and draw.
- Okay.

612
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:43,514
How long are you going to keep drawing?

613
00:39:43,774 --> 00:39:45,077
It's been more than a minute now.

614
00:39:46,506 --> 00:39:47,890
Just a few more pages.

615
00:39:48,498 --> 00:39:50,608
I want to draw from different angles.

616
00:40:08,761 --> 00:40:10,597
Aren't you too serious about this?

617
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:14,472
What's the fun
in drawing a man's body?

618
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:21,668
You may not know.

619
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:24,074
But your facial expression...

620
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:25,988
is attractive.

621
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:30,426
It seems indifferent,
but it's interesting.

622
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:33,209
It's sexy.

623
00:40:43,994 --> 00:40:45,287
I don't know who started it.

624
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,658
I don't know
why it turned out like this.

625
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,002
In the beginning,
I didn't plan for it to happen.

626
00:40:52,823 --> 00:40:54,193
I was trying to be patient.

627
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,287
Did I drink too much yesterday?

628
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:49,921
What?

629
00:41:58,342 --> 00:41:59,342
What is this?

630
00:42:17,776 --> 00:42:19,334
Not a kiss. No.

631
00:42:21,396 --> 00:42:23,850
No. It's definitely not a kiss.

632
00:42:24,563 --> 00:42:25,563
No.

633
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,459
Do I... like men?

634
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:30,945
I've never thought about it even once.

635
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:32,258
Wait.

636
00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:36,482
It's sexy.

637
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:39,342
Gosh. I must have gone mad.

638
00:42:40,443 --> 00:42:41,756
Did I really say that?

639
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,399
Yesterday, after that,
Mr. Shin fell asleep.

640
00:42:53,118 --> 00:42:55,047
After I checked
and saw PD Minyoung's pouch,

641
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:58,281
I came to my senses.

642
00:43:03,149 --> 00:43:05,867
PD Minyoung had been there
before I came.

643
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,953
After that, Mr. Shin took a shower.

644
00:43:16,745 --> 00:43:18,383
And then I kissed him.

645
00:43:19,134 --> 00:43:20,492
That kiss...

646
00:43:21,692 --> 00:43:22,992
was so sweet.

647
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:26,899
And I had no choice but to leave.

648
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,865
This is terrible.

649
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,300
My phone.

650
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:34,979
What should I do?

651
00:43:35,454 --> 00:43:36,454
Wait.

652
00:43:37,988 --> 00:43:39,558
I should try calling him.

653
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:45,855
How can I look at Muyeong's face now?

654
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,307
(Author Shin Seonho)

655
00:44:05,671 --> 00:44:08,336
- Hello?
- Oh... Muyeong.

656
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,480
Mr. Shin.

657
00:44:10,003 --> 00:44:12,049
I'm not feeling well today.
May I take a day off?

658
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:16,297
- Will that be okay?
- Oh... Yes, it's okay.

659
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:20,463
- Well, about last night...
- Oh.

660
00:44:20,971 --> 00:44:22,312
Don't worry about it.

661
00:44:22,615 --> 00:44:25,258
- We were both drunk.
- Right.

662
00:44:26,193 --> 00:44:27,781
- Okay, then.
- Hello?

663
00:44:27,972 --> 00:44:30,484
Muyeong. Muyeong.

664
00:44:33,136 --> 00:44:35,831
Mr. Shin already has PD Minyoung.

665
00:44:40,582 --> 00:44:41,582
Damn it.

666
00:44:44,863 --> 00:44:47,339
Why is he... so cool about it?

667
00:44:50,363 --> 00:44:51,855
Or am I too old-fashioned?

668
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:55,972
Does Muyeong really feel nothing?

669
00:44:57,798 --> 00:44:58,798
Damn it.

670
00:44:59,085 --> 00:45:02,986
I guess I'm the only one who's restless.

671
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:08,623
Whatever.

672
00:45:08,989 --> 00:45:11,779
I'm lucky Muyeong isn't mad at me.

673
00:45:19,212 --> 00:45:20,212
Wait.

674
00:45:21,312 --> 00:45:23,118
What am I talking about?

675
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,936
It felt so good.

676
00:45:33,253 --> 00:45:36,735
Can we keep working together
and act as if nothing had happened?

677
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:38,905
- Mr. Shin.
- Yes?

678
00:45:39,188 --> 00:45:40,710
Please take a look at my sketch.

679
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,803
- Is it okay?
- Oh, yes.

680
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,702
- Should we have kimchi stew for lunch?
- That's great.

681
00:45:52,353 --> 00:45:54,563
You mean putting kimchi in noodles?

682
00:45:56,978 --> 00:45:58,297
I'll do it today.

683
00:46:07,135 --> 00:46:08,135
Get a grip.

684
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:10,828
Mind your words.

685
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:15,852
Does Muyeong really feel nothing?

686
00:46:17,305 --> 00:46:18,678
Am I the only one overthinking this?

687
00:46:33,071 --> 00:46:34,249
I'm leaving, then.

688
00:46:35,598 --> 00:46:36,598
Muyeong.

689
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:40,157
Would you like to have dinner
with me before you go?

690
00:46:40,337 --> 00:46:41,649
- We can order some chicken...
- No.

691
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:44,344
- I don't want to.
- Oh, okay.

692
00:46:46,948 --> 00:46:48,335
Please get home safely.

693
00:46:55,093 --> 00:46:56,094
Muyeong...

694
00:46:56,774 --> 00:46:59,967
You really feel nothing?

695
00:47:02,594 --> 00:47:04,703
There's nothing I can do now.

696
00:47:07,048 --> 00:47:09,483
Where are you? Can you come out?

697
00:47:10,462 --> 00:47:12,547
- Got it.
- Meet me at JJ.

698
00:47:12,657 --> 00:47:14,164
Okay, I'll see you there.

699
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:18,913
This is not normal.

700
00:47:21,484 --> 00:47:24,739
- I said I'm sorry.
- Why didn't you tell him you're with me?

701
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:26,553
You should have told him
you'd meet him later.

702
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:31,022
If Muyeong calls me first,
there must be something wrong.

703
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:33,725
- We see each other every day anyway.
- Every day?

704
00:47:34,693 --> 00:47:38,124
Honey, we haven't seen
each other for a week.

705
00:47:38,434 --> 00:47:41,514
- What about getting our wedding rings?
- I got it.

706
00:47:42,771 --> 00:47:45,061
Next time, I'll buy you a present.

707
00:47:46,427 --> 00:47:48,952
You're like this again. I'm sick of it.

708
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:51,466
Anyone is going to think
you two are dating.

709
00:47:57,771 --> 00:47:59,131
Don't push the joke too far.

710
00:48:03,002 --> 00:48:04,061
I'll get going.

711
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:11,163
Isn't it weird to leave your fiancée
for another man?

712
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,124
That's too much.

713
00:48:34,747 --> 00:48:37,661
You called me first because
you have a problem, right?

714
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:41,818
No.

715
00:48:43,012 --> 00:48:44,012
It's nothing.

716
00:48:46,763 --> 00:48:48,919
I just wanted to come here.

717
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,991
So there's no problem with the author?

718
00:49:04,538 --> 00:49:06,863
- Hey, Junseok.
- What?

719
00:49:08,128 --> 00:49:10,027
You're really straight, right?

720
00:49:11,011 --> 00:49:12,035
What are you talking about?

721
00:49:13,746 --> 00:49:14,780
Have you ever...

722
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:18,558
got drunk and touched another man?

723
00:49:18,941 --> 00:49:19,941
Are you crazy?

724
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:26,410
Maybe he's bisexual?

725
00:49:26,878 --> 00:49:30,030
Bisexual? You're talking about
those who like both men and women?

726
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:35,996
Did you do something to the author?

727
00:49:40,923 --> 00:49:44,421
- Seriously?
- No, it's not a big deal.

728
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,085
It's just a light touch.

729
00:49:48,049 --> 00:49:51,624
You're more serious than I thought.

730
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:54,975
Stay out of trouble.

731
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,842
It's never ended well
when you dated these people.

732
00:49:58,617 --> 00:50:01,006
Junseok knows

733
00:50:01,642 --> 00:50:06,353
how I was hurt by loving people
who were unlikely to return the feeling.

734
00:50:09,268 --> 00:50:11,085
- You like me?
- Yeah.

735
00:50:11,405 --> 00:50:12,585
More than friends.

736
00:50:13,663 --> 00:50:16,822
Have you ever wanted to kiss me?

737
00:50:19,236 --> 00:50:23,088
You are so disgusting.

738
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:28,189
Don't tell anyone that you like me.
And don't act like you know me.

739
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:40,226
He's probably worried that
I'll make a stupid mistake again.

740
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:43,359
"Will I ever meet the one"

741
00:50:44,382 --> 00:50:48,780
- "who I love and who loves me back?"
- Hey.

742
00:50:49,468 --> 00:50:51,217
Stop talking nonsense.

743
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,592
It's what you said
when you were in high school.

744
00:50:55,626 --> 00:50:57,186
- Don't you remember?
- No, I don't.

745
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:00,256
When I was young,

746
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,226
I tried so hard to find love.

747
00:51:05,101 --> 00:51:06,389
What is so important about love?

748
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:09,718
Love... Of course, it's important.

749
00:51:10,155 --> 00:51:15,233
Just get married with the right person,
at the right time.

750
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:17,842
Even though I don't want
to believe it now.

751
00:51:20,968 --> 00:51:21,968
I get it.

752
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:24,554
Just have fun in moderation.

753
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,335
It's the first time I'm seeing this,
but I don't feel that it's shocking.

754
00:51:42,894 --> 00:51:45,897
There's something else
that is shocking to me.

755
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,936
The fact that I thought of Muyeong...

756
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:56,374
while watching these videos.

757
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,671
My heart is pounding again.

758
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:07,038
I'm always like this

759
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:08,975
when I think of Muyeong.

760
00:52:09,438 --> 00:52:12,600
What's wrong with me?
Why am I like this?

761
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:21,397
Or is it because of what just happened?

762
00:52:26,724 --> 00:52:29,321
No, even before that.

763
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,803
Or do I...

764
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:36,006
really like Muyeong?

765
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:42,563
Come to think of it,
I do want to make Muyeong laugh.

766
00:52:42,658 --> 00:52:45,337
I want to be with him.
I want to touch him.

767
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:46,963
And I want to see him.

768
00:52:51,637 --> 00:52:52,829
So I like him.

769
00:52:53,345 --> 00:52:55,126
This feels strange.

770
00:52:55,623 --> 00:52:58,165
Maybe it's because it's the first time
I'm falling for a man.

771
00:52:58,667 --> 00:53:02,751
Actually, I have never had
anything against it.

772
00:53:02,907 --> 00:53:04,475
Seonho, look at this.

773
00:53:04,883 --> 00:53:06,007
Isn't it great?

774
00:53:06,032 --> 00:53:09,360
- A man dating a man? Is that possible?
- Right. I can't take it.

775
00:53:09,963 --> 00:53:13,274
Is that so? If they like each other,
there shouldn't be a problem.

776
00:53:13,299 --> 00:53:16,305
Damn. How could I like someone
who has the same thing?

777
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,764
Right. How is that normal?

778
00:53:18,271 --> 00:53:20,501
I don't know.
I don't really care about that.

779
00:53:20,526 --> 00:53:22,344
- You liked it back then.
- Shut up.

780
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:24,296
Seonho, what do you want to eat?

781
00:53:24,761 --> 00:53:27,993
I don't know. Jajangmyeon? Or Jjamppong?

782
00:53:28,165 --> 00:53:29,624
Yeah, what should we eat?

783
00:53:29,931 --> 00:53:31,485
Pick what you want to eat.

784
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:34,960
- How? I want both.
- Then get Jjamjjamyeon.

785
00:53:36,814 --> 00:53:39,508
I've always liked Jjamjjamyeon.

786
00:53:40,696 --> 00:53:43,313
I like dogs, but I also like cats.

787
00:53:44,573 --> 00:53:47,413
I like Latte, but I also like Americano.

788
00:53:48,169 --> 00:53:51,225
As for ice cream, I like both
vanilla and chocolate.

789
00:53:54,594 --> 00:53:58,499
And I like it both fried and seasoned.

790
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,991
And now, I like men too.

791
00:54:03,431 --> 00:54:04,633
I like both men and women.

792
00:54:07,446 --> 00:54:10,967
If Muyeong found out,
what would he think of me?

793
00:54:14,672 --> 00:54:16,788
- I like you.
- I...

794
00:54:17,406 --> 00:54:18,647
don't like men.

795
00:54:18,695 --> 00:54:21,008
- I like you.
- You're making me uncomfortable,

796
00:54:21,903 --> 00:54:23,194
looking at me like that.

797
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:26,242
- I like...
- I can't work with you anymore.

798
00:54:26,493 --> 00:54:27,493
I like...

799
00:54:29,964 --> 00:54:31,155
You freak.

800
00:54:34,392 --> 00:54:37,124
No matter what, it doesn't seem to work.

801
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,452
But that night, Muyeong also...

802
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:50,944
Maybe I still have hope.

803
00:54:53,938 --> 00:54:56,891
Anyway, how do I win his heart?

804
00:54:58,048 --> 00:55:00,538
With my face, speech, or skills?

805
00:55:06,696 --> 00:55:10,608
All I have is this body.

806
00:55:17,438 --> 00:55:18,928
Should I use my body?

807
00:55:22,423 --> 00:55:24,500
Gosh. What am I thinking?

808
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,093
Use my body to flirt with him.

809
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,760
Get a grip.

810
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,749
This isn't what I meant.

811
00:55:33,406 --> 00:55:35,663
Wait a sec. Why am I...

812
00:55:35,688 --> 00:55:36,688
I'm sorry.

813
00:55:36,968 --> 00:55:37,968
Sorry.

814
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:40,202
Damn it. Why are you two like this?

815
00:55:40,366 --> 00:55:42,710
One keeps pounding.
The other keeps standing up.

816
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,819
We're here. Let's get off.

817
00:55:53,204 --> 00:55:57,821
Until Mt. Baekdu is worn away and
East Sea runs dry, may God protect...

818
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,182
I think we picked the wrong time
to come take pictures.

819
00:56:11,588 --> 00:56:14,922
- Maybe it's Friday, so many people came.
- That's right.

820
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:19,143
- I'll come again when I have free time.
- Okay.

821
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,666
Should we go that way?

822
00:57:08,226 --> 00:57:09,460
Well, Muyeong.

823
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:13,960
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

824
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:18,624
- I'd like to hear your thoughts.
- About what?

825
00:57:19,987 --> 00:57:22,979
About... men dating men.

826
00:57:24,323 --> 00:57:25,323
What?

827
00:57:29,315 --> 00:57:32,206
I don't know.
I don't think it's a problem.

828
00:57:33,714 --> 00:57:36,276
Do you... think it's possible?

829
00:57:37,513 --> 00:57:40,667
Yes, there are a lot of
people like that these days.

830
00:57:40,692 --> 00:57:42,979
So you mean, you can do it too?

831
00:57:43,004 --> 00:57:45,682
- You don't hate it?
- No.

832
00:57:46,354 --> 00:57:49,799
I don't hate it
because it has nothing to do with me.

833
00:57:52,205 --> 00:57:53,213
Right.

834
00:57:54,961 --> 00:58:00,096
But why do you keep asking about this?

835
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:04,160
Or do you have a man that you like?

836
00:58:04,185 --> 00:58:07,331
What? No, I don't.

837
00:58:07,356 --> 00:58:10,565
No way. It's definitely not that.

838
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:13,128
I... just...

839
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:18,466
I was just asking, so maybe
I could use it in the next scenes.

840
00:58:23,977 --> 00:58:25,797
You can talk to me.

841
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:29,617
I have nothing against it.

842
00:58:39,462 --> 00:58:42,344
Wait. What am I thinking?

843
00:58:51,413 --> 00:58:53,695
Because of you,
I have a lot of great pictures.

844
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,453
No, it's my job to help you.

845
00:58:58,211 --> 00:58:59,883
You must be tired
from working outside today.

846
00:59:00,293 --> 00:59:02,063
- You can get off work now.
- Okay.

847
00:59:02,266 --> 00:59:05,766
- And aren't you going home?
- I'm meeting someone.

848
00:59:06,102 --> 00:59:08,539
- So I'm gonna stay here a bit more.
- Meeting someone?

849
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:12,170
Okay, I'll get going then.

850
00:59:32,384 --> 00:59:34,532
Is that who he's meeting?

851
00:59:38,906 --> 00:59:41,938
- Gosh.
- PD Lee, you seem tired.

852
00:59:41,963 --> 00:59:46,727
If you submit your work quickly,
I won't be tired.

853
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:52,071
- Should I go live with you?
- I'm sorry.

854
00:59:53,391 --> 00:59:54,391
I'm kidding.

855
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:57,375
What's going on?

856
01:00:00,336 --> 01:00:05,038
I asked you to meet because
I have something to discuss with you.

857
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:06,344
- Okay.
- Mr. Shin.

858
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:09,664
Your work has gotten
a lot better lately.

859
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:12,078
- It made my heart flutter.
- Really?

860
01:00:12,617 --> 01:00:14,961
Mr. Shin suddenly blushed.

861
01:00:15,123 --> 01:00:16,719
What exactly are they talking about?

862
01:00:19,759 --> 01:00:20,849
They're holding hands?

863
01:00:21,204 --> 01:00:24,282
Since they're holding hands,
there must be something going on.

864
01:00:24,307 --> 01:00:28,532
The handcuff scene
in the last chapter is very good.

865
01:00:28,694 --> 01:00:30,435
But you did it wrong.

866
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,278
- I thought I could do it however I like.
- So you've never worn a handcuff.

867
01:00:33,303 --> 01:00:34,959
Normal people don't usually wear it.

868
01:00:34,984 --> 01:00:37,131
That's why I brought it with me.

869
01:00:42,084 --> 01:00:45,818
- Why did you bring so many things?
- I didn't know when I'd get to use them.

870
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:47,826
All right, focus.

871
01:00:49,951 --> 01:00:52,467
This is how you wear it.

872
01:00:56,858 --> 01:00:58,709
Wearing a handcuff here?

873
01:01:00,186 --> 01:01:02,576
And draw it from this angle.

874
01:01:03,084 --> 01:01:05,662
- This should be better.
- Oh, okay.

875
01:01:06,647 --> 01:01:09,114
Whoa, you did it so quickly.

876
01:01:09,139 --> 01:01:12,934
Of course, I've been a consultant
for this kind of thing for a long time.

877
01:01:12,959 --> 01:01:14,881
This is easy.

878
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:16,615
Should we move on to another one?

879
01:01:18,936 --> 01:01:24,529
Please wait. There are kids here.

880
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,935
Anyway, please fix the handcuff scene
just the way I told you to.

881
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,342
The content is so much
better than before.

882
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,389
I'm amazed.

883
01:01:46,414 --> 01:01:48,967
Did something happen? Or...

884
01:01:49,226 --> 01:01:51,185
have you been using these
with your lover?

885
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:54,443
- Oh my gosh.
- What? No.

886
01:01:54,468 --> 01:01:56,303
She has to act like this?

887
01:01:56,328 --> 01:01:57,779
It's not like that.

888
01:01:57,804 --> 01:02:00,865
- Can you uncuff me?
- Tell me first.

889
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:02,860
You're dating someone, right?

890
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,599
- Please uncuff me...
- It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

891
01:02:05,624 --> 01:02:10,443
These days, many artists are using
SketchUp for their backgrounds.

892
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:13,139
- Don't you want to use it too?
- No.

893
01:02:13,164 --> 01:02:14,982
I prefer to draw by hand.

894
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:17,310
Plus, my assistant is very good
at drawing backgrounds.

895
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:23,365
Is that so? I thought SketchUp
could help you save time, so I asked.

896
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:26,170
Well, it's because it's so hard
to find background pictures.

897
01:02:26,195 --> 01:02:28,209
If I have a good one,
I can draw it quickly.

898
01:02:28,234 --> 01:02:32,006
I want to find
all those pictures for you.

899
01:02:32,756 --> 01:02:36,035
If there's a company scene,
you should come draw at our company.

900
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,514
Oh, really?

901
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,537
It'd be great if I could do that.

902
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,521
Whatever location you want,
you can tell me.

903
01:02:42,546 --> 01:02:46,592
I will ask my friends and acquaintances
to find it for you.

904
01:02:46,665 --> 01:02:48,373
What I can get for you now are

905
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:55,182
bars, pharmacies, restaurants, hotels,
furniture stores, pork belly places.

906
01:02:56,029 --> 01:02:57,717
Great. Next chapter,

907
01:02:57,742 --> 01:02:59,904
- there's a hotel and a bar.
- That's great.

908
01:02:59,929 --> 01:03:02,287
My cousin works at athe front
desk of a hotel.

909
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:04,881
For the bar,
I'll take you to a specialist.

910
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,857
- It's actually nearby. Should we go now?
- Really?

911
01:03:09,897 --> 01:03:13,092
Wait. Uncuff me first.

912
01:03:13,882 --> 01:03:16,303
What? Where are they going
with the handcuffs?

913
01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:22,866
Here we are.

914
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:26,530
PD Lee.

915
01:03:27,936 --> 01:03:30,029
Are you going to make me
go in with this?

916
01:03:31,881 --> 01:03:33,495
Oh, I'm sorry.

917
01:03:35,662 --> 01:03:37,545
They're holding hands
in front of a hotel?

918
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:44,599
I requested a bathroom
with translucent glass for you.

919
01:03:44,624 --> 01:03:45,834
Translucent?

920
01:03:45,859 --> 01:03:49,709
Since we're already here,
you should create a fantastic scene.

921
01:03:50,366 --> 01:03:52,013
Right. Okay.

922
01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:53,482
- Let's go, then.
- Okay.

923
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,560
- Walk faster.
- Yes.

924
01:04:09,201 --> 01:04:11,404
What am I doing?
I'm acting like an idiot.

925
01:04:14,588 --> 01:04:17,365
There's no reason to feel hurt.

926
01:04:17,795 --> 01:04:20,107
Hey, do you like men?

927
01:04:21,803 --> 01:04:22,943
I heard you like men.

928
01:04:25,576 --> 01:04:27,592
Do you like every man?

929
01:04:29,717 --> 01:04:31,459
Does your heart flutter
when I do this?

930
01:04:31,592 --> 01:04:33,771
Are you nervous?

931
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:35,490
Let go of me.

932
01:04:38,811 --> 01:04:40,263
Yes, I like men.

933
01:04:40,991 --> 01:04:45,123
But isn't it too stupid of you to think
that I like every man?

934
01:04:45,262 --> 01:04:46,373
Listen carefully.

935
01:04:47,138 --> 01:04:49,537
I don't care if it's a man or a woman.

936
01:04:49,562 --> 01:04:53,857
We're all human. What's wrong with it?

937
01:04:53,882 --> 01:04:57,865
Bullies who pick on
weaker people like you.

938
01:05:00,052 --> 01:05:01,770
Even if we're in the same train car,
I'd leave and go to another one.

939
01:05:02,828 --> 01:05:07,115
When you touched me just now,
it felt so disgusting.

940
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:10,110
Don't touch me.

941
01:05:10,472 --> 01:05:11,472
Hey.

942
01:05:13,341 --> 01:05:14,419
Stop it.

943
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:20,826
- Didn't you hear this bastard?
- Go and use the time to study.

944
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:22,739
Go.

945
01:05:28,295 --> 01:05:30,295
When I found someone that I loved,

946
01:05:31,204 --> 01:05:32,748
bad things usually happened

947
01:05:33,808 --> 01:05:35,146
more than good things.

948
01:05:35,906 --> 01:05:37,162
But every time that happened,

949
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,553
Junseok was there to help me.

950
01:05:42,807 --> 01:05:44,560
- Hello?
- Where are you?

951
01:05:45,022 --> 01:05:47,029
- Gangnam.
- I'm in Gangnam as well.

952
01:05:47,245 --> 01:05:49,631
- Did you get off work early?
- No, we went outside to work.

953
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:52,217
- You have to work outside too?
- Yeah.

954
01:05:52,445 --> 01:05:56,420
- Are you in a bad mood?
- No, it's nothing.

955
01:05:58,922 --> 01:06:00,428
If you're in Gangnam, let's get a drink.

956
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:02,732
- See you at JJ.
- Got it.

957
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:25,050
I've never...

958
01:06:25,905 --> 01:06:27,730
liked anyone of the opposite sex.

959
01:06:28,509 --> 01:06:30,738
I thought Mr. Shin would be different.

960
01:06:30,765 --> 01:06:32,042
Did I misunderstand?

961
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,195
Didn't I tell you?

962
01:06:42,562 --> 01:06:45,574
It has never ended well
when you dated these people.

963
01:06:48,582 --> 01:06:51,253
Damn it. That author is also too much.

964
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:54,808
He has a girlfriend,
but still did this to you.

965
01:06:55,588 --> 01:06:58,660
Enough. Stop talking about it.

966
01:06:59,628 --> 01:07:00,839
Want another drink?

967
01:07:05,777 --> 01:07:06,777
Oh, right.

968
01:07:06,996 --> 01:07:08,183
Don't be surprised.

969
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:11,503
There's a lot of gay male couples here.

970
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:12,910
Gay male couples?

971
01:07:13,012 --> 01:07:15,558
This specialist is my friend,

972
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,105
but he likes men,

973
01:07:17,653 --> 01:07:20,074
so most of his guests
are gay male couples.

974
01:07:20,887 --> 01:07:23,449
The world is more accepting now.

975
01:07:24,215 --> 01:07:26,769
- You're okay with it, right?
- Yes.

976
01:07:27,162 --> 01:07:28,839
- Let's go, then.
- Okay.

977
01:07:31,503 --> 01:07:32,831
Gay male couples?

978
01:07:33,706 --> 01:07:36,449
And I thought it had
nothing to do with me.

979
01:07:42,164 --> 01:07:45,648
- It's on me tonight.
- No way, you're in a bad mood.

980
01:07:45,836 --> 01:07:48,226
- I'll pay.
- Don't.

981
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:50,734
Jimin.

982
01:08:00,934 --> 01:08:03,500
This specialist is my friend,

983
01:08:03,525 --> 01:08:04,906
but he likes men,

984
01:08:04,931 --> 01:08:07,468
so most of his guests
are gay male couples.

985
01:08:08,227 --> 01:08:09,227
Mr. Shin.

986
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:13,609
- How come...
- Muyeong.

987
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:20,343
- Who is with you here?
- Oh, he's...

988
01:08:22,117 --> 01:08:24,750
Hello, I'm Han Junseok.

989
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:28,125
Oh, hello.

990
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,171
...so most of his guests
are gay male couples.

991
01:08:38,052 --> 01:08:39,755
Why is he here?

992
01:09:00,901 --> 01:09:03,072
Oh my. What's going on?

993
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,478
What is this? My gosh.

994
01:09:06,503 --> 01:09:07,575
That's so bold.

995
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,090
I did something reckless.

996
01:09:53,426 --> 01:09:54,426
But...

997
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:58,621
when I saw how shaken Muyeong was,
I came to my senses.

998
01:10:09,044 --> 01:10:11,145
Right. Muyeong has always

999
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,817
been like this.

1000
01:10:17,372 --> 01:10:18,598
What are you doing here?

1001
01:10:19,154 --> 01:10:20,325
I heard you got the second prize.

1002
01:10:21,372 --> 01:10:24,645
- Congrats.
- Just a small event in the institute.

1003
01:10:24,985 --> 01:10:25,985
Whatever.

1004
01:10:29,192 --> 01:10:30,989
It's you, so I want to congratulate you.

1005
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:37,958
This one?

1006
01:10:38,788 --> 01:10:39,788
Nice work.

1007
01:10:42,903 --> 01:10:46,254
Compared to this, I'm so far behind.

1008
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:48,431
This one is the winner?

1009
01:10:48,458 --> 01:10:51,009
I think yours is more beautiful.

1010
01:10:57,478 --> 01:10:58,478
So, it's this person.

1011
01:10:59,908 --> 01:11:00,908
What?

1012
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:03,415
The person that you like.

1013
01:11:06,557 --> 01:11:08,783
- No, it's not that.
- Come on.

1014
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:13,564
Your eyes say it all.

1015
01:11:15,777 --> 01:11:16,908
Will you confess?

1016
01:11:21,025 --> 01:11:22,025
No.

1017
01:11:22,689 --> 01:11:26,290
If I do, he'll probably
feel uncomfortable.

1018
01:11:27,545 --> 01:11:29,353
I don't want to get hurt again.

1019
01:11:30,978 --> 01:11:34,197
And I don't want to...
hurt someone else.

1020
01:11:34,476 --> 01:11:37,486
If someone you love is in front of you,

1021
01:11:37,511 --> 01:11:40,587
you'll like everything about them,

1022
01:11:40,872 --> 01:11:44,009
and see no one else but them.

1023
01:11:44,144 --> 01:11:45,433
I have to go.

1024
01:11:45,752 --> 01:11:48,136
- Thanks for the gift.
- Oh, okay.

1025
01:11:56,907 --> 01:11:59,102
No matter if it's then or now,
you're the same.

1026
01:12:01,212 --> 01:12:04,649
Why haven't you learned to grow up?

1027
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:07,774
You keep doing things
according to your feelings.

1028
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:14,196
When I kissed him,
something came to my mind.

1029
01:12:15,642 --> 01:12:17,196
If it's you...

1030
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,836
I can do even more than this.

1031
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:37,117
Yesterday, I panicked and ran away.

1032
01:12:38,602 --> 01:12:40,563
I don't know how to deal with this.

1033
01:12:42,493 --> 01:12:44,719
Mr. Shin seems normal.

1034
01:12:45,422 --> 01:12:48,531
What? Is he pretending
that he didn't see anything?

1035
01:12:51,811 --> 01:12:53,795
What do I do? It's awkward.

1036
01:12:53,998 --> 01:12:56,412
I feel like I have a crush
on a guy who has a girlfriend.

1037
01:12:56,437 --> 01:12:59,693
No, a guy who has a boyfriend.

1038
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:01,529
A crush?

1039
01:13:01,823 --> 01:13:04,412
A... A crush?

1040
01:13:11,817 --> 01:13:14,043
- Oh, it's awkward.
- No.

1041
01:13:14,314 --> 01:13:15,918
Just say what you want to say.

1042
01:13:22,216 --> 01:13:24,231
- Well, Muyeong.
- Yes?

1043
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:27,168
Please change the background into this.

1044
01:13:27,489 --> 01:13:29,137
Oh, no.

1045
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:31,934
Come to think of it,
the background should be something else.

1046
01:13:35,504 --> 01:13:36,629
Are you crazy?

1047
01:13:36,894 --> 01:13:39,153
Are you going to use the bar
as the background?

1048
01:13:39,528 --> 01:13:41,973
- Then what should we use?
- Oh... well...

1049
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,035
This one.

1050
01:13:47,288 --> 01:13:48,379
(Author Shin Seonho's file)

1051
01:13:53,489 --> 01:13:55,902
- Hotel?
- Yes.

1052
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,793
I took the picture myself.
You can just trace it.

1053
01:14:00,818 --> 01:14:02,949
- Of course.
- Sorry?

1054
01:14:03,123 --> 01:14:04,215
Nothing.

1055
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:08,832
I almost forgot.

1056
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,785
Mr. Shin is dating PD Minyoung.

1057
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:15,434
What am I hoping for?

1058
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:26,949
I'm getting off.

1059
01:14:27,033 --> 01:14:28,957
It's time?

1060
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:32,434
- Get home safely, then.
- Okay.

1061
01:14:35,528 --> 01:14:38,660
Oh, wait, Muyeong.

1062
01:14:43,262 --> 01:14:45,973
Do you have something to say to me?

1063
01:14:46,584 --> 01:14:48,137
No, it's just...

1064
01:14:49,794 --> 01:14:51,020
You want to talk about...

1065
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:54,153
last Friday, right?

1066
01:15:01,606 --> 01:15:03,699
That's right.

1067
01:15:04,793 --> 01:15:07,582
Yes, I like men.

1068
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,074
So what?

1069
01:15:13,473 --> 01:15:16,043
Well... it's not like that, Muyeong.

1070
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:20,004
Actually...

1071
01:15:21,739 --> 01:15:24,246
I like you, Muyeong.

1072
01:15:28,598 --> 01:15:29,637
Do you?

1073
01:15:29,662 --> 01:15:31,160
(Me too.)

1074
01:15:32,755 --> 01:15:35,988
And what are you going to do?
I have a boyfriend.

1075
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:38,629
(I like you too, Mr. Shin.)

1076
01:15:39,575 --> 01:15:41,059
The one...

1077
01:15:41,856 --> 01:15:44,082
- with the glasses?
- That's right.

1078
01:15:44,895 --> 01:15:46,496
He's my boyfriend.

1079
01:15:47,145 --> 01:15:48,903
(There's nothing I can do anyway.)

1080
01:15:50,075 --> 01:15:51,996
I see.

1081
01:15:53,661 --> 01:15:56,863
(Because you have PD Minyoung.)

1082
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:58,333
But still...

1083
01:16:00,538 --> 01:16:01,538
But still...

1084
01:16:03,426 --> 01:16:07,387
I wanted to tell you...
what's on my mind.

1085
01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:13,606
So I don't have any regrets.

1086
01:16:32,169 --> 01:16:34,045
I know it's impossible.

1087
01:16:34,311 --> 01:16:35,311
Besides...

1088
01:16:37,591 --> 01:16:39,238
I'm not right...

1089
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:42,014
for Muyeong at all.

1090
01:16:43,225 --> 01:16:45,545
I hope you don't know what I feel.

1091
01:16:46,983 --> 01:16:50,498
That way, you won't get hurt.

1092
01:17:00,108 --> 01:17:03,381
No matter how lonely you feel,
you can't let it happen.

1093
01:17:06,811 --> 01:17:08,241
What are you thinking about?

1094
01:17:10,358 --> 01:17:11,842
That man at the bar

1095
01:17:12,163 --> 01:17:14,139
- is that author, right?
- Yeah.

1096
01:17:16,512 --> 01:17:19,496
But... what the heck did you do?

1097
01:17:22,075 --> 01:17:23,105
What did I do?

1098
01:17:23,411 --> 01:17:25,168
You kissed me.

1099
01:17:26,503 --> 01:17:28,026
You're curious about that now?

1100
01:17:28,581 --> 01:17:29,987
Why did you do that?

1101
01:17:31,863 --> 01:17:35,839
I just... wanted to help you.

1102
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:38,909
I was going to make that author jealous.

1103
01:17:40,081 --> 01:17:43,050
So, did you tell him?

1104
01:17:43,682 --> 01:17:44,682
No.

1105
01:17:46,019 --> 01:17:48,253
Just let him think that way.

1106
01:17:50,706 --> 01:17:51,706
This is fun.

1107
01:17:54,581 --> 01:17:56,893
How are you going to
look at him after this?

1108
01:17:59,579 --> 01:18:01,180
I think I'm gonna quit.

1109
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:09,696
Yes, that's the way it should be.

1110
01:18:23,977 --> 01:18:26,180
Mr. Shin, I have something to tell you.

1111
01:18:26,205 --> 01:18:29,562
I'm sorry for having to say this,
but I'd like to quit.

1112
01:18:29,587 --> 01:18:31,774
Muyeong is going to quit?

1113
01:18:31,799 --> 01:18:33,507
I have my personal reason.

1114
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:36,977
- I'll be working from home.
- All of a sudden?

1115
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,860
- Until you find someone to replace me.
- What?

1116
01:18:40,094 --> 01:18:41,735
What personal reason?

1117
01:18:42,852 --> 01:18:45,391
Is it because... I confessed?

1118
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:48,030
All right.

1119
01:18:48,804 --> 01:18:53,399
Is it because I like you?

1120
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,560
He read but doesn't reply?

1121
01:19:10,959 --> 01:19:15,927
I thought he would say
that he needed me.

1122
01:19:17,061 --> 01:19:18,521
Actually...

1123
01:19:20,181 --> 01:19:23,297
I like you, Muyeong.

1124
01:19:24,649 --> 01:19:26,196
After I heard that,

1125
01:19:28,485 --> 01:19:30,594
how can I look at him and feel nothing?

1126
01:19:31,243 --> 01:19:32,821
It's better not to see him.

1127
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:44,071
Let's eat.

1128
01:19:44,886 --> 01:19:46,243
I have to go now.

1129
01:19:50,188 --> 01:19:51,805
The more I try to forget...

1130
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,248
The more I miss him.

1131
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,326
Muyeong's smiling face.

1132
01:19:59,983 --> 01:20:03,084
The time I spent with Muyeong.

1133
01:20:03,748 --> 01:20:07,146
All right. Let's try it.

1134
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:13,803
Now that you're full, stay strong.

1135
01:20:14,292 --> 01:20:16,225
Stop it. I am strong.

1136
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:18,654
Although I don't know much about love,

1137
01:20:18,928 --> 01:20:21,779
I know getting your heart
broken is tough.

1138
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,998
I'm not heart-broken.
I haven't even started.

1139
01:20:25,491 --> 01:20:26,491
Got it.

1140
01:20:27,241 --> 01:20:28,241
I'll get going, then.

1141
01:20:39,217 --> 01:20:42,123
Then go, or you'll be late.

1142
01:20:46,368 --> 01:20:48,318
Pretend you're my boyfriend.

1143
01:20:57,498 --> 01:20:58,935
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

1144
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:02,084
- Drive safely.
- Okay.

1145
01:21:14,522 --> 01:21:15,654
Muyeong.

1146
01:21:16,779 --> 01:21:18,670
Can we talk for a second?

1147
01:21:19,084 --> 01:21:21,935
I'm sorry about the job.

1148
01:21:24,116 --> 01:21:25,576
What do you want to talk about?

1149
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:28,685
I need to go soon.

1150
01:21:29,394 --> 01:21:31,256
I just want to tell him to stay with me.

1151
01:21:31,564 --> 01:21:35,178
I want to say I can wait,
so please come back.

1152
01:21:35,772 --> 01:21:38,185
But I just realized...

1153
01:21:39,303 --> 01:21:40,693
how much.

1154
01:21:41,373 --> 01:21:43,701
I have wronged Muyeong.

1155
01:21:44,795 --> 01:21:47,717
Thank you... for everything you've done.

1156
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:06,777
We haven't even started dating,

1157
01:22:09,355 --> 01:22:11,253
but why does my heart hurt so much?

1158
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:22,222
Muyeong.

1159
01:22:24,535 --> 01:22:26,011
I miss you.

1160
01:22:36,024 --> 01:22:37,274
I miss you.

1161
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,535
(Today, I'll drop by
to collect my things)

1162
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:54,145
I sent it before I got in the shower,
but he hasn't read it yet?

1163
01:23:08,762 --> 01:23:09,762
Right.

1164
01:23:10,489 --> 01:23:14,309
If I want to work from home,
I need to go get my stuff.

1165
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,846
Mr. Shin, I'm here to collect my things.

1166
01:23:28,425 --> 01:23:29,510
No one is here?

1167
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:32,065
Bottles.

1168
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:33,987
How much did he drink?

1169
01:23:39,987 --> 01:23:41,198
Mr. Shin.

1170
01:23:44,151 --> 01:23:45,542
He seems tired.

1171
01:23:47,162 --> 01:23:49,940
I wonder how he feels.

1172
01:23:53,846 --> 01:23:54,908
No.

1173
01:23:55,807 --> 01:23:58,205
I've decided not to go on.
I shouldn't worry about him.

1174
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:03,689
Mr. Shin, I like you a lot.

1175
01:24:05,018 --> 01:24:06,322
Goodbye.

1176
01:24:07,059 --> 01:24:08,572
Don't go, Muyeong.

1177
01:24:12,635 --> 01:24:13,986
Muyeong.

1178
01:24:15,131 --> 01:24:17,056
Don't be with him.

1179
01:24:20,056 --> 01:24:21,686
I can't move.

1180
01:24:22,244 --> 01:24:25,240
Please don't go. Stay by my side.

1181
01:24:26,092 --> 01:24:27,193
Muyeong.

1182
01:24:27,496 --> 01:24:28,496
Muyeong.

1183
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:29,928
Don't go, Muyeong.

1184
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,348
Oh! Muyeong!

1185
01:24:54,466 --> 01:24:56,981
Muyeong, I'm sorry.

1186
01:24:57,887 --> 01:24:59,903
I really thought it was a dream.

1187
01:25:00,029 --> 01:25:03,434
- I thought you'd never come back.
- I sent you a message

1188
01:25:03,685 --> 01:25:05,098
telling you I was coming
to get my stuff.

1189
01:25:06,122 --> 01:25:08,567
I didn't see it. Sorry.

1190
01:25:11,917 --> 01:25:12,924
Anyway,

1191
01:25:13,604 --> 01:25:15,073
it's good that you woke up.

1192
01:25:16,155 --> 01:25:18,068
I smell bad.
I'll go take a shower first.

1193
01:25:18,093 --> 01:25:20,716
- Then, we can eat.
- Wait, what do you mean?

1194
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,382
Please don't go back yet. Please.

1195
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,616
I have something to talk to you about.
Okay?

1196
01:25:26,234 --> 01:25:27,351
Okay.

1197
01:25:28,818 --> 01:25:29,818
Good.

1198
01:25:31,732 --> 01:25:32,732
Please don't go yet.

1199
01:25:35,622 --> 01:25:36,622
Please don't go yet.

1200
01:25:40,184 --> 01:25:41,458
Don't go, Muyeong.

1201
01:25:42,607 --> 01:25:45,809
It reminds me of that.

1202
01:25:49,497 --> 01:25:50,497
PD Lee?

1203
01:25:52,294 --> 01:25:53,825
Hello, Mr. Ko.

1204
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:56,067
Where is Mr. Shin?

1205
01:25:56,599 --> 01:25:57,809
In the shower.

1206
01:25:58,451 --> 01:26:01,911
I couldn't reach him,
so I had to come here.

1207
01:26:02,475 --> 01:26:05,248
I told him not to make me worry,
but he still...

1208
01:26:05,959 --> 01:26:09,560
Is this a curse, to make me repeat
the same things over and over again?

1209
01:26:09,585 --> 01:26:11,693
Or is it the black hole of deadline?

1210
01:26:11,718 --> 01:26:15,615
I really need to hand in
the manuscript now.

1211
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:18,732
Why are you telling me that?

1212
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:22,763
Talk to him when he comes out.

1213
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:24,943
Oh, okay.

1214
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:32,967
I was afraid we'd be late again,
so I got really scared.

1215
01:26:32,981 --> 01:26:36,404
But since you're here,
I'm much more relieved.

1216
01:26:36,936 --> 01:26:38,873
You can work late tonight, right?

1217
01:26:39,389 --> 01:26:41,935
- No, I...
- Oh.

1218
01:26:42,561 --> 01:26:43,849
I got it.

1219
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:54,384
What? When did you get here?

1220
01:27:12,682 --> 01:27:13,682
What is this?

1221
01:27:15,115 --> 01:27:16,213
Is it this guy?

1222
01:27:16,463 --> 01:27:19,845
- Your friend.
- You think acting like this is cool?

1223
01:27:20,572 --> 01:27:22,002
You're wrong.

1224
01:27:22,674 --> 01:27:24,455
I've never understood

1225
01:27:24,488 --> 01:27:26,963
why you care so much about that guy.

1226
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:29,259
But I understand now.

1227
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,564
It's not like that, Yoona.

1228
01:27:34,283 --> 01:27:35,869
Even though it's hard to believe,

1229
01:27:36,807 --> 01:27:38,720
- I did that for a reason.
- Really.

1230
01:27:39,266 --> 01:27:40,939
But you seemed very happy to do it?

1231
01:27:42,447 --> 01:27:43,900
Who took the picture this time?

1232
01:27:44,222 --> 01:27:47,556
If these pictures are released,
the wedding will be canceled.

1233
01:27:47,581 --> 01:27:50,213
People in your company will know.

1234
01:27:50,439 --> 01:27:51,439
Your parents too.

1235
01:27:53,229 --> 01:27:55,252
Your position in the company

1236
01:27:55,722 --> 01:27:58,166
- would be...
- What do you want?

1237
01:27:59,955 --> 01:28:02,970
Tell your parents we're canceling the
wedding because you did something wrong.

1238
01:28:05,963 --> 01:28:07,650
You don't love me, right?

1239
01:28:13,994 --> 01:28:16,072
Muyeong, you haven't
gone back yet, right?

1240
01:28:16,214 --> 01:28:18,150
Not yet. But...

1241
01:28:18,237 --> 01:28:21,978
- PD Minyoung is waiting for you.
- You must be mad because I kissed you.

1242
01:28:22,003 --> 01:28:24,322
I'll hurry and go out.

1243
01:28:26,781 --> 01:28:28,320
- That's not it.
- Shh!

1244
01:28:28,961 --> 01:28:32,210
It's not like that.
Mr. Shin was asleep earlier.

1245
01:28:33,896 --> 01:28:36,898
And I'm sorry
I touched your waist earlier.

1246
01:28:37,047 --> 01:28:40,257
I didn't realize I was groping you.

1247
01:28:40,282 --> 01:28:44,874
I was sweaty,
so you got dirty because of me.

1248
01:28:45,022 --> 01:28:46,022
I'll get going.

1249
01:28:47,015 --> 01:28:49,671
Are you still there? Please wait a sec.

1250
01:28:49,696 --> 01:28:51,132
It's not like that, PD Lee.

1251
01:28:51,157 --> 01:28:52,343
Please wait.

1252
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:54,187
It's okay.

1253
01:28:54,212 --> 01:28:56,491
Love should come first.

1254
01:28:56,968 --> 01:28:58,624
I'll ask for a break from work for you.

1255
01:29:12,211 --> 01:29:13,211
Muyeong.

1256
01:29:13,236 --> 01:29:15,195
PD Minyoung was here.

1257
01:29:15,571 --> 01:29:16,929
Really? Why?

1258
01:29:16,954 --> 01:29:18,890
It doesn't matter now.

1259
01:29:18,915 --> 01:29:21,226
She heard everything
you said in the bathroom.

1260
01:29:25,047 --> 01:29:26,218
I'm sorry.

1261
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:29,210
I'll explain to her.

1262
01:29:29,539 --> 01:29:32,460
So it's true, Mr. Shin and PD Lee...

1263
01:29:32,945 --> 01:29:37,280
I'll explain it well so that
it won't affect your reputation.

1264
01:29:38,008 --> 01:29:40,429
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1265
01:29:41,307 --> 01:29:42,827
I think I should go too.

1266
01:29:43,312 --> 01:29:44,710
Let's just eat next time.

1267
01:29:46,218 --> 01:29:47,421
Muyeong.

1268
01:29:53,203 --> 01:29:56,218
Did you quit because of me?

1269
01:29:57,857 --> 01:29:59,091
No.

1270
01:29:59,822 --> 01:30:01,185
It's my fault.

1271
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:03,794
You don't have to lie.

1272
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,880
No, it's really my fault.

1273
01:30:06,529 --> 01:30:08,208
I wanted to stop...

1274
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:12,060
doing stupid things like this.

1275
01:30:13,841 --> 01:30:17,770
By stupid things, do you mean drawing?

1276
01:30:19,185 --> 01:30:20,981
- No.
- What?

1277
01:30:21,748 --> 01:30:23,888
- I mean liking you.
- What did...

1278
01:30:24,567 --> 01:30:25,708
you say?

1279
01:30:27,857 --> 01:30:29,333
Liking what?

1280
01:30:31,364 --> 01:30:33,372
Pretend you didn't hear it.

1281
01:30:33,646 --> 01:30:34,669
Say it again.

1282
01:30:34,694 --> 01:30:36,161
Please say it again.

1283
01:30:36,742 --> 01:30:40,325
- I want to stop doing stupid things.
- Not that.

1284
01:30:42,076 --> 01:30:43,528
You liking me.

1285
01:30:46,278 --> 01:30:47,653
I want to hear

1286
01:30:47,946 --> 01:30:48,946
those words.

1287
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:58,177
Please don't stop.

1288
01:30:58,956 --> 01:31:01,005
- Being your assistant?
- No.

1289
01:31:01,463 --> 01:31:03,013
Liking me.

1290
01:31:05,287 --> 01:31:07,130
Please keep liking me.

1291
01:31:08,137 --> 01:31:11,435
If you just like me, I won't think
about anything complicated.

1292
01:31:15,612 --> 01:31:17,627
I know this might be off-topic but...

1293
01:31:18,269 --> 01:31:20,206
- Please break up.
- What?

1294
01:31:20,987 --> 01:31:23,979
Do I... like Muyeong?

1295
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:25,815
Go and be with someone you like.

1296
01:31:26,487 --> 01:31:28,377
Be with someone I like?

1297
01:31:29,518 --> 01:31:32,026
Honestly, you only go to Muyeong.

1298
01:31:32,051 --> 01:31:34,065
When something comes up, you run to him.

1299
01:31:34,706 --> 01:31:35,807
Is that so?

1300
01:31:37,093 --> 01:31:38,093
I don't remember.

1301
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,854
Anyway, what I want to say is you should

1302
01:31:41,136 --> 01:31:44,807
- date someone you really like.
- I told you it's not like that.

1303
01:31:44,832 --> 01:31:48,135
- Then, is it one-sided love?
- It's not.

1304
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:55,112
Let's stop here.

1305
01:32:02,057 --> 01:32:03,761
So you really like him.

1306
01:32:06,418 --> 01:32:09,683
You've never had that serious look
when you're with me.

1307
01:32:11,757 --> 01:32:16,319
I just take care of my friend,
so he doesn't get hurt.

1308
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:21,382
I'll be by his side when he needs me.

1309
01:32:24,836 --> 01:32:28,085
It's fun when I'm with him.

1310
01:32:30,588 --> 01:32:32,280
And I'm happy.

1311
01:32:39,461 --> 01:32:42,171
I guess... I like Muyeong.

1312
01:32:43,718 --> 01:32:45,124
- I like you.
- I like you.

1313
01:32:46,947 --> 01:32:48,982
So please only like me.

1314
01:32:49,234 --> 01:32:50,929
I want you to like only me.

1315
01:32:53,161 --> 01:32:54,444
Please break up

1316
01:32:55,555 --> 01:32:57,007
with that guy.

1317
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:01,874
Shouldn't you take care
of your problem first?

1318
01:33:02,679 --> 01:33:04,968
- What do you mean?
- PD Minyoung.

1319
01:33:05,499 --> 01:33:08,359
- I know there's something between you.
- Me?

1320
01:33:10,023 --> 01:33:11,319
You mean,

1321
01:33:11,674 --> 01:33:14,108
- you two are not dating?
- No.

1322
01:33:14,133 --> 01:33:15,460
That's not possible.

1323
01:33:15,485 --> 01:33:17,101
Then partners?

1324
01:33:17,551 --> 01:33:18,551
What?

1325
01:33:18,888 --> 01:33:20,757
What do you think of me?

1326
01:33:21,242 --> 01:33:25,335
But you two went to a hotel together,
and held hands at a cafe.

1327
01:33:27,976 --> 01:33:30,609
We went there to take pictures.

1328
01:33:31,089 --> 01:33:34,132
And about us holding hands, she's just
teaching me how to tie a knot.

1329
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:37,140
So you two...

1330
01:33:37,575 --> 01:33:39,265
We're not together.

1331
01:33:42,336 --> 01:33:44,437
- I see.
- Then...

1332
01:33:45,648 --> 01:33:47,577
Are you going to break up with him?

1333
01:33:49,859 --> 01:33:51,663
Actually,

1334
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,773
we just pretended that we're dating.

1335
01:33:54,265 --> 01:33:55,515
He's my friend.

1336
01:33:56,461 --> 01:33:57,788
What did you say?

1337
01:33:57,973 --> 01:34:00,773
That really hurt my feelings.

1338
01:34:00,798 --> 01:34:02,077
Why did you do that?

1339
01:34:02,328 --> 01:34:05,171
I was angry because you kissed me

1340
01:34:05,196 --> 01:34:07,866
even though you're with PD Minyoung.

1341
01:34:09,968 --> 01:34:11,265
That's too much.

1342
01:34:11,848 --> 01:34:13,585
Do you know how I feel?

1343
01:34:18,429 --> 01:34:19,593
Now,

1344
01:34:21,741 --> 01:34:23,296
I'm so happy.

1345
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:27,718
I like you, Muyeong.

1346
01:34:29,062 --> 01:34:31,296
I like you too, Mr. Shin.

1347
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:34,069
By the way,

1348
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:37,679
how did you know we went to
a hotel and held hands?

1349
01:34:38,828 --> 01:34:40,835
About that...

1350
01:34:45,617 --> 01:34:46,780
Wait a sec.

1351
01:34:47,671 --> 01:34:49,304
- Hello?
- Are you Muyeong?

1352
01:34:49,329 --> 01:34:52,702
- Right now, Junseok is in the hospital.
- What?

1353
01:34:53,093 --> 01:34:55,101
Can you come here?

1354
01:34:56,601 --> 01:34:57,601
Yes.

1355
01:34:58,607 --> 01:35:00,843
Mr. Shin, I need to go.

1356
01:35:01,755 --> 01:35:02,755
Where to?

1357
01:35:02,871 --> 01:35:06,405
Junseok got into an accident.
I'll tell you later.

1358
01:35:06,877 --> 01:35:08,273
Wait, Muyeong.

1359
01:35:18,241 --> 01:35:19,944
What timing.

1360
01:35:30,898 --> 01:35:33,288
- You're Muyeong, right?
- Are you Yoona?

1361
01:35:36,054 --> 01:35:37,272
What happened?

1362
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:41,913
He got into an accident on his way home.

1363
01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:46,764
Luckily, he wasn't seriously injured.
He just needs a cast.

1364
01:35:48,101 --> 01:35:49,538
But, Muyeong,

1365
01:35:50,851 --> 01:35:52,561
can you stay by his side

1366
01:35:54,773 --> 01:35:57,280
until he gets better?

1367
01:35:57,856 --> 01:35:58,856
What?

1368
01:35:59,957 --> 01:36:01,139
We broke up.

1369
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:04,061
- Why...
- I know about you two.

1370
01:36:05,429 --> 01:36:07,319
- I think you misunderstood.
- Muyeong,

1371
01:36:07,519 --> 01:36:10,827
even though you think it's nothing,
that's not the case with Junseok.

1372
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:13,428
He really likes you.

1373
01:36:17,843 --> 01:36:19,350
Please take care of him.

1374
01:36:47,788 --> 01:36:48,812
Are you okay?

1375
01:36:50,163 --> 01:36:51,163
Yeah.

1376
01:36:54,117 --> 01:36:55,835
When I'm better,

1377
01:36:56,701 --> 01:36:59,413
I'll become a pathetic idiot
of a boyfriend.

1378
01:37:03,366 --> 01:37:04,483
Aren't you curious?

1379
01:37:05,426 --> 01:37:06,426
What?

1380
01:37:07,227 --> 01:37:08,975
I asked if you're curious.

1381
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:11,991
A pathetic idiot of a boyfriend.

1382
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:20,507
What happened with Yoona?

1383
01:37:24,679 --> 01:37:28,937
Do you know the feeling of not being
able to do anything you want?

1384
01:37:32,393 --> 01:37:35,486
I've been told what to do
since I was a kid. About schools.

1385
01:37:36,135 --> 01:37:38,111
About my jobs.

1386
01:37:38,987 --> 01:37:41,314
Or even about who I should marry.

1387
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,603
At first, I didn't even
pay attention to Muyeong.

1388
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:55,410
But everything changed.

1389
01:37:55,435 --> 01:37:57,377
Hey, stop it.

1390
01:37:57,667 --> 01:38:00,619
Even if it's a taboo in society,

1391
01:38:00,999 --> 01:38:02,806
I could talk about it freely.

1392
01:38:02,831 --> 01:38:03,916
Enough.

1393
01:38:04,369 --> 01:38:08,596
I could express myself
without having to hide anything.

1394
01:38:10,311 --> 01:38:14,451
For someone who used to believe
doing as I was told was a good thing,

1395
01:38:15,561 --> 01:38:17,279
it's happiness.

1396
01:38:19,037 --> 01:38:20,357
But then, one day,

1397
01:38:21,146 --> 01:38:23,451
Muyeong started liking someone.

1398
01:38:24,327 --> 01:38:27,545
Even though he tried to hide it, I knew

1399
01:38:28,484 --> 01:38:31,599
that Muyeong liked that person.

1400
01:38:33,506 --> 01:38:34,677
And...

1401
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,790
I know now...

1402
01:38:54,728 --> 01:38:55,728
that I...

1403
01:38:56,988 --> 01:38:58,962
like Muyeong.

1404
01:38:58,987 --> 01:39:00,657
What? What is it?

1405
01:39:05,056 --> 01:39:06,899
No. Nothing.

1406
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:11,204
I guess you're better now.

1407
01:39:14,025 --> 01:39:15,025
Hey, Ko Muyeong.

1408
01:39:15,658 --> 01:39:16,954
Remember when I said.

1409
01:39:17,552 --> 01:39:22,181
I'm a pathetic idiot of a boyfriend?

1410
01:39:27,236 --> 01:39:30,118
You know I broke up with Yoona
before I got into the accident, right?

1411
01:39:34,064 --> 01:39:36,657
When I realized
I could die at any moment,

1412
01:39:37,163 --> 01:39:39,056
I decided I should be
honest with myself.

1413
01:39:39,619 --> 01:39:41,126
Why would you die?

1414
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:44,220
I feel sorry for Yoona.

1415
01:39:47,345 --> 01:39:50,220
But it seems I already
have someone that I like.

1416
01:39:52,259 --> 01:39:54,649
At first, I was going to
confess to that person.

1417
01:40:00,166 --> 01:40:02,353
But the accident happened.

1418
01:40:03,558 --> 01:40:05,095
So I think I'll confess later.

1419
01:40:06,798 --> 01:40:08,837
I'll confess after I've recovered.

1420
01:40:14,908 --> 01:40:16,618
Aren't you curious who it is?

1421
01:40:20,142 --> 01:40:21,189
You can tell me later.

1422
01:40:25,822 --> 01:40:28,204
When you've recovered,
just tell me then.

1423
01:40:28,927 --> 01:40:29,927
Muyeong.

1424
01:40:32,431 --> 01:40:34,915
Stay by my side
until they take off the cast.

1425
01:40:35,767 --> 01:40:37,501
- Junseok...
- Please do it for me.

1426
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:43,353
I was always by your side
whenever you had a hard time.

1427
01:40:53,341 --> 01:40:57,045
Am I Muyeong's second choice?

1428
01:41:03,551 --> 01:41:05,189
(Han Junseok)

1429
01:41:07,049 --> 01:41:08,049
Excuse me.

1430
01:41:18,055 --> 01:41:20,421
I think a city background
should be better.

1431
01:41:20,446 --> 01:41:22,454
- You want more buildings?
- Yes.

1432
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:23,612
(Han Junseok)

1433
01:41:23,637 --> 01:41:24,782
Please give me a sec.

1434
01:41:27,087 --> 01:41:30,493
Mr. Shin, I need to go to the hospital.

1435
01:41:30,704 --> 01:41:31,938
I'm sorry.

1436
01:41:36,915 --> 01:41:39,626
Compared to the time the two of them
have known each other,

1437
01:41:40,307 --> 01:41:43,813
are the memories with me insignificant?

1438
01:41:54,876 --> 01:41:59,095
With his status, appearance,
and academic background,

1439
01:41:59,881 --> 01:42:01,938
he's more suitable
for Muyeong than I am.

1440
01:42:05,525 --> 01:42:06,954
The problem is with Muyeong.

1441
01:42:07,759 --> 01:42:12,266
When he calls, he just runs to him.

1442
01:42:14,392 --> 01:42:15,657
That's terrible.

1443
01:42:17,118 --> 01:42:18,306
I miss him.

1444
01:42:43,736 --> 01:42:44,970
Muyeong.

1445
01:42:47,302 --> 01:42:49,837
Sleep in, it's your birthday.

1446
01:42:50,038 --> 01:42:51,649
I made seaweed soup for you.

1447
01:42:58,188 --> 01:42:59,290
Thank you.

1448
01:43:04,891 --> 01:43:06,004
(Junseok's caregiver)

1449
01:43:06,454 --> 01:43:07,626
Please give me a sec.

1450
01:43:08,509 --> 01:43:10,212
- Hello?
- Mr. Ko Muyeong?

1451
01:43:10,235 --> 01:43:11,993
Yes. Is there a problem?

1452
01:43:12,018 --> 01:43:13,774
Mr. Han Junseok is missing.

1453
01:43:14,329 --> 01:43:16,962
- What?
- You need to come to the hospital.

1454
01:43:17,779 --> 01:43:19,173
Understood.

1455
01:43:21,251 --> 01:43:23,063
I'm sorry, Mr. Shin.

1456
01:43:24,179 --> 01:43:25,806
I have to go.

1457
01:43:26,357 --> 01:43:27,357
What?

1458
01:43:27,815 --> 01:43:29,579
The caregiver said Junseok is missing.

1459
01:43:31,353 --> 01:43:34,095
Even if you go,
there's nothing you can do.

1460
01:43:34,853 --> 01:43:36,290
Right, but...

1461
01:43:36,988 --> 01:43:39,360
I told you he has depression.

1462
01:43:39,385 --> 01:43:41,063
Do you really need to do that?

1463
01:43:41,701 --> 01:43:44,188
He has his family and his caregiver.

1464
01:43:46,087 --> 01:43:49,102
I'm his only friend.

1465
01:43:50,012 --> 01:43:51,813
Today, you can't go.

1466
01:43:52,173 --> 01:43:55,470
- It's my birthday.
- Please try to understand.

1467
01:43:56,415 --> 01:43:58,243
If you go,

1468
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:00,751
I won't see you again, Muyeong.

1469
01:44:05,345 --> 01:44:08,352
I told you. If you go...

1470
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:11,681
it's over.

1471
01:44:19,977 --> 01:44:21,266
Here.

1472
01:44:26,072 --> 01:44:29,165
Muyeong, do I have to back off?

1473
01:44:29,465 --> 01:44:30,712
I'm your boyfriend,

1474
01:44:31,046 --> 01:44:33,415
but I feel like I'm a nuisance.

1475
01:44:44,119 --> 01:44:45,119
You're here?

1476
01:44:47,611 --> 01:44:49,696
I rushed here because
I thought you're missing.

1477
01:44:51,391 --> 01:44:52,696
Did you lie to me?

1478
01:44:53,798 --> 01:44:55,931
If I hadn't done that,
would you have come this fast?

1479
01:44:56,755 --> 01:45:00,071
You're always late
when you're with that author.

1480
01:45:01,144 --> 01:45:03,235
What's wrong with you?

1481
01:45:03,843 --> 01:45:06,852
- I'm leaving.
- I have something to show you.

1482
01:45:14,611 --> 01:45:17,212
Have you... fully recovered?

1483
01:45:20,165 --> 01:45:21,399
Remember when I said.

1484
01:45:22,595 --> 01:45:25,899
I wanted to confess to someone?

1485
01:45:26,204 --> 01:45:27,438
Of course.

1486
01:45:29,284 --> 01:45:30,735
I'm going to confess.

1487
01:45:35,970 --> 01:45:37,360
Aren't you curious?

1488
01:45:39,837 --> 01:45:40,837
Yeah.

1489
01:45:49,017 --> 01:45:50,923
No matter how you think
about it, this is...

1490
01:45:55,353 --> 01:45:58,936
absurd and nonsensical.

1491
01:45:59,686 --> 01:46:01,928
It's so irrational

1492
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:05,920
that even I don't want to believe it.

1493
01:46:08,921 --> 01:46:09,921
I love you,

1494
01:46:12,610 --> 01:46:13,610
Ko Muyeong.

1495
01:46:30,069 --> 01:46:31,951
Aren't you surprised?

1496
01:46:33,941 --> 01:46:34,941
I'm sorry.

1497
01:46:36,709 --> 01:46:39,311
- You already knew?
- I'm sorry.

1498
01:46:42,452 --> 01:46:43,889
Is that your answer?

1499
01:46:46,108 --> 01:46:48,631
You're a very good friend.

1500
01:46:52,452 --> 01:46:53,975
I knew it's gonna be like this.

1501
01:46:55,048 --> 01:46:56,287
It's just like you, Ko Muyeong.

1502
01:46:57,585 --> 01:46:59,397
But I won't give up.

1503
01:46:59,771 --> 01:47:01,576
When you break up with the author,
come to me.

1504
01:47:03,067 --> 01:47:05,397
I'll do my best.

1505
01:47:18,131 --> 01:47:19,584
Is he really not going to call?

1506
01:47:21,043 --> 01:47:23,576
Whatever. I don't care.

1507
01:47:25,499 --> 01:47:27,154
You went to someone else.

1508
01:47:38,186 --> 01:47:40,256
What? What?

1509
01:47:41,170 --> 01:47:44,417
You think if you left this,
I'll wait for you?

1510
01:47:46,789 --> 01:47:47,789
I won't read it.

1511
01:47:49,583 --> 01:47:50,921
I said I won't read it.

1512
01:47:52,702 --> 01:47:53,890
I really won't read it.

1513
01:47:55,633 --> 01:47:56,633
I'll work.

1514
01:47:58,084 --> 01:47:59,468
I have my pride too.

1515
01:48:03,812 --> 01:48:05,015
Should I read it a bit?

1516
01:48:08,883 --> 01:48:09,883
Mr. Shin,

1517
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:11,991
you may not know,

1518
01:48:12,016 --> 01:48:13,437
but this letter is actually

1519
01:48:13,784 --> 01:48:16,202
a letter that I wrote to you
a long time ago.

1520
01:48:20,265 --> 01:48:23,515
At first, I liked your painting,

1521
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:29,890
but I think I like you now.

1522
01:48:29,915 --> 01:48:30,915
(Yurim Middle School
Gold Medal Prize Shin Seonho)

1523
01:48:32,094 --> 01:48:33,218
So, it's this person.

1524
01:48:34,664 --> 01:48:35,664
What?

1525
01:48:36,329 --> 01:48:37,656
The person that you like.

1526
01:48:40,831 --> 01:48:42,942
I'm not going to confess.

1527
01:48:43,783 --> 01:48:46,044
I don't know if you'll
get to read this letter.

1528
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:49,341
But if I continue liking you,

1529
01:48:50,247 --> 01:48:52,356
you should get to read it one day.

1530
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:58,067
Then, it'd be great if you like me back.

1531
01:49:06,091 --> 01:49:07,223
Mr. Shin.

1532
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:10,091
Actually, I kept this letter away.

1533
01:49:13,372 --> 01:49:15,231
But then, one day,

1534
01:49:17,638 --> 01:49:19,552
I met you again.

1535
01:49:20,672 --> 01:49:24,458
And the feelings that I'd suppressed
started to explode.

1536
01:49:28,013 --> 01:49:29,903
I can't fight it anymore.

1537
01:49:30,349 --> 01:49:32,934
Now, I want to be selfish

1538
01:49:33,569 --> 01:49:36,411
because I like you so much.

1539
01:50:04,357 --> 01:50:05,357
You idiot.

1540
01:50:07,263 --> 01:50:09,231
Who would know if you hid it like that?

1541
01:50:16,641 --> 01:50:17,641
Mr. Shin.

1542
01:50:18,138 --> 01:50:19,911
- I thought you'd be mad...
- I am mad.

1543
01:50:20,555 --> 01:50:22,434
I told you I wasn't going
to see you again.

1544
01:50:25,286 --> 01:50:26,630
If it hadn't been for this letter...

1545
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:30,661
I wouldn't have come to see you.

1546
01:50:32,029 --> 01:50:34,958
Finally, you know how I feel.

1547
01:50:35,501 --> 01:50:36,973
Why didn't you tell me all this time?

1548
01:50:37,496 --> 01:50:39,192
Why didn't you confess back then?

1549
01:50:39,475 --> 01:50:40,981
Why didn't you do anything?

1550
01:50:41,694 --> 01:50:44,630
Back then, I didn't have the courage.

1551
01:50:47,091 --> 01:50:48,419
Is it too late?

1552
01:50:51,676 --> 01:50:53,010
It's not.

1553
01:50:54,589 --> 01:50:57,104
Thank you for having the courage now.

1554
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:35,423
What about... that guy?

1555
01:51:36,291 --> 01:51:37,291
What?

1556
01:51:38,202 --> 01:51:40,188
That guy.

1557
01:51:42,356 --> 01:51:44,798
- Junseok?
- Don't say his name fondly like that.

1558
01:51:45,235 --> 01:51:46,244
That guy.

1559
01:51:46,472 --> 01:51:47,666
That guy.

1560
01:51:48,151 --> 01:51:49,587
Okay, that guy.

1561
01:51:50,736 --> 01:51:52,939
- What about that guy?
- Well...

1562
01:51:53,455 --> 01:51:56,478
Since you said we're dating,

1563
01:51:56,497 --> 01:51:58,666
he keeps calling you to see him.

1564
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:00,767
Are you two really just friends?

1565
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:04,158
We're really just friends.

1566
01:52:04,511 --> 01:52:06,002
That's what you think.

1567
01:52:06,471 --> 01:52:08,306
That guy probably doesn't think
you're just a friend.

1568
01:52:12,182 --> 01:52:13,182
What are you doing?

1569
01:52:13,659 --> 01:52:14,962
There's more to this, right?

1570
01:52:15,681 --> 01:52:17,095
Be honest with me.

1571
01:52:17,838 --> 01:52:18,861
Well...

1572
01:52:19,767 --> 01:52:21,994
he just confessed to me.

1573
01:52:23,495 --> 01:52:24,705
But I turned him down.

1574
01:52:26,182 --> 01:52:28,548
See? I knew it.

1575
01:52:28,986 --> 01:52:30,314
Wait and see, Han Junseok.

1576
01:52:30,534 --> 01:52:32,462
No, that guy.

1577
01:52:33,811 --> 01:52:36,923
I feel relieved seeing you angry.

1578
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:38,260
Damn it.

1579
01:52:38,736 --> 01:52:41,791
You have no idea how scary this is.

1580
01:52:41,816 --> 01:52:43,408
I already turned him down.

1581
01:52:43,794 --> 01:52:44,869
Don't you believe me?

1582
01:52:45,590 --> 01:52:47,211
Yes, I do.

1583
01:52:47,236 --> 01:52:49,931
I believe you,
but how could I trust him?

1584
01:52:51,721 --> 01:52:55,150
What are you afraid of? I only have you.

1585
01:52:57,797 --> 01:52:58,908
Really?

1586
01:52:59,816 --> 01:53:00,816
Really?

1587
01:53:03,859 --> 01:53:05,119
Are you that happy?

1588
01:53:05,431 --> 01:53:07,556
Of course, I am happy.

1589
01:53:08,346 --> 01:53:10,048
Oh, Muyeong.

1590
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:12,541
- Do you want to live together?
- Yes.

1591
01:53:12,791 --> 01:53:13,791
What?

1592
01:53:15,283 --> 01:53:17,220
I take it that you said yes.

1593
01:53:17,856 --> 01:53:20,619
If you agree with my conditions,
I'll think about it.

1594
01:53:20,970 --> 01:53:23,533
Tell me. I'll do everything.

1595
01:53:45,349 --> 01:53:47,394
"Oh My Assistant"
