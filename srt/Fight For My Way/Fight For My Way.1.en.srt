1
00:00:03,831 --> 00:00:05,174
Next fight!

2
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:06,487
Muay Thai!

3
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:11,558
Fight!

4
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:28,399
Whoever made that noise, get up.

5
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:32,831
No one?

6
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:35,278
No one?

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,390
Thank you.

8
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:39,954
Look at your uniforms.
Are you old ladies going hiking?

9
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:42,799
Are you trying to show
all the colors of the rainbow?

10
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:45,769
Sir, it was just one word.

11
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:47,110
Please forgive us.

12
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,221
Is that so?

13
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,006
Dongman and Juman. Our Man Brothers.

14
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:54,053
Get this question right, and I won't hit.

15
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,885
Sir, don't make a deal with students.
Be generous.

16
00:00:58,085 --> 00:00:59,250
I agree.

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,241
Fine then, I'll just hit you. Come up.

18
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:05,140
Let's go. I'll challenge myself.

19
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,473
Listen carefully.

20
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:09,564
There's 20 percent chance
you'll know the question.

21
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:13,123
You have 40 percent chance
of getting it wrong.

22
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,622
What percent is the chance
of your butts staying safe?

23
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:17,967
Is that the question?

24
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:19,619
-Could you repeat that?
-Five.

25
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:22,128
-Four, three.
-I think 50 percent.

26
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:23,970
-Two...
-It's 50.

27
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,302
It's 50 percent.

28
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,826
It's 50? Give them a hand.

29
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,070
I'll give you two a reward. Come up.

30
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,771
We're coming for our reward.

31
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:41,830
Very happy.

32
00:01:42,405 --> 00:01:43,397
We're here.

33
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:45,453
-Great. Turn around.
-Pardon?

34
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:46,732
Both of you, turn around.

35
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:51,769
Since you were sure it was 50,
I'll hit you 50 times.

36
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:53,549
I thought we had one percent chance.

37
00:01:53,842 --> 00:01:55,262
One? Just turn around.

38
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:56,728
Does anyone know the answer?

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,229
Yes, Moobin.

40
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:04,577
It's 11 percent.

41
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:06,053
Correct.

42
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,974
-Jerk.
-He's chirping again.

43
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:15,360
Sir, hold on. Sir. That was my bone.

44
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,499
-I really got hit on the bone.
-Punks.

45
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:21,657
Pungwoon Girls' High School
in Seosan, 2006

46
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:23,309
Please, Ma'am. That hurts.

47
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:25,855
Episode 1

48
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:27,765
Are you going around to perform?

49
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:31,849
It's her dream to become an anchor.

50
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:33,689
Give me your headband.

51
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:35,925
Hurry up.

52
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:39,746
Can't you let it go just once?

53
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:43,077
No, ma'am.

54
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:46,847
When I become an anchor,
I'll look for you on a show...

55
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:48,724
-...where they search for people.
-Aera.

56
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:51,757
You have to study...

57
00:02:51,957 --> 00:02:54,084
...really well to become an anchor.

58
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:56,848
Ma'am, she's smart.

59
00:02:57,048 --> 00:02:58,574
She even placed 29th last time.

60
00:02:58,774 --> 00:03:00,154
So Miss 35th place.

61
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:02,144
Are you going to become
an anchor like Aera?

62
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:04,872
No, I'm going to be a good housewife.

63
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,573
Anyway, enough talking.

64
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:11,506
Clean the auditorium
if your items were confiscated.

65
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:13,171
No, not today.

66
00:03:32,273 --> 00:03:34,559
Move it before I snap your wrist.

67
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,670
-Gosh.
-What is this?

68
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:37,842
They're out of coffee milk.

69
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:39,980
Darn it.

70
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:41,150
Boram.

71
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:44,205
Here. I bought it in advance.

72
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:47,127
Don't do this anymore.
Your mom will scold me.

73
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,042
You'll come to tutor today, right?

74
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:51,918
I can't. I have to skip school for Gangnam.

75
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:53,297
Gangnam? Why?

76
00:03:53,497 --> 00:03:55,853
It's none of your business.

77
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:07,921
The convenience store lady is strange.

78
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,925
-Why does it...
-Does it taste like persimmons?

79
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:15,430
Are you a chef?
Do you have an absolute taste?

80
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,546
It smells like a burger.

81
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,236
That's why I told her
not to use the same microwave.

82
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:23,040
I already told her.

83
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,478
What is this?
Why are you wearing that today?

84
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,001
To match my outfit.

85
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:35,413
You have yet to become a city guy.

86
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,606
Can you at least act like
you're from Seoul?

87
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,280
Just look at me.

88
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:45,131
And the wolf-cut.

89
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,667
Are you going to confess in that?

90
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:48,901
Me?

91
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:52,057
-Who would I confess to?
-To Jang Boram.

92
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:53,211
What for?

93
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,639
You're our best fighter.
She rules the girls.

94
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:57,358
Won't you make an alliance?

95
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:58,874
An alliance?

96
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:00,883
What's that?

97
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:03,253
So anyway,

98
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:05,873
did she say she likes me?

99
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,908
Can't you tell by
the coffee-flavored milk?

100
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:10,239
Do you know how hard it is...

101
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:13,041
...to get coffee-flavored milk
in our school?

102
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:15,765
From Boram

103
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:19,788
But even I wouldn't want to get involved
with a guy in a ragged, red shirt.

104
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:32,136
Park Moses. No, what's your name?

105
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:34,042
-It's Moobin.
-Right, Park Moobin.

106
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:36,610
Sponsor the poor guy.

107
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,119
Lend him your expensive shirt.

108
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,014
Your classmate's entering
the National Sports Festival.

109
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:43,921
Can't you do that much for him?

110
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,613
He's going to Gangnam. You'll get it back...

111
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:48,021
...before evening study hall.

112
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:49,926
Gangnam?

113
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:52,179
That's where his Taekwondo match is.

114
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,103
He'll come first,

115
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:57,355
and take off his uniform,
and look good for the ceremony.

116
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:00,525
If he were to show those trademark,

117
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:01,820
plaid colors on his shoulders,

118
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:03,958
he'll look good like a kid from Seoul.

119
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,186
Look what he's offering.

120
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:13,200
That is a precious gift.

121
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,959
I can't ignore the importance
of a good ceremony.

122
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,679
It's the fate of a star fighter, you see.

123
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,987
Do you get what I mean?

124
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:28,718
What time's the match?

125
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:30,076
6 PM.

126
00:06:30,276 --> 00:06:32,686
Do you think we can catch the 3 PM train?

127
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:36,012
You bet we can.

128
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,507
We look perfect.

129
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:45,678
She's so sick.

130
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:50,361
Ma'am, I think we both have the flu.

131
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:52,992
We need to be isolated.

132
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,029
Can we go home?

133
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:02,852
Your lips are so pale, the both of you.

134
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:06,227
Sorry.

135
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:07,811
Let's go.

136
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,570
I think we have acute conjunctivitis.

137
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,110
I can smell the pain relief gel
from over here.

138
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,856
Don't put it around your eyes.
You could go blind.

139
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:31,089
I got hit by a shuttlecock during PE class.

140
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:34,030
It hurt as if I was hit by Hyun Junghwa.

141
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,978
Hyun Junghwa played table tennis.

142
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,167
You're trying way too hard.

143
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:49,612
We're doomed. Nothing worked.

144
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,755
Shall we try saying we broke an ankle?

145
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,294
Who touched my car this time?
It's new too.

146
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:17,032
I have a great idea.

147
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:18,220
Follow me.

148
00:08:25,594 --> 00:08:27,970
The plastic mic. Where is it?

149
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:32,132
Hey, what are you doing?

150
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:35,658
Put that down. Don't do it.

151
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:39,672
Where are you going?
You two! I saw everything!

152
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,539
Where do you think you're going?

153
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,353
Choi Aera, Baek Seolhui!

154
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:48,659
I'll see you tomorrow!

155
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,791
Sometimes it seems like
you only live for today.

156
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:53,087
You don't think there's a tomorrow?

157
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:57,305
No, I just didn't think!

158
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,434
Kukkiwon, Seoul, 2006

159
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:11,951
Do you know why men
fixate on hometown friends?

160
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:13,434
To drink together?

161
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:16,229
It's because country bumpkins
aren't intimidated.

162
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:19,874
We practically raised him since he was 6.

163
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:21,764
We have to support him.

164
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:24,029
-Ko Dongman.
-Ko Dongman.

165
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,999
-Ko Dongman.
-Ko Dongman.

166
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,145
Keep your distance. Good.

167
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,726
Separate. Separate.

168
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,390
-Fight.
-Dongman, use your feet.

169
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:40,588
Your feet!

170
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:44,243
You idiot. Go for it. Move in first!

171
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:47,129
Kick him!

172
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:49,560
Kick him!

173
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:51,471
Kick him!

174
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,733
Just kick him already.

175
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:55,083
What's she doing there?

176
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:58,214
-Kick him!
-The psycho mic girl's here again.

177
00:09:58,414 --> 00:09:59,566
-Do it!
-Kick him.

178
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,951
-Kick him!
-Go for it.

179
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:06,585
Ko Dong...

180
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:11,113
Seosan's Ongbak, Ko Dongman!

181
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:23,484
Round 1. One-time Ongbak
One-time Baik Jiyeon

182
00:10:23,684 --> 00:10:25,143
Watch out. Watch your left.

183
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:26,891
Get out of the way.

184
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,416
-Ko Dongman!
-You're doing good!

185
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:39,373
Keep them quiet.

186
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:41,839
Do you know how scary southern girls are?

187
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,729
What's wrong with them?

188
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,168
Boram.

189
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,978
What are you doing here?

190
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:52,088
Why did you give the milk
I gave you to Dongman?

191
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:54,993
What? Did you come here to ask me that?

192
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:56,091
Don't you have tutoring?

193
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:59,186
Do you like him by any chance?

194
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:06,325
-Ko Dongman!
-Ko Dongman!

195
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,499
From now on,

196
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:02,200
say you have a boyfriend.

197
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:04,141
Date me,

198
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:06,859
Jang Boram!

199
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,328
Hey, did you hear that?

200
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,087
-My goodness.
-Congratulations.

201
00:12:14,393 --> 00:12:15,989
We have an alliance now!

202
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,643
It's not that.

203
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:21,498
What did he just say?

204
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:24,315
Something about all and lance.

205
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:28,117
How dare you give away your uniform?
Come here.

206
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:30,620
-Can you let go of my ear?
-Come.

207
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,017
See you.

208
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:33,926
He was sent to Seoul to train...

209
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:36,013
...and look what he's getting up to.

210
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:38,077
Congratulations.

211
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:40,553
Did she snap her neck?

212
00:12:40,753 --> 00:12:42,290
Why can't she keep her head still?

213
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:48,583
Are you really going to date him?

214
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:50,900
Yes, I will. Why?

215
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,260
Tell my mom.

216
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,650
I really will.

217
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,349
He can't calculate probabilities...

218
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:58,688
...and always gets beaten up in class.

219
00:12:58,888 --> 00:13:01,268
He even wears a Red Devil t-shirt, so why?

220
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:03,372
He looks good. He's the best.

221
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:05,395
I only date the best.

222
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:15,374
Hey.

223
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:18,056
When did we drop this?

224
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:21,165
Sorry. My bad.

225
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:22,953
-Hold back.
-Hey!

226
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:26,365
I said sorry!

227
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:29,382
Did the legendary Knuckleheads
from back then...

228
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:31,160
...really become legends?

229
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,478
Sorry.

230
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,339
Sorry, excuse me.

231
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:36,999
Sorry.

232
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:40,429
Are they letting VIPs in first?

233
00:13:44,405 --> 00:13:47,097
The mic girl who
wanted to read the news...

234
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:50,500
...now mans an information desk.

235
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:53,963
Please enter in an orderly fashion
to avoid accidents.

236
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,570
Which suite, sir?

237
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:02,003
P, the penthouse.

238
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:07,607
The Taekwondo prodigy
who wanted to smash the world...

239
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,881
We got rid of all the ticks.

240
00:14:12,972 --> 00:14:16,285
I sprayed some phytoncide just to be sure.

241
00:14:17,611 --> 00:14:19,108
He crushes bugs now.

242
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:20,355
Doctor Mite, Ko Dongman

243
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,091
The pink princess
who wanted to be a good wife...

244
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:30,338
-Hello, have a nice day.
-Hello, have a nice day.

245
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:32,679
She is now in customer service.

246
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,836
Hello, this is Dream Home Shopping
where happiness...

247
00:14:41,628 --> 00:14:44,456
The snack-loving Juman became...

248
00:14:45,945 --> 00:14:47,820
Let's cut it by 50 won each for 2,000.

249
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,452
Can't you discount it by 50 won?

250
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:55,168
You can't cut it by 50 won each
for 2,000 fishcakes?

251
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,638
It's soft.

252
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,247
-He's a buyer for a home shopping channel.
-What?

253
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:01,156
-It's all natural.
-It is, right?

254
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,086
We are starting the real legend...

255
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:06,700
...of the Fantastic Four Knuckleheads.

256
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,890
Fantastic 4

257
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,913
Hello.

258
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:14,382
Hello.

259
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:16,862
How did it go?

260
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:20,103
Hello.

261
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:24,136
Why won't you pick up?

262
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:26,610
Hey.

263
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:28,894
Mooki! Pick up.

264
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:30,864
Did he fail again?

265
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,240
Hello.

266
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:39,142
Choi Aera?

267
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,477
Aera, it is you.

268
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,429
Yes. Should I go now?

269
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:51,624
It is you.

270
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:57,442
Who were you again?

271
00:15:57,654 --> 00:16:00,154
It's me. The second Kim Juha.

272
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,418
Don't you remember me?

273
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:02,856
How could I not?

274
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,569
Hold on.

275
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:07,689
Okay.

276
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:11,075
You've never come here,
since you started your job, right?

277
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:14,845
It's my first time too
thanks to my boyfriend's card.

278
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:20,466
Don't feel too intimidated by me.

279
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,102
Whatever.

280
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,878
Lucky Department Store, Designer bag

281
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:26,916
All done.

282
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:31,400
But seriously,
I can't believe we met like this.

283
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,255
It's so good to see you.

284
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:34,488
No way.

285
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:35,616
I'm getting married.

286
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:37,610
-Crud.
-He's a doctor.

287
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,987
I didn't ask.

288
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:41,231
We're getting married at Diamond Hall.

289
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:43,935
We're moving into Dogok Palace.
The ring is 2.5 carats.

290
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,470
Our honeymoon...

291
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:50,352
I thought you were rapping.

292
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,664
I was cheering the Korean soccer team,

293
00:16:52,864 --> 00:16:55,312
got carried away, and got on top of a car.

294
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:57,535
That was caught by the news,

295
00:16:57,735 --> 00:17:00,167
and my mom flipped out when she saw.

296
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,085
I was too loud, wasn't I? I'm sorry.

297
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:07,538
Also, when I was in the fifth grade,

298
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:09,950
I was in the same class
as Dujun from Beast.

299
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,226
Really?

300
00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:14,348
Seriously, back then, I was...

301
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:17,164
...a much better dancer
and much more popular...

302
00:17:17,364 --> 00:17:21,802
Can't you talk about
the present and not the past?

303
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:25,296
Kyungkoo said you were a specialist.

304
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:29,577
Yes. I dedicate my life
for the health of the people.

305
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:32,438
Then are you a doctor?

306
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:35,296
I help treat eczema.

307
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:38,069
Oh, my. Dermatologist?

308
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:39,987
Dermatology is all the rage now.

309
00:17:40,187 --> 00:17:41,202
Gosh.

310
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:43,815
That's it. That.

311
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,221
I got a new car

312
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:47,635
I'm on my way to you

313
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:49,148
Come out

314
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:53,208
You seem excited.

315
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:55,724
I'm a man with a car.
I'll give you a ride later.

316
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:57,169
No, it's fine.

317
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,794
When I sold bidets,
I took the subway everywhere.

318
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:04,474
I paid as much in rent
for my studio apartment.

319
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:06,197
A studio.

320
00:18:06,397 --> 00:18:09,209
When you pay rent
on a month-to-month basis,

321
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,701
don't you feel like you're being robbed?

322
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,914
I have an annual lease.

323
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:17,509
You do?

324
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:19,695
You must be rich.

325
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:23,231
Didn't you major in anything?

326
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:26,420
I heard you were famous
for some sport before.

327
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:27,518
What did you do?

328
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:33,893
Sport...

329
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,491
I didn't do sports. No.

330
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:40,328
I see.

331
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:45,371
Anyway,

332
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,838
did you give up on being
the second Baik Jiyeon?

333
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:52,186
You were going to be the second Kim Juha.

334
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:53,982
Why are you depending on
your guy's credit card?

335
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:56,609
What do you mean? It's love.

336
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:59,348
You should get married
before it's too late.

337
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:00,536
I have someone.

338
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:03,049
-Really?
-He's a prosecutor...

339
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:05,062
What?

340
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:06,634
In training.

341
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:09,087
It's hard supporting someone
still studying, isn't it?

342
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:19,945
Hey, why didn't you mention the age...

343
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:21,463
...of your boyfriend?

344
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,833
Does it start...

345
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,628
...with a three?

346
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:27,756
Four?

347
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,433
He looks very young for his age.

348
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:32,910
I see. He must really...

349
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:35,101
...look young.

350
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:36,184
Attack

351
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:39,937
You should get married soon.

352
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,905
You'll find someone soon...

353
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:44,966
...if you lower your standards
to at par with you.

354
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,704
Even shoes made of straw has a match.

355
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:49,251
Counterattack

356
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:51,260
-Straw?
-Yes.

357
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:56,711
Is he coming to your wedding?

358
00:19:56,911 --> 00:20:00,096
You know. That boy from Pungmul Band.

359
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:01,247
Strike

360
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,334
Why would he?

361
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:06,894
I bet you still think I came onto him.

362
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:08,993
But you know,

363
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:14,332
I care about guys' looks.

364
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:20,218
He was on the same level as you.

365
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:22,486
Hey. I'm prettier than you now.

366
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:31,075
Mom

367
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,037
Hello.

368
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:38,113
You must've been so upset.

369
00:20:38,313 --> 00:20:40,337
You're saying the blanket you received...

370
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:43,547
...smells like someone farted on it.

371
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:49,681
We sincerely apologize
for the inconvenience.

372
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,295
Oh my.

373
00:20:51,495 --> 00:20:53,807
It smells like a person farted on it!

374
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,430
I have a sensitive nose!
Come smell it yourself.

375
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,294
I'm terribly sorry, but I have rhinitis,

376
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:02,917
so I can't even smell my own fart.

377
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:05,707
So if you with the sensitive nose...

378
00:21:05,907 --> 00:21:07,776
What do you mean? What was that?

379
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:08,907
Okay.

380
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:13,359
I'll help you process the return.

381
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,534
Please confirm your information first.

382
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:21,356
Are you Park Jumsoon?

383
00:21:21,556 --> 00:21:23,012
No, that's my woman!

384
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:26,132
I see. Then what is your woman's number...

385
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:30,289
What? Your woman? How dare you!

386
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,598
I'm sorry.

387
00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:34,734
Hello, sir.

388
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:36,973
We apologize for the inconvenience.

389
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:38,008
I'm sorry.

390
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:51,582
Yejin.

391
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:54,408
Yes? Hello.

392
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:57,064
This is going to
the conference room, right?

393
00:21:58,138 --> 00:22:00,140
Yes. I'll be done soon.

394
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,629
I'll do it.

395
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:03,410
You will?

396
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:05,952
There are 100 sets.

397
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,541
-I need to make 100 sets.
-Sure.

398
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:10,960
I like doing these things.

399
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:13,388
Dream Home Shopping

400
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,318
It's 100.

401
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:18,018
Dream Home Shopping

402
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:21,223
I'm sorry.

403
00:22:22,164 --> 00:22:23,328
Don't you have a boyfriend?

404
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:26,235
-I do.
-You do?

405
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:28,318
Then just get married.

406
00:22:29,076 --> 00:22:32,091
The full-time workers
look down on us already.

407
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,135
You know people like you make it worse.

408
00:22:37,618 --> 00:22:39,133
We have a meeting here.

409
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,340
Hello, sir. I'm sorry. We're done.

410
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:46,011
Let's get it together.

411
00:22:48,394 --> 00:22:49,514
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:08,850
Hey.

413
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:12,209
Just for a minute. I need to recharge.

414
00:23:13,012 --> 00:23:15,846
What will I do with you?

415
00:23:17,335 --> 00:23:19,172
You came because of me, didn't you?

416
00:23:19,372 --> 00:23:21,087
Your meeting is two hours from now.

417
00:23:22,144 --> 00:23:24,496
What is it now? What did you do this time?

418
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,336
Stop getting stuff on you like this.

419
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:30,827
Sweetie. Should I really...

420
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,199
...just get married?

421
00:23:33,969 --> 00:23:36,109
-What?
-What do you think?

422
00:23:38,436 --> 00:23:39,702
Why are you doing that again?

423
00:23:41,368 --> 00:23:42,442
Are you on your period?

424
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:47,034
Seriously. I'm not trying to start a fight.

425
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:48,560
We've been dating for six years.

426
00:23:49,334 --> 00:23:50,252
Gosh.

427
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,440
Invitation

428
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:02,070
Choi Aera

429
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:13,282
Honey

430
00:24:20,824 --> 00:24:22,259
Why did you ignore all my texts?

431
00:24:23,656 --> 00:24:24,546
Did you...

432
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:26,901
...fail again?

433
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,640
I'm sorry.

434
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:34,874
Why can't you ever pass?

435
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:37,722
Where are you?

436
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:39,628
I'm eating alone.

437
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:42,404
But hey,

438
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:45,290
I'm thinking of traveling
across the country.

439
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,803
What? Traveling across the country?

440
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:54,390
Do you have time and
luxury to go around biking?

441
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,883
I'm going to bike around
and refresh my brain.

442
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,905
That's only if you passed.

443
00:25:01,105 --> 00:25:04,204
If you used your brain,
you would need to refresh it.

444
00:25:10,714 --> 00:25:12,956
I was going to treat him
to rib eye if he made it.

445
00:25:14,923 --> 00:25:17,536
How am I going to look
after him from now on?

446
00:25:22,858 --> 00:25:24,653
What should we have for lunch?

447
00:25:25,877 --> 00:25:28,718
There's this really
good clam noodle place nearby.

448
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:32,823
Sorry but I have to be somewhere.
I need to go.

449
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:34,180
You have to leave?

450
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:36,745
-I'll drive you then. Come here.
-It's okay.

451
00:25:36,945 --> 00:25:38,041
Taxi.

452
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,551
Taxi? Hold on. Wait, please!

453
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:45,431
Taxi? Can you give me a moment, sir?

454
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,644
Can I have your number?

455
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,309
-I'll give it to Kyungkoo.
-Okay, ma'am.

456
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:54,248
I got coffee so why don't you
pay for soju on Friday?

457
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,280
There's a place in Sillim-dong
known for gizzards.

458
00:25:57,379 --> 00:26:00,323
They give you three dishes
for 9,900 won. Now...

459
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:03,992
Hey, let's just say I paid
for the tea today.

460
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:05,675
-Sorry?
-So I don't need...

461
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:09,472
...to buy soju this Friday, right?

462
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,560
We can go.

463
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:30,133
Error. Da Aera

464
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:31,491
What is it?

465
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:35,281
What? Hey, why do I have to go...

466
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:37,496
...all the way there for you to eat?

467
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:40,334
No, I'm not coming. What? Ribeye?

468
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:42,410
Ribeye, you say?

469
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:57,467
She wanted to have lunch.
Why isn't she answering?

470
00:26:58,698 --> 00:27:01,140
You should get a hair transplant
before the wedding.

471
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,162
You need to look as young as you can.

472
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:04,889
I keep changing for the better.

473
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,027
I even got my facial bones carved for you.

474
00:27:07,482 --> 00:27:10,884
And you can't even get
a hair transplant? Fine, bye.

475
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:16,974
What, why is this being annoying too?

476
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:18,944
What's going on?

477
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,601
Wait. I'll try to fix it.

478
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:30,922
Doctor Ko Dongman

479
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:46,715
Are you all right?

480
00:27:47,898 --> 00:27:50,241
-You must be a doctor.
-Sorry?

481
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,364
You have thick hair too.

482
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,078
Yes.

483
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:10,790
We're sorry. We're very sorry.

484
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,385
Why did you come so late?
My lunch is almost over.

485
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:16,758
Hey, I came on time.
You weren't at your desk.

486
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:19,931
Hey, Park Chansook.

487
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:23,320
Why are you so red?

488
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:25,638
I'm not red.

489
00:28:26,224 --> 00:28:28,235
By the way, do you know him?

490
00:28:28,326 --> 00:28:30,208
You should introduce me to him.

491
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:34,828
Why? Hey, Dongman.

492
00:28:35,186 --> 00:28:38,426
-This is my friend...
-I'm Chansook, Dongman.

493
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:46,085
Sure.

494
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:49,361
Do you want him to
kiss your hand or something?

495
00:28:52,114 --> 00:28:53,970
-I'm Ko Dongman.
-I see.

496
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,920
-And he...
-He's not your boyfriend.

497
00:28:58,011 --> 00:29:00,979
-He's not, right?
-I'm not. Impossible.

498
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:04,109
So you're friends? Just friends?

499
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:08,955
Kind of.

500
00:29:09,964 --> 00:29:12,147
-"Kind of?"
-Yes.

501
00:29:12,821 --> 00:29:14,646
We're kind of friends.

502
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,371
If he's not your boyfriend
or just a friend, what is he?

503
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:23,413
To tell you the truth...

504
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:30,431
What nonsense is she saying now?

505
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:34,452
He likes me.

506
00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:36,917
Stop lying.

507
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:38,630
And you won't go out with him?

508
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,539
He's handsome and also a doctor.

509
00:29:40,964 --> 00:29:43,711
-Doctor?
-I saw his white coat.

510
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:48,451
That white coat?

511
00:29:48,832 --> 00:29:50,644
And you won't go out with him?

512
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:53,640
Let me remind you.
I care about their looks.

513
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,372
His face is enough...

514
00:29:55,572 --> 00:29:58,847
I guess he's just okay-looking.

515
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,095
That doesn't make any sense.

516
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:02,712
Then is your unemployed boyfriend...

517
00:30:02,912 --> 00:30:05,540
He's the best. He'll drive you nuts.

518
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:10,181
When I look at him,
all my fatigue goes away.

519
00:30:11,014 --> 00:30:14,442
When it comes to men, looks matter the most.

520
00:30:22,577 --> 00:30:24,297
It's been so long since I had beef.

521
00:30:24,465 --> 00:30:25,650
Meat, meat.

522
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,731
Hey, let's switch seats.

523
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:39,431
Why?

524
00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:43,268
The sun's too bright. Just switch seats.

525
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:44,317
Hurry up.

526
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:46,772
Just sit anywhere. You're so picky.

527
00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:48,513
Hurry.

528
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:54,961
It's not even that bright.

529
00:30:58,845 --> 00:31:01,119
Hey, can you pat my head?

530
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,194
What did you say?

531
00:31:02,322 --> 00:31:04,852
Pat my bangs.

532
00:31:05,052 --> 00:31:07,753
When you watch dramas,
the guy pats the girl's head.

533
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:08,969
Do that for me.

534
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,417
No. I don't want to touch you.

535
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:16,140
If you want the ribeye, do it.

536
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,322
My goodness. You're so dirty and unfair.

537
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:40,659
Did you not wash your hair?

538
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:42,852
Why are you...

539
00:31:43,592 --> 00:31:47,542
...making me touch your hair?

540
00:31:48,518 --> 00:31:49,845
This is crazy.

541
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,679
I told you to pat my head,
not grab my hair.

542
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:16,420
Hey.

543
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:19,693
Are you around 185 cm tall?

544
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,135
185.6 cm.

545
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:25,555
Would you like to order?

546
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,716
Can we have three servings of ribeye...

547
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,759
Oh, did your boyfriend pass the bar exam?

548
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:33,533
Can we have beer and soju as well?

549
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:36,242
-He failed.
-Okay.

550
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:41,803
I'm going to rejuvenate myself
and work forever.

551
00:32:42,155 --> 00:32:45,497
If he doesn't pass the exam,
I'll have to retire there.

552
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:48,484
Gosh, he's such a punk.

553
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:52,357
-What?
-Why isn't he paying back your deposit?

554
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,052
Well, he will.

555
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:57,580
Sure, he will.

556
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,861
His girlfriend has
varicose veins at her age...

557
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:03,380
...and stands all day at work
to support him financially.

558
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,938
He must have lost his mind.

559
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,653
Hey, watch what you say.

560
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:11,614
If he's a good guy,
he would do physical labor.

561
00:33:11,705 --> 00:33:13,523
I won't let him do that.

562
00:33:13,732 --> 00:33:16,586
Oh, dear. What a virtuous woman.

563
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,833
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
Have a great lunch.

564
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:23,680
Hey.

565
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:26,398
Leave. I'm not treating you to lunch!

566
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:32,263
Can we have the ribeye now?

567
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:39,867
Don't stare at it so much.
Are you going to buy it?

568
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:43,949
How much is the discount?

569
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:47,551
Hey, it's already at 50 percent.
I can't go lower.

570
00:33:50,165 --> 00:33:51,488
Eight gears, too.

571
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,225
Bus 171 will be arriving soon.

572
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:10,264
A-E-I-O-U.

573
00:34:10,618 --> 00:34:11,554
Apply now!

574
00:34:11,697 --> 00:34:13,233
Join KBC with your creative self.

575
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,625
A-E-I-O-U.

576
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:42,482
Wait.

577
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,979
You should take a taxi.

578
00:35:11,424 --> 00:35:13,129
The number you're calling...

579
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,130
...is currently not available.
Please leave a message...

580
00:35:16,345 --> 00:35:18,455
Why isn't he picking up?

581
00:35:21,348 --> 00:35:23,062
Hello.

582
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:24,482
Room 208?

583
00:35:25,395 --> 00:35:26,974
Room 208?

584
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:30,800
What was that?

585
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:40,241
Hey, radish. Radish!

586
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:42,077
-Radish. Hey.
-What is it?

587
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:45,494
Put it away. Room 208 is here.

588
00:35:45,694 --> 00:35:47,759
-She's back.
-Hurry up.

589
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,597
Put the radish away first.

590
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:51,429
-Put it in.
-Clean it up.

591
00:35:51,629 --> 00:35:52,608
Get Mooki.

592
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:54,897
Get Mooki. Hurry up and clean!

593
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,283
Mooki.

594
00:35:56,483 --> 00:35:59,992
Gyeryong Residence

595
00:36:08,493 --> 00:36:10,918
Are you here? What brings you here?

596
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:13,572
Why won't you pick up your phone?

597
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,941
I was sleeping.

598
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:18,494
How can you sleep?

599
00:36:18,757 --> 00:36:19,885
You can still sleep?

600
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:25,602
Don't just stand there. Take this.

601
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:28,895
Right. What is the bike for?

602
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,467
I thought you were
going to tour the country.

603
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:34,733
Don't tell me you'll ride
the broken bike you have.

604
00:36:35,168 --> 00:36:37,547
-Don't make me a widow.
-Right.

605
00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:41,937
Gosh. You didn't have to buy me one.

606
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,678
It's only an eight-speed.

607
00:36:48,888 --> 00:36:50,698
Gosh. Okay.

608
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,449
Why are your pants inside out?

609
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:03,036
The tag is hanging out.

610
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:16,237
You need to come to your senses, okay?

611
00:37:16,914 --> 00:37:17,881
Okay.

612
00:37:26,107 --> 00:37:28,243
Hey, it's the lady from
the radish barley rice place.

613
00:37:28,803 --> 00:37:31,270
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

614
00:37:32,361 --> 00:37:33,803
Do you deliver these days?

615
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:37,027
Yes. I'm just trying to make a living.

616
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:40,594
Did you bring the whole container for them?

617
00:37:40,794 --> 00:37:42,979
You won't make a profit
if you give away so much.

618
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:44,543
How's business?

619
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:47,257
Your radish kimchi is the best.

620
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:49,969
-Can I have one?
-No.

621
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,267
You'll ruin your clothes.
Don't use your hand.

622
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:53,322
Here.

623
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:57,344
Do you have hand tremor?

624
00:37:57,873 --> 00:37:59,579
Maybe it's because I quit smoking.

625
00:38:08,408 --> 00:38:09,687
That rat...

626
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:15,474
The rat hair tie with
a missing ear is mine.

627
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:19,205
I'm sure it's mine.

628
00:38:32,752 --> 00:38:36,107
Why does it look like Mooki's pants...

629
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:39,252
...and your top look like one outfit?

630
00:38:49,218 --> 00:38:50,305
Menthol.

631
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:52,906
This smells like Mooki's cigarettes.

632
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,001
-Did you dodge? Come here.
-Wait.

633
00:39:14,305 --> 00:39:15,812
-Come here.
-No, I...

634
00:39:15,907 --> 00:39:17,451
-I'm sorry.
-You.

635
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:20,156
-Come here.
-No, please.

636
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:22,031
-Don't go in.
-Run.

637
00:39:22,295 --> 00:39:24,822
-Hey!
-Stop it.

638
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:26,137
You jerk.

639
00:39:26,337 --> 00:39:28,139
Help me.

640
00:39:29,174 --> 00:39:32,971
Gyeryong Residence

641
00:39:39,052 --> 00:39:40,250
Mooki.

642
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:43,973
You gave me this bag last year...

643
00:39:44,064 --> 00:39:45,672
...and said we should get married
after you pass the bar.

644
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:48,927
Yes.

645
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,884
But...

646
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:52,979
I keep...

647
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:55,447
...failing it.

648
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,552
This bag...

649
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,112
...was the very first brand bag I got.

650
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:06,648
I yelled at you for buying it...

651
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,519
...and scolded you for wasting money then.

652
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:14,577
But it was really a brand name bag.

653
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:19,347
Thinking about you saving
pocket money to buy it...

654
00:40:25,783 --> 00:40:27,766
...made my heart ache.

655
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,591
I felt so thankful and I trusted you.

656
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,742
I'm sorry.

657
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:36,260
I'm sorry, Aera.

658
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,177
I already knew you didn't have the brains.

659
00:40:40,848 --> 00:40:42,197
If you failed again this time,

660
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:45,361
I was going to tell you to give up first.

661
00:40:46,162 --> 00:40:47,661
If you were to fail again,

662
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:50,777
I was going to just take care of you.

663
00:40:51,459 --> 00:40:53,031
-Hey.
-What?

664
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:54,888
Go on your knees at least.

665
00:41:04,689 --> 00:41:07,377
Do you know how much
I make at the information desk?

666
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:12,494
Since I paid for your deposit
and gave you an allowance,

667
00:41:12,585 --> 00:41:13,976
did you think I was paid millions?

668
00:41:16,565 --> 00:41:19,620
Do you think I don't have a dream?

669
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:23,696
Do you think that's why I supported you?

670
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,623
I'm really sorry.

671
00:41:26,903 --> 00:41:29,276
How can you be so foolish?

672
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:32,045
If it was someone younger...

673
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:35,725
...or someone really rich, I wouldn't mind.

674
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:37,965
But how...

675
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:40,046
She's just...

676
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:43,635
She's just a small restaurant owner.

677
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:49,594
Actually, it's not small.

678
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,233
Radish Kimchi and Barley Rice

679
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,773
The line is so long here.

680
00:41:57,992 --> 00:41:59,131
Like I said,

681
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:03,660
it's not that small.

682
00:42:05,096 --> 00:42:07,294
She wasn't a cook at a small restaurant.

683
00:42:07,385 --> 00:42:09,748
She had customers lining up
due to a television show.

684
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,140
She's the queen of radish kimchi.

685
00:42:13,014 --> 00:42:16,513
He wasn't foolish at all.

686
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,705
Traveling across Korea

687
00:42:23,562 --> 00:42:25,792
-Are you all packed up?
-Yes.

688
00:42:26,198 --> 00:42:27,974
-Are you leaving now?
-Yes.

689
00:42:31,276 --> 00:42:33,720
I already booked all the accommodations.

690
00:42:34,483 --> 00:42:36,283
So I have to go.

691
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:41,190
The bike was enough.

692
00:42:41,281 --> 00:42:43,114
You didn't have to lend me the car.

693
00:42:43,314 --> 00:42:45,688
It's okay. The car isn't important.

694
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:47,074
You're more important.

695
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:48,312
That bike...

696
00:42:49,058 --> 00:42:50,955
...must go up to 18-speed.

697
00:42:51,422 --> 00:42:53,724
-Right?
-It's 28-speed.

698
00:42:55,395 --> 00:42:56,512
Hey.

699
00:42:58,554 --> 00:43:01,490
I've been wanting to
give this to you for a while.

700
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:06,656
This is the deposit for Mooki's room.

701
00:43:06,768 --> 00:43:08,348
I added 300 dollars.

702
00:43:08,951 --> 00:43:10,836
Is that my compensation?

703
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:13,973
Just take it.

704
00:43:14,407 --> 00:43:15,650
Take it.

705
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:17,933
Yes. You should take it.

706
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,994
Hey.

707
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:25,429
Do you want a ride?

708
00:43:27,562 --> 00:43:29,750
You have to take that bike. It was heavy.

709
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:31,649
Yes, take the car. Go.

710
00:43:31,746 --> 00:43:32,678
Get on.

711
00:43:32,782 --> 00:43:35,066
-What?
-Hey, wait.

712
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,595
What's wrong?

713
00:43:40,977 --> 00:43:42,678
This is mine.

714
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,376
-What? Just say so.
-I know.

715
00:43:54,636 --> 00:43:55,604
Taxi!

716
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,091
Gosh. Why isn't it working?

717
00:44:08,298 --> 00:44:10,258
Gosh. No.

718
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,163
It doesn't fit.

719
00:44:13,428 --> 00:44:15,424
It doesn't fit, okay?

720
00:44:15,642 --> 00:44:17,583
Just call a truck.

721
00:44:17,695 --> 00:44:20,216
Or you can ride the bike home.

722
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,162
I don't know how to ride a bike.

723
00:44:44,554 --> 00:44:45,593
Okay.

724
00:44:46,966 --> 00:44:49,145
I asked for sausage, not liver.

725
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:51,637
You can't stay fit if
you eat carbs at this time.

726
00:44:51,837 --> 00:44:52,976
You should eat protein.

727
00:44:53,176 --> 00:44:55,791
That isn't protein. It's cheap fat.

728
00:44:57,747 --> 00:44:58,856
What was that, punk?

729
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:02,178
Once a coach, forever a coach.

730
00:45:02,506 --> 00:45:04,895
Once a martial artist,
always a martial artist.

731
00:45:05,095 --> 00:45:07,739
A competitor must
remain in competition form...

732
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,819
...if you want to make a comeback.

733
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:12,998
-Who said I'd make a comeback?
-Did I say anything?

734
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:17,239
Let me come out and ask you.

735
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:19,765
-Why do you keep coming here?
-To sell sausages.

736
00:45:21,341 --> 00:45:25,669
You know you stand no chance against them.

737
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:29,058
It's David and Goliath's fight.

738
00:45:29,631 --> 00:45:31,756
I'm the coach that trained...

739
00:45:31,847 --> 00:45:35,933
...a 185.6 cm tall, 64 kg slim-fit David.

740
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:39,716
If you're still trying
to get me to go back, give up.

741
00:45:40,133 --> 00:45:41,593
I'm never doing Taekwondo again.

742
00:45:42,025 --> 00:45:44,763
I'll be 30 soon.
I can't make the national team.

743
00:45:44,854 --> 00:45:45,982
Who said anything about Taekwondo?

744
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:49,056
Choo Sunghoon was born in 1975.

745
00:45:49,256 --> 00:45:51,313
In the fighting world, you're still young.

746
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:54,840
Will you waste your legs?
Aren't you itching to kick?

747
00:45:55,016 --> 00:45:57,055
You were first in Korea
with your roundhouse kick.

748
00:45:57,146 --> 00:45:59,746
Doesn't it kill you to see men
worse than you up there?

749
00:45:59,837 --> 00:46:01,963
I won't do any sport ever again.

750
00:46:03,823 --> 00:46:07,117
That number one roundhouse kick
died November 3, 2007.

751
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:08,838
So leave me alone. Let me live.

752
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:11,529
You still can't forget?

753
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:14,281
Forget already.

754
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:18,471
I won't do sports ever again.
It never made me happy.

755
00:46:18,671 --> 00:46:21,572
It was always humiliating and too intense.

756
00:46:22,377 --> 00:46:24,677
I'll never do it again. Never!

757
00:46:24,877 --> 00:46:25,877
So?

758
00:46:26,725 --> 00:46:28,268
Are you happy now?

759
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:30,882
Are you doing anything intensely?

760
00:46:38,645 --> 00:46:39,574
Go.

761
00:46:40,997 --> 00:46:42,100
Bye.

762
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,390
Is she sleeping?

763
00:46:58,272 --> 00:46:59,945
Leave her.

764
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:05,227
I'm so humiliated that I feel faint.

765
00:47:05,427 --> 00:47:07,636
The boy band BSS held a concert last night,

766
00:47:07,815 --> 00:47:12,486
drawing a crowd of tens of thousands.

767
00:47:12,686 --> 00:47:13,855
Why am I...

768
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:18,890
...so pathetic even with my breakup?

769
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:23,259
We have sad news.

770
00:47:23,502 --> 00:47:25,676
Park Hyeran,
who had retired when she got married,

771
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:30,069
announced that her marriage
is over after three years.

772
00:47:30,237 --> 00:47:32,925
She's the one who
married into a rich family.

773
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:34,960
-In 2013...
-You're right.

774
00:47:36,373 --> 00:47:37,765
Wow. I wonder what happened.

775
00:47:55,843 --> 00:47:56,827
What's that?

776
00:47:57,633 --> 00:47:58,752
-What was that?
-What?

777
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,623
-What's wrong?
-Stop it.

778
00:48:00,998 --> 00:48:03,918
-Why are you...
-There's a person!

779
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:11,209
Are you okay? Oh, no.

780
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,649
Are you okay?

781
00:48:15,278 --> 00:48:16,293
-There's a person.
-What?

782
00:48:16,384 --> 00:48:17,741
There's a person.

783
00:48:22,234 --> 00:48:24,814
Sir! Are you okay?

784
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:26,400
Didn't you see the red light?

785
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,749
Seriously!

786
00:48:28,685 --> 00:48:30,346
Are you here to see Aera?

787
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,458
Did you get a new car?

788
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,022
With what money?

789
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,926
Do you know him?

790
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:40,127
Well...

791
00:48:40,532 --> 00:48:42,538
Are you okay? Did I hit you hard?

792
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:45,040
I'm fine. You didn't hit me.

793
00:48:45,819 --> 00:48:47,995
-Go on...
-Stay down. Call your insurance company.

794
00:48:48,544 --> 00:48:49,526
You were with him?

795
00:48:50,903 --> 00:48:52,682
We're like family. There's no need...

796
00:48:52,773 --> 00:48:54,408
Drop the gibberish.

797
00:48:55,152 --> 00:48:57,344
Call the police and the insurance company.

798
00:48:57,853 --> 00:48:59,821
Get admitted to the hospital
while you're at it.

799
00:49:03,734 --> 00:49:04,748
Did you two fight?

800
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,273
-You see...
-Sir.

801
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:09,922
Who is this person? Is she your aunt?

802
00:49:10,122 --> 00:49:12,582
-I'm not her aunt.
-She's his baby's mom.

803
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,284
That scumbag's...

804
00:49:17,751 --> 00:49:18,749
...baby's mother.

805
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:21,201
What are you talking about?

806
00:49:22,381 --> 00:49:24,246
She's Mooki's mom?

807
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:25,471
Hello, ma'am.

808
00:49:25,678 --> 00:49:27,463
What a place to meet.

809
00:49:28,473 --> 00:49:30,164
In this old lady's belly...

810
00:49:33,164 --> 00:49:34,667
...is that jerk's baby.

811
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:38,866
He used the money I gave him...

812
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:44,893
...to eat in this old lady's restaurant.

813
00:49:49,178 --> 00:49:50,636
Eating radishes...

814
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,904
...and meals...

815
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:57,907
Radishes...

816
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,217
Speak coherently!

817
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:06,534
They have a baby together.

818
00:50:11,847 --> 00:50:13,528
-Sir. Please be rational.
-Hey.

819
00:50:13,728 --> 00:50:15,010
-That's not completely...
-Please.

820
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,926
You shameless, little sleazebag!

821
00:50:21,202 --> 00:50:23,589
Hey! Let go!

822
00:50:24,282 --> 00:50:25,724
-What are you doing?
-Let go of Mooki!

823
00:50:25,924 --> 00:50:27,234
Let go of Mooki!

824
00:50:27,811 --> 00:50:31,641
If you touch him, I'll kill you!
Don't mess with me!

825
00:50:31,736 --> 00:50:33,411
You should let go.

826
00:50:33,553 --> 00:50:35,665
-Let go!
-Hold on.

827
00:50:38,987 --> 00:50:41,103
Did I get hurt here? Look.

828
00:50:47,046 --> 00:50:49,490
Check your teeth to see if they're loose.

829
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:52,184
They're fine.

830
00:50:52,734 --> 00:50:54,959
Did that lady play sports or something?

831
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:56,913
She was super strong.

832
00:50:57,706 --> 00:50:59,366
She made a million dollars...

833
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:01,663
...making radish kimchi with those arms.

834
00:51:02,594 --> 00:51:05,103
Why did you have to attack him?

835
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,725
Idiot. Did you really do Tekwondo?

836
00:51:09,157 --> 00:51:12,469
Should I have done
a turning kick on a pregnant woman?

837
00:51:14,399 --> 00:51:15,950
But seriously.

838
00:51:16,379 --> 00:51:19,077
You even get dumped by students?

839
00:51:20,335 --> 00:51:21,832
Tell everyone...

840
00:51:22,982 --> 00:51:24,062
I dumped him.

841
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:28,743
What's wrong with you?
You're so frustrating.

842
00:51:29,647 --> 00:51:32,933
-Worry about yourself.
-I'm fine.

843
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,831
Hey.

844
00:51:36,512 --> 00:51:38,451
-What?
-Park Hyeran.

845
00:51:40,884 --> 00:51:41,933
She got a divorce.

846
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:51,274
Get your act together, okay?

847
00:51:51,836 --> 00:51:52,954
I'll be watching.

848
00:52:18,873 --> 00:52:20,750
This day really stinks.

849
00:52:22,154 --> 00:52:25,007
I told you to stop buying fakes!

850
00:52:25,207 --> 00:52:28,375
There are so many good quality,
affordable items.

851
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,678
Darn it.

852
00:52:39,344 --> 00:52:40,463
Darn it.

853
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,837
Is this something to cry about?

854
00:52:42,956 --> 00:52:45,068
Why are you kicking my shoe?

855
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,622
Darn it.

856
00:52:51,879 --> 00:52:53,785
She has a brother?

857
00:52:53,985 --> 00:52:55,402
No, he isn't her brother.

858
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,503
-Then who is he?
-A 20-year boyfriend.

859
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:01,881
I mean, a guy friend.

860
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:04,396
He lives across the street from her.

861
00:53:04,596 --> 00:53:06,827
She's more cunning than she looks.

862
00:53:06,918 --> 00:53:09,417
What, a guy friend?

863
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,908
I gave her an extra
300,000 won for nothing.

864
00:53:16,825 --> 00:53:18,478
Anyway, Mooki.

865
00:53:19,452 --> 00:53:22,732
Did you buy her designer goods?

866
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,437
I have no money.

867
00:53:28,924 --> 00:53:30,166
They're fake.

868
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,550
You're so frugal.

869
00:53:48,218 --> 00:53:51,238
Darn it. It got scratched up.

870
00:53:54,384 --> 00:53:55,807
Throw it away.

871
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,804
Why are you holding onto
something from that jerk?

872
00:53:59,595 --> 00:54:00,916
This one is real.

873
00:54:01,295 --> 00:54:02,239
What?

874
00:54:02,484 --> 00:54:04,110
This is authentic.

875
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,961
I'll get it fixed tomorrow.

876
00:54:10,161 --> 00:54:12,998
So you'll keep carrying
something that rat gave you?

877
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:15,653
I'll fix it and sell it.

878
00:54:16,278 --> 00:54:18,198
I'll sell it and drink with you.

879
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:20,559
Darn it.

880
00:54:21,431 --> 00:54:24,638
Are you an idiot or just stupid?

881
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:30,851
Hey. Come with me.

882
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:34,847
Where are you going?

883
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:45,718
Choose.

884
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:50,205
Are you going to buy me a handbag?

885
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,840
Just choose.

886
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,542
Take this. This one's the prettiest.

887
00:55:05,025 --> 00:55:07,591
It's quite new. It's 22 dollars.

888
00:55:09,394 --> 00:55:11,890
It's the most expensive
new handbag out there.

889
00:55:12,238 --> 00:55:14,369
This is much more durable than yours.

890
00:55:14,741 --> 00:55:16,359
You should hit people
with this from now on.

891
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:19,166
And when you have to hit Mooki,

892
00:55:19,467 --> 00:55:21,395
put a stone inside and smack it at him.

893
00:55:21,724 --> 00:55:24,587
This won't break.

894
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:29,336
Hey, Dongman.

895
00:55:29,687 --> 00:55:30,630
What?

896
00:55:32,006 --> 00:55:35,242
I'll carry this bag until the day I die.

897
00:55:36,946 --> 00:55:37,963
Here.

898
00:55:41,066 --> 00:55:43,342
You don't have to carry it
until the day you die.

899
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:47,080
Choose a pair of shoes too.

900
00:55:51,246 --> 00:55:52,819
Do you take credit card, sir?

901
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:12,031
Ko Dongman. You have a good eye.

902
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:23,160
Are they comfortable?

903
00:56:23,326 --> 00:56:24,896
Yes, they're so comfortable.

904
00:56:25,698 --> 00:56:27,155
This bag is really nice too.

905
00:56:27,534 --> 00:56:29,056
-It's sturdy, right?
-Yes.

906
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:32,204
I can fit five or
six soju bottles in here.

907
00:56:32,295 --> 00:56:34,271
Hey, it's not for alcohol.

908
00:56:34,362 --> 00:56:36,729
That's not why I got it for you.

909
00:56:38,727 --> 00:56:42,794
Dongman, I didn't know you
buy handbags for women.

910
00:56:45,246 --> 00:56:46,683
You're so lame.

911
00:56:46,802 --> 00:56:49,302
Why do you giggle like that?

912
00:56:50,771 --> 00:56:51,765
Yes, this.

913
00:56:52,348 --> 00:56:55,880
This is it. This is what I wanted earlier.

914
00:56:56,968 --> 00:56:59,712
-This?
-Yes, this.

915
00:57:00,115 --> 00:57:02,443
This makes your heart flutter.

916
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:07,676
Hey.

917
00:57:10,206 --> 00:57:11,467
Did this make your heart flutter?

918
00:57:13,415 --> 00:57:14,363
What?

919
00:57:14,928 --> 00:57:17,472
Why would my heart flutter over you?

920
00:57:19,967 --> 00:57:23,117
Then why is your face so red?

921
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,546
It's like you were just welding something.

922
00:57:28,858 --> 00:57:31,833
I don't know. Why am I red?

923
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:37,556
You...

924
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:39,239
What?

925
00:57:43,278 --> 00:57:44,858
You need to quit drinking.

926
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,222
Right?

927
00:57:50,949 --> 00:57:52,252
I should quit, right?

928
00:57:54,825 --> 00:57:56,436
Is it the alcohol?

929
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,330
At the National Sports Festival...

930
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:17,114
...which was held in Gangnam yesterday,

931
00:58:17,314 --> 00:58:20,311
something more interesting
than the matches took place.

932
00:58:20,511 --> 00:58:22,305
We'll end the sports news...

933
00:58:22,505 --> 00:58:23,859
...with our last video of the day.

934
00:58:24,144 --> 00:58:25,122
Hey!

935
00:58:25,322 --> 00:58:27,122
Boram, nobody can stop her.

936
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:30,251
You should just, you should let go.

937
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,515
Let go. Stop it, Aera!

938
00:58:32,606 --> 00:58:33,715
-Hey!
-Hey.

939
00:58:34,775 --> 00:58:38,899
Hey. How could you scratch her?

940
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,091
Using your finger nails is cheating.

941
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,684
Hey, Dongman.

942
00:58:42,884 --> 00:58:45,393
Let me see. My gosh.

943
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:48,326
Why would you start up a fight
when you can't even win?

944
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:49,419
We have to go see a doctor.

945
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:50,710
Move over.

946
00:58:51,474 --> 00:58:52,341
Hey.

947
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:54,654
Did you see that?

948
00:58:55,512 --> 00:58:57,715
Fight For My Way

949
00:58:58,305 --> 00:58:59,369
Didn't you serve in the military?

950
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:02,243
You don't want to?
Quit. I won't stop you.

951
00:59:02,523 --> 00:59:04,769
How have you been, Aera?

952
00:59:04,969 --> 00:59:06,518
I heard you work at an information desk.

953
00:59:06,718 --> 00:59:08,823
It's fun. I like
to talk in the microphone...

954
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:10,857
...and I make announcements sometimes.

955
00:59:11,057 --> 00:59:12,595
Aera, please save me.

956
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,835
Please show us how carefree you are.

957
00:59:16,126 --> 00:59:17,006
Who is she?

958
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:19,106
Should we make
a one million won bet on her today?

959
00:59:19,352 --> 00:59:21,423
Don't take the bus back home later.

960
00:59:21,636 --> 00:59:22,514
What's going on?

961
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:23,821
Can you come pick me up?

962
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:25,014
Say that again.

963
00:59:25,275 --> 00:59:28,185
I can't go by myself, so come.
