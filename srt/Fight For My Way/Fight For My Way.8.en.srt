1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,940
I told you to stay out of it.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,060
I said you'll get into a trouble!

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,520
Episode 8

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,580
Would I get involved if
you did things right?

5
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:12,963
It is because you always cry,

6
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:14,560
and step on a turd...

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,657
You make my heart flutter!

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,180
What?

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,020
My heart flutters

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,380
every time you do that.

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,800
That is why.

12
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,949
My heart flutters.

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,220
Something is wrong with me.

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,360
That's why you better watch out.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,460
You know I'm not cool nor sophisticated.

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,670
I am like a dog.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,840
Once I bite, I don't let go.
I will go all the way.

18
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:04,140
Bite what?

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,320
I am just about to take that bite.

20
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,552
You better keep your best guard up.

21
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,040
I might even shoot a
nuclear weapon at you.

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,659
That's why we should both be careful.

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,900
Wear them when you are driving.

24
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,340
Go.

25
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:53,797
Go...

26
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,120
Get on already.

27
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,280
Hey.

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,660
That's uncomfortable.
Why are you doing that?

29
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:13,183
It is so that you can focus on driving.

30
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,660
You are worried for nothing.

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,150
Shut up.

32
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:19,789
One's back nerves,

33
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:23,894
can't detect something so small.

34
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,166
Let's go.

35
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,220
Hold tight.

36
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,980
Seolhui, I'm really sorry.

37
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:54,024
But it was really quick.
It was even quicker this.

38
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,940
Why are you reenacting it?

39
00:02:57,494 --> 00:03:00,564
I was surprised since she attacked me.

40
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,902
It's not like I can slap a
woman or sue her either.

41
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,003
So?

42
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,000
How was it?

43
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,200
What?

44
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,080
It wasn't bad, right?

45
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,610
It was just...

46
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,810
I felt like a slug was stuck on my lips.

47
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:21,318
You are so original and detailed.

48
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,960
What? A slug?

49
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,340
That is not what I meant.

50
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,220
Are you trying to say,

51
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,480
that you weren't excited
at all when she kissed?

52
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,990
No way. It is not like that.

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,120
Then, I will handle that slug.

54
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,500
What do you plan on doing?

55
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:44,941
Seolhui.

56
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:55,986
My heart flutters,

57
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,888
every time you do that.

58
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,391
That is why.

59
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,580
Hey. If you don't have anything

60
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,772
the day after tomorrow...

61
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,060
What? Did you want to do something?

62
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:23,146
Do you want to come watch my match?

63
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,120
It is at 4 PM at Dongchook Gymnasium.

64
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,319
Are you fighting again?

65
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:32,255
You were beaten to a pulp and you still...

66
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,740
Just be like your normal self. I am fine.

67
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,100
Wow, there are a lot of stars tonight.

68
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:52,750
Where?

69
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,660
There. Is that the big digger?

70
00:04:58,014 --> 00:04:59,849
It is Big Dipper.

71
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,719
Hey, do you want to,

72
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:05,922
drink at Namil Bar tonight?

73
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,550
Sure.

74
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:11,561
Really? Are you sure?

75
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:15,065
Yeah, well, sure.

76
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,301
What are you doing?

77
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,447
I am glad you all are here.

78
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:25,241
We, the Fantastic Four should
go to Namil Bar. Deal?

79
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,610
I won't go if Juman goes.
You all go ahead.

80
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,916
Hey. What is it now?

81
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,680
Then, the three of us can drink.

82
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:37,998
Didn't you two have a drink already?

83
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,357
Aera looks flushed.

84
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,680
-Why are your ears so red?
-Are you color blind?

85
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,420
My ears are not red. They're just hot.

86
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:52,402
-Why are you yelling?
-Enough chatting. Let's go.

87
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,570
Let's drink plum wine Seolhui made.

88
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,370
No, I am going in.

89
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,100
You two go ahead.

90
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,642
Just us two?

91
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,079
You always drink by yourselves. What's up?

92
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,181
I am going.

93
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:22,031
Anyway, that,

94
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,860
Moobin.

95
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,800
I will take care of him.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,140
How? Are you going to beat him?

97
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,147
I am not a gangster. Why
would I beat a person?

98
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,417
I have my own strategies too.

99
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,860
He is not someone you can handle.

100
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:55,709
Why do you always date such thugs?

101
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,367
When did I do that?

102
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:58,968
In middle school,

103
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,260
the one that borrowed your cell
phone and transferred schools.

104
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,608
-Dooyoung.
-How do you remember his name?

105
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,677
He was your first love.

106
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,700
He wasn't my first love.

107
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,000
In university, you dated the creepy
Sangmo in a traditional band.

108
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:14,880
We didn't date.

109
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,689
Then, the last boyfriend you supported for
two years left you for another woman.

110
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:21,157
That is enough.

111
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:23,493
Now, there's Moobin, the latest version!

112
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,690
Do you collect thugs? Is it your hobby?

113
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,201
You forgot one from my list of defect men.

114
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:33,436
My true first love.

115
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,760
The wrist man?

116
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:37,771
Yes.

117
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,710
Thanks to him, my wrist
still aches when it rains.

118
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,260
Where did you find such a jerk?
How is that the first love?

119
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:53,556
Leaving my home behind and on a train

120
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,894
I am on my way to the camp...

121
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,560
That is enough.

122
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:04,660
Hey. Once you go to the army,
you'll forget everything.

123
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,537
Did you know? They still
sell FINKL bread there.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,540
When things

125
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,670
get rough, men miss their
girlfriends more. You are clueless.

126
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,300
Is she your girlfriend?

127
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,240
You two broke up ages ago.

128
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,018
Take this off too.

129
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,220
Come on.

130
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,399
Have hangover porridge and go to the army.
I will wait.

131
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,501
From your first lady Choi.

132
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,940
She scared me!

133
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,760
Is she homeless?

134
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:06,296
He must be sleeping.

135
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:11,768
It might be his last chance.
He should sleep more.

136
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,480
Have hangover porridge and
go to the army. I'll wait.

137
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,160
Witch.

138
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,132
She looks pretty even with clumpy mascara.

139
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:02,980
Are you okay?

140
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,656
I am waiting outside.
Let's sober up together.

141
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,060
Dongman.

142
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,480
Did you really wait for me all night long?

143
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:41,591
I forgot to bring him kimchi.

144
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:45,361
Did she leave?

145
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,838
What is this?

146
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:59,175
Is there a mouse here or something?

147
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:12,288
What?

148
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,659
Hey! Darn it.

149
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,095
Are you all right?

150
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:21,920
It hurts!

151
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,200
Are you still drunk?

152
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,769
Aren't you leaving? Do
you want to be late?

153
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:29,972
Are you going somewhere?

154
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,941
What?

155
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:48,291
Do you really have to go?

156
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:51,494
I can't live without you.

157
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,860
She is acting like she would
wait 2 years for him.

158
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:57,100
Two years will fly by.

159
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,437
Why is she holding my porridge?

160
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:04,400
Seriously.

161
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,844
I said I would give you
all the rice I have left.

162
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,710
Why did you bring that out?

163
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,440
Did I ask for your rice? Did I?

164
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,886
Why did you bring kimchi
and fall down the stairs?

165
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,022
Let me see.

166
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,420
Does it hurt a lot?

167
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:27,363
Forget it.

168
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,699
Huh?

169
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,334
Are you going to cry?

170
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,100
Are you a kid? Are you
crying because you fell?

171
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:42,979
Hey. I told you. You
look ugly when you cry.

172
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,140
You get discharged on
September 5, 2012, right?

173
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,440
You will really come back then, right?

174
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,594
Stay out of trouble, okay?

175
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:11,107
How do you hurt your
wrist by liking someone?

176
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,608
Did you beat him up?

177
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,644
Did he deserve it?

178
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:18,581
Yes. He was so utterly clueless.

179
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,484
He probably had no idea I liked him.

180
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:25,555
You know, there is no
cure for being clueless.

181
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:28,691
They don't even know
that they are clueless.

182
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,259
Go to sleep.

183
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:31,794
Sleep.

184
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:34,197
Hey.

185
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:38,734
Do you still think,

186
00:13:38,935 --> 00:13:40,870
about your first love and stuff?

187
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:44,941
First love is like an immunization shot.

188
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,220
You are nervous before getting it and
it hurts briefly when you get it,

189
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,980
but you are fine afterward.
It just leaves a scar.

190
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:58,120
Hey. I told you. First loves are nothing.

191
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:02,191
Good night.

192
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:14,303
Who is it?

193
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,600
An immunization shot?

194
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,312
Who is it?

195
00:14:32,475 --> 00:14:33,743
Moron.

196
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:43,766
She was pretty...

197
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,993
Dieting is the hardest part of training.

198
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,263
So? Did you dump him?

199
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,600
Are you a dog?

200
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,200
It is.

201
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,580
Why did you spray on fabric
conditioner to breakfast?

202
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:29,779
I can't tell if I am eating
beans because of the smell.

203
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:32,548
It is the scent of my skin.

204
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:33,649
Your skin?

205
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,240
Have you lost your mind?

206
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,368
Aera, are you a food fighter?

207
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,103
Why aren't you talking?

208
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,140
Are you preparing for a fight?

209
00:15:58,307 --> 00:15:59,875
Did you two fight?

210
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,510
Why aren't you two talking?

211
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:05,147
Do you think we fight all
the time or something?

212
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:07,140
Did he call you ugly again?

213
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,010
Did he say you need to be reborn?

214
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,089
Hey. When was I that blunt with her?

215
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:18,794
Aera. Did you put on lip tint?

216
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,196
What?

217
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:23,232
I did not.

218
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,960
Yes, you did.

219
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:29,910
Why did you put on lip tint
before brushing your teeth?

220
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,460
She didn't put on lip tint.

221
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,845
-What?
-That is just the color of her lips.

222
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,025
I taste the fabric
conditioner in the eggs,

223
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:41,183
because of this punk.

224
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:03,739
Hey. Come out.

225
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,821
Why do you keep clearing your throat?

226
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:20,823
Are you phlegmy?

227
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:22,358
Do you still smoke...

228
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:23,890
You do, don't you?

229
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,960
Hey. I never smoked.

230
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,831
Why did you stop walking?

231
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:30,733
Because I felt like it.

232
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:32,034
Okay.

233
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,600
Are you going somewhere? Meeting someone?

234
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,100
Why is he asking so many questions?

235
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:39,608
You are unemployed, where are you going?

236
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm going to shop so that I
can stop being unemployed.

237
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:46,310
-Shop?
-I have an interview tomorrow.

238
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,010
So, I am shopping for a suit.

239
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,510
Alone? What about Seolhui?

240
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,820
-Is she unemployed like me?
-Right.

241
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,460
How long will you take?

242
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,161
What?

243
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:05,568
It was really brief.

244
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,090
It was like a slug...

245
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,139
Stop talking about that stupid slug!

246
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:12,908
Let's talk later.

247
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,448
What are you doing?

248
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:21,580
What? Can't we carry a bag together?

249
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,651
What?

250
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,050
I didn't grab your hand or link arms.

251
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,490
Can't we carry a stupid bag together?

252
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,920
Look around.

253
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,995
Who else is carrying a bag together?

254
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:36,550
Who else kisses a slug in the copy room?

255
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,830
Seolhui.

256
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,560
It's gross.

257
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:45,170
She buys clothes online all year round,

258
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,520
and she goes shopping
for every single event.

259
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,612
Women are so strange.

260
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,100
If she used that money for gaming, she
would have been number one by now.

261
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,820
How do I look?

262
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:05,694
It's just...

263
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,671
It's just...

264
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:30,492
It's just...

265
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,688
Why did you come along?

266
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:34,934
Did you come for the coffee?

267
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,680
Did you come for the air conditioning?

268
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,829
You need to say which looks pretty
or which is better. Say something!

269
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:44,209
You look pretty in them all!

270
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:57,179
Hurry up. Let's go.

271
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,880
Was it this copy room?

272
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,260
What?

273
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,700
Mr Kim, looks like we are
eating meat for lunch today.

274
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,160
Hi, Sunhee. You're here too.

275
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,600
It is Seolhui.

276
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,311
Mr Kim.

277
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:34,650
The last time as well.

278
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,080
Do you,

279
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,022
put something on your lips?

280
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:43,592
You are stylish, aren't you?

281
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,760
Shouldn't you go?

282
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,880
Are you going to the gym again?

283
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,560
Yes, to exercise. I have a match tomorrow.

284
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:09,018
You never do as you are told.

285
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,480
You need to get beaten up
so bad until you barely,

286
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,990
lift a spoon to say you
will give up MMA for good.

287
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,320
Why are you still here nagging?

288
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,160
I...

289
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,930
I want to tag along and see the place.

290
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:31,106
Hey.

291
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,830
Back from the copy room again?

292
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,400
What is wrong with you?

293
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,570
You're making me so nervous. I can't work.

294
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,681
Speak up, so you don't
have to be nervous.

295
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:40,810
We dated six years and
nearly live together.

296
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,540
Say I am the mistress of
our de facto marriage.

297
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,610
You don't use mistress in this context.

298
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,930
You do if it is a secret
de facto marriage.

299
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,750
Why should I be the mistress?

300
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,380
Sorry. I have an urgent meeting.

301
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:05,774
Why are you acting so silly?

302
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,700
Are you a child?

303
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,381
No. I should have been more careful.

304
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,160
What for?

305
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,120
-What?
-Just spill the beans.

306
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:20,222
Tell the truth.

307
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:22,991
Why tiptoe around? Brand him.

308
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:24,790
-What?
-Yell it out.

309
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,880
"Juman is mine." Make a big announcement.

310
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:31,200
If you don't have the guts
to, then at least act cool.

311
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:33,302
Well...

312
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,720
You remind me

313
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:38,574
of myself 10 years ago.

314
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,460
It is frustrating and heartbreaking.

315
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:50,219
Isn't this an illegal temporary building?

316
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,700
Does it have building permission?

317
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,940
Do you have adequate fire
extinguishing facilities?

318
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:00,590
Jab.

319
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,190
You make him teach too, right?

320
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,270
One.

321
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,020
Do you pay him at least minimum wage?

322
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,820
The Ministry of Employment
and Labor's hotline is 1350.

323
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,720
Hey, Byungju!

324
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:16,412
Punch the sandbag.

325
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:19,148
The newbie makes the best sandbag.

326
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,640
-You're playing favorites.
-Hey.

327
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,410
Are you the only one competing tomorrow?
He is too. Both should be careful.

328
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,523
I'm giving him some lessons.

329
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:32,461
Or else, put the two losers
up against each other.

330
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,760
Ready?

331
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:36,790
-That punk!
-I see,

332
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,480
he likes to beat up Dongman a bit.

333
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:46,241
Do you not have any other
plans for the day?

334
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,849
Jab.

335
00:23:54,817 --> 00:23:56,185
Come on. Jab.

336
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,187
One.

337
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,298
Byungju!

338
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,266
I got carried away.

339
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,890
You jerk. Is he your sandbag?

340
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,672
Then, let him put on
gloves and fight properly.

341
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,840
Why are you high-kicking
someone wearing mitts?

342
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:24,620
I need to throw real punches and he needs
to take them to see what it's like.

343
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,200
I am building up his pain threshold.

344
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,240
I'm fine, coach. It was a glancing blow.

345
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:35,357
Aera wants to have a go.

346
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,620
Could you teach me, mister?

347
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:46,201
-Me?
-Hey.

348
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,070
He's busy. Don't talk nonsense.
I will teach you next time.

349
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,640
Not you. Him.

350
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:56,300
He is the strongest and
best-looking man here.

351
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,713
My goodness!

352
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,510
Come on up here. It is
okay to have some fun.

353
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,287
Come on. Watch your head. There you go!

354
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:07,623
Okay then.

355
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:10,492
Gloves.

356
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:13,495
Aera, don't go psycho on him.

357
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,910
Why would a real man put on a
head gear to fight a woman?

358
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,930
What?

359
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,380
Aera is about to lose interest.

360
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,560
Sorry, my bad. Real men wouldn't!

361
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:40,150
Can experts like you really tell
when you are about to get punched?

362
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,940
You bet. Now, watch.

363
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,590
This is what I see.

364
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,190
It is almost in slow motion, you see.

365
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,932
I see and evade everything.

366
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,220
Shall we?

367
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:57,940
Wow, you are amazing!

368
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:03,200
A true fighter has to have better
hand-eye coordination than a punch.

369
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,347
Let's move a little faster.

370
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,317
I am not good at punching.

371
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:10,480
It is okay. It is me you are facing.

372
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,087
I can see every punch.

373
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:15,220
Real experts protect their faces well.

374
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,330
-Left.
-It's instinctual. We're born with it.

375
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,550
-Now, stop.
-Left.

376
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,590
I can see it all. You are too slow.

377
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,560
Left. Right.

378
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,150
-Faster.
-Left.

379
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,020
-Can't help avoiding...
-Left!

380
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,030
-Come here!
-Sorry.

381
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,940
Freeze. Are you trying
to beat up women too?

382
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,620
Your nose.

383
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,120
It's bleeding.

384
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:47,856
Come here. You've learnt
how to punch. Right?

385
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,300
You dated for six years?

386
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,390
We had no idea.

387
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,633
Aren't they our first in-house couple?

388
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,940
How did you start dating? You
work on different floors.

389
00:27:03,405 --> 00:27:06,470
Was it more about love and
less about work for you?

390
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,245
That is why we are treating you to lunch.

391
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,880
I hope you understand.

392
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:16,380
-I hope you understand.
-Thank you.

393
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,610
I hope you understand.
Come to our wedding.

394
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,220
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

395
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:21,500
Enjoy the food.

396
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,580
I am so envious.

397
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,861
Don't say that.

398
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:30,532
There are quite a few here
who don't have boyfriends.

399
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,500
I don't drink soda.

400
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,960
She is seeing someone, sir.

401
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:42,177
Yes.

402
00:27:42,944 --> 00:27:44,446
I have a boyfriend.

403
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,482
Come out of the cabinet.

404
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:50,886
Is anyone else looking
to date a colleague?

405
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:56,291
Don't suddenly shove us
a wedding invitation.

406
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:59,420
I dated for six years too.
We'll get married soon.

407
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,963
Great. Good for you.

408
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,560
I have a feeling there is a
couple waiting in the wings.

409
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:11,173
Mr Kim, make sure your
kimchi is a hit,

410
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,740
get promoted and get married.

411
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:18,270
He works in a large company, is a
full-time employee, born in 1989,

412
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,683
type O blood, height 178.7 cm, weight...

413
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,610
Okay. Good luck.

414
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,000
-What?
-I hope to hear the good news soon.

415
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,790
Yejin, how would you
describe your ideal man?

416
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,398
I like Park Bogum.

417
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:39,267
My boyfriend looks
exactly like Park Bogum.

418
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,703
What is wrong with you?

419
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,330
Are you drowning?

420
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,000
-Really?
-The restroom?

421
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,174
I am fine.

422
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,877
-Yejin.
-Yes?

423
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,000
If you have some time,

424
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,180
shall we have some tea?

425
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:56,985
I would love that.

426
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,820
Let's go to a cafe for some cake.

427
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:09,197
Byungju...

428
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:10,832
Goodness.

429
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:14,469
I think he cried.

430
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,271
Seriously?

431
00:29:16,738 --> 00:29:19,875
He got hit on the nose.
Even Fedor would wince.

432
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,980
Noses hurt extra.

433
00:29:22,878 --> 00:29:26,548
He attacked Dongman's
nose first with his foot.

434
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,260
Sorry. I got carried away just like you.

435
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:35,524
What?

436
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,160
I heard your mom sells jokbal too.

437
00:29:49,404 --> 00:29:51,840
Was your nickname "jokbal" as well?

438
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,740
Yes. "Pink Jokbal."

439
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,480
Mine too.

440
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,600
Our parents own a jokbal
place and we like pink.

441
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,650
When I was young, I wished
I had an older sister.

442
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,190
Can I be good friends with you?

443
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,180
Normally in dramas,

444
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:18,366
girls like her are rude.

445
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:23,104
Yejin, you are

446
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,160
not rude. You are pretty.

447
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,380
Pardon?

448
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:33,014
Do you think I am pretty? You too.

449
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:41,690
If I knew how to drink, we
could have had a drink.

450
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,580
But I can't, so I wanted to
have tea with you instead.

451
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,060
What is it, Seolhui? Do you have worries?

452
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,140
Did you argue with your boyfriend?

453
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,860
Sorry?

454
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,903
How is your boyfriend like, by the way?

455
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,820
He is

456
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,260
like a teddy bear.

457
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,430
He's like a cub.

458
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,040
My boyfriend is exactly like that.

459
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,520
Our tastes in men are similar too.

460
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,040
Do you have a boyfriend?

461
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,050
It is a secret at work,
but I have somebody too.

462
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,260
Really? I didn't know you had somebody!

463
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I totally understand. If you say you
have a boyfriend, they'll ask questions.

464
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,400
Do you want to see him?

465
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,270
We took a picture together this morning.

466
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,784
I bet he looks like Park Bogum.

467
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:36,578
But Seolhui, this is a secret. Okay?

468
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,640
It is Mr Kim.

469
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,120
Are you two dating?

470
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,970
I have a crush on him, but
he'll be my boyfriend soon.

471
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,800
I like him so much.

472
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,870
Just looking at him makes me so happy.

473
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,748
Yejin, why are you doing this?

474
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,740
I thought my first love
was in middle school,

475
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:19,231
but I was wrong.

476
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:23,458
I think about him all day and my heart,

477
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,920
goes all over the place.
If that is love,

478
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,560
Mr Kim must be my first love.

479
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,260
I must be crazy, Seolhui!

480
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:40,920
I thought Hongsik was my
first love, but I was wrong.

481
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,120
I think about Manager Kim all day.

482
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,643
I am going to die like this.

483
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,466
I must be crazy.

484
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:53,021
I like him so much.

485
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,060
Should I splash water on her?

486
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:02,497
I am thinking about how I should tell him.

487
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:12,360
How do I ask him out and
maintain a long relationship?

488
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:14,676
Should I slap her?

489
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,460
What do I do now?

490
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,280
Sorry?

491
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:24,340
In dramas, they slap the girl with kimchi.

492
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,354
That is playing by the book.

493
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,060
Can you give me some tips?

494
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,760
Do you want tips from me?

495
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:38,433
That's when I realized something.

496
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,340
In the course of one's life.

497
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:45,874
I am happy that I told you this though.

498
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:52,213
It is really difficult,

499
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,610
to slap somebody.

500
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,500
Stop looking at the camera, Sonya.
Are you on "Music Bank"?

501
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,110
I can't help it.

502
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,490
Wait, Taksu. Did you just get mad at me?

503
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,080
I wasn't mad at you.

504
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,310
This scandal is a huge blow to me
before the release of my second album.

505
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,050
To be honest, nobody knows
this is your second album.

506
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,390
-Geez!
-You will get publicity as,

507
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,590
my girlfriend and it will benefit me too.

508
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,820
Sonya, this is a win-win situation.

509
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,600
Is this a business relationship?

510
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,550
It's...

511
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,460
Love.

512
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,420
Love.

513
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,580
Cut, cut!

514
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,412
Sonya, why do you keep
looking at the camera?

515
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,620
-This is not a selfie, right?
-Isn't it enough?

516
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:04,510
If you look at other scandal
photos, they're all blurry.

517
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,010
Let's go again. She keeps
on staring at the camera.

518
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,360
It doesn't look like a
paparazzi cut at all.

519
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,820
Let's go again. Be natural.
Practice your acting.

520
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:17,098
That scumbag.

521
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,940
You made his nose bleed.
Why are you still angry?

522
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,940
Hey, would you lose if
you fought him fairly?

523
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,420
You tell me not to fight, but
you don't want me losing.

524
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,970
People get mad even when their
little puppy gets beaten up.

525
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,450
That's enough. I called the other two,
so get changed and come to the bar.

526
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:43,020
I have an interview tomorrow.
I can't drink.

527
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,320
Who says we are drinking?
It's a rehearsal.

528
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,540
Let's go.

529
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,840
Age doesn't matter
unless you are a cheese.

530
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,600
If you are not cheese, age
doesn't matter at all.

531
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:02,410
With an earnest desire,

532
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,860
age and experience,

533
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:09,083
I will become Choi Aera of KBC News.

534
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,187
-That is perfect.
-That was!

535
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,150
Aera is a great speaker.

536
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,250
You would make a good saleswoman.

537
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,590
If I had a choice, I would
pick you, 100 percent!

538
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,962
I was having such a lousy day.

539
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,899
You all make me excited
and my heart flutters.

540
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,669
Somehow, I feel like crying.

541
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,860
Why are you exaggerating?

542
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,130
I saw you practicing
to be an announcer,

543
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,321
and Dongman doing Taekwondo
and breaking everything,

544
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:38,240
since we were young.

545
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,970
You two are finally doing
it in real life tomorrow.

546
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,280
I feel nervous. I am getting emotional.

547
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:48,223
Honey, it is not like I got in already.

548
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:52,020
Mom, did I win already?
Why are you crying?

549
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,520
I feel like you are already halfway there.

550
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:59,030
You all are sparkling right now.

551
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,868
She is right. You two

552
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,120
are making me jealous.

553
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:08,000
Let's drink. Drink it up.

554
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,860
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

555
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,320
Your match is tomorrow, right?

556
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,224
If you become an MMA fighter,
would you meet Sarang?

557
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:24,792
Choo Sarang?

558
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:26,894
Why would I meet her?

559
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,240
Kim Donghyun met her.

560
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:40,074
Hold on.

561
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,180
You're nervous, aren't you?

562
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,780
Of course I am. How can I not be?

563
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,110
Does my hair look okay?

564
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,040
Do my clothes look okay?

565
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,100
They are not ugly.

566
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:02,830
Do I really look okay?

567
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,360
Look at me in the eyes and say something.

568
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:11,939
Usually,

569
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:16,444
you look like a beast,

570
00:38:17,648 --> 00:38:19,213
but...

571
00:38:20,782 --> 00:38:22,116
But what?

572
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:24,319
You look...

573
00:38:25,393 --> 00:38:26,721
-Kind of...
-Hey!

574
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,791
He means you are pretty.

575
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:33,938
She scared me. I almost cursed!

576
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:35,830
Why are you yelling?

577
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,800
It is like you got caught doing something.

578
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,803
-Did you do something?
-Did we?

579
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,405
I don't remember.

580
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:49,454
Do you do the plastering yourself?

581
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:52,914
Madam, do you even have
the license to do this?

582
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,780
Did Unit 102 decided to go for Unit 101?

583
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,280
Wait.

584
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,520
Use a cab. Just use it for today.

585
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:11,220
I bet Gangbyeon Expressway
is packed right now.

586
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,769
Don't tire your legs. You
need to use them later on.

587
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:27,515
I am your first sponsor. Pay
me back with fight money.

588
00:39:28,182 --> 00:39:31,953
You told me not to fight.
Why would you sponsor me?

589
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,000
-Get going.
-Aera.

590
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,037
You are not coming to watch, right?

591
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,029
It is 4 PM at Dongchook
Gymnasium, entrance four.

592
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,340
I will never watch you fight again.

593
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,270
Fine.

594
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:51,572
Hey, Dongman.

595
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:53,307
What?

596
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,960
Don't get intimidated.

597
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,644
Get them all.

598
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:00,047
You are acting like my father.

599
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:03,684
I hope you beat them all too.

600
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:05,563
Go.

601
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,654
Okay.

602
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:08,289
Bye. Go.

603
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:30,845
2017 KBC Announcer Interviews

604
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,940
Interviewee Waiting Room

605
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:44,580
I am number 24, Park Nari.

606
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,213
Hello, hello.

607
00:40:47,662 --> 00:40:49,160
Sample Interview Questions

608
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:53,111
Hello, I am KBC announcer, Park Nari.

609
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,204
I will give my best to...

610
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:04,670
Interviewee Testing Room

611
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,510
Number 23, 24 and 25.

612
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,648
-Yes.
-Yes.

613
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:18,793
I believe friendliness will
draw me closer to viewers.

614
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:24,031
Lastly, I think sense of duty is the most
important qualification for announcers.

615
00:41:24,432 --> 00:41:26,467
Okay, thank you.

616
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:30,730
If you don't have any other
questions, we will...

617
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,920
Excuse me.

618
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,980
You haven't asked me anything yet.

619
00:41:36,878 --> 00:41:39,447
Do you have any talents?

620
00:41:39,947 --> 00:41:42,717
For example, something you
can do on variety shows.

621
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:45,310
Variety shows?

622
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,387
Yes.

623
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:49,480
How about a song? Should I sing?

624
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,225
That would take too long.

625
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,760
We'll just consider we listened to it.

626
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,930
-Good job, everyone.
-Then...

627
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,560
How about a dance?

628
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,800
I can do a cover dance of AOA.

629
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:01,769
I understand you are passionate,

630
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:05,840
but if you dance right now, wouldn't
it make everyone feel awkward?

631
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:12,100
Then, I prepared an introductory opening.

632
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,247
Number 25.

633
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:17,880
-Yes?
-I am not sure how it is like for you,

634
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,655
but time is gold to us.

635
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,380
If you wanted to steal our time,

636
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:26,827
you should have filled up your time first.

637
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:32,080
Other interviewees went abroad to study,
went to graduate school and volunteered.

638
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,201
What were you doing during then?

639
00:42:34,902 --> 00:42:38,773
Passion should be proven
through your experiences.

640
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,020
I...

641
00:42:45,346 --> 00:42:47,315
Earned money.

642
00:42:48,268 --> 00:42:49,269
Pardon?

643
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:53,138
While they went abroad to
study and volunteer,

644
00:42:54,057 --> 00:42:55,058
I...

645
00:42:57,425 --> 00:43:00,161
Was earning money.

646
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,975
Mom.

647
00:43:15,076 --> 00:43:16,787
Choi Aera

648
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:18,079
Mom.

649
00:43:18,412 --> 00:43:20,514
How did it go? Get on.

650
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,431
Dad, what are you doing?

651
00:43:38,933 --> 00:43:40,034
Are you busy?

652
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:42,536
Can I

653
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,886
come see you?

654
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:49,176
I am really busy because
the boat just came in.

655
00:43:49,477 --> 00:43:51,508
Let's talk later. Okay.

656
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:01,367
We were always short on time.

657
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:07,050
I tend to doze off during the
day, but I don't sleep at night.

658
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,147
I am more focused at night too.

659
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,732
We wake up earlier than anyone,

660
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,413
and we sleep later, but
we never had enough time.

661
00:44:15,503 --> 00:44:18,839
I am a night owl, so working
late is not a problem.

662
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:21,795
Jab.

663
00:44:22,462 --> 00:44:24,845
We lived harder than anyone,

664
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:29,272
but our resumes don't show a thing.

665
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:32,820
They seem to be everything of our history.

666
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,647
It makes me mad and upset.

667
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,760
Once the news releases after the match,
all of the cameras will be on you.

668
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,440
If you can help it, it would be
good to look like a sexy fighter.

669
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,378
Is this what you call sexy?

670
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,980
I look like a 90s' office worker.

671
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:02,980
Even if two people score the same,

672
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,187
the camera will turn to the handsome one.

673
00:45:06,353 --> 00:45:09,790
In that sense, why do you think
my sundaes sell so well?

674
00:45:10,024 --> 00:45:12,626
Sure. You'll soon be a billionaire.

675
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:16,230
Wait. Did the news get released already?

676
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:19,176
What is this?

677
00:45:19,266 --> 00:45:22,403
Kim Taksu Admits to Dating Sonya

678
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:26,800
Kim Taksu and Sonya Often
Dated in His Studio Flat

679
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,540
We stopped Dongman's news with your
scandal. We'll buy two adverts

680
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,020
at this newspaper in
exchange of the scandal.

681
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:36,450
Dongman costs me so much money.
He is a money eater.

682
00:45:37,084 --> 00:45:38,340
He tires me out.

683
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,250
No one cares about a no name fighter.

684
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:45,360
You are a star. The scandal
will cover everything.

685
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,120
He is having his debut match today.

686
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,631
Right? Hey.

687
00:45:51,465 --> 00:45:53,134
You need to do your job right.

688
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,360
Do you wanna go back to where you're from?

689
00:45:56,137 --> 00:45:57,800
It is not a real match.

690
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:01,470
It is like an opening act at a concert.

691
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,370
They won't air it anyway.

692
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,640
No one cares.

693
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:05,840
I do.

694
00:46:06,213 --> 00:46:08,370
I care, okay? I do.

695
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,786
Don't let him come near the ring at all.

696
00:46:12,086 --> 00:46:15,380
By the way, I talked to the matchmaker.

697
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,400
I already planned out everything.

698
00:46:17,658 --> 00:46:22,150
There's someone who's confident he'll beat
Dongman. So I put him against Dongman.

699
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,820
What a joke.

700
00:46:24,398 --> 00:46:27,030
What could an amateur know about Dongman?

701
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,379
He beat Dongman before.

702
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:29,637
He did?

703
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:34,942
I wish people would just notice.

704
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,878
I would rather have people find out.

705
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:42,583
We are always together,
but no one suspects us.

706
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,510
Seolhui, you know that would
make us uncomfortable.

707
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,765
There's disadvantage too.

708
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:49,423
I am so anxious.

709
00:46:49,657 --> 00:46:51,058
Why?

710
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:52,326
Because of everything.

711
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,950
You are kissing someone else at work.

712
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,964
Stop thinking about that.

713
00:46:57,832 --> 00:47:00,501
Why is she so pretty and young?

714
00:47:01,502 --> 00:47:02,903
She is from a rich family,

715
00:47:03,103 --> 00:47:04,738
but she is so nice.

716
00:47:05,206 --> 00:47:06,774
You are a lot more beautiful.

717
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:11,111
No one even imagines that I am dating you.

718
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:16,483
I already know that your mother
and your sisters don't like me.

719
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:18,986
That is why,

720
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,823
I feel like I am dragging you down.

721
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,960
I feel like I am your mistress.
I feel foolish.

722
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,080
It really makes me feel awful. I am sad.

723
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,401
Why would you think that way?

724
00:47:34,902 --> 00:47:38,505
Sometimes, I wish you weren't
an assistant manager.

725
00:47:38,706 --> 00:47:40,700
I wish you never went to college like me.

726
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:44,845
I want you to earn 50
dollars less than me.

727
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,816
Even if that was the case, I could,

728
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:53,053
still love you for 100
years just like now.

729
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:11,739
If we sell out the kimchi this
time and I become a manager,

730
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:14,909
let's tell people at work.

731
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,840
After that, you should quit.

732
00:48:21,282 --> 00:48:22,383
Quit?

733
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,150
You always wanted to be a power blogger.

734
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,180
Once you quit, I'll fully support
you to become a power blogger.

735
00:48:30,524 --> 00:48:32,459
You can do that as the manager's wife.

736
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:34,762
What?

737
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,300
Once I become a manager,

738
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,320
let's do it.

739
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,580
Let's get married.

740
00:49:21,008 --> 00:49:22,570
Star Fighter and Idol Are Dating

741
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,920
How would you like it done?

742
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:27,381
Prettier than idol girl groups.

743
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,384
Are you going to be on a variety show?

744
00:49:30,584 --> 00:49:31,652
No.

745
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,022
I want to support my man.

746
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:36,590
Seriously?

747
00:49:36,857 --> 00:49:41,428
I want my man to become the star.
Make that obvious for everyone.

748
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,040
Yes, I ate.

749
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,700
I am working.

750
00:49:51,005 --> 00:49:52,930
Mom, I am at work right now.

751
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,541
Wait, Dongman.

752
00:49:55,943 --> 00:49:58,879
Do you want me to send you some money?

753
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,460
Do you think your grown
son doesn't have money?

754
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,740
I told you I work.

755
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,251
That is not it.

756
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:07,734
-Your dad...
-What now?

757
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,080
Did he say something? That
I can't even feed myself?

758
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,626
No.

759
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:16,430
He is worried that you may
have run out of money,

760
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:19,228
and aren't eating well.

761
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,905
Is he there?

762
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:28,375
Yes, he is. Do you want to talk to him?

763
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,980
I told you to make up with him.

764
00:50:35,962 --> 00:50:37,310
-Hey...
-No, no, no...

765
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,082
Mom. Don't give him the phone.
I have to get to work.

766
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,615
Just give Dad a message for me.

767
00:50:51,493 --> 00:50:52,527
Ask him

768
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:55,556
to believe in his son.

769
00:50:55,842 --> 00:50:56,921
Bye.

770
00:51:05,031 --> 00:51:07,126
What is there to believe in?

771
00:51:07,216 --> 00:51:08,668
You are so...

772
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:11,304
He will win in anything he does.

773
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:13,436
Ko Dongman, Lee Byungju

774
00:51:13,526 --> 00:51:17,344
You can't change the match-up
last minute like this.

775
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:19,876
You are making me feel bad.

776
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:23,516
Yes, new fighters usually go
up against each other,

777
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:28,176
but the one who was supposed to
fight Dongman suddenly forfeited.

778
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:30,586
Suddenly? Right before the fight?

779
00:51:30,676 --> 00:51:33,460
Should I feel bad about this?

780
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:38,798
I will go easy on you.

781
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:43,470
Coach, I am fine.

782
00:51:43,837 --> 00:51:46,406
You should help Dongman from his corner.

783
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:50,110
I feel so bad.

784
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:53,013
Hey.

785
00:51:54,014 --> 00:51:55,615
Even if you have no one else,

786
00:51:55,806 --> 00:51:58,246
Byungju was a champion in his region.

787
00:51:58,446 --> 00:52:01,546
How can you match him up with
someone making his debut?

788
00:52:01,716 --> 00:52:04,546
Why are you playing so dirty?

789
00:52:08,256 --> 00:52:09,726
Let's just do it.

790
00:52:12,032 --> 00:52:14,467
-What?
-I think I can do it.

791
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:19,636
It has been ages since we
walked through here together.

792
00:52:19,726 --> 00:52:21,536
How long has it been? Ten years?

793
00:52:21,626 --> 00:52:23,510
Don't be nervous. There is no need.

794
00:52:24,444 --> 00:52:25,866
-Coach.
-Yes? What?

795
00:52:25,956 --> 00:52:27,636
Nervous? Stomach hurts? Toilet?

796
00:52:27,726 --> 00:52:29,446
Do I must take off my shirt?

797
00:52:29,536 --> 00:52:30,506
Why?

798
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:33,946
I am used to wearing a uniform.
To take it off...

799
00:52:34,054 --> 00:52:36,016
So nervous? Stomach hurts? Toilet?

800
00:52:36,106 --> 00:52:40,470
I'm a little embarrassed. There
are so many women out there too.

801
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,956
I see. They will be so far away anyway.

802
00:52:44,046 --> 00:52:46,756
You will look like two kidney beans.
They can't see you.

803
00:52:46,846 --> 00:52:47,826
-Kidney beans?
-Yes.

804
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:50,966
Great, Dongman. You look
good wearing gloves.

805
00:52:51,056 --> 00:52:52,839
-You're here.
-Yes.

806
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:54,841
What are you here for?

807
00:52:55,636 --> 00:52:57,366
I enjoyed the scandal article.

808
00:52:57,944 --> 00:53:00,636
Taksu is second to none when
it comes to being shady.

809
00:53:00,726 --> 00:53:03,076
Why did you do something
you normally don't?

810
00:53:03,166 --> 00:53:04,606
You can't even do it well.

811
00:53:04,696 --> 00:53:05,606
What?

812
00:53:05,696 --> 00:53:08,388
Why did you meet with a reporter?

813
00:53:08,888 --> 00:53:10,286
Just stick to what you know.

814
00:53:10,376 --> 00:53:13,486
Geez. Am I an idiot? Should
I have just taken it?

815
00:53:13,576 --> 00:53:16,886
Don't let Taksu shake you up.
You and Dongman

816
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:19,032
should do what you are good at.

817
00:53:19,226 --> 00:53:21,466
Win with skills.

818
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,526
Did you hear that?

819
00:53:23,837 --> 00:53:27,617
Stupid idiots have to use their bodies.

820
00:53:27,707 --> 00:53:28,775
Darn it.

821
00:53:28,975 --> 00:53:30,176
Dongman.

822
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:33,313
I am here today as your fan.

823
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:34,736
What?

824
00:53:34,826 --> 00:53:37,046
Let me see you fly again.

825
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,294
Thank you.

826
00:53:49,729 --> 00:53:52,098
Honey. Do you think Dongman...

827
00:53:55,335 --> 00:53:56,503
"Honey"?

828
00:54:14,454 --> 00:54:17,190
Does he think he is Choo
Sunghoon or something?

829
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,325
He better be just as good.

830
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:32,839
Next up. Here comes Ko Dongman.

831
00:54:33,406 --> 00:54:34,507
Yes!

832
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:36,442
Yes!

833
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,085
Hey, don't let him set the pace.

834
00:55:19,326 --> 00:55:22,886
In this field, the one dating an idol
isn't king. The one with skills is.

835
00:55:22,976 --> 00:55:25,391
Whatever. I am just going to enjoy it.

836
00:55:25,486 --> 00:55:27,246
It's been a while since I've been here.

837
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,361
Open up.

838
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:32,465
Enjoy it.

839
00:55:47,747 --> 00:55:48,815
Go!

840
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:55,276
Now, for the main event.
RFC's Super Fight.

841
00:55:55,366 --> 00:55:57,056
Let me introduce the fighters.

842
00:55:57,523 --> 00:55:59,158
First, in the red corner.

843
00:55:59,726 --> 00:56:03,363
Standing at 180 cm tall, weighing 71 kg.

844
00:56:03,496 --> 00:56:05,598
With a 10-0 MMA record,

845
00:56:05,765 --> 00:56:07,326
-Boxing Face...
-Isn't that Park Hyeran?

846
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:09,736
-Park Hyeran?
-Is she here to watch the fight?

847
00:56:09,902 --> 00:56:11,226
Gosh, that's a scoop!

848
00:56:11,316 --> 00:56:12,326
-It's her!
-Film her.

849
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:13,606
Lee Byungju!

850
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:16,519
Aren't you Park Hyeran?

851
00:56:16,609 --> 00:56:19,036
-Are you here alone?
-Whom are you here with?

852
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,386
-Were you invited?
-May we get an interview?

853
00:56:21,506 --> 00:56:24,566
What brings you to an MMA fight?

854
00:56:24,684 --> 00:56:26,996
I came to cheer on a fighter.

855
00:56:27,086 --> 00:56:28,826
Really? Who?

856
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:33,459
The fighter standing
in the ring right now.

857
00:56:33,993 --> 00:56:37,499
Ko Dongman!

858
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:43,903
Keep it clean!

859
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,802
Ready? Fight!

860
00:57:18,805 --> 00:57:20,306
Stop!

861
00:57:22,842 --> 00:57:24,043
He is down!

862
00:57:24,644 --> 00:57:27,276
-Did you get that?
-It ended in 19 seconds.

863
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:28,336
What? Is it over?

864
00:57:28,426 --> 00:57:29,646
He just knocked him out.

865
00:57:29,736 --> 00:57:31,484
Is it over already?

866
00:57:38,624 --> 00:57:41,608
How did he keep it in all these years?

867
00:57:49,202 --> 00:57:52,526
We will announce the
winner of the main event.

868
00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:54,851
After knocking down his
opponent in 19 seconds,

869
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:57,366
the winner of this round,

870
00:57:57,456 --> 00:57:59,255
is Ko Dongman!

871
00:57:59,345 --> 00:58:00,413
Winner!

872
00:58:37,817 --> 00:58:39,546
Sorry, but what is your name?

873
00:58:39,636 --> 00:58:41,076
This was your debut, right?

874
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:42,576
What agency are you with?

875
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:44,646
How do you know Park Hyeran?

876
00:58:44,736 --> 00:58:46,516
How do you feel about your match?

877
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,428
Did you expect to win?

878
00:58:49,028 --> 00:58:50,386
May we get a brief interview?

879
00:58:50,476 --> 00:58:52,031
A word, please.

880
00:59:41,214 --> 00:59:42,615
What are you doing?

881
00:59:45,751 --> 00:59:47,019
I won.

882
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:55,553
Do you really have to do this?

883
00:59:57,497 --> 01:00:00,166
I can't bear to watch.

884
01:00:13,306 --> 01:00:14,666
I am in trouble.

885
01:00:18,946 --> 01:00:20,106
Now,

886
01:00:21,646 --> 01:00:23,906
you look pretty even when you cry.

887
01:00:35,468 --> 01:00:36,502
Dongman.

888
01:00:37,603 --> 01:00:40,966
If you feed only Whitey
because Blacky is ugly,

889
01:00:41,056 --> 01:00:42,555
wouldn't Blacky be sad?

890
01:00:43,643 --> 01:00:45,230
Don't you feel bad?

891
01:00:47,613 --> 01:00:50,616
The uglier they are, the
nicer you should be, okay?

892
01:00:54,186 --> 01:00:55,311
Here.

893
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:10,436
Here.

894
01:01:11,396 --> 01:01:12,906
Why are you like this?
