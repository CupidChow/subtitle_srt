1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,720
Episode 10

2
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,184
Darn it.

3
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,029
Hey, do you think this is your room?

4
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:48,432
Why are you shirtless?

5
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,744
You startled me.

6
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,169
Don't you remember?

7
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,360
Are you acting like you don't?

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,740
Whatever.

9
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,805
Who told you to sleep here?

10
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:00,956
You were in the mood.

11
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:03,113
You're the one who wanted to drink more.

12
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,401
You said you would leave soon.
Once the coach comes back!

13
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,800
Do you really not remember?

14
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,420
I remember your heavy
breathing very clearly.

15
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,026
Shut up.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,880
Why did you do it?

17
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,600
Why do you have to be so handsome?

18
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,720
You are giving me the shivers.

19
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,740
How can you sleep?

20
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,050
Are you an animal? How
can you sleep so well?

21
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,560
You punk. You are too gutsy.

22
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:19,836
Why did you blow your
hot breath on my face?

23
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,771
Did you have a dream?

24
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,180
You are talking nonsense.

25
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,775
You did.

26
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,645
You came up close

27
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,480
and touched my face.

28
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,782
I didn't touch you.

29
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,785
I swear you were breathing
right at my face.

30
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:37,354
Forget it.

31
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,460
No, we are not moving on.

32
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,860
What about you? Why are you undressed?

33
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,460
I don't know. Did I take
it off while sleeping?

34
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,248
Was it you by any chance?

35
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:57,273
Are you crazy? What are you saying?

36
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,720
Did you ask for a wake-up call?

37
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,580
Do you think this is a hotel?

38
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:08,485
Have you been to one a lot?

39
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,000
Didn't you hear someone knock earlier?

40
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,920
Who is that?

41
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,580
Maybe it is Coach.

42
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:23,233
Darn it.

43
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,350
I am kind of embarrassed.

44
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,470
Geez.

45
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:35,044
Sorry. I kind of fell asleep.

46
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:40,940
Who is it?

47
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,022
Why are you...

48
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,660
In life, timing is always

49
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,500
terrible.

50
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,370
One hour ago before the door open

51
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:03,470
Seocheongun

52
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,775
Say I will go up once I have my sketch.

53
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:08,478
Okay. Thank you.

54
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:13,480
The person you have dialed is unavailable.

55
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,785
Please leave a message after the tone.

56
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:36,339
30 minutes before the door open

57
00:07:45,582 --> 00:07:48,017
Why won't she pick up?

58
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,960
Is she here already?

59
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:57,320
No. This won't work.

60
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,320
Look!

61
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,940
My children aren't from
the Shaolin Temple.

62
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,465
There you go again.

63
00:08:03,878 --> 00:08:05,701
Just use anything. Please.

64
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,771
How could you say that
just because it, isn't you?

65
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:11,041
There are breaking
boards for these things.

66
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:12,481
See how they break?

67
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:15,481
I know. But they can hit it with
their hands like yesterday.

68
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:18,421
That was with their knees.
Try it yourself.

69
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:20,060
-They can do it.
-Excuse me.

70
00:08:21,128 --> 00:08:24,398
Yes? How may I help you?

71
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:27,091
I am with a staff member.

72
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:28,335
Which...

73
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:30,137
The MC.

74
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,711
The MC Choi Aera is my daughter.

75
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:36,341
Oh, you are Aera's father.

76
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:38,579
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

77
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:42,950
15 minutes before the door open

78
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:48,111
Why are there so many?

79
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:51,659
Geez, where is he?

80
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:57,298
We Did It! Motel

81
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:03,571
You raised your daughter so well.
She is tough.

82
00:09:03,771 --> 00:09:04,872
Tough?

83
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,601
But she is a girl.

84
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:10,501
She is solid like a rock. A hard rock.

85
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,347
Aera wouldn't even lose to Ronda Rousey.

86
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:15,671
Why would she fight her?

87
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:19,954
I am more afraid of Aera
than any woman in the world.

88
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,251
Ever since her microphone moron days, I...

89
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:24,658
What moron?

90
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:30,664
-Here. Please, come in.
-Here?

91
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:34,568
"We did it! Motel." Of all names...

92
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:43,001
We all stayed in the same motel,

93
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:44,979
so I'm sure he got her a room here.

94
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,371
-Who did?
-You didn't hear?

95
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,971
Dongman. Ko Dongman.

96
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:50,050
Dongman?

97
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:51,981
Ko Dongman?

98
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:54,121
-Let's go up.
-Okay.

99
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:59,311
Why did you come inside?

100
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:08,461
What? Is something going on in that room?

101
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,572
An affair? Is it?

102
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:17,978
They are definitely the
ones in rooms 408 and 410.

103
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:21,649
Why won't they pick up?

104
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:24,391
Did the children run away from home?

105
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:27,351
What is the area code here?

106
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:28,455
It is 041.

107
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:30,351
-041.
-Why?

108
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:31,781
041.

109
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:35,462
You can call the police
without an area code.

110
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:41,831
So I thought if I could get pictures

111
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:45,101
of the martial arts show and some sketches,

112
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:47,791
it would publicize the
festival, so it is a win-win.

113
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:52,271
I guess that martial arts
man is pretty famous.

114
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:54,582
-Yes, kind of.
-No wonder.

115
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:56,050
He stood out.

116
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,181
The kicker didn't look like
he should be doing shows.

117
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:02,151
Right? He is good.

118
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:05,481
Above all else, with his looks,

119
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:07,361
he will be popular in no time.

120
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:10,521
We are not about creating stars.

121
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:12,900
We are about selling their stories.

122
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:18,869
She must have left already.

123
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:20,100
One minute before doors open

124
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,676
Why won't she answer her phone?

125
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:26,381
Okay, I will go see Dongman first then.

126
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:27,731
What room is he in?

127
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:30,150
Let's see. I think his is that way.

128
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,286
Hey, Dooho.

129
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:34,371
Is Dongman still sleeping?

130
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:37,024
Dongman? I don't know.

131
00:11:37,324 --> 00:11:40,027
Why not? Didn't he sleep
with you in your room?

132
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:43,211
No. I thought he slept with you.

133
00:11:44,498 --> 00:11:49,937
Where did this punk sleep?

134
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:58,301
No! I was wrong!

135
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:00,711
I was confused about the motel.

136
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:02,371
This isn't it. She isn't in there.

137
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:04,451
It is another motel.

138
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:09,511
Who is it?

139
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:13,761
Why are you...

140
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,567
Sir...

141
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:31,045
Sir. Just a minute.

142
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,482
Dad. Hold on.

143
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:36,981
Excuse me, sir.

144
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:39,119
That is right. My performance.

145
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:43,157
Sir, I need to break some boards first.

146
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:47,361
That is right. We are late.
You have to go now.

147
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:49,363
Dongman, get in here.

148
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:53,500
Close the door and come in.

149
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:59,273
Sir. He has to be careful
of injuries right now.

150
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,050
July 1, 1989, Choi Aera

151
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:12,753
Get in here.

152
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,694
Go ahead.

153
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,682
July 1, 1989, Choi Aera

154
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:51,925
No! Raise it!

155
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:54,428
Yes. Okay.

156
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:00,134
Let Aera do both parts one and two.

157
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,361
Aera was great yesterday.
She will be a star.

158
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:06,051
She will make it for sure.

159
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:08,675
No! Don't come here!

160
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:18,919
How are you...

161
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,959
Should we call the cops?

162
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,961
What if unit 102 dies?

163
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:29,062
What?

164
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,349
It isn't an O, but an X.

165
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,920
Hundred percent for sure,
it is an X, not a triangle.

166
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:54,755
Triangle?

167
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:57,221
What is a triangle?

168
00:14:57,311 --> 00:14:59,726
Why are you doing this to me?

169
00:14:59,827 --> 00:15:01,791
She hits me while I am sleeping,

170
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:04,091
and you show up behind the door.

171
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:06,733
Why are you two doing this to me?

172
00:15:07,331 --> 00:15:09,951
So why did you sleep here?

173
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,072
You useless, little punk.

174
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:13,401
How dare you?

175
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:15,301
Why am I a useless punk?

176
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:17,778
Why did you sleep here?
What were you after?

177
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,611
Even if she and I were alone
on a deserted island

178
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:26,153
I would consider her a comrade. No.

179
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:30,081
I would consider her like an
island native or a monkey

180
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:33,311
and not even look at her. I swear.

181
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:37,861
No. I am just saying. It is not...

182
00:15:37,951 --> 00:15:39,511
What is wrong with my Aera?

183
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:42,169
-Sorry?
-Why must you

184
00:15:43,036 --> 00:15:47,174
call Aera a monkey?

185
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:02,551
By the way,

186
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:05,931
what are you, the landlady,
doing all the way here?

187
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:09,411
Sleeping in the same room is forbidden.

188
00:16:09,563 --> 00:16:10,564
Pardon?

189
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:16,431
But

190
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:18,338
why are you speaking informally?

191
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:21,084
I am older than you.

192
00:16:21,174 --> 00:16:22,743
I see.

193
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:27,511
Didn't we meet somewhere before?

194
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:28,782
We did not.

195
00:16:29,783 --> 00:16:31,285
-Scoop.
-Okay.

196
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:40,294
Why steak?

197
00:16:40,494 --> 00:16:44,698
Steamed pork is jokbal and
grilled pork is steak.

198
00:16:45,032 --> 00:16:46,667
Meat is all the same.

199
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:50,103
She will quit selling jokbal
to open a restaurant.

200
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:52,372
Here you go.

201
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:54,841
Eat all you want.

202
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:58,331
-Is it good?
-Yes, Mother.

203
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:02,911
I should treat you something good one day.

204
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:04,351
One day? When?

205
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:08,581
Our families should...

206
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:10,057
Forget it.

207
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:11,481
Pardon?

208
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:13,931
There is no need to rush the marriage.

209
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:15,631
The in-laws are...

210
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:19,231
I mean, you will get
married when it is time.

211
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,602
I almost forgot.

212
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:26,840
It was so funny. I still can't believe it.

213
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:28,731
What's it about? Just tell us.

214
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:31,755
Do you remember Kyushik from Jochiwon?

215
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:33,771
-Who?
-You know who!

216
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:37,150
The only son of the man on the mountain.

217
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:39,630
-Who? Kyushik?
-Yes.

218
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,165
There is now a paved road
through that mountain.

219
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:45,125
Kyushik made about a million dollars.

220
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:47,991
No, I heard it was 1.5 million.

221
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:49,129
So what?

222
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:51,231
I met his aunt.

223
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:53,991
She asked if you are still single.

224
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:56,291
I said you were and she said,

225
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:58,905
Kyushik has been waiting
for you to grow up.

226
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:02,376
I found that hilarious!

227
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:07,180
It is not a fun story
to share during a meal.

228
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,551
Intern Yejin

229
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:19,159
What is wrong with you?

230
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:21,962
Kyushik is way too old.

231
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:24,721
He was in the army when
I was in preschool.

232
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:26,566
He is probably in his '50s by now.

233
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,811
Are you trying to marry me off to him?

234
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:33,271
I'm implying, "You never know
until you walk down the aisle."

235
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:35,953
You made Juman feel bad.

236
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:37,411
He is not your boss.

237
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:39,871
Don't mind him too much.

238
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:42,791
Live off of this.

239
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,131
Why are you giving me this?

240
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:46,820
Am I a trash can?

241
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,188
You brat.

242
00:18:48,555 --> 00:18:49,556
Have a look.

243
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:53,894
We have no cash.

244
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:57,107
We spent all putting your
brothers through college.

245
00:18:57,197 --> 00:18:58,398
This is all yours.

246
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:01,231
Where did you get this, Mom?

247
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:04,271
I took it from my mother
in-law's closet before she died.

248
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,671
I did that to spend it on your wedding.

249
00:19:08,771 --> 00:19:10,011
Take it.

250
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:14,047
My goodness. You are insane!

251
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:17,271
Why are you giving this to me now?

252
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:20,053
Owning something like this gives you guts.

253
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:23,571
-Guts?
-Stop being so timid. Have a backbone.

254
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,751
If Juman upsets you, just dump him.

255
00:19:30,464 --> 00:19:31,791
Seolhui's Jokbal

256
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:34,201
Seolhui has three older brothers.

257
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,011
Yes, I know that.

258
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:39,211
Some couples

259
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:43,411
have a few daughters because
they tried for sons.

260
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:47,747
I ended up with three
boys trying for a girl.

261
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:54,321
The day she was born

262
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:57,551
I screamed and ran around the clinic.

263
00:19:57,724 --> 00:20:01,428
I heard. You screamed, "It is not there."

264
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:04,664
I took down her brothers' names

265
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:08,191
and put hers on the storefront.

266
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:10,470
My Seolhui means a lot to you.

267
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:12,272
She isn't yours yet.

268
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,074
Right.

269
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:17,110
Your family will think you are losing out

270
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:20,947
but I think my daughter
is too good for you.

271
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:23,683
Of course. She is way better than me.

272
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:25,852
Be good to her.

273
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:28,451
Or else, I will kill you.

274
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:31,331
Don't look down on her because she's kind.

275
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:35,331
Don't give your number to
people you must ignore.

276
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,831
Sit and watch from here.

277
00:20:43,136 --> 00:20:45,205
I will appear

278
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:47,831
from behind that wall there.

279
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:50,171
Then, I will come up here.

280
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:53,201
I bet you will. The MC
must be in the middle.

281
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,549
At the center, the forefront.

282
00:20:58,051 --> 00:21:00,161
I will be smashing a few
things up there myself.

283
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:02,871
You can't tell my dad what I did.

284
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:04,257
If you do,

285
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:07,791
I will tell him that you beat
me with a wire clothes hanger.

286
00:21:07,881 --> 00:21:10,063
You are a blackmailer.

287
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,969
Don't tell my dad.

288
00:21:20,707 --> 00:21:24,311
Why do I see nothing, but my own face?

289
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:25,801
Is this the video function?

290
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:26,947
Let me see.

291
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:28,591
Let me have a look.

292
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,618
I said I will take it for you.

293
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:35,021
Why would you film my girl?

294
00:21:36,957 --> 00:21:38,024
Dongman.

295
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:40,927
Hey.

296
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:44,130
What are you...

297
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:47,867
Aren't you Aera?

298
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:57,911
-Oh my!
-Gosh!

299
00:21:58,071 --> 00:21:59,351
Player Han Dooho!

300
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:05,091
Is Byungju with the Tigers now?

301
00:22:05,652 --> 00:22:06,811
Does our coach know?

302
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:09,511
Be wise like him when
you sign the contract.

303
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:14,051
Thanks for the offer, but...

304
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:16,997
Take your time before
you give me an answer.

305
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:18,591
Think about it.

306
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:23,301
I am hardly good enough for
the Tigers to want me.

307
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:28,391
If you sign me, Dongman will be
left alone. What's your intention?

308
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:31,721
Does it matter?

309
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:32,779
What?

310
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:37,350
Don't you want to move
to a house without mold?

311
00:22:37,651 --> 00:22:40,096
Think about your role as a dad.

312
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:43,156
Your child has atopy and
scratches until she bleeds.

313
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:45,921
You can't live life based
on childish bravado,

314
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:49,731
loyalty, and what you
think is cool, can you?

315
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:55,131
One.

316
00:22:57,037 --> 00:22:58,238
Hello.

317
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,094
Excuse me.

318
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:30,947
So Aera is the host and
you'll be smashing boards!

319
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:32,072
Yes.

320
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:34,411
You should have called ahead.

321
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:36,331
We had no idea.

322
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:41,531
You must not know. I am
a producer now at KBC.

323
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:43,049
The public network.

324
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:46,181
I worked on shows like "1 Versus 20",

325
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:49,856
"Happy Monday" and "How Are You?"

326
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:55,705
If you wanted to be an announcer,
you should have told me.

327
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:58,491
I could have asked my
producer friends to call you.

328
00:23:58,581 --> 00:23:59,666
Don't you dare

329
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:02,702
mention me to anyone.

330
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:09,531
Sir, from right here, you can
zoom from this position.

331
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:11,681
-Like this?
-Use two fingers. Good.

332
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:14,941
That's too far in. Pull back out.

333
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:23,451
Were you surprised?

334
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:28,131
You hadn't seen him in about five years.

335
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,866
I never wanted to see him again.

336
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,769
Why did you call him when I am here?

337
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:36,991
I didn't call him.

338
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:38,901
Why would you agree to this gig?

339
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:40,974
I never really did.

340
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:45,211
Did you call him first?

341
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:46,656
He called me.

342
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:47,781
Why?

343
00:24:48,841 --> 00:24:50,791
He said he would set
me up on a blind date.

344
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:54,911
Jang Kyungkoo?

345
00:24:58,792 --> 00:24:59,781
Did you go?

346
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:01,838
-What?
-The date?

347
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:02,962
What?

348
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:05,231
You went on the date.

349
00:25:05,465 --> 00:25:07,367
-You met someone.
-What?

350
00:25:08,768 --> 00:25:10,670
You are such a simpleton.

351
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:15,575
Hey, you better get a grip.

352
00:25:17,343 --> 00:25:21,247
Once a Jang Kyungkoo,
always a Jang Kyungkoo.

353
00:25:24,851 --> 00:25:26,481
Maxx World Chicken

354
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:30,557
Shall we have Seoul Chicken
or American Chicken?

355
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,321
Seoul.

356
00:25:34,661 --> 00:25:37,271
-We'll have another Seoul Chicken.
-Okay.

357
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,661
Mr Park, congratulations
on getting promoted.

358
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:43,570
Good for you, getting
married and promoted too.

359
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:46,983
I am so busy preparing
things and thanking people.

360
00:25:47,073 --> 00:25:48,752
How's the wedding preparation going?

361
00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:50,687
It is all about money.

362
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:52,245
Photos, dresses, and makeup.

363
00:25:52,378 --> 00:25:54,380
We are treated like ATM machines.

364
00:25:54,481 --> 00:25:56,850
Where will you live? In Gimpo?

365
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,220
Yes. Our parents will lend us some money

366
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:02,655
and we will get a loan from a bank.

367
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:05,851
Are you still dating in secret?

368
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:07,994
Not anymore.

369
00:26:08,561 --> 00:26:10,651
Everyone knows about us now.

370
00:26:10,921 --> 00:26:13,881
We will get married soon too

371
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:16,811
when Juman gets promoted.

372
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:20,671
You didn't have to say that.

373
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:22,381
Congratulations.

374
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:25,271
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

375
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:34,151
Wow, ice creams cost 80 cents these days.

376
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:36,581
Economy for the ordinary people failed.

377
00:26:37,391 --> 00:26:38,571
It was ruined.

378
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:42,031
Don't you think Chanho
shouldn't have done that?

379
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:43,191
Do what?

380
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:45,721
He dated his ex for four years.

381
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:47,661
I was actually close to her.

382
00:26:47,751 --> 00:26:50,851
He is marrying somebody he
has dated for four months.

383
00:26:52,505 --> 00:26:54,007
What is wrong with that?

384
00:26:55,841 --> 00:26:59,271
You are being so cranky today.

385
00:27:00,146 --> 00:27:01,281
Is it

386
00:27:01,731 --> 00:27:05,351
because Chanho is getting
promoted and you are not?

387
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:08,041
Do you think I am that shallow?

388
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:11,651
Frankly, I don't want Yejin's
aunt to promote you to a manager.

389
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:16,161
Why do you think it is from her aunt?

390
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:19,521
I could have done it with my performance.

391
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:21,061
Don't be too upset.

392
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:23,531
I'm fine even if you're an
assistant manager forever.

393
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:25,104
I am not okay with it.

394
00:27:26,072 --> 00:27:28,708
Who would want to be an
assistant manager for life?

395
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:31,671
If I do better, I can make you happier.

396
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:34,357
I am happy already.

397
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:37,951
Look. We are happy eating
ice cream together.

398
00:27:38,151 --> 00:27:41,788
I want to enjoy small things
with you like now,

399
00:27:41,888 --> 00:27:43,091
and love each...

400
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:44,229
Small things?

401
00:27:47,391 --> 00:27:48,831
Small things...

402
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,151
Why does happiness have
to be small things?

403
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:58,411
-What?
-If we continue this way,

404
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,751
when would we buy an apartment,

405
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:04,341
buy a car, get married,

406
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:07,941
get promoted, and have babies?

407
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:11,211
-Juman.
-I am sorry, but I am not grateful

408
00:28:11,301 --> 00:28:13,151
of those little things anymore.

409
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:16,831
I want to meet my friends
and brag about myself.

410
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:19,511
I wish I had something to be proud of.

411
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:25,465
Juman.

412
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,535
Why do I keep thinking you have changed?

413
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,706
People are not the same all the time.

414
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:37,601
You can't live life like
you are playing house.

415
00:28:46,252 --> 00:28:49,389
I am wearing the same outfit as yesterday.

416
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:52,021
How do I look?

417
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:57,191
You look pretty.

418
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:03,603
Why do I have a huge pimple today?

419
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:08,651
Hey, act normal today.

420
00:29:08,741 --> 00:29:11,444
Don't try to stand out. Don't dance.

421
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:13,346
By the way, would you really

422
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:17,391
feel that way if you went to
a deserted island with me?

423
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,242
What?

424
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:23,391
Am I the same as natives or monkeys?

425
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:28,861
What a gentleman!

426
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:33,491
Aera.

427
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:38,631
Alcohol saved you yesterday.

428
00:29:43,071 --> 00:29:44,431
What are you saying?

429
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,441
Why? Wishing go to a
deserted island with me?

430
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:55,421
By the way

431
00:29:57,081 --> 00:30:01,771
we are not entirely, completely

432
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:04,163
just friends, right?

433
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:05,511
What?

434
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:09,402
Are we kind of seeing each other?

435
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:15,301
Hey, stop talking nonsense.

436
00:30:15,391 --> 00:30:18,144
Go do your rehearsal. I will watch you.

437
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:20,279
Geez!

438
00:30:25,651 --> 00:30:30,723
Are We Seeing Each Other or What?

439
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:35,094
Aera.

440
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:42,251
It's awesome!

441
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:48,841
-Testing microphone.
-You are

442
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:51,244
-going to be here, right?
-Hello, Daecheon.

443
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:53,619
-I'm the host of the festival...
-What's she doing?

444
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,681
-The MC of Seosan!
-Didn't you text her?

445
00:30:56,931 --> 00:30:59,011
I thought you texted her.

446
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,691
What?

447
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:05,781
It is just a rehearsal, Dad.

448
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:08,394
Don't worry about me. Focus.

449
00:31:19,872 --> 00:31:21,007
Move over.

450
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,279
What are you doing here?

451
00:31:27,571 --> 00:31:30,631
-Why are you...
-I must be evil.

452
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,286
I hate seeing you excited.

453
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:36,691
Let's start the rehearsal, Hyeran.

454
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,658
Okay.

455
00:31:45,498 --> 00:31:48,100
Hello, citizens of Daecheon.

456
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:49,151
Wait,

457
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,247
Isn't that her?

458
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:52,538
Goodness.

459
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,731
Isn't that Park Hyeran?

460
00:31:56,671 --> 00:31:59,401
Where are you going?
Isn't it starting soon?

461
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:00,731
Let's go.

462
00:32:01,191 --> 00:32:03,681
-Isn't it starting?
-Let's just

463
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,152
-go already.
-What...

464
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:10,361
Let's just go.

465
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:12,831
I am here to volunteer

466
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:16,551
my time at the festival. I
am announcer Park Hyeran.

467
00:32:24,371 --> 00:32:25,551
Take it.

468
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:28,931
You can give it to me.

469
00:32:29,508 --> 00:32:30,576
Okay.

470
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:37,731
I didn't come here to see you on stage.

471
00:32:38,611 --> 00:32:42,691
I came here to give you these.

472
00:32:43,151 --> 00:32:44,461
Just go.

473
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:47,331
Shouldn't we eat together?

474
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:52,291
I haven't seen you for two months.

475
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:54,391
Let's have dinner together.

476
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:56,168
I am not hungry.

477
00:32:56,761 --> 00:32:58,991
I want you to leave now.

478
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:04,310
Okay.

479
00:33:05,911 --> 00:33:07,491
I'll go now.

480
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:19,421
Once you get home, put the
side dishes in the fridge.

481
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:21,841
What are you doing? Why
would you give me money?

482
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:23,861
I just want to.

483
00:33:24,664 --> 00:33:27,133
I'm over the age of getting
pocket money from you.

484
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,361
Why are you making me feel ashamed?

485
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:32,271
Can't dad give 30 dollars to his daughter?

486
00:33:32,431 --> 00:33:35,131
But why would you give it to me now?

487
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:36,911
Why now?

488
00:33:38,591 --> 00:33:42,241
Why did you have to come
and see me in this state?

489
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,387
What are you embarrassed
of in front of me?

490
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:51,390
I am completely fine.

491
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,071
You should leave.

492
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:58,351
I'm going to tear up if I
keep looking at you, so go.

493
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:00,491
Aera.

494
00:34:02,168 --> 00:34:03,602
In life,

495
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:09,742
each person has their own level of play.

496
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:14,641
Are you telling me not to dream?

497
00:34:15,247 --> 00:34:19,051
Does it make sense for a
gambler to play with grannies?

498
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:23,881
Park Jisung shouldn't play
in recreational soccer.

499
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:26,371
You are a professional.

500
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:32,891
A stage that small is not enough.

501
00:34:33,811 --> 00:34:35,231
Is it enough for you?

502
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:47,179
You were acting like a grown up.

503
00:34:49,048 --> 00:34:50,516
You are still far from it.

504
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:55,581
Go. I am leaving.

505
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:00,593
You rotten punk.

506
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:15,411
Come next time when I call you.

507
00:35:16,151 --> 00:35:17,191
What?

508
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:19,771
Next time,

509
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:23,791
I will be on a grand stage

510
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:26,331
so come when I call you then.

511
00:35:28,054 --> 00:35:29,155
Okay.

512
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:31,771
Call me then.

513
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:35,291
Even if you are in North Korea,

514
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:40,551
I will cross the 38th parallel to see you.

515
00:35:42,802 --> 00:35:44,236
I will get going.

516
00:36:19,671 --> 00:36:21,251
You should go too.

517
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:26,112
I don't want you to see me cry anymore.

518
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,051
I'm going to go back to Seoul.

519
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:34,771
By yourself?

520
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:37,791
We can go together tonight.

521
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:39,791
No.

522
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,328
I will go by myself.

523
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:35,811
I am going to sleep here.

524
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:37,111
Intern Yejin

525
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:38,751
I am lying on the bench.

526
00:37:44,481 --> 00:37:46,331
I'm going out for a while.

527
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:47,660
For what?

528
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:51,051
My friends want me there
saying I left too early.

529
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:53,866
-Should I come too?
-What?

530
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,535
No, it is just the guys.

531
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:59,401
Don't you think it is too late at night?

532
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:00,706
I will come right back.

533
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:05,477
Just eat with me and let's go for a walk.

534
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:07,931
It is too hot for a walk.

535
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:09,911
Why are you going out if it's hot?

536
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:11,811
What?

537
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:14,851
Just don't go.

538
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:34,231
I want to fight you sometime.

539
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:36,709
Well, you are my only sparring partner.

540
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:37,910
I think...

541
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:41,541
You are actually really strong.

542
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:46,685
Coach.

543
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:49,381
Are we supposed to be a circus?

544
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,651
We don't have energy. We didn't even eat.

545
00:38:53,158 --> 00:38:55,291
More boards? Why the
hell are they so thick?

546
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:57,696
Why the hell? Hell?

547
00:38:58,063 --> 00:39:00,532
-You!
-I mean, why are they so thick?

548
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:16,592
What kind of festival
has so many problems?

549
00:39:16,682 --> 00:39:18,651
They are so disorganized!

550
00:39:31,964 --> 00:39:35,501
I will wait until you come out.

551
00:39:42,975 --> 00:39:46,478
How can you drink without
knowing your skirt ripped?

552
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:50,831
Wouldn't you drink if you were me?

553
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,851
What is with you, Yejin?

554
00:39:53,118 --> 00:39:54,820
Why aren't you coming to work?

555
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:57,921
I know it is wrong of me to do this

556
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:01,711
but I still like you.

557
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:04,063
Why would you like me?

558
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,321
You are too good for me.

559
00:40:06,411 --> 00:40:08,121
I just like you more and more!

560
00:40:08,211 --> 00:40:10,202
I want you to pay me attention!

561
00:40:11,937 --> 00:40:14,501
I just keep on liking you.

562
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:16,171
I want you to pay me attention!

563
00:40:16,261 --> 00:40:19,431
I just like you so much.

564
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,384
I feel like I am going to die.

565
00:40:32,624 --> 00:40:34,593
I like you.

566
00:40:40,265 --> 00:40:41,734
Why are you crying?

567
00:40:55,731 --> 00:40:57,891
Are you going back to Seoul?

568
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:02,691
-Yes.
-Get on, I will give you a ride.

569
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:04,256
Why?

570
00:41:04,723 --> 00:41:08,594
What do you mean why?
I'm going there anyway.

571
00:41:13,531 --> 00:41:15,351
How do you do this without a script?

572
00:41:17,011 --> 00:41:20,291
Most events outside of
Seoul change by the hour.

573
00:41:20,431 --> 00:41:22,701
Don't you know? You can do it impromptu.

574
00:41:22,791 --> 00:41:26,021
You have no basics or organization.

575
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,831
At least plan the basic outline.

576
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:30,941
Who can do this without a script?

577
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:33,251
Well, she could.

578
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:35,291
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

579
00:41:36,922 --> 00:41:40,459
Then, we will try to get it ready. Okay?

580
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:44,391
Did Aera leave already?

581
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:50,531
Ko Dongman

582
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:53,539
Don't go. Wait for me.

583
00:41:54,301 --> 00:41:55,851
I want to go with you.

584
00:42:13,425 --> 00:42:15,721
Right. How was Chansook's wedding?

585
00:42:15,811 --> 00:42:18,497
I didn't get an invite, so I couldn't go.

586
00:42:19,531 --> 00:42:22,151
Why would she send you an invite?

587
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:25,991
That is true.

588
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,240
Hey.

589
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:33,389
How did you know I went to her wedding?

590
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:34,480
What?

591
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:38,091
How did you know about the Festival?

592
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:41,381
Dongman told me about that.

593
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:43,021
I know he didn't tell you.

594
00:42:43,322 --> 00:42:47,151
He didn't tell me directly,
but I heard it in passing.

595
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:50,562
Are you stalking my social media account?

596
00:42:51,597 --> 00:42:55,767
No. I don't even know your username.

597
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,039
Recent search

598
00:43:01,171 --> 00:43:03,301
12 Maebong Road, Oksu-dong

599
00:43:03,391 --> 00:43:05,931
"12 Maebong Road, Oksu-dong."

600
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:08,371
That's Namil Villa.

601
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:12,651
Because of you,

602
00:43:12,971 --> 00:43:16,121
I get chills when I see
traditional percussion bands.

603
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:18,481
Chills?

604
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,693
I'll make it short.
Terminate your program.

605
00:43:22,021 --> 00:43:24,271
Don't show up in front of me or Dongman.

606
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:27,521
Aera, I am not who I was before.

607
00:43:27,611 --> 00:43:32,451
I don't trust you becoming a
better or a brand new person.

608
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:39,651
Open the door.

609
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,881
Aera.

610
00:43:43,181 --> 00:43:44,249
Open it.

611
00:44:03,502 --> 00:44:06,171
I told you. I have changed.

612
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:12,578
I am not a pushover anymore.

613
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:46,144
Yejin, do you take me for a joke?

614
00:44:49,081 --> 00:44:51,149
You're the one that thinks I am a joke.

615
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:54,711
You must have had your fun watching me.

616
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:56,571
It wasn't funny at all.

617
00:44:56,821 --> 00:44:59,971
I was so upset and it drove me mad.

618
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:03,762
I was scared.

619
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:06,298
What?

620
00:45:06,732 --> 00:45:08,661
I hate that it is someone like you

621
00:45:08,751 --> 00:45:11,568
that likes Juman. I hate it.

622
00:45:14,051 --> 00:45:15,591
I was afraid.

623
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:22,180
Please, stop doing this to Juman.

624
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:25,831
Don't come see him at night, and
don't text him or call him.

625
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:29,211
Also, could you unfriend
him on social media?

626
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:32,958
I...

627
00:45:36,131 --> 00:45:37,571
Don't want to do that.

628
00:45:38,761 --> 00:45:40,751
Your relationship is dissolving anyway.

629
00:45:42,231 --> 00:45:45,611
If Mr Kim is torn, then I
really don't want to stop.

630
00:45:45,831 --> 00:45:48,071
If you are at that stage
of drifting apart,

631
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:49,574
then I will...

632
00:45:51,941 --> 00:45:53,531
Just continue to sway him.

633
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:17,141
To Seolhui.

634
00:46:17,231 --> 00:46:22,571
Did you go down?

635
00:46:52,738 --> 00:46:56,208
Why did you put on that safety pin?

636
00:46:57,576 --> 00:47:00,278
That is mine.

637
00:47:01,731 --> 00:47:03,341
That's mine.

638
00:47:07,252 --> 00:47:09,481
Then, that becomes a double discount.

639
00:47:09,571 --> 00:47:10,481
Movie theater 2011

640
00:47:10,571 --> 00:47:12,124
Pardon? What was that?

641
00:47:14,221 --> 00:47:16,611
Just take 12 dollars.

642
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:19,071
Really?

643
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:20,611
What?

644
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:21,961
Just a minute.

645
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:25,270
Let me help you with that.

646
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,901
By using the discount card

647
00:47:31,991 --> 00:47:33,879
and the points from your card,

648
00:47:34,191 --> 00:47:37,492
it comes out to 9 dollars and 80 cents.

649
00:47:37,582 --> 00:47:39,481
I had points?

650
00:47:39,571 --> 00:47:40,911
Yes, should I apply them?

651
00:47:41,001 --> 00:47:42,211
He is so smart.

652
00:47:42,301 --> 00:47:43,791
Do you need a parking stamp?

653
00:47:45,111 --> 00:47:48,351
I recommended you because you
are Dongman's friend,

654
00:47:48,651 --> 00:47:50,481
and put you at the counter,

655
00:47:50,571 --> 00:47:52,431
but you keep causing trouble.

656
00:47:53,131 --> 00:47:56,411
You sold a ticket for
70 cents last time too.

657
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:59,971
I am sorry. I keep
causing trouble for you.

658
00:48:00,471 --> 00:48:03,652
I would like to just
join the cleaning crew.

659
00:48:03,742 --> 00:48:05,501
Do you know how tiring that is?

660
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,978
I prefer feeling at ease

661
00:48:07,071 --> 00:48:10,031
than being physically comfortable.

662
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:13,652
Why are you like that?

663
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:18,390
Here.

664
00:48:22,227 --> 00:48:24,121
A woman having this open

665
00:48:24,211 --> 00:48:27,199
is like a man having his fly open.

666
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:31,781
Why are you so absentminded, careless,

667
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:34,431
and full of mistakes?
You are so distracting.

668
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,531
Maybe I should just quit.

669
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:40,579
Then? Will you be different elsewhere?

670
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:43,431
Just stay where I can see you.

671
00:48:56,695 --> 00:48:58,721
You are only a year older.

672
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:00,498
Let's just be friends, okay?

673
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:04,211
-Alright.
-Cheers!

674
00:49:08,173 --> 00:49:10,471
Let's start from here and...

675
00:49:10,561 --> 00:49:14,071
-Wave!
-Wave!

676
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:15,780
-Wave!
-Wave!

677
00:49:18,183 --> 00:49:19,281
Gamjatang.

678
00:49:19,371 --> 00:49:20,381
Tangsuyuk.

679
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:21,581
Yukgaejang.

680
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:23,811
-Changgookji.
-Drink!

681
00:49:23,901 --> 00:49:25,511
-Drink.
-Drink up!

682
00:49:25,601 --> 00:49:28,727
Drink it up. Drink.

683
00:49:31,621 --> 00:49:33,141
-Manager Kim, could you...
-"Manager."

684
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:34,791
-She spoke English.
-"Manager."

685
00:49:34,881 --> 00:49:36,031
-English.
-English.

686
00:49:36,121 --> 00:49:38,937
-Drink.
-Drink!

687
00:49:39,304 --> 00:49:42,431
I can't drink much, so I need to stop.

688
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,744
She is my friend's friend,
so I'll drink for her.

689
00:49:47,178 --> 00:49:48,771
You are a real man!

690
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,448
You have to grant him a wish.

691
00:49:50,548 --> 00:49:54,085
I am too drunk. I need
to use the restroom.

692
00:49:56,254 --> 00:49:58,089
Sit down. Sit.

693
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,211
I am going to call home.

694
00:50:02,691 --> 00:50:04,391
Hey. Park Seolhui.

695
00:50:05,297 --> 00:50:06,898
I am Baek Seolhui.

696
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:08,391
Okay. Baek Seolhui.

697
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,303
Do you know that you're really pretty?

698
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:15,371
"Hey"? I am still older than you.

699
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:19,210
Today is "kiss day."

700
00:50:21,391 --> 00:50:24,141
I want to be with you today.

701
00:50:26,651 --> 00:50:28,253
You little jerk.

702
00:50:28,653 --> 00:50:30,121
I said not to do it.

703
00:50:30,355 --> 00:50:32,351
I told you, she's my friend's friend.
Bastard!

704
00:50:32,441 --> 00:50:34,492
My friend's friend!

705
00:50:44,436 --> 00:50:48,073
My dad said to sterilize wounds with soju.

706
00:50:48,707 --> 00:50:50,271
Should I go get some?

707
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:53,645
What is wrong with you?

708
00:50:56,548 --> 00:50:58,450
What did I do wrong this time?

709
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:02,751
You are the one who fought.
Why are you yelling at me?

710
00:51:03,011 --> 00:51:05,351
Why did you throw a kick

711
00:51:05,441 --> 00:51:08,426
at someone you can't even beat?

712
00:51:11,961 --> 00:51:13,591
Why are you so cute?

713
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,361
-What?
-Do you wear a short dress

714
00:51:16,451 --> 00:51:17,877
to get attention?

715
00:51:18,103 --> 00:51:19,304
Your eyes.

716
00:51:20,138 --> 00:51:21,761
You smile all cute

717
00:51:21,851 --> 00:51:24,376
to try to brainwash men. Right?

718
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:28,051
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

719
00:51:28,391 --> 00:51:30,081
It is because I like you!

720
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:33,371
I wanted you to look at me!

721
00:51:33,811 --> 00:51:37,081
That is why I wore this
dress and smiled so much!

722
00:51:37,188 --> 00:51:38,256
What?

723
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:40,861
It is because I keep liking
you more and more,

724
00:51:40,951 --> 00:51:43,031
so I wanted you to look at me!

725
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:47,891
Darn it. Why must I say this?

726
00:51:49,034 --> 00:51:50,869
You are so annoying.

727
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:56,991
You are so damn pretty.

728
00:53:14,911 --> 00:53:17,131
Why are you going this far?
What are you afraid of?

729
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,451
Am I not being myself?

730
00:53:19,611 --> 00:53:21,011
That's exactly yourself.

731
00:53:22,421 --> 00:53:25,091
You are being too obvious
that you are nervous.

732
00:53:27,632 --> 00:53:29,801
Smiling like that isn't cool at all.

733
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:32,770
If you are upset, just scream and cry.

734
00:53:32,937 --> 00:53:35,273
If you are happy, say so and be silly.

735
00:53:35,701 --> 00:53:37,621
If you want to do something, say so...

736
00:53:37,711 --> 00:53:39,611
and just cry. That is less pathetic.

737
00:53:39,891 --> 00:53:41,331
Like Aera?

738
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,351
You know you are more
pathetic than she is, right?

739
00:53:47,051 --> 00:53:50,671
Then, why didn't you ever
date such a great girl?

740
00:53:51,881 --> 00:53:54,351
-What?
-You weren't sure.

741
00:53:54,551 --> 00:53:56,331
You weren't positive.

742
00:53:57,261 --> 00:53:58,971
Then, it isn't right.

743
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:03,461
We have shared 20 years together.
What do you know?

744
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:08,116
After 20 years, even furniture
in your home grows on you.

745
00:54:08,206 --> 00:54:09,161
What?

746
00:54:09,251 --> 00:54:11,871
Don't confuse being
comfortable as liking her.

747
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:15,271
If it wasn't her for 20
years, it won't be her ever.

748
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:23,311
Do you think I want to act crazy?

749
00:54:24,722 --> 00:54:26,851
It needs to be you for me.

750
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:28,931
That is why I am acting crazy.

751
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:34,251
You said I was your first love.

752
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:36,868
Sure, Hyeran.

753
00:54:37,802 --> 00:54:39,971
You were my first love.

754
00:54:41,472 --> 00:54:44,075
Because I was only 20 years old back then.

755
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:46,771
I let myself get hurt

756
00:54:47,245 --> 00:54:49,480
and acted like a fool with no regrets.
But

757
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:51,971
that's all in the past.

758
00:54:53,671 --> 00:54:54,581
What?

759
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:56,881
My first love has ended already,

760
00:54:57,251 --> 00:54:58,831
and now...

761
00:55:00,511 --> 00:55:02,131
I only see Aera.

762
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:07,831
Aera again?

763
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:11,491
You think I was terrible to you, right?

764
00:55:11,581 --> 00:55:15,173
But you were cruel to me too.

765
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,701
I was always nervous because of Aera.

766
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:19,911
That's why...

767
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:26,331
I won't lose you to her.

768
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,171
I have seen this scene countless times.

769
00:55:32,021 --> 00:55:35,651
Doesn't she seem like
a manipulating witch?

770
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,597
Maybe we should send Dongman to the army.

771
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:43,067
Okay, everyone.

772
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:46,211
Since it is Dongman and
Hyeran's 100th day together...

773
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:48,139
Kiss.

774
00:55:48,273 --> 00:55:51,175
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

775
00:55:51,276 --> 00:55:53,978
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

776
00:55:54,279 --> 00:55:56,981
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

777
00:55:57,248 --> 00:55:58,683
Kiss!

778
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:05,731
Our boy, Dongman kissed a girl.

779
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:12,751
What's so moving about this?

780
00:56:13,031 --> 00:56:14,711
Suzy? Because she's so pretty?

781
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:18,803
Moving, my foot.

782
00:56:43,928 --> 00:56:45,263
You punk.

783
00:56:45,361 --> 00:56:49,191
He probably didn't get any
chocolate since Hyeran dumped him.

784
00:57:09,921 --> 00:57:13,391
In life, timing is always terrible.

785
00:57:16,828 --> 00:57:18,763
I always ran away.

786
00:57:21,332 --> 00:57:23,041
What are you doing?

787
00:57:23,131 --> 00:57:25,971
If it hadn't worked out for
20 years, it never will!

788
00:57:53,097 --> 00:57:54,732
I won't lose you again.

789
00:57:57,201 --> 00:57:59,291
Let's stop taking detours.

790
00:58:05,943 --> 00:58:07,478
Stand strong.

791
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:12,991
We have already kissed

792
00:58:13,611 --> 00:58:16,111
and I don't know how to do flings.

793
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:19,131
We kissed, so it is official.

794
00:58:22,391 --> 00:58:23,751
Let's date.

795
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:29,391
Let's date.

796
00:58:32,901 --> 00:58:34,251
Let's date.

797
00:58:40,971 --> 00:58:42,271
We are dating now

798
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:48,111
so I will do it again.

799
00:58:49,771 --> 00:58:50,791
What?

800
00:58:52,121 --> 00:58:53,531
I want to do it again.

801
00:59:29,193 --> 00:59:33,241
Darn it. Why did it go out again?

802
00:59:33,331 --> 00:59:35,341
Relax. Take it easy.

803
00:59:35,431 --> 00:59:37,091
Don't be nervous.

804
00:59:46,171 --> 00:59:49,631
But it is you, right?

805
00:59:50,147 --> 00:59:54,252
Hwang Bok Hee.

806
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,351
Ganako Hwang.

807
00:59:57,751 --> 01:00:00,691
Now, I go by Ganako Hwang.

808
01:00:04,531 --> 01:00:08,631
How long do you plan to
live in Namil Villa?

809
01:00:14,851 --> 01:00:18,431
I will live there forever.
