1
00:00:02,157 --> 00:00:03,727
Episode 3

2
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,920
Don't touch

3
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:44,393
The 2017 KBC announcer...

4
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:47,591
-Sit and wait. I won't be long.
-Thanks.

5
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:51,681
Share your creative future with KBC and...

6
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,853
It will be slightly colder than yesterday.
Wrap up.

7
00:00:55,944 --> 00:00:57,012
A thin cardigan...

8
00:00:57,103 --> 00:00:59,339
Why don't you wrap up a bit more?

9
00:00:59,548 --> 00:01:01,659
The trough of low pressure...

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,727
...will cause rain in some areas.

11
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:05,730
-Open wide.
-Be prepared for it.

12
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,689
Let's check the current temperature.

13
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:09,424
Do it yourself.

14
00:01:09,524 --> 00:01:10,625
Just go and do it.

15
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:13,437
-Do what?
-I know you're upset since it's around...

16
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:14,830
...time for the open recruitment
for announcers.

17
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,995
Forget it.

18
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:19,637
Why not? If I were born with your looks,

19
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:21,831
I'd apply and see if I could fly.

20
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:24,053
Do you think...

21
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,593
...I can fly?

22
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:27,775
Yes.

23
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:30,859
Look. This is tofu soup,
not bean sprout soup.

24
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:32,393
Share it with Dongman.

25
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:34,966
See you later.

26
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:38,546
You two went to prison yesterday.

27
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,897
It wasn't prison.

28
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,040
I'm off to make money.

29
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:57,184
Open up.

30
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:08,509
Love

31
00:02:08,636 --> 00:02:09,904
Comes out

32
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:12,683
Oh dear. He'll be so embarrassed...

33
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:15,243
...when he comes out.

34
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:20,099
Like a lost child

35
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,115
I cried and begged

36
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:27,376
I can't hit the high notes today.
Why you...

37
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,990
I told you not to come in here.

38
00:02:31,758 --> 00:02:33,720
You should've changed your pass code.

39
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,237
-0070 is so easy to remember.
-Gosh.

40
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:08,425
Gosh.

41
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,059
What body lotion do you use?

42
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:15,172
Do you think you're Song Seungheon?
Your eyebrows...

43
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:19,402
It's delicious.

44
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:23,797
It's so itchy.
Is it because I didn't wash my hair?

45
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:25,098
Hey.

46
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:28,524
Let's try not meet in the mornings.

47
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:30,637
Why?

48
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:34,776
I just prefer seeing you in the evening.

49
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,196
Silly.

50
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:40,506
Why do you want to see me in the evenings?

51
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:50,824
Who is it that?

52
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:52,370
Why are you ignoring the call?

53
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:54,282
It's a telemarketer.

54
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:58,771
Why are you being so nosy?

55
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,195
Did she call you?

56
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,228
She didn't, so eat up.

57
00:04:03,374 --> 00:04:05,560
I told her clearly back then...

58
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:08,815
...that I'd kill her if she
showed up around you again.

59
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:12,196
Wait and see if I'm true to my words.

60
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:23,019
Hello, how have you been?

61
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:25,758
I miss everyone.

62
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:27,582
Yes.

63
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:30,871
Do you know what she's doing now?

64
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:33,276
I think her name was Aera.

65
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,712
Yes, that's right, Choi Aera.

66
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,987
No, we weren't close.

67
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:43,857
I thought she'd be in my field by now.

68
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,804
What? At a department store?

69
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:49,977
So...

70
00:04:50,177 --> 00:04:54,264
...you got back from changing
and found this here?

71
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:57,909
What could it be?

72
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:59,825
Who'd leave this here?

73
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:02,917
Did a terrorist leave it?

74
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,774
What do you think?

75
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:07,628
Should I open it?

76
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:10,388
Don't.

77
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,820
Why not? Do you have a bad feeling too?

78
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:17,376
This was packed by an expert.

79
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:20,521
It looks like just
the packaging cost 20,000 won.

80
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:23,691
What if the owner comes back
and demands compensation?

81
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:25,678
Let's leave it then.

82
00:05:26,763 --> 00:05:30,239
I'll put out a broadcast
and ask if someone lost it.

83
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:35,189
Let's leave it here for now.

84
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:37,681
Here?

85
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:40,708
Reject Call

86
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:54,476
Answer your phone,
or I'll go to your house.

87
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:20,155
One gimbap, please.

88
00:06:28,318 --> 00:06:29,420
Hey, Aera.

89
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,647
Park Hyeran is eating
a 1,000 won gimbap right now.

90
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,077
Is this reality?

91
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:49,043
Aren't you going to eat?

92
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,543
I'm dieting.

93
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,245
Then why are you here?

94
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,257
I bought it for someone.

95
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:57,586
But coincidentally, I saw you here.

96
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,083
It's good to see you.

97
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,874
Was it really a coincidence?

98
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:06,258
Hyeran, a conglomerate
family's daughter-in-law,

99
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,851
happened to show up
at a dollar gimbap place...

100
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:11,804
...near my workplace during my lunch break.

101
00:07:12,028 --> 00:07:13,340
That's a coincidence?

102
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:16,211
Nothing happens by coincidence with you.

103
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:19,686
Since we met anyway,
give me Dongman's number.

104
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:21,607
Or his address.

105
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:24,687
Why do you care?

106
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,652
I have no reason to tell you.

107
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,265
You know his number, right?

108
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:31,217
No, I don't.

109
00:07:32,648 --> 00:07:33,647
You don't?

110
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:36,666
We don't keep in touch anymore,

111
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,562
ever since he got married and moved away.

112
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:41,313
It felt strange calling a married man.

113
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,096
That's proper etiquette.

114
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:45,663
I see. Is that right?

115
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:47,496
Etiquette.

116
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:49,989
You know what that is, don't you?

117
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:03,423
Leave Dongman alone.

118
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,957
Don't think about him
and stay away from him.

119
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,440
You have not changed at all.

120
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:14,106
This is so heavy.

121
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,814
Gosh.

122
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:20,999
If you exterminate the mites,

123
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,661
I'll work on the bidet and filter...

124
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:25,660
Me?

125
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:28,292
You want me to do the fumigation?

126
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:30,789
That's your part.

127
00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:33,185
We need to do our
own parts to finish quickly.

128
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,105
Do you like dividing up the duties?

129
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,202
But you know, in Korea,

130
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:41,950
we follow hierarchy. You know, seniority.

131
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,380
So are you telling me...

132
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,185
...to do everything myself?

133
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:50,459
Why are you asking?

134
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:54,457
You sound like you
haven't served in the military.

135
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:57,878
Does this work? My bad. Sorry.

136
00:08:57,969 --> 00:08:59,603
My gosh.

137
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:02,667
They're so stingy.

138
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,699
Why are they making us eat the cherries?

139
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:08,234
I like it. It's like break time.

140
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,716
-It tastes good.
-We need to shoot people...

141
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:13,121
...eating the cherries,
so act like they taste good.

142
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:14,219
-Okay.
-Okay.

143
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,779
Also, mix it with the salad
and yogurt too.

144
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,612
-Yes, sir.
-Enjoy.

145
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:22,020
-Okay.
-Okay.

146
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:23,989
I said not the yogurt.

147
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:37,022
Smile more, please.

148
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:42,013
Yogurt!

149
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,223
What are they saying?
Why are they smiling?

150
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,533
"Me too?" What does that mean?

151
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:02,203
Me too.

152
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:09,982
What's wrong with her?

153
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:12,631
-Oh no.
-Are you okay?

154
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:13,828
Stop.

155
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:16,791
Someone help! I think she's choking!

156
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:26,655
Step aside.

157
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:21,007
Was he big and tall?

158
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:22,193
There's nobody like you.

159
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:23,427
Can you do it, Dongman?

160
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:24,705
Anywhere at all.

161
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:27,669
Why does Seolhui get to play Snow White?

162
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,794
Because she is.

163
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:34,380
-Got a problem with that?
-You're just a tree.

164
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:38,164
I'm a special tree.

165
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,769
You just have to kiss Seolhui now.

166
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,475
What?

167
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:06,448
I don't want to.

168
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,773
What's wrong with you?

169
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:14,251
Just do it!

170
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:17,283
Kiss her!

171
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:23,584
My fantasy was always being Snow White.

172
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:31,789
And now, finally,

173
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:37,279
I felt like I became Snow White.

174
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,348
Why would you put cherries in yogurt?

175
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:50,239
You eat cherries by themselves!
Not with yogurt!

176
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:52,681
You can just dip it if you want!

177
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:54,900
Just dip it!

178
00:13:05,273 --> 00:13:07,292
I'm so sick of my stupid IBS.

179
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,948
The person who left behind
their spare battery...

180
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,217
...in the third-floor women's department,

181
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:15,252
please come pick it up...

182
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:16,702
- ...right away.
-What's that?

183
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:18,306
Isn't that Mr Kim?

184
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:20,650
Why is he making the announcement?

185
00:13:20,856 --> 00:13:22,558
Who says, "battery" like that?

186
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,090
The PA girl suddenly took...

187
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:27,625
...three months off.

188
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:28,824
Why?

189
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:30,887
She's getting married.

190
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,351
Mr Kim. Here.

191
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:44,661
What is it this time? You're scaring me.

192
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:46,743
I thought you'd be extra tired today.

193
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,506
You have your own job,
plus the announcements.

194
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:52,292
What is it? Say what you want.

195
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:55,253
It's what I've been
asking you for a while already.

196
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:58,875
To give me a heads up
if the PA position opens up.

197
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:04,476
You are quite the ambitious one,
aren't you?

198
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:09,132
You must've been flustered
by the sudden resignation.

199
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,865
People like me need to act
quickly in these situations.

200
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,238
People like you?

201
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:16,448
People on your side.

202
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:18,265
Gosh.

203
00:14:20,564 --> 00:14:22,867
Mr Kim, you have the best eye.

204
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:25,671
You should be a doctor.

205
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:29,608
It was as if your own wife was dying.

206
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:34,338
I learned the Heimlich maneuver
during training.

207
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:37,740
Sure. I hope you'll work hard to...

208
00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:40,099
...on cleaning up too.

209
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,569
Oh, my head.

210
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,419
Why that...

211
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,096
-Mr Kim.
-Yes?

212
00:14:50,953 --> 00:14:54,499
You were super cool.
A real knight in shining armor.

213
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:57,510
It made me wish I had eaten that cherry.

214
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:00,554
Sorry?

215
00:15:18,063 --> 00:15:20,375
It isn't that complicated.

216
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,882
Just don't burp into the microphone.

217
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:25,868
I'll hold interviews
no matter who may come.

218
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,719
You can give it a shot then too.

219
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,530
If you do well then,
you can make this seat yours.

220
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:33,784
Really?

221
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:44,650
How dare someone who served...

222
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,038
...as a private lecture
an Army sharpshooter sergeant...

223
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,348
...about respecting seniority? Why that...

224
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:51,694
Seriously.

225
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:54,298
Gosh, I can't take this anymore.

226
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:58,877
Error Da.Aera

227
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:01,730
You have such a bad timing, Aera.

228
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:06,496
What do you want? Why are you calling me?

229
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:09,812
How dare you order me to come?

230
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,503
What? There's big news?

231
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:15,997
So you're going to do
the in-house broadcasting today?

232
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:22,268
Wait. But why did you ask me to come over?

233
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:25,605
You should be here to
witness the historical moment.

234
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:27,182
You also need to do something for me.

235
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:29,184
My first broadcast starts at 3:30 p.m.

236
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:31,317
It'll be my debut,
so please record it for me.

237
00:16:31,517 --> 00:16:34,301
You want me to record it? My goodness.

238
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:36,200
You're making me do such ridiculous stuff.

239
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,950
We only have 20 minutes
left until the live broadcast.

240
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,909
I should hurry up and
wait beneath the speaker.

241
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:45,722
My gosh, you really
know how to do a good job.

242
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:46,961
Okay, let's go.

243
00:16:53,582 --> 00:16:56,855
Here's an announcement
for all our customers.

244
00:16:56,946 --> 00:17:01,312
Outdoor wear is on sale
on the eighth floor.

245
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:05,218
If you're interested, please make a visit.

246
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:08,766
I am Aera, and that's it
for the announcements.

247
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,065
My gosh, she did a great job.

248
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:17,485
She's as good as Baik Jiyeon.
Don't you think?

249
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,219
My gosh, what should I do?

250
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:38,055
Hey, she just said her name, right?

251
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,112
Gosh, why would she say her name?

252
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:47,086
Put on your gloves. You'll burn yourself.

253
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:51,265
Outdoor wear is on sale
on the eighth floor.

254
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:55,913
If you're interested,
please make a visit.

255
00:17:56,004 --> 00:17:59,218
I am Aera,
and that's it for the announcements.

256
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:03,756
My gosh.

257
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:06,691
What should I do?

258
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:09,979
Why? Is there something wrong?

259
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:13,357
It sounded perfect to me.

260
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:16,384
What should I do?

261
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:18,935
I'm...

262
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,765
...so happy.

263
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:24,984
I'm really happy.

264
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:30,959
I guess people really need
to do what they love.

265
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,758
Now that you've done what you love,

266
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,869
are you that happy?

267
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:37,221
I could die.

268
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,150
An unknown box is being kept...

269
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,129
...at the information desk
on the first floor.

270
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:53,914
The person who used to be
at the information desk?

271
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:56,342
Oh, are you talking about Aera?

272
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:58,236
She's the one who's talking right now.

273
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:01,848
I am Aera,
and that's it for the announcements.

274
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,550
-Let's have spicy pig's feet and soju.
-Where?

275
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:40,638
I'm not Cindy Jung,

276
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:43,249
but Aera of Lucky Department Store.

277
00:19:43,423 --> 00:19:46,454
Make sure to bring the receipt
and come to get revenge.

278
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:22,994
Take your hand off me, you pervert!

279
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:24,257
Don't follow me.

280
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,465
My gosh.

281
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:35,056
Let's go.

282
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:44,456
My goodness.

283
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,658
I'm sorry for cursing at you earlier.

284
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:52,746
Why were you following me?

285
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:54,589
No, it's just that...

286
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:00,983
I got this for you,
but it was in Lost and Found.

287
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:04,256
What is it?

288
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:17,154
Aera, once you get off work,
wear these sneakers...

289
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:20,566
...and come to the gate.
I'll be waiting. From Moobin.

290
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:25,198
When you kicked
the rear view mirror last time,

291
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,007
you broke your heels.

292
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:29,948
I got you these so that
you can walk comfortably...

293
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,034
...after the next time
you have to kick anything.

294
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,532
These are air sneakers.

295
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,594
Do you think this is funny?

296
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:42,860
Are you guys betting on shoes this time?

297
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,765
No, that's not it.

298
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:48,010
I feel extremely uncomfortable
having to look at you.

299
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,018
So quit this joke,
and let's not see each other again.

300
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,261
I want to be with you.

301
00:21:55,152 --> 00:21:56,096
What?

302
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,542
I missed you.

303
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,320
After I saw you that night,
I kept thinking of you.

304
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:07,603
I spent so many nights
coming up with this idea...

305
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:10,197
...so that I could come
and see you tonight.

306
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:12,803
So...

307
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:15,435
This is a new jacket.

308
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:17,066
I even got a haircut today.

309
00:22:17,157 --> 00:22:18,379
I also made a reservation at a restaurant,

310
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,842
and I even filled up my car's fuel.

311
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:27,861
That was a bit cute.

312
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:33,125
Why did you fill up your car's fuel?

313
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:37,823
Well, just in case you
wanted to go for a drive...

314
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,339
...or go to Mount Nam.

315
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:43,738
That's so lame.

316
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:45,994
By any chance,

317
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:48,698
do you have a boyfriend?

318
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,213
What will you do if I don't?

319
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,947
Then try going on ten dates with me.

320
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:00,266
I'm confident.

321
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,161
I'll do my best.

322
00:23:06,742 --> 00:23:08,315
I do my best in everything.

323
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,180
My gosh,

324
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,323
why are you so straight-forward?

325
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:16,713
Well, it's because you're so pretty.

326
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:19,599
Other guys might also be after you.

327
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:23,318
Whatever.

328
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,619
Aera, try these on and see if they fit.

329
00:23:28,092 --> 00:23:30,921
I think your foot size is around 230 mm.

330
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,242
It's 235 mm.

331
00:23:35,577 --> 00:23:37,580
Then they'll fit you perfectly.
Please try them on.

332
00:23:48,657 --> 00:23:52,225
Try them on like Cinderella tried
on her glass shoes.

333
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:55,171
My foot size is 245 mm.

334
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,529
Should I try squishing
my feet inside these sneakers?

335
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,167
Martial arts

336
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:53,287
The Path of Martial Arts

337
00:24:53,554 --> 00:24:55,598
Now that you've done what you love,

338
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:57,510
are you that happy?

339
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:02,554
I could die.

340
00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:13,126
No...

341
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:15,455
Go.

342
00:25:21,362 --> 00:25:22,291
No yo-yo syndrome!

343
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:23,338
Coach.

344
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,127
Why does he keep making sudden visits?

345
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:30,263
That jerk is here again.

346
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,083
Let me ask you just one question.

347
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:38,505
If, by any chance,

348
00:25:39,154 --> 00:25:40,518
I decide to start martial arts...

349
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:42,740
What?

350
00:25:45,598 --> 00:25:47,198
Yes? Go on.

351
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:50,865
Will I be able to make a lot of money?

352
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:54,203
Can I make money with mixed martial arts...

353
00:25:54,357 --> 00:25:55,935
...when I get old and
can't fight in matches?

354
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:59,318
Why do you keep bringing up money?

355
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:01,718
Is money all that matters in life?

356
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,646
Instead of money,
you should think about your dreams,

357
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:07,484
and heart, and give your best shot at life.

358
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:10,203
I must have money to dream
and care about others.

359
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:14,119
Gosh, you're too young
to be tainted by the world.

360
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,494
I...

361
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:18,055
...want to buy a house for my mom,

362
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:20,432
and a new car for my dad.

363
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:23,271
These are my wishes,
but I need money for them.

364
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:28,088
People say money isn't important, but it is.

365
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,107
I ask because I can't do this
just to fulfill my dream.

366
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:36,768
Besides, I have to protect
Donghee until the end.

367
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:39,157
I can't give this a shot if I were to fail.

368
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:40,262
Darn it!

369
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:43,184
So can I make a lot of money
doing mixed martial arts?

370
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:48,545
If you want to make money,
stay away from here.

371
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,938
Don't even show your face to me, you jerk.

372
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:03,921
I'm worried I might want to do this.

373
00:27:04,842 --> 00:27:06,815
I'm afraid that this might be
what I want to do!

374
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:10,431
-Forget about it.
-You are a man.

375
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,584
How can you still not be over it?

376
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,832
I won't do it.
Do whatever you are supposed to do.

377
00:27:15,923 --> 00:27:18,741
-Taksu.
-Why is he being such a jerk about it?

378
00:27:38,476 --> 00:27:40,201
Dad, so today,

379
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:41,900
I really did make announcements.

380
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:43,295
I did!

381
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,643
Of course.

382
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,037
"I am Aera,
and that's it for the announcements."

383
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:54,405
This was it. I'll send you the recording.

384
00:27:54,937 --> 00:27:57,832
So you are going to do it
tomorrow and the day after?

385
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,158
If that's the case,
I will visit you tomorrow.

386
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,544
-I'll close the shop and go.
-I think...

387
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:07,001
...Aera might be doing something.

388
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,922
-I don't know.
-How can I not go?

389
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:11,346
My daughter finally made announcements.

390
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:14,994
Why don't we do this?
Let's have lunch tomorrow.

391
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,629
I'll open for the morning and be there.
I'll hang up.

392
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:19,727
Okay.

393
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:21,613
Gosh, I'm so proud.

394
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:23,945
-Gosh.
-Hey,

395
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:26,152
bring us sea bream sashimi.

396
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,836
You had sea bream?

397
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,625
Why haven't you brought it out?

398
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:33,887
You. Don't even think about paying for this.

399
00:28:34,522 --> 00:28:37,595
Everything including the sea bream is on me.

400
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:40,021
Why? Is Aera getting married?

401
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:42,302
That's not what matters now.

402
00:28:42,714 --> 00:28:46,221
I became the dad of an anchor
for the department store.

403
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:48,272
Goodness, he drives me crazy.

404
00:28:48,523 --> 00:28:50,852
Why is he coming all the way to Seoul?
It's lame.

405
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,543
Hey, you crazy moron.

406
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:37,139
Gosh, are you a gangster?

407
00:29:38,178 --> 00:29:39,790
-Get up.
-Gosh.

408
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,770
Darn it.

409
00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:51,065
This is nice.

410
00:29:52,911 --> 00:29:54,905
Should an anchor go home
standing on the bus?

411
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:14,912
Seolhui.

412
00:30:15,835 --> 00:30:17,708
Is that Tteokbokki that you're holding?

413
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:19,965
Is that from the three-way intersection?

414
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:22,294
Do you have beer in that bag?

415
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:23,753
Do you have soju too?

416
00:30:25,636 --> 00:30:29,124
-Soju, beer, and Tteokbokki.
-Unbelievable.

417
00:30:29,215 --> 00:30:30,896
I have to check if you two are on drugs.

418
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:33,277
-Drug test.
-Drug test.

419
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:35,801
You two look like you lost your senses.

420
00:30:37,072 --> 00:30:40,198
-Where's Juman?
-At work. He won't come home.

421
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,446
Juman became a big shot. He's working late.

422
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:45,069
He really looks like an office worker.

423
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:48,308
Anyway, that's why I am free tonight.

424
00:30:48,508 --> 00:30:51,185
-I'm free tonight.
-Seolhui.

425
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:53,759
-Seolhui, it's pronounced "free".
-Free.

426
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:55,370
Free.

427
00:31:28,107 --> 00:31:29,516
This is so refreshing.

428
00:31:31,463 --> 00:31:34,669
I can't leave this place
because of this Namil Bar.

429
00:31:35,383 --> 00:31:37,752
By the way,
don't you think the new landlord...

430
00:31:37,843 --> 00:31:40,074
...hasn't found out
about this place yet, right?

431
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,231
But have you two seen the new landlord?

432
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:46,174
I haven't seen
the landlord on the fifth floor either.

433
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,922
She's Namil's mom.
It's the name of the villa.

434
00:31:50,122 --> 00:31:51,450
-Just like "Seolhui Jokbal?"
-Yes.

435
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:55,074
So the real landlord
of this villa moved in.

436
00:31:55,274 --> 00:31:56,440
That's what the laundromat lady told me.

437
00:31:57,428 --> 00:31:59,713
By the way, she is a bit odd.

438
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,570
-What?
-The new landlord.

439
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,676
She's odd.

440
00:32:06,183 --> 00:32:07,400
Could she be a ghost?

441
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,223
No one has seen her coming in or out.

442
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:13,670
It's weird that she suddenly moved in.

443
00:32:47,857 --> 00:32:51,285
Why do I keep hearing people talking?

444
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:59,409
-That's a lot of soju.
-It tastes better this way.

445
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,153
Here we go.

446
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,294
Thank you.

447
00:33:04,631 --> 00:33:05,899
Give me the bomb shot too.

448
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:08,446
-Really?
-Don't give it to her.

449
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:10,847
If she gets drunk,
I have to take care of her.

450
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:13,417
One shot of soju makes her crawl.

451
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,445
-Let me just have a taste.
-Hey.

452
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,340
Hey, did something happen?

453
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,550
-Did you and Juman have a fight?
-No.

454
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:26,665
It's not that.

455
00:33:27,863 --> 00:33:30,574
Isn't it funny to attach
jewelry on your nails?

456
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:33,087
Why? Did someone put
jewelry on their nails?

457
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:34,489
The new intern at my company did.

458
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:38,240
Yesterday, her sleeves were lacy...

459
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,214
...and she wore a princess outfit.

460
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:42,302
Today, she wore a pink skirt suit.

461
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,067
Is she pretty?

462
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:46,664
Don't you think she's trying to show off?

463
00:33:47,576 --> 00:33:48,851
She's ridiculous.

464
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:50,254
So is she pretty?

465
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:53,783
Why? Did she hit on Juman?

466
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:56,826
He won't fall for her even if she does.

467
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:59,583
Forget it. She's just someone at work.

468
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:03,098
So answer me. Is she pretty? Am I invisible?

469
00:34:03,189 --> 00:34:04,685
Why are you treating me like a ghost?

470
00:34:04,885 --> 00:34:06,883
So I have a question now.

471
00:34:08,503 --> 00:34:10,074
Women don't like...

472
00:34:10,274 --> 00:34:13,219
...mixed martial arts, do they?

473
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:14,402
-Mixed martial arts?
-Yes.

474
00:34:14,578 --> 00:34:16,237
Don't those fighters bleed?

475
00:34:16,752 --> 00:34:19,848
Well, not really. They don't bleed.

476
00:34:19,939 --> 00:34:21,097
-Hey.
-What?

477
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:23,343
What are you up to these days?

478
00:34:23,434 --> 00:34:24,850
What are you doing?

479
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,058
Don't act like my grandmother.

480
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:30,878
You punk.

481
00:34:31,412 --> 00:34:33,144
I'm sleepy.

482
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:36,686
Seolhui, you're
going to call Juman, right?

483
00:34:36,886 --> 00:34:39,055
Hey, try playing hard to get.

484
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:40,798
I won't call him.

485
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:45,083
If you're interested,

486
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,777
please make a visit.

487
00:34:47,914 --> 00:34:51,028
I am Aera,
and that's it for the announcements.

488
00:34:52,077 --> 00:34:55,623
I am Aera,
and that's it for the announcements.

489
00:34:55,823 --> 00:34:58,926
And that's it for the announcements.

490
00:34:59,427 --> 00:35:00,369
Are you that happy?

491
00:35:01,112 --> 00:35:04,702
Doesn't my voice resemble Baik Jiyeon's?

492
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,959
How did you manage
to live without being an anchor?

493
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:10,077
Give it your best shot.
Try it even if you might fail.

494
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:11,896
I think they are recruiting anchors now.

495
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:14,049
I won't.

496
00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:21,788
You told me you perform well
in front of a microphone.

497
00:35:21,988 --> 00:35:25,401
That's why you are using
a microphone at your desk.

498
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:28,960
-I won't do it.
-Why?

499
00:35:30,919 --> 00:35:31,973
I don't want to be a prop.

500
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,935
-A prop?
-It says the school I attended...

501
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,491
...and age aren't of importance.
It's all a lie.

502
00:35:42,713 --> 00:35:46,321
Don't just tell me to chase my dream.
What about yours?

503
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:47,593
Mine?

504
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:49,738
My dream is...

505
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,244
...to be rich.

506
00:35:55,795 --> 00:35:57,036
What a stupid dream.

507
00:35:59,054 --> 00:36:02,268
It sounds stupid but I can relate.

508
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:18,472
When you become rich,
will you make me a rich madam?

509
00:36:18,994 --> 00:36:22,705
See, this is why I can't become rich.

510
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:25,512
Hey, relax your arm.

511
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:27,323
I am relaxed.

512
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,278
When we were in school, we had to...

513
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:32,884
...write down what we wanted to be.

514
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:34,996
The teachers said we could be anything.

515
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:37,349
Now that I'm older...

516
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,186
The adults duped us
clueless kids in many ways.

517
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,031
I wrote everything
from winning the Miss Korea...

518
00:36:44,122 --> 00:36:46,199
...to becoming the president.

519
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,625
Back then,

520
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:50,637
my dream changed almost every day.

521
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,108
What will you be when you grow up?

522
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,203
A skewered rice cake.

523
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:57,836
What?

524
00:36:57,927 --> 00:37:00,416
I'll be a skewered rice cake
when I grow up.

525
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,165
Red Devil

526
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:03,598
-Dongman.
-Goodness.

527
00:37:03,798 --> 00:37:04,959
Sit down.

528
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:07,714
Goodness.

529
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,643
I'll become Yoon Dohyun!

530
00:37:13,587 --> 00:37:15,451
The national competition's coming up.

531
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:17,399
Send me to Seoul!

532
00:37:22,757 --> 00:37:23,706
Skewered rice cake.

533
00:37:24,773 --> 00:37:25,902
What's your dream now?

534
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,297
Let's say I don't have one.

535
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,627
Why must we say you don't have one?

536
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:33,048
It's better to pretend
to not have a dream.

537
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:35,688
Having one will only make
you feel pathetic.

538
00:37:37,346 --> 00:37:39,845
You're right.
What's the point in dreaming...

539
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:41,322
...when your reality blows?

540
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:44,422
Dreaming of reading
the news only infuriates me.

541
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,447
I won't dream anymore.

542
00:37:49,177 --> 00:37:50,778
Do we all need to dream?

543
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:54,433
Society works even when
someone like me doesn't dream.

544
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:08,482
Don't fall asleep.

545
00:38:08,782 --> 00:38:10,104
I'll just leave you here.

546
00:38:11,546 --> 00:38:12,803
You could end up with...

547
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:15,492
...a lopsided face for sleeping up here.

548
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:18,262
Do you know what facial nerve palsy is?

549
00:38:18,535 --> 00:38:19,526
You could get that.

550
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,279
Hey, you...

551
00:38:29,669 --> 00:38:31,356
You have tiny nostrils.

552
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:36,411
You have great skin for someone so ugly.

553
00:38:37,621 --> 00:38:38,847
It's...

554
00:38:40,177 --> 00:38:41,779
...so soft and smooth.

555
00:38:45,177 --> 00:38:46,179
Don't do that.

556
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:48,085
Do what?

557
00:38:52,237 --> 00:38:54,247
I let you off the last time.

558
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,181
When?

559
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,788
You hugged me on the way back
from the police station.

560
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:03,394
I remember it clearly.

561
00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:04,432
Oh, that?

562
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:07,462
You don't have to remember it clearly.

563
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:10,063
I'm warning you. Don't you dare...

564
00:39:10,154 --> 00:39:11,331
...touch me again.

565
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:15,490
What? This is just unbelievable.

566
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:18,466
Someone would think that...

567
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:21,340
...I groped you or molested
you or something.

568
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:22,427
I am...

569
00:39:23,015 --> 00:39:25,742
...from the countryside,
so I get the wrong idea.

570
00:39:27,379 --> 00:39:30,446
You don't think much.
You're practically a moron.

571
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,965
Puberty barely hit you and ran off,

572
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:34,259
so I can do this...

573
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:36,732
...or this.

574
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:40,495
I could do something like this...

575
00:39:42,138 --> 00:39:43,456
...or this,

576
00:39:44,106 --> 00:39:46,843
and you'd feel nothing, but I...

577
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:51,504
I feel almost sick.

578
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:54,456
Don't make me want to vomit.

579
00:39:56,873 --> 00:39:59,486
Don't touch. Don't cross the line.

580
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:15,718
Why? How could she just...

581
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:19,377
...touch me up like that?

582
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:26,502
Why is it so hot?

583
00:40:27,313 --> 00:40:28,805
It's so warm.

584
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:32,583
I'm burning up.

585
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:52,217
Namil Villa PSA

586
00:41:18,258 --> 00:41:19,256
What's that?

587
00:41:19,863 --> 00:41:20,949
A bag for your laptop.

588
00:41:21,493 --> 00:41:23,338
It came in the mail yesterday.

589
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:25,830
Look.

590
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:28,856
It's made with Italian cowhide...

591
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:30,180
...and it's extremely light.

592
00:41:30,474 --> 00:41:32,756
I got it online for a bargain.

593
00:41:32,942 --> 00:41:34,954
-For how much?
-300,000 won.

594
00:41:35,053 --> 00:41:36,661
-300,000 won?
-Yes.

595
00:41:37,523 --> 00:41:39,380
Do smart office workers all have one?

596
00:41:39,742 --> 00:41:41,651
You can't lose out.

597
00:41:41,979 --> 00:41:43,571
Well? Isn't it pretty?

598
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:46,771
Why do you keep acting like my mom?

599
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:48,164
How so?

600
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,333
If you carry a torn fake leather bag...

601
00:41:50,533 --> 00:41:52,225
...and buy me an Italian cowhide bag,

602
00:41:52,316 --> 00:41:54,155
do you think I'd like it?

603
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:56,606
You meet a lot of people...

604
00:41:56,697 --> 00:41:58,868
...and sign deals.
It helps to look smart.

605
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:01,164
I don't want to be a son to you.

606
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:03,139
Let's not be like a family.

607
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,199
Can't we have fun and enjoy life?

608
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:07,167
-Okay?
-Honey.

609
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:09,677
Don't you like me anymore?

610
00:42:10,188 --> 00:42:12,852
You silly, I say this because I like you.

611
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:15,017
You silly thing.
You can be so infuriating.

612
00:42:16,564 --> 00:42:17,547
Kiss.

613
00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:25,262
Here.

614
00:42:26,204 --> 00:42:28,572
It's been a while since we kissed.

615
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,270
Here comes your wife.

616
00:42:48,642 --> 00:42:49,736
Dongman's fan.

617
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:51,471
His best friend.

618
00:42:51,562 --> 00:42:52,581
That's me.

619
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:55,048
What? You're Dongman's best friend?

620
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:56,560
Is it you then?

621
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,751
What?

622
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,274
We're all best friends to each other.

623
00:43:02,902 --> 00:43:04,647
Go on. He's waiting for you.

624
00:43:04,738 --> 00:43:07,604
-Go on.
-He's such a nuisance.

625
00:43:12,376 --> 00:43:14,380
Hello, morning sundae.

626
00:43:15,945 --> 00:43:18,295
Do you do business here
in the mornings too?

627
00:43:19,857 --> 00:43:22,485
You told me not to come and see you.

628
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:24,560
After all that yelling,

629
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,969
you came to see me the very next day.

630
00:43:28,177 --> 00:43:30,137
What? What?

631
00:43:30,337 --> 00:43:33,649
You're actually quite clingy.

632
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:39,251
-That hurts.
-Move.

633
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:43,628
Don't pretend to actually open up.

634
00:43:43,828 --> 00:43:45,118
What do you want?

635
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:48,755
Will you do it for me?

636
00:43:48,955 --> 00:43:50,065
Let's hear it first.

637
00:43:50,617 --> 00:43:52,032
Will you do it for me?

638
00:43:53,253 --> 00:43:54,197
Coach.

639
00:43:55,438 --> 00:43:57,643
Have a great day.

640
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,874
Go! Get lost!

641
00:44:02,447 --> 00:44:03,658
What are you doing?

642
00:44:04,212 --> 00:44:06,873
I bought those for 198,000 won
each to go with you.

643
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:08,913
Throw them away or sell them.
I don't care.

644
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:12,844
Gosh.

645
00:44:14,847 --> 00:44:17,806
You're such a nuisance. Do you know that?

646
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,743
You won't even grant me a simple wish.

647
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:23,744
You're a jerk, a traitor.

648
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:25,129
What time is it?

649
00:44:26,435 --> 00:44:28,892
You have eyes. See for yourself!

650
00:44:37,796 --> 00:44:40,498
Testing for the morning broadcast.

651
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:43,429
Testing for the morning broadcast.

652
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:46,219
It can be tough.

653
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,835
I'll come over and help you out sometimes.

654
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:51,429
My goodness.

655
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,744
You're here early, Miss Choi.

656
00:44:53,835 --> 00:44:55,004
Who is she?

657
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:57,490
Well, you see...

658
00:44:57,655 --> 00:44:59,199
I'm the new announcer.

659
00:45:02,771 --> 00:45:04,294
What's going on?

660
00:45:05,021 --> 00:45:06,284
What happened?

661
00:45:07,517 --> 00:45:08,719
Let's go outside.

662
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,524
-We'll talk outside.
-But...

663
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:15,306
Is there a problem? What's all this fuss?

664
00:45:16,557 --> 00:45:18,233
A recommendation
from the last announcer...

665
00:45:18,461 --> 00:45:21,008
...and the announcer academy...

666
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:24,021
For many complicated reasons, I had to...

667
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,043
...hire her as
the new internal broadcaster.

668
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,109
You said there would
definitely be an interview.

669
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:32,120
It's unfair to not give me a shot.

670
00:45:32,211 --> 00:45:35,001
This is about trust
between labor and management.

671
00:45:35,638 --> 00:45:36,810
Labor and management?

672
00:45:38,717 --> 00:45:40,993
Is there a labor union in our company?

673
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:42,743
What?

674
00:45:45,823 --> 00:45:47,892
This could be the catalyst...

675
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:51,078
...to a labor issue.

676
00:45:51,187 --> 00:45:55,189
-Be quiet.
-Why are you so thoughtless?

677
00:45:55,473 --> 00:45:57,968
Let's do an interview. Fairly.

678
00:45:58,168 --> 00:45:59,170
Let's go.

679
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:02,106
Thank you.

680
00:46:08,204 --> 00:46:09,219
I'm so tired.

681
00:46:10,675 --> 00:46:11,715
Sir.

682
00:46:12,555 --> 00:46:15,271
If you suddenly pass on your job to me...

683
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:16,408
Are you angry?

684
00:46:17,326 --> 00:46:18,966
That's not it.

685
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:22,075
Look. She wants to break up with me.

686
00:46:22,275 --> 00:46:24,112
Do you think I want to
kill mites right now?

687
00:46:24,312 --> 00:46:27,023
You did that to me last time too.
And again today...

688
00:46:27,223 --> 00:46:31,035
She wants to break up with me.
How could I not drink?

689
00:46:31,235 --> 00:46:32,799
You can drink. Sure.

690
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:37,230
But if we get double-booked and
the customer complains...

691
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:40,281
...like last time,
our branch will look bad.

692
00:46:40,481 --> 00:46:41,699
-Pull over.
-Sorry?

693
00:46:41,971 --> 00:46:43,481
Pull over.

694
00:46:45,366 --> 00:46:50,210
Doctor for You

695
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,843
Do you feel nauseated? Why did you...

696
00:46:59,934 --> 00:47:00,899
Dongman.

697
00:47:03,017 --> 00:47:05,930
Hey. Are you lecturing me?

698
00:47:09,106 --> 00:47:10,510
I'm sorry.

699
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,548
You clenched your teeth.

700
00:47:18,508 --> 00:47:21,279
Must I get your permission
to clench my teeth?

701
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:26,056
-No, right?
-Why you punk.

702
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:28,137
Hey.

703
00:47:29,657 --> 00:47:30,617
Do it again.

704
00:47:32,262 --> 00:47:33,254
Are you upset?

705
00:47:34,037 --> 00:47:35,127
Are you?

706
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:36,895
Clench your teeth again.

707
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,212
Clench your teeth again!

708
00:47:46,515 --> 00:47:48,480
I'm sorry. I'll be better.

709
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,189
Just quit then.

710
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,061
Please quit.

711
00:47:53,505 --> 00:47:55,276
I won't stop you!

712
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:06,747
Whatever! That punk.

713
00:48:06,947 --> 00:48:10,108
I came because you said it was mine.
I'm so annoyed.

714
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:13,797
So you talk to that jerk again.

715
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:16,915
Your husband got scared
once she brought up labor law.

716
00:48:17,115 --> 00:48:19,338
What's the use in owning
a department store?

717
00:48:19,538 --> 00:48:20,990
Take care of it!

718
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:34,508
The US has increased their
production of gasoline.

719
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:36,820
Thus, everyone is watching carefully...

720
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,723
...to see how it affects gas prices...

721
00:48:39,923 --> 00:48:41,880
...here in Korea.

722
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:45,978
Your enunciation is superb.
Just like an academy grad.

723
00:48:46,647 --> 00:48:50,430
Next. Do you have something prepared?

724
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:56,333
Please check out
the food section in the basement.

725
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:59,586
Domestic oxtail is on sale right now.

726
00:48:59,786 --> 00:49:02,342
For only 198,000 won per kg.
For a limited time only.

727
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:04,944
If you are planning
a trip abroad with your alums,

728
00:49:05,144 --> 00:49:08,114
you should hurry downstairs.
Don't miss out.

729
00:49:15,023 --> 00:49:17,856
I'd like to go with the oxtail sale.

730
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:19,534
Well, still,

731
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:22,063
a more professional feeling...

732
00:49:22,263 --> 00:49:23,872
Would discussing...

733
00:49:24,072 --> 00:49:26,466
...gas prices be very useful
in making announcements...

734
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:28,448
...at a department store?

735
00:49:28,648 --> 00:49:31,381
I believe knowing
the store is more important.

736
00:49:33,563 --> 00:49:35,160
Yunji, how old are you?

737
00:49:35,251 --> 00:49:38,333
I'm 23 years old. 23.

738
00:49:38,997 --> 00:49:40,442
I see.

739
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:42,790
I believe there was no age requirement.

740
00:49:43,686 --> 00:49:47,385
Then after adding up the various scores,

741
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:51,086
we'll go with Yunji.

742
00:49:51,386 --> 00:49:54,495
Miss Choi, you should
return to your post...

743
00:49:54,695 --> 00:49:57,054
...and work hard on
what you were assigned.

744
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:03,410
Okay.

745
00:50:04,045 --> 00:50:05,743
I should go back down.

746
00:50:07,067 --> 00:50:09,006
I didn't graduate
from an academy, I'm old,

747
00:50:09,097 --> 00:50:10,716
and have no connections, so naturally,

748
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:14,111
I should lose.

749
00:50:21,529 --> 00:50:23,058
You never...

750
00:50:25,283 --> 00:50:26,909
...should've bothered saying...

751
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:29,590
...you'd give me an interview.

752
00:50:50,238 --> 00:50:51,325
What are you looking at?

753
00:50:55,249 --> 00:50:58,112
May I have your attention, please?

754
00:50:58,466 --> 00:51:00,080
We are having...

755
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,198
...a special event on housewares.

756
00:51:02,743 --> 00:51:06,707
If you are interested,
please head to the event hall.

757
00:51:06,907 --> 00:51:10,085
Dad. Don't come here.

758
00:51:11,676 --> 00:51:14,489
Yes, madam. How may I help you?

759
00:51:14,689 --> 00:51:16,092
Where's the bathroom?

760
00:51:16,387 --> 00:51:18,549
-This way, madam.
-Thank you.

761
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:42,636
What's with you?

762
00:51:43,763 --> 00:51:45,890
I didn't even ask you to come this time.

763
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,107
Is something wrong?

764
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:53,978
I was passing by and
thought I'd eat with you.

765
00:51:57,039 --> 00:51:59,123
You wear this to make announcements too?

766
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:03,739
Did you make announcements today?

767
00:52:09,716 --> 00:52:10,712
You know me.

768
00:52:10,912 --> 00:52:12,976
I can't sit still all day long.

769
00:52:13,546 --> 00:52:17,035
I started getting stiff and felt so trapped.

770
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:18,380
I couldn't handle it.

771
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:20,595
So I quit.

772
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:29,706
My dad's too busy to come here anyway.
It's for the best.

773
00:52:46,347 --> 00:52:47,454
Why are you turning around?

774
00:52:50,286 --> 00:52:51,569
This is a fort.

775
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,057
My back is ridiculously wide.
No one can see you.

776
00:52:56,682 --> 00:52:57,632
So what?

777
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,053
Just cry.

778
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,352
You're funny.

779
00:53:08,671 --> 00:53:10,210
It isn't cool...

780
00:53:11,149 --> 00:53:13,244
...to act tough when you want to cry.

781
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:17,864
It's fine to cry when you want to.

782
00:53:20,654 --> 00:53:21,629
Who wants to cry?

783
00:53:25,276 --> 00:53:27,421
Why are people such jerks?

784
00:53:28,173 --> 00:53:30,242
How could they give and then take it away?

785
00:53:34,482 --> 00:53:35,962
You were so happy.

786
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:40,959
You were jumping for joy.
How could they do that?

787
00:53:46,213 --> 00:53:47,309
I'm so upset.

788
00:53:55,706 --> 00:53:56,981
Cover me well.

789
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:01,039
If anyone I know sees me, I'll just die.

790
00:54:25,472 --> 00:54:28,550
I really want to do it.

791
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,307
Why can't I ever get what I want?

792
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:02,529
It's tasty.

793
00:55:03,746 --> 00:55:07,626
You know how
I buy you sausages all the time?

794
00:55:08,459 --> 00:55:11,207
Did you tell your mom?

795
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,764
I did, but she still wants me to quit.

796
00:55:14,713 --> 00:55:16,552
-Why?
-I don't know.

797
00:55:21,894 --> 00:55:23,041
Did you get hit again?

798
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,009
Do 100 kicks.

799
00:55:32,998 --> 00:55:33,917
Gosh.

800
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:39,645
"Stupid?"

801
00:55:47,789 --> 00:55:50,063
You keep coming by.

802
00:55:51,366 --> 00:55:52,722
Coach, I got hit.

803
00:55:53,998 --> 00:55:55,295
You got hit? By whom?

804
00:55:56,323 --> 00:55:58,617
A jerk who ended
his service as a private...

805
00:55:58,817 --> 00:56:00,940
...kicked me in front
of a crowd of people.

806
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,438
And I got hit here
four times by a tiny fist.

807
00:56:04,964 --> 00:56:05,984
Gosh.

808
00:56:06,914 --> 00:56:11,341
Why are you both getting beaten up?
I'm so upset!

809
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:18,518
Here.

810
00:56:24,113 --> 00:56:26,454
Is that why you're here?

811
00:56:31,645 --> 00:56:33,788
-You can go if you want.
-Who was it?

812
00:56:33,879 --> 00:56:35,050
Want me to beat them up?

813
00:56:36,432 --> 00:56:37,709
Not that.

814
00:56:41,345 --> 00:56:42,375
You said it's at 8 PM.

815
00:56:45,096 --> 00:56:47,496
You'll go? Really?

816
00:56:49,077 --> 00:56:51,175
Sure. We can go. You said it's your wish.

817
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:54,213
You're not on the bus, right?

818
00:56:56,232 --> 00:56:58,132
There's no need to come.

819
00:56:59,298 --> 00:57:02,631
I quit because the PA room was too stuffy.

820
00:57:03,997 --> 00:57:04,855
Dinner?

821
00:57:06,235 --> 00:57:07,140
I'm eating now.

822
00:57:12,206 --> 00:57:13,922
Why are you asking what I'm eating?

823
00:57:14,122 --> 00:57:15,460
Like you'd know what it was.

824
00:57:17,761 --> 00:57:21,135
Why do you always ask what I eat, Dad?
It's annoying.

825
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:28,059
You're the one
who's making me feel annoyed.

826
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,047
Do you think I'm starving or something?

827
00:57:31,527 --> 00:57:33,809
You're always asking if I'm eating well.

828
00:57:34,828 --> 00:57:36,210
Every single time.

829
00:58:08,744 --> 00:58:09,593
This way.

830
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,688
This is the last of our
martial arts career together.

831
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:25,003
Let's have fun here and
close the book for good.

832
00:58:25,203 --> 00:58:28,558
You sound like you'll never see me again.

833
00:58:29,043 --> 00:58:31,611
Let's stop seeing each other
as coach and player.

834
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:32,939
Let's be friends now.

835
00:58:33,428 --> 00:58:35,306
What was that just now?

836
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:39,137
No. We can't be friends. Let's go.

837
00:58:39,927 --> 00:58:41,466
He's so pig-headed.

838
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,596
What do you think? Isn't it fun?

839
00:58:58,796 --> 00:58:59,837
Isn't it entertaining?

840
00:59:01,984 --> 00:59:03,769
Isn't your heart racing?

841
00:59:03,969 --> 00:59:06,010
Aren't you getting worked up?

842
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,663
When will it end? It's so long.

843
00:59:08,863 --> 00:59:09,858
Fine.

844
00:59:10,645 --> 00:59:11,940
There's one fight left.

845
00:59:12,985 --> 00:59:17,098
The kid coming up dominated
after just two years.

846
00:59:17,298 --> 00:59:19,118
He's got great legs...

847
00:59:20,461 --> 00:59:21,496
Anyway.

848
00:59:23,028 --> 00:59:24,830
Anyway, he does.

849
00:59:28,283 --> 00:59:29,283
Hey.

850
00:59:30,403 --> 00:59:32,371
Just watch. Okay?

851
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:34,166
Fine.

852
00:59:55,915 --> 00:59:58,573
Now, for the main event.

853
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:01,359
Here comes Kim Taksu!

854
01:00:05,807 --> 01:00:08,021
In the red corner,

855
01:00:08,221 --> 01:00:10,062
Taksu Kim!

856
01:00:43,577 --> 01:00:46,761
Watch how he's living now.

857
01:00:49,635 --> 01:00:50,962
You did stupid things together.

858
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,599
Why must you hang your head?

859
01:00:57,564 --> 01:00:58,643
Coach.

860
01:01:00,996 --> 01:01:03,078
Why are you being so cruel to me?

861
01:01:30,623 --> 01:01:35,000
Friends Dictionary Vocabulary One

862
01:01:38,142 --> 01:01:41,083
What are you doing?
I said not to touch me.

863
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:43,175
You're so ugly.

864
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:46,305
"You're so ugly" means...

865
01:01:48,832 --> 01:01:50,122
Darn it.

866
01:01:50,943 --> 01:01:53,783
Hey. What is this smell from your hair?

867
01:01:53,983 --> 01:01:55,229
Did you have pork ribs?

868
01:01:55,429 --> 01:01:57,588
You look like a hog too.

869
01:01:57,788 --> 01:01:59,343
That just means you're ugly.

870
01:01:59,543 --> 01:02:02,465
Hey. Stop touching my hair. I don't like it.

871
01:02:02,665 --> 01:02:03,845
I'll kill you.

872
01:02:04,045 --> 01:02:06,570
Must I know what you've eaten?

873
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:09,133
Gross. I'm going home.

874
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:16,075
Fight For My Way

875
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:17,822
Aera, let's go on a date tomorrow.

876
01:02:18,058 --> 01:02:19,751
I'll plan the entire evening.

877
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:22,488
Are you here to see me?

878
01:02:22,688 --> 01:02:25,187
-Are you afraid I'd make a comeback?
-You punk.

879
01:02:25,387 --> 01:02:26,797
Hey you, Kim Taksu!

880
01:02:26,888 --> 01:02:30,408
If we meet on the ring, you're dead.

881
01:02:30,608 --> 01:02:33,524
I'll feel better when I see you go in.

882
01:02:33,724 --> 01:02:34,720
Aera!

883
01:02:35,183 --> 01:02:36,259
Hey.

884
01:02:38,062 --> 01:02:39,893
Why are you in front of my house?

885
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:41,348
I'm going to date Aera officially.

886
01:02:41,548 --> 01:02:43,557
Guys and girls can't be friends.

887
01:02:43,757 --> 01:02:45,454
He and I are like siblings.

888
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:48,605
We aren't siblings.
