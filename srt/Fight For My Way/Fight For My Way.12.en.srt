1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,037
Choi Aera,

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,145
I like you so much.

3
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:08,666
It's driving me crazy.

4
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,022
I have always liked you,

5
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:16,608
you annoying brat!

6
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:30,103
If it's all or nothing,

7
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,033
let's make it "all".

8
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:35,561
What?

9
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,640
Do you want to...

10
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,745
Sleep over tonight?

11
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,746
Are you all right?

12
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:12,643
Let me see.

13
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:18,137
Oh, no.

14
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:21,228
Gosh, it's bleeding.

15
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:22,388
Yejin!

16
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:23,986
Yejin!

17
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,556
EPISODE 12

18
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,497
Be careful.

19
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:39,275
-Gosh.
-You scared me.

20
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,806
What is this?

21
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:42,833
Why did you come out of a closet?

22
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:45,182
Why are you here at this hour?

23
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,497
Is there something wrong if
I'm in front of my house?

24
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:50,841
What were you two doing in there?

25
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,973
Why did you come out from there?

26
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,982
It's the entrance to Namil Bar.

27
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,507
Their secret passage.

28
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:57,862
What?

29
00:01:58,144 --> 00:01:59,879
You knew about it?

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,391
I didn't say anything

31
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:04,762
about you guys going there.

32
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,046
Go ahead and have fun all you want.

33
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:11,297
Drink to your heart's content
while your liver still works.

34
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:15,521
Be innocent, reckless, and
free from all thoughts.

35
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:20,227
I'm telling you to play innocently
like children, not like adults.

36
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:22,543
Somehow I want to talk back.

37
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,954
I want to talk back to her.

38
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,505
After enjoying the moment,

39
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:28,968
go back to your own rooms.

40
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:30,159
Okay?

41
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,177
We just kissed up there.

42
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:33,288
Hey!

43
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:34,624
Hey...

44
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:41,872
Hold on.

45
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:44,654
Mom told me she would kick me out
if I bring guys over.

46
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:46,285
-No, I will just leave.
-Hold on.

47
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,030
She will leave soon.

48
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,235
-I will just tell her what happened.
-No, she has her eyes on me.

49
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:52,880
She would beat you if she sees you.

50
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,273
-Why would I get beaten up?
-Just stay here.

51
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:56,608
Yejin...

52
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:57,869
Yejin...

53
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:00,479
Open up.

54
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,105
Come in.

55
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,261
-Were you sleeping?
-Yes.

56
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,189
Why did you come so late?

57
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,621
I have to watch the drama.

58
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,728
It's airing already.

59
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:24,397
Are you going to watch it here?

60
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:29,222
Oh, my gosh!

61
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:31,271
I knew that would happen.

62
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:32,863
What a jerk!

63
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:34,022
He is sleeping out.

64
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:37,442
It's late, you should go.

65
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:48,684
The landlord doesn't have
the right to do this, does she?

66
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:50,327
That's true...

67
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:51,335
Then...

68
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:55,602
do tenants basically have
the right to trespass the rooftop?

69
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,747
She is being annoying again.

70
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:58,677
Hey...

71
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,025
I can hear you.

72
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:02,843
I think it's better for your son

73
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:07,887
to help you find a hobby, something
like mountain climbing or anything...

74
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:09,245
Enough. Go home.

75
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:10,593
Split up.

76
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,642
You...

77
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:22,003
Did you just tell him you
will come back after shower?

78
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,975
I can already read your mind.

79
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,348
By the way,

80
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:36,042
if someone tells you not to do something,
it makes you want to do it more.

81
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,284
What?

82
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:40,297
Do what? What are you talking about?

83
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:42,699
If Joseon wasn't
so strict and conservative,

84
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:46,924
people wouldn't have snuck
into the watermill.

85
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:48,580
In conclusion,

86
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,438
you might be the one setting
things on fire here.

87
00:04:55,748 --> 00:04:56,749
Go in.

88
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:00,640
You know what they did
at watermills, don't you?

89
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:04,900
Gosh.

90
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:06,448
These two...

91
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,247
I can see the resemblance.

92
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:10,019
What?

93
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,520
I can see the reason why
you, Madam Hwang...

94
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,216
are staying here.

95
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,869
That's my philtrum...

96
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,112
You have a unique taste.

97
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:27,605
You must like philtrum.

98
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,419
You should have stuck out your lips.

99
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,260
Your stomach seems like it
wants to say something.

100
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:43,067
What's wrong with this again?

101
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:48,492
Hey.

102
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:53,028
I'm not a reckless,
thoughtless airhead kid...

103
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,141
who stopped maturing before
puberty just like what you said.

104
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,844
We're dating now,

105
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,048
and we're sitting on a bed together.

106
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:04,507
I don't want...

107
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:07,933
to be a gentleman to you at all now.

108
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:09,890
You are...

109
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:13,007
So manly.

110
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:16,722
Yeah.

111
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:19,324
I want to be very manly to you.

112
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:22,936
But you know

113
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,206
this is not homework.

114
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,474
What?

115
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:30,612
Even without a turning point like this,

116
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:33,263
you are not Bigfoot to me.

117
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,301
You are a real girl to me.

118
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:40,843
I want to hold you now
and all night long.

119
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:42,994
I don't want to let you go home.

120
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,873
You should keep that kind
of thoughts to yourself.

121
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,387
So, tell your oversensitive
stomach to quiet down.

122
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,831
Just sleep.

123
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:13,915
I can't sleep with only
holding your hands.

124
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:16,165
I will hug you tight.

125
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,026
I need to do this much.

126
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:30,776
Sleep, you brat.

127
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:36,952
Hey...

128
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:41,787
I feel like I'm going to die now.

129
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,312
Is your stomach filled with gas?

130
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:49,564
Well,

131
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:52,007
I can't breathe.

132
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,231
And my heart is racing like crazy.

133
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:00,701
Your...

134
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,134
Your heart?

135
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:42,769
Mr Kim?

136
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:44,978
Mr Kim?

137
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,274
Mr Kim?

138
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,302
Mister...

139
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,657
Seolhui

140
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,241
Hey.

141
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,533
Isn't that your dad?

142
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,191
Why do people keep coming by
whenever I sleep with you?

143
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,348
Aera!

144
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:58,840
Are you here?

145
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:05,315
Get up.

146
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:06,917
Get up!

147
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,903
She just came here.

148
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:20,150
-Like 10 minutes ago?
-Yes.

149
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,355
I'm wearing this because
I was doing laundry.

150
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:30,512
What's wrong?

151
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,106
Juman

152
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:36,192
didn't come home.

153
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:44,261
What are you doing with that?

154
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,682
Why is this here?

155
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,350
-Why are you wearing workout clothes?
-Why?

156
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,647
Do you want to go too?

157
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,444
You can't even hit a girl anyway.

158
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:54,741
Are you planning to hit someone with this?

159
00:12:55,469 --> 00:12:57,604
I won't beat him up, so go to the gym.

160
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:00,543
-I can't say anything with you there.
-Are you going to curse again?

161
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,826
Then I can't at least
curse in this situation?

162
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,428
Then why do curses exist?

163
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,063
Darn it.

164
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,605
Yes, Coach.

165
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:11,774
I need to go somewhere today.

166
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,360
What?

167
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,195
What is it now?

168
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,531
Okay, I'm coming.

169
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,612
Is something up?

170
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:24,262
Nothing is up. So, you two go first.

171
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:25,888
You better not to cause trouble.

172
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:27,250
I'm confiscating this.

173
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,162
Let's go, Seolhui.

174
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:38,234
Why didn't you tell me sooner and
let it come into this state?

175
00:13:38,324 --> 00:13:40,034
You should've give him a lesson!

176
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:41,615
I was afraid.

177
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:44,069
What?

178
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,200
If I brought it up,

179
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:50,670
it really...

180
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:53,734
It really would have been a problem.

181
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:55,013
But I didn't have

182
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:57,301
the confidence to beat her.

183
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:58,770
Seolhui.

184
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,585
You are the girlfriend.
You shouldn't be the one afraid.

185
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:05,101
-You've been dating him for six years...
-Those six years of dating,

186
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:06,725
were all I had going for me,

187
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,513
but then I realized it was a weak point.

188
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:14,598
The time he spent with
me was dull and boring,

189
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,167
but it must be exciting with her.

190
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:21,438
If he leaves you after six years because
of those short bursts of excitement,

191
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,197
I won't let him have you again.

192
00:14:24,302 --> 00:14:25,303
Come on.

193
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:37,858
You don't know the apartment number?

194
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,322
I only heard that she lives here.

195
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:46,569
How could Juman...

196
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,722
He may not even be here.

197
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:51,578
I might be wrong.

198
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:54,105
Something else might have happened to him.

199
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:56,564
Then give that girl a call.

200
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:58,583
No. I don't want to.

201
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,000
Why not?

202
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,086
It hurts my pride.

203
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:08,225
Should I really do this?

204
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:11,789
After I watched Dongman's match,
he will be a star in no time.

205
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:12,890
What a nonsense.

206
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,884
If you search his name online,
that match you guys threw comes right up.

207
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:19,035
It's better to come clean first,

208
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,261
before you got exposed later.

209
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:23,988
Hyung.

210
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:27,693
I didn't do press conference
even 10 years ago.

211
00:15:27,783 --> 00:15:29,713
Why must I do this show now?

212
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,099
That way, you become the victim.

213
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,328
What?

214
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:37,939
If you use the media properly,
you can control the world.

215
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:48,849
Seolhui

216
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:05,319
Where am I?

217
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,835
What is going on?

218
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:12,973
Are you awake now?

219
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,710
Yejin, why didn't you wake me?

220
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,938
I tried after my mom left,
but you wouldn't get up.

221
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:22,886
You should've kicked me until I woke up.

222
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,831
I somehow ended up staying the night,

223
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:32,510
but I fell asleep here and you...

224
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,996
You must slept in your room and nothing...

225
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:39,199
Don't you remember last night?

226
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,086
Remember what?

227
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:45,179
I came to bring you a blanket,

228
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,707
and you...

229
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,080
What? Why won't you finish your sentence?

230
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,134
Well...

231
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:54,187
You suddenly hugged me.

232
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:59,853
The moment Juman walks out
of here, he is dead.

233
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:03,041
We are not sure yet.

234
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:04,826
Seolhui.

235
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,074
It's certain when he won't
answer his phone. Why...

236
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:09,296
I want to go home.

237
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:13,772
What are you afraid of?

238
00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:17,181
You can just dump Juman and
get along with your life.

239
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:20,219
You can work on personal development
and follow your dream.

240
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,777
What is my dream?

241
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,896
We can start figuring that out.

242
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:28,142
You're a good cook and
good with a curling iron.

243
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:29,600
I have a dream.

244
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,973
I always had one.

245
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:35,497
What nonsense are you talking about?

246
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,523
I didn't drink at all yesterday
and even when I do...

247
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:39,937
I never do that.

248
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:43,941
-Why are you over-reacting?
-Because you are lying.

249
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:47,594
You grabbed and pulled my
arm like this yesterday.

250
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:49,736
Then you hugged me, and...

251
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,743
You said, "Seolhui, get the light."

252
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:00,016
Then you feel asleep snoring.

253
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:02,684
That really hurt my pride.

254
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,624
42 missed calls

255
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,059
I have a dream.

256
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,330
I've always had one ever since I was 6.

257
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:21,527
Why do you think a man is
all that matters to me?

258
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,221
That's not what I meant.

259
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,169
While Dongman had Taekwondo
and you had your mic,

260
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:28,121
when you both looks shiny,

261
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:31,345
I quietly

262
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:34,424
kept my dream alive in my heart.

263
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,597
Why didn't you tell me?

264
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:39,813
Now you can achieve that
dream you've always had.

265
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:41,861
A mom.

266
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:46,467
My dream was to be a mom.

267
00:18:48,347 --> 00:18:49,306
What?

268
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:52,318
You know, I always play the role of
the mom everytime we play house.

269
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:54,978
Being a good mom

270
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,532
and a good wife

271
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,407
was my dream.

272
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:04,545
I want to marry Juman

273
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:07,337
and live like that.

274
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:10,747
Seolhui.

275
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:13,225
Does that not count as a dream?

276
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,374
Does everyone have to do
personal development?

277
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:20,539
You are all smart, and
you live for yourselves.

278
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:25,275
It would be okay
if I just focus on my family.

279
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,501
That doesn't make me inferior than you.

280
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:31,081
That's a great thing to do.

281
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,397
It's amazing, but...

282
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,635
Then find someone else.

283
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:36,310
To me, Juman

284
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:39,192
isn't just a boyfriend.

285
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,467
He is my world.

286
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,386
So...

287
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:49,756
So...

288
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:53,390
I just

289
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,703
want to go home.

290
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,619
What is your problem?

291
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:10,577
Why are you actually here?

292
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:14,513
I somehow...

293
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:20,531
I fell asleep before I knew it.

294
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:22,158
At the intern's home?

295
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:24,327
Are you

296
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:27,638
actually saying you slept here for real?

297
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,629
Seolhui, nothing happened.

298
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:32,706
Mr Kim...

299
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,735
He left a sock.

300
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:47,371
Why did you take a sock off?

301
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:48,761
Why?

302
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:54,365
Why did you took it off
if you fell asleep before you knew it?

303
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:56,142
Seolhui, it's not like...

304
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:02,139
I didn't cross the line.

305
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:03,931
Is that all you have to say?

306
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:07,320
Is everything fine and
perfect if nothing happened?

307
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:10,716
I really didn't do anything.

308
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:12,627
It's the same to me.

309
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:19,153
Whether you slept together or not,

310
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:21,590
it's the same.

311
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:23,784
What?

312
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:25,753
You were here all night,

313
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,703
and every second that
passed slowly killed me.

314
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:32,025
Seolhui...

315
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:35,295
-Let's...
-Seolhui, please.

316
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:39,489
Break up.

317
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:45,647
Seolhui's world...

318
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,164
Just crumbled.

319
00:22:01,052 --> 00:22:04,395
Kim Taksu Press Conference

320
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:05,519
Today,

321
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:08,200
here and now,

322
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,832
I will reveal the truth

323
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,456
about manipulation of game
results of my fight

324
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,039
against Ko Dongman in 2007.

325
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:22,009
I wanted to

326
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:28,640
hold back, cover it up,
and get on with my life,

327
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,728
but the money I gave as a favor

328
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:35,170
turned into a bribe or compensation.

329
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:38,687
I played fairly and yet,

330
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,031
I became a victim of a witch hunt and
in order to close my past history,

331
00:22:44,498 --> 00:22:45,763
I, Kim Taksu,

332
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:47,826
demand that Ko Dongman

333
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,238
accept my request

334
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:53,915
for a fair match.

335
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,301
As soon as possible...

336
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:03,408
Don't be rash.

337
00:23:03,498 --> 00:23:05,338
I know what you are thinking...

338
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:06,530
I won't do it.

339
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:08,151
What?

340
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:10,119
I won't fall for his games.

341
00:23:10,787 --> 00:23:13,105
I won't let him sway me.

342
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:17,007
You are all grown up now.

343
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:19,632
You said stupid people
need to rely on skills.

344
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,327
I will develop my skill

345
00:23:23,046 --> 00:23:24,592
and take him on next season.

346
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:26,807
Can you wait?

347
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,351
You are even worse than an impatient guy.

348
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,742
You have a temper.

349
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:32,829
Did you really mature now?

350
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:35,395
He also thinks I'm a kid now.

351
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,577
I will train hard and show him.

352
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:42,751
I'm no longer a tiger cub.

353
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,941
I'm a tiger.

354
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,831
Seolhui.

355
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,001
I shouldn't say this in these situation,

356
00:23:55,626 --> 00:23:57,007
but you were way cool.

357
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,453
It was the best of you
I've seen in over 20 years.

358
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,819
Why?

359
00:24:02,384 --> 00:24:04,830
-Because I said we should break up?
-No.

360
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:06,497
When you wanted to be a mom.

361
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:09,616
It's cool that your dream is to be a mom.

362
00:24:12,571 --> 00:24:15,574
To think about it, nobody is
more incredible than mothers.

363
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:27,981
Seolhui did my hair all 6 years
of elementary school.

364
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:35,993
Seolhui.

365
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:38,311
School doesn't start so early.

366
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:40,583
Why do you come here every morning?

367
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,703
Why?

368
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:45,452
Seolhui was my first female friend.

369
00:24:48,422 --> 00:24:50,635
My dad couldn't dress me up,

370
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:53,563
and no one wanted to
be a tomboy's friend.

371
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,030
Pink?

372
00:24:57,547 --> 00:24:59,582
I don't like pink.

373
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:04,679
After Seolhui found out
I didn't have a mom,

374
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,881
she started coming over an hour earlier.

375
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,045
Armed with a kind heart.

376
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,459
Since you don't have a mom,

377
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:18,195
I will do your hair for you.

378
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:20,286
Seolhui

379
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,148
was like the vast sea.

380
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:36,167
Juman has lost his mind.

381
00:25:36,257 --> 00:25:37,448
Did they do it?

382
00:25:37,962 --> 00:25:40,542
Do you think that matters?

383
00:25:41,898 --> 00:25:42,932
Did they do it?

384
00:25:43,477 --> 00:25:44,328
Hey!

385
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,542
Let's say some unavoidable
situation led you

386
00:25:47,632 --> 00:25:49,479
to spending the night at Hyeran's place.

387
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,829
And I slept only there, like in the army?

388
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,799
Do you think I should
let you off or slap you hard?

389
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,090
Did I just sleep?

390
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:02,231
Let's say that I slept in
some other place then.

391
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:06,081
I will slap you hard.
I will hit your head and punch it.

392
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:09,515
Let's pay now.

393
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:15,886
Kim Taksu must have been so stressed.

394
00:26:15,976 --> 00:26:18,533
I guess so. I'm a fan of his.

395
00:26:20,282 --> 00:26:21,383
Poor guy.

396
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:25,859
You won't do it, right?

397
00:26:26,623 --> 00:26:27,624
Right?

398
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:32,960
I have to fight him one day.

399
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,782
Don't do that even if it's some other day.

400
00:26:35,872 --> 00:26:37,219
I don't like the idea.

401
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:39,035
I hate Kim Taksu so much.

402
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:42,555
I saw what happened
during your last fight.

403
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:45,649
I really don't like the idea, okay?

404
00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:50,450
I will win then.

405
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:52,896
I won't lose to him again.

406
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:55,997
Hey, Ko Dongman.

407
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:57,567
Am I a pushover?

408
00:26:58,595 --> 00:27:00,663
Do you know how much I like you?

409
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:03,760
-What?
-I like you so much

410
00:27:04,324 --> 00:27:06,520
that if someone were to
shoot you three times.

411
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,506
I will take two bullets.

412
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:13,230
Why not three?

413
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,213
Then I wouldn't be telling the truth.
I would be lying.

414
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:18,362
But I'm telling the truth.

415
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:21,830
I can't take all the burden for you,

416
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,387
but I will take two out of
three bullets in your life

417
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:27,352
for you.

418
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,905
I will protect you.

419
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:33,365
Hey.

420
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:35,924
Why are you

421
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:37,741
so great?

422
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:40,987
I like you this much,
so please do as I say.

423
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:43,154
Can you not do it?

424
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:48,662
Aera.

425
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,626
I don't want you

426
00:27:52,432 --> 00:27:54,297
to always protect me.

427
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:57,525
I'm going to become very strong,

428
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:02,132
and make nobody can mistreat you

429
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:05,567
as my girlfriend.

430
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,013
Can you trust me?

431
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:12,215
IF GROWING UP MEANS
I'M LOSING MY DREAM, THEN I...

432
00:28:12,305 --> 00:28:13,339
Can you?

433
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:23,125
I will take those.

434
00:28:27,114 --> 00:28:29,990
Why did you come pick me up?
Don't you have work?

435
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:31,856
I came back from work.

436
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:32,937
Dressed like that?

437
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,616
Sure, you did.

438
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:43,324
Wait for me.

439
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:45,317
Are we strangers?

440
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:53,871
Goodness! All you do is drink.

441
00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:10,933
Is this a junk shop?

442
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:13,204
Throw this away.

443
00:29:13,463 --> 00:29:14,358
Gosh.

444
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,441
Aren't you going to work?

445
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:20,116
You said you're on a business trip.

446
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:21,707
What about you?

447
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:25,841
Why are you wearing
track pants during the day?

448
00:29:26,615 --> 00:29:27,783
You don't work, right?

449
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,238
You stay at home, right?

450
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,411
I do work.

451
00:29:32,721 --> 00:29:34,855
What are you doing while
wearing track pants?

452
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,785
Why are you at home during the day then?

453
00:29:40,782 --> 00:29:43,104
I came out to pick you up.

454
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:47,037
You haven't been here,
so you don't know where it is.

455
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:48,458
Aren't you going to get married?

456
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:50,521
You are starting it again.

457
00:29:50,611 --> 00:29:51,651
Right.

458
00:29:52,854 --> 00:29:56,057
If you wanted to get married
and feed your family,

459
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:59,979
you will be doing all sorts of work now.

460
00:30:00,802 --> 00:30:02,294
You are getting older,

461
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,235
but you don't even have a plan yet.

462
00:30:04,695 --> 00:30:05,546
Dad.

463
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,628
I'm not getting married.

464
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:09,871
So, don't think about those yet.

465
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:11,246
Why won't you get married?

466
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:13,757
I don't have a house nor a stable job.

467
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:17,537
Who would want to get married
to a thoughtless guy?

468
00:30:17,627 --> 00:30:21,600
Not everybody starts off
with a huge house.

469
00:30:22,047 --> 00:30:23,292
During my time,

470
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,942
while lazy guys like you
complained about your lives,

471
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:29,894
I did construction and laid out bricks.

472
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:33,807
You must have been so
earnest and not lazy,

473
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:37,203
but you never once paid
for my tuition or rent.

474
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,069
Don't tell me to live like you.

475
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:42,240
But still,

476
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:44,605
I was penniless

477
00:30:44,997 --> 00:30:47,047
and still raised my children
with everything I had.

478
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,926
Should I live like that
and have a child like me?

479
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,175
I'm not so sure about that.

480
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:56,242
Because my child might
resent me for being so poor.

481
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,447
What?

482
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:02,001
Who said you were poor?

483
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,695
Gosh.

484
00:31:14,925 --> 00:31:17,551
From Baek Seolhui

485
00:31:27,415 --> 00:31:30,491
Organic Bellflower Roots Extract

486
00:31:58,607 --> 00:32:00,309
Seolhui, I'm sorry.

487
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,545
Can you pack my things?

488
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,793
Seolhui, I really made a mistake that day.

489
00:32:11,691 --> 00:32:13,193
It was just a mistake.

490
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:15,279
It's not a mistake.

491
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,038
It's not just one day.

492
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:21,473
You put your phone
to silent mode every night.

493
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:27,539
Whenever she texted and
your phone lighted up,

494
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:31,785
I felt like my heart
dropped to the ground.

495
00:32:32,969 --> 00:32:35,312
How do you think I felt

496
00:32:36,148 --> 00:32:39,557
when I knew you were going to see her,
but I still let you go?

497
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:42,376
She got involved in a car accident.

498
00:32:42,466 --> 00:32:44,408
She was drunk the other time.

499
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:46,015
It bothers you, right?

500
00:32:47,703 --> 00:32:49,417
You couldn't ignore her, could you?

501
00:32:52,685 --> 00:32:53,786
Juman...

502
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:56,607
You...

503
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:00,177
Let go of my hand first.

504
00:33:01,676 --> 00:33:03,199
Please, Seolhui.

505
00:33:03,683 --> 00:33:04,894
Please...

506
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:08,739
-Please...
-You might think I'd always be here

507
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:13,123
even if you let go of me for a moment,
but I don't want to

508
00:33:17,302 --> 00:33:18,666
stay that way anymore.

509
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:23,038
I thought it would pass by like the wind.

510
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:25,968
But wind is just wind.

511
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:28,101
It was either a yes or no.

512
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:30,978
It wasn't about how big the problem was.

513
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:33,659
I was an idiot.

514
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:37,259
Why are you doing this?
You are not like this.

515
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,323
Why are you being so cruel?

516
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,051
You are only doing this
because you are mad.

517
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:43,995
During our six years of dating,

518
00:33:44,463 --> 00:33:48,487
I never said I want to
broke up with you out of anger.

519
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:54,300
I treated you the best I could,
so I have no regrets.

520
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,732
The regret is yours.

521
00:34:01,894 --> 00:34:03,011
Leave my things

522
00:34:03,564 --> 00:34:04,709
outside.

523
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:39,048
What is that?

524
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,980
Congratulations for your
first day starting today.

525
00:34:44,837 --> 00:34:46,681
It's the first day of your independence.

526
00:34:48,238 --> 00:34:50,207
Blow out the candle.

527
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:03,125
Hurry. Blow it out.

528
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:05,777
Blow it and just forget about it.

529
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:07,536
You're not supposed to do it.

530
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:11,902
You're not supposed to
do things like this.

531
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,331
What?

532
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,515
I...

533
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,759
Can't blow it out.

534
00:35:19,432 --> 00:35:21,249
You should not have done this.

535
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,987
Seolhui.

536
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:25,734
Juman...

537
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:27,487
He...

538
00:35:30,082 --> 00:35:32,384
How could he do this to you?

539
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:34,035
Juman...

540
00:35:34,595 --> 00:35:35,997
He cried.

541
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,773
He cried earlier.

542
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,181
Why did you do that?

543
00:35:57,911 --> 00:35:59,600
You don't get easily swayed.

544
00:36:00,303 --> 00:36:02,342
You love Seolhui so much.

545
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:10,038
Don't pour yourself a drink.

546
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,763
Why would you make Seolhui cry, you jerk?

547
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,220
You crazy jerk.

548
00:36:41,044 --> 00:36:42,779
You have to beg her.

549
00:36:48,432 --> 00:36:49,966
Goodness.

550
00:36:58,404 --> 00:36:59,318
Hello?

551
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:01,302
Yes, Mom.

552
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,651
1,200,000 won?

553
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,235
Dad spent 1,200,000 won at a bar?

554
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,280
Yeah. He's not answering
his phone either.

555
00:37:09,566 --> 00:37:11,904
I wonder what happened.

556
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,813
He would never drink
such expensive alcohol.

557
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:20,218
I wonder if someone stole his wallet.

558
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,003
Mom, the text mentioned
the bar's name, right?

559
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:24,678
Can you send it to me?

560
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:26,514
Okay.

561
00:37:36,105 --> 00:37:37,712
Ko Hyungshik...

562
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,301
You need to wake up.

563
00:37:41,114 --> 00:37:42,312
Sir.

564
00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:44,932
You were too drunk,

565
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,890
so I paid with my card...

566
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:50,749
Charge it.

567
00:37:52,746 --> 00:37:53,766
Mr Ko.

568
00:37:54,536 --> 00:37:55,934
Do you know

569
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,515
why I cut off all the young men

570
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,335
and brought you in?

571
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,133
You said you've worked
in the field for 30 years?

572
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:10,183
Then you need to bring
your network to good use.

573
00:38:10,273 --> 00:38:14,279
You still have too much pride left in you.

574
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:17,436
You are so detached from everything.

575
00:38:19,148 --> 00:38:20,283
Mr Ko.

576
00:38:21,824 --> 00:38:23,379
Mr Ko Hyungshik...

577
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:27,663
Why aren't you answering me?

578
00:38:31,423 --> 00:38:32,334
Yes, sir.

579
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:35,218
I will change my ways.

580
00:38:40,246 --> 00:38:42,715
Just quit, why don't you?

581
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,958
I won't beg you to stay.

582
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:47,487
I'm sorry, sir. I won't do it again.

583
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:52,170
You said you have to marry off your son.

584
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:55,333
You need to come to your senses.

585
00:38:56,297 --> 00:38:57,298
Got it?

586
00:39:15,322 --> 00:39:16,664
My dad has never

587
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:20,038
kept the same pace as his family.

588
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:24,097
Wait for me!

589
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:26,736
Hurry up.

590
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:28,869
We have to hurry to get seats.

591
00:39:29,504 --> 00:39:30,360
Gosh.

592
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:33,187
Are you okay?

593
00:39:34,882 --> 00:39:37,225
-What is wrong with you?
-I'm sorry.

594
00:39:38,408 --> 00:39:39,390
Gosh.

595
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,359
I'm sorry. My kid gets motion sickness.

596
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,230
Hurry, hurry up!

597
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,490
Here.

598
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:46,989
Oh, my goodness.

599
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:52,896
-Hold tight.
-Oh my God.

600
00:39:55,123 --> 00:39:56,291
What should we do?

601
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,764
Here.

602
00:39:58,205 --> 00:40:00,018
Clinic

603
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,503
Excuse me! Open the door!

604
00:40:02,593 --> 00:40:03,664
Open the door!

605
00:40:03,754 --> 00:40:06,706
My kid has a fever!

606
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,458
He might die.

607
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:11,502
Please call the doctor.

608
00:40:21,715 --> 00:40:22,716
Dad.

609
00:40:27,162 --> 00:40:28,918
Have a drink with your son.

610
00:40:48,965 --> 00:40:50,466
What are you doing?

611
00:40:50,984 --> 00:40:52,586
Where are you taking that?

612
00:40:52,802 --> 00:40:55,131
Just trust me and follow me.

613
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:04,341
Hurry up.

614
00:41:13,524 --> 00:41:15,893
Hey, what are you doing?

615
00:41:16,218 --> 00:41:17,386
Are you out of your mind?

616
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:52,412
We are not homeless.

617
00:41:52,836 --> 00:41:54,270
Why would you drink outside?

618
00:41:56,298 --> 00:41:57,273
Why are we here?

619
00:41:57,363 --> 00:41:59,309
Just sit down.

620
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:02,402
There is no other place
like this in Seoul.

621
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:10,300
I didn't know you could can cook this.

622
00:42:11,051 --> 00:42:11,986
Gosh.

623
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:14,413
Of course, I can.

624
00:42:14,768 --> 00:42:15,616
Dad,

625
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:18,230
your son have been living
alone for ten years.

626
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:22,499
Did you drink somewhere else before this?

627
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:25,759
Don't ruin the nice mood.

628
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:28,018
Just try this.

629
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:34,511
Don't feed me.

630
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:36,423
I have hands too.

631
00:42:58,879 --> 00:42:59,755
Dad.

632
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:01,740
What was

633
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:04,963
your dream?

634
00:43:06,476 --> 00:43:08,232
What nonsense are you talking about?

635
00:43:08,322 --> 00:43:09,857
I never had such a thing.

636
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,528
I'm sure you must have had
a dream in the past.

637
00:43:15,848 --> 00:43:17,116
Not really.

638
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,591
You had it. I can tell.

639
00:43:21,587 --> 00:43:22,688
What was it?

640
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,249
Tell me. What was it?

641
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:29,025
Well...

642
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:31,478
Well...

643
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:33,814
A pilot.

644
00:43:34,377 --> 00:43:35,412
A pilot?

645
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:39,820
There was a movie called "The Red Scarf".
I shouldn't have watched it.

646
00:43:40,187 --> 00:43:42,260
I suffered so much because of it.

647
00:43:42,595 --> 00:43:44,564
I was dying to become a pilot.

648
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:47,110
That's really cool.

649
00:43:47,427 --> 00:43:48,659
You should have tried it.

650
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:49,955
Why didn't you go for it?

651
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:53,133
We couldn't afford the Air Force Academy.

652
00:43:55,525 --> 00:43:57,160
But now,

653
00:43:58,672 --> 00:43:59,973
you guys are my dream.

654
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:10,150
Dad.

655
00:44:11,685 --> 00:44:13,153
I thought

656
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:17,257
you were always just a dad.

657
00:44:19,466 --> 00:44:21,301
Now that I know you had a dream,

658
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:24,844
it feels kind of weird.

659
00:44:27,327 --> 00:44:28,287
Somehow,

660
00:44:28,935 --> 00:44:30,446
I feel bad.

661
00:44:31,323 --> 00:44:32,555
My glass is empty.

662
00:44:32,645 --> 00:44:34,299
Enough nonsense. Just fill my glass.

663
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,390
I worked so hard to raise you,

664
00:44:43,844 --> 00:44:46,613
and now you are finally
pouring me drinks, you brat.

665
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:49,398
You are just like me.

666
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,226
You are stubborn, too.

667
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:54,662
Dad.

668
00:44:55,996 --> 00:44:57,030
Just wait.

669
00:44:58,298 --> 00:44:59,204
Although,

670
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,994
I can't help you become a pilot,

671
00:45:02,643 --> 00:45:05,813
but I will let you ride first
class on a plane one day.

672
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:09,762
That's the closest to the cockpit.

673
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:12,813
Crazy brat.

674
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:15,139
Sir...

675
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:18,015
Oh, my! Aera...

676
00:45:19,693 --> 00:45:21,962
I didn't think I would get to see you.

677
00:45:23,857 --> 00:45:26,603
Can't you smile like that for me too?

678
00:45:26,693 --> 00:45:29,129
Do you like Aera more than your son?

679
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,667
It's no fun when two boring guys drink.

680
00:45:31,757 --> 00:45:33,607
I need to join to become
the life of the party.

681
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:34,776
Not really...

682
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:37,667
He even scooped up the yolk for me.

683
00:45:37,757 --> 00:45:38,758
Did he?

684
00:45:42,817 --> 00:45:43,668
By the way,

685
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:45,537
have you two

686
00:45:47,214 --> 00:45:48,553
done it yet?

687
00:45:53,987 --> 00:45:56,647
Do what?

688
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:00,304
I told you two and Seolhui

689
00:46:00,394 --> 00:46:02,516
to start saving up money together.

690
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:06,582
Who needs the bank? She's the best.

691
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:08,957
Right.

692
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:10,439
Savings...

693
00:46:10,804 --> 00:46:12,782
She is, she is the best...

694
00:46:12,872 --> 00:46:14,194
Are you not going to do it?

695
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,351
Hwang Jangho's Gym

696
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,626
What is this?

697
00:46:18,716 --> 00:46:19,872
Is it a warehouse?

698
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:21,133
Well...

699
00:46:21,424 --> 00:46:23,567
My job is here.

700
00:46:25,525 --> 00:46:26,978
"Hwang Jangho's Gym"?

701
00:46:27,068 --> 00:46:29,437
Isn't Jangho that man?

702
00:46:34,381 --> 00:46:36,119
Sir, I'm the one that talked him into it.

703
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:37,620
It's not his fault.

704
00:46:38,051 --> 00:46:39,186
Coach...

705
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:48,091
Sir...

706
00:46:48,488 --> 00:46:50,670
You can have some snacks

707
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,302
while watching some of
Dongman's videos...

708
00:46:53,735 --> 00:46:55,692
You must be surprised, Dad.

709
00:46:58,778 --> 00:47:00,647
I think I will just leave.

710
00:47:14,735 --> 00:47:15,753
So,

711
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:19,464
you always wear track pants
because this is your job.

712
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,761
Dad, I might not be earning
a huge amount of money now,

713
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:25,022
but if you would have faith...

714
00:47:25,112 --> 00:47:26,113
Dongman.

715
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:28,348
I didn't live like this.

716
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:32,475
I went to work early in the morning

717
00:47:32,565 --> 00:47:33,852
and came home late.

718
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:35,260
I worked and slept.

719
00:47:35,749 --> 00:47:36,982
That's all I ever did.

720
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:40,727
I know that you worked
hard all your life.

721
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:44,641
So, I know you don't like

722
00:47:44,731 --> 00:47:46,902
that I don't live like you, but...

723
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:47,993
But...

724
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:51,071
Don't live like me.

725
00:47:53,459 --> 00:47:54,345
What?

726
00:47:57,144 --> 00:47:59,112
I've thought it over.

727
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:02,216
If to live like me,

728
00:48:03,784 --> 00:48:05,285
I wouldn't have liked it.

729
00:48:06,353 --> 00:48:08,489
It's too late for me to become a pilot,

730
00:48:09,189 --> 00:48:10,276
but you are

731
00:48:11,057 --> 00:48:13,185
young enough to try something new.

732
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:16,318
So...

733
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,535
Just live however you want.

734
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:25,372
Really?

735
00:48:27,374 --> 00:48:29,176
Can I really live however you want?

736
00:48:29,676 --> 00:48:31,111
Although you keep sighing?

737
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:33,480
It's because I'm pathetic.

738
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:38,591
You couldn't do what you
wanted for all these years,

739
00:48:39,553 --> 00:48:41,088
and it breaks my heart.

740
00:48:43,555 --> 00:48:47,027
Why does it break your heart?
I always had fun.

741
00:48:47,514 --> 00:48:48,816
You know how I am.

742
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,031
Because

743
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:53,801
your dad's business failed,

744
00:48:54,835 --> 00:48:56,203
you wasted your precious youth.

745
00:48:56,883 --> 00:48:58,451
You took care of Donghee.

746
00:49:00,307 --> 00:49:02,576
I feel like you took all the burden

747
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:06,146
and gave up on your own life.

748
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:10,490
When I look at you,

749
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:12,317
my heart...

750
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:14,480
Darn it.

751
00:49:17,805 --> 00:49:19,873
Stop being silly.

752
00:49:21,228 --> 00:49:22,496
But seeing you

753
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,098
do this,

754
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,202
I feel like I can breathe again.

755
00:49:28,502 --> 00:49:32,770
I'm so excited that my heart is racing.

756
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,032
I didn't give up on
my dream because of you.

757
00:49:39,012 --> 00:49:41,215
You need to let it go.

758
00:49:43,082 --> 00:49:44,117
Dongman,

759
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:46,426
your family isn't poor.

760
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,666
I am going to earn money
for 20 more years.

761
00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:52,659
Your dad has got your back,

762
00:49:53,394 --> 00:49:54,895
so fly high.

763
00:49:57,006 --> 00:50:00,047
Let me fly first class thanks to my son.

764
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:04,304
You can't save your youth anyway.

765
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:05,555
Just fight,

766
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:07,079
and take challenges.

767
00:50:07,169 --> 00:50:08,476
Even if you get beaten up,

768
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:12,079
live your life however you want, okay?

769
00:50:17,437 --> 00:50:19,505
Okay. You live in yeonggi-do...

770
00:50:19,854 --> 00:50:24,074
Characters in TV dramas get sick after a
breakup and stay in bed all day long.

771
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:26,389
But as for me,

772
00:50:27,076 --> 00:50:28,594
I broke up yesterday,

773
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:30,441
and I'm smiling today.

774
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:33,918
I hope you have a nice and happy day.

775
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,172
Okay.

776
00:50:35,476 --> 00:50:36,608
You, too.

777
00:50:37,504 --> 00:50:38,364
Pardon?

778
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:40,122
I hope you will be happy too.

779
00:51:04,024 --> 00:51:05,177
I really

780
00:51:05,717 --> 00:51:08,074
feel sorry to you.

781
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:14,367
But my feelings for him are sincere,

782
00:51:15,709 --> 00:51:18,504
and I really want to date him.

783
00:51:20,707 --> 00:51:22,609
I feel really bad

784
00:51:23,784 --> 00:51:25,455
and guilty to you.

785
00:51:25,545 --> 00:51:27,434
Do whatever you want.

786
00:51:27,988 --> 00:51:30,290
It's not like Juman and I are married.

787
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:32,959
He can date you after breaking up with me.

788
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,874
There is no need to tell me.

789
00:51:36,442 --> 00:51:37,610
Eonni...

790
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,537
Still, I'm very sorry.

791
00:51:40,627 --> 00:51:41,795
But Yejin...

792
00:51:49,576 --> 00:51:50,587
Now...

793
00:51:51,228 --> 00:51:53,296
I'm allowed to throw water on you, right?

794
00:51:53,386 --> 00:51:56,581
It was one thing when you didn't know,
but this time you knew,

795
00:51:57,438 --> 00:51:58,439
and that's really,

796
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:01,221
really an evil thing.

797
00:52:01,902 --> 00:52:02,775
Eonni.

798
00:52:03,823 --> 00:52:04,954
Still,

799
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:07,728
I hope one day,

800
00:52:08,721 --> 00:52:10,723
you will be in my shoes.

801
00:52:11,236 --> 00:52:13,871
I hope many tears
pour out from those eyes

802
00:52:13,961 --> 00:52:15,903
that claim to be clueless and innocent.

803
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:18,659
Even if you are upset, how could you

804
00:52:19,173 --> 00:52:20,407
say something so mean?

805
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:22,654
You know,

806
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:26,313
Juman liked me a lot.

807
00:52:29,401 --> 00:52:30,911
It wasn't like

808
00:52:31,451 --> 00:52:34,614
the vague excitement
he feels towards you now.

809
00:52:35,322 --> 00:52:36,790
He liked me like crazy.

810
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,493
He was crazy about me.

811
00:52:41,915 --> 00:52:43,292
Those moments

812
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,617
when I was immature and cute like you.

813
00:52:47,034 --> 00:52:48,836
Those passionate moments...

814
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:51,573
Juman

815
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:54,308
remembers them all.

816
00:52:58,645 --> 00:53:00,781
If you do go out with him,

817
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:05,498
I sincerely hope

818
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,992
those memories will haunt you forever.

819
00:53:25,806 --> 00:53:28,623
He said to wait one minute.
Where did he go?

820
00:53:30,389 --> 00:53:31,337
Dad!

821
00:53:35,863 --> 00:53:37,061
Call me when you get home.

822
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,059
-Let's talk once in a while, okay?
-Sure.

823
00:53:55,717 --> 00:53:57,838
He won't look back even once.

824
00:54:21,728 --> 00:54:22,820
Gosh.

825
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,045
He is so lame.

826
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:28,268
Whom does he take after?

827
00:54:33,626 --> 00:54:35,929
When did he clean the place?

828
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,132
Buy a new chair.

829
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:07,536
My dad is so lame.

830
00:55:11,715 --> 00:55:12,625
Just fight,

831
00:55:13,107 --> 00:55:14,096
and take challenges.

832
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,299
Even if you get beaten up,

833
00:55:16,124 --> 00:55:19,052
live your life however you want, okay?

834
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:33,795
What is with that face?
You are scaring me.

835
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:35,281
Coach.

836
00:55:36,136 --> 00:55:38,071
What? What is it now?

837
00:55:38,324 --> 00:55:39,344
I will just

838
00:55:39,854 --> 00:55:41,434
stop pretending to be mature.

839
00:55:42,629 --> 00:55:44,191
I want to do it my way.

840
00:55:45,491 --> 00:55:47,136
What are you trying to say?

841
00:55:47,226 --> 00:55:48,260
You know,

842
00:55:48,894 --> 00:55:50,429
for the past ten years,

843
00:55:50,951 --> 00:55:54,254
my mind always go back to
2007, November 3rd, every single day.

844
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:58,635
Whenever I saw that jerk Taksu succeed,

845
00:55:58,725 --> 00:56:01,615
I regretted it and clenched
my teeth in anger.

846
00:56:02,032 --> 00:56:04,791
I went crazy in here every single day.

847
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:06,791
So don't tell me

848
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,780
to wait any longer

849
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,613
or take the long way.

850
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,065
Hey,

851
00:56:13,155 --> 00:56:15,278
you said you knew why he was doing that?

852
00:56:15,368 --> 00:56:16,218
Coach.

853
00:56:16,786 --> 00:56:19,056
I may be unable to hit
Dooho when he's hurt,

854
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:22,314
but I will kill Taksu
even if he hurts a little.

855
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:25,820
I may tap out when sparring against you,

856
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:30,257
but I will fight until
I die against Taksu.

857
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:32,159
So please,

858
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:35,817
help me to be released from
that day ten years ago.

859
00:56:36,417 --> 00:56:37,485
Let me...

860
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:41,335
Let's just fight him, please.

861
00:56:43,203 --> 00:56:44,491
You better do it right.

862
00:56:45,783 --> 00:56:48,400
Beat Taksu properly.

863
00:56:57,563 --> 00:56:58,471
Aera!

864
00:57:05,473 --> 00:57:06,474
What is it?

865
00:57:07,395 --> 00:57:10,104
You are scaring me. Why are
you all worked up again?

866
00:57:10,547 --> 00:57:11,392
Aera,

867
00:57:11,802 --> 00:57:12,976
I'm going to do it.

868
00:57:13,692 --> 00:57:15,876
I'm going to fight Taksu no matter what.

869
00:57:17,743 --> 00:57:18,810
You will lose.

870
00:57:19,258 --> 00:57:20,696
He knows you'll lose, so...

871
00:57:20,786 --> 00:57:22,219
Who cares if I lose?

872
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:26,419
-What?
-I'm not doing this to beat him.

873
00:57:26,803 --> 00:57:29,481
I'm finally doing what
I have been dying to do.

874
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:31,226
I have only to fly.

875
00:57:31,316 --> 00:57:34,319
No one can beat someone
who is having fun.

876
00:57:35,715 --> 00:57:38,118
If growing up means
I'm losing my dream, then I...

877
00:57:39,598 --> 00:57:41,333
I will give up on growing up.

878
00:57:42,122 --> 00:57:43,057
What?

879
00:57:43,441 --> 00:57:46,283
There is no need to pretend
to be grown up for others.

880
00:57:47,366 --> 00:57:49,263
You save it, you lose it.

881
00:57:50,382 --> 00:57:52,582
So that's why

882
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,796
I rushed here to say this to you.

883
00:57:57,362 --> 00:57:58,357
What now?

884
00:57:59,091 --> 00:57:59,956
It's just...

885
00:58:00,531 --> 00:58:03,208
To frankly say what I want...

886
00:58:03,984 --> 00:58:05,085
Say what?

887
00:58:08,522 --> 00:58:09,656
I love you.

888
00:58:11,804 --> 00:58:14,071
I love you so much I could die.

889
00:58:15,645 --> 00:58:18,325
Like crazy, like an immature kid...

890
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,874
I love you.

891
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:24,723
I love you, Aera.

892
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:31,682
Me too.

893
00:58:41,193 --> 00:58:42,441
I love you, too.

894
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:44,822
You immature brat.

895
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,013
Man...

896
00:58:53,104 --> 00:58:55,269
Choi Aera, I...

897
00:58:59,276 --> 00:59:00,757
I love you like crazy!

898
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,499
I love you, Choi Aera!

899
00:59:35,387 --> 00:59:36,243
Oppa...

900
00:59:38,314 --> 00:59:39,518
Hyungshik-oppa.
