1
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:03,041
I'll see you all later.

2
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:07,453
Hey you.

3
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:11,419
Dongman may be a moron,

4
00:00:12,118 --> 00:00:14,161
but you know I've got his back,
and I am tough.

5
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:16,419
Me too.

6
00:00:20,743 --> 00:00:21,745
Look.

7
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:24,233
Please keep your nose out of it.

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,551
I will always keep my nose in it,

9
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:30,595
so take me down first
if you want to get to him.

10
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:32,422
Take me down too.

11
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:36,683
You will have to shoot me first.

12
00:00:37,507 --> 00:00:40,003
Aera. Good luck.

13
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:42,571
Try your very best.

14
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:47,091
See you.

15
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,497
Episode 5

16
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:15,948
Dongman, I really missed you.

17
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,222
Goodness.

18
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:28,655
Coach Hwang

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,161
Dongman, that fool.

20
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:38,963
What if he falls for it again?

21
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:46,337
Kim Taksu got knocked down.

22
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:51,509
So many people are out of their minds.

23
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,244
Why would they beat anyone up?

24
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:59,851
Wait. This...

25
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:04,122
Coach Hwang.

26
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:08,192
You really didn't have to pick me up.

27
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:09,594
Let's go for your morning workout.

28
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:12,163
You have to push yourself for next year.

29
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,999
Why are you whispering?

30
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,603
You told me the crazy girl lives here.

31
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:20,772
-The microphone psycho?
-Aera?

32
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,777
Hey, Dongman!

33
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:36,487
Hey. Explain this.

34
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:40,458
Are you a gangster?
Why would you go beat people?

35
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:42,660
Are you really going to go
into martial arts?

36
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,996
I decided to go with it
no matter how it turns out.

37
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:48,399
-The life of a martial arts master...
-A master?

38
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:54,205
I know exactly what got you
excited and jumping.

39
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:59,210
You lured him in, didn't you?

40
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:01,913
No, I didn't.
I would only do that to women.

41
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:03,281
It is true. You lured me.

42
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:08,886
He is so disloyal. Don't you think?

43
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:16,394
You better not follow that man around.

44
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:18,696
Come to the department store
by lunch no matter what.

45
00:03:18,963 --> 00:03:20,565
Why are you always ordering me around?

46
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:24,936
Remember we have to attend
a special lesson at lunch.

47
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,374
Just come if I tell you to.

48
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,743
If you don't, I will go to you.

49
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:35,713
I will make a visit to this man's studio.

50
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,082
Go. You should go see her.

51
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:39,384
You have to eat lunch anyway.

52
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,461
Yes.

53
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:53,064
Yes.

54
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:55,867
It is just a little happening.

55
00:03:56,567 --> 00:04:00,271
You know, don't you?
People will forget soon.

56
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:02,073
You shouldn't run
a business emotionally...

57
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:04,442
-Like this.
-Isn't it time I get my roots touched?

58
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:07,945
I am shooting a magazine pictorial today.

59
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,647
Contour my face to make it look smaller.

60
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:12,450
You lost both of your advertisement gigs.

61
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:14,152
Goodness.

62
00:04:14,452 --> 00:04:17,655
It is no time for you
to be getting your hair done.

63
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:21,559
-Aren't you going for training?
-Enough nagging.

64
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,194
Just tell me how to put out the fire.

65
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:25,663
Let me think about it, okay?

66
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:29,434
Here, Taksu. Taksu.

67
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:34,138
The public, goodness.

68
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:36,207
The public is going crazy right now.

69
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:39,544
Should we start a new training schedule...

70
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:41,512
...for a revenge match?

71
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:45,283
We can analyze your opponent's techniques.

72
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,886
Hey. Will you ever wake up?

73
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:51,823
I guess not.

74
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:56,761
It is hot. I only drink cold drinks.

75
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:02,767
I don't think it is something
that requires my action.

76
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,069
It was just a minor happening.

77
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:07,438
However, many are
requesting a revenge match.

78
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:09,273
-Do you plan on doing it?
-Come on.

79
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:13,044
I don't think I should fight
a neighborhood thug.

80
00:05:13,277 --> 00:05:16,981
I am not in a place to get
into a match like that.

81
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:19,350
Fool. He is scared.

82
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,823
People call him a street fighter
and are interested.

83
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:27,392
However,

84
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:30,061
he is nothing, but a thug from the streets.

85
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:33,297
Also, if people like him
get up to the octagon,

86
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:37,035
they will come on two feet
then crawl back out on four.

87
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:41,105
Okay, fine. If that guy wins just once...

88
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:44,208
...at an amateur game,
I will let him challenge me.

89
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,811
I told you no already.

90
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:52,884
Stop watching garbage and do skipping.

91
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:56,888
Why?

92
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:59,357
Let's just go into a game right away.

93
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:01,259
You had a break for ten years.

94
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,961
You need to build
your muscles and train more.

95
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,863
I never took a break.

96
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:08,800
I was a mover and a courier man.
I trained my strength.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,370
Taksu lazed around in
an air-conditioned gym,

98
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,640
but my muscles were built
on hard work and sweat.

99
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,476
Taekwondo and MMA are different.

100
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:20,511
You don't have enough low attacks.

101
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:23,748
I can kick them.

102
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:26,484
Spin kick. High kick.

103
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:29,053
Flying kick. I won't lose!

104
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,456
Stop yelling at me, punk.

105
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:34,463
If you enter the ring in this condition,

106
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:35,893
you will end up with injuries.

107
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:38,062
We can see whether or not I can do it.

108
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:40,498
You always said
I should take the risk and try.

109
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:44,736
Why did I bring this knucklehead here?

110
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:49,073
Your coach said no, so no!

111
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:56,781
Don't watch TV.
Run ten laps around the yard.

112
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:58,049
Now!

113
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:59,550
Darn it.

114
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:12,096
KBC Job Application

115
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:20,171
Submit Application

116
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:21,172
Submit?

117
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:24,008
Yes

118
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,781
Application Submitted

119
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,022
Are you a flight attendant or an announcer?

120
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:42,293
-Pardon?
-They are slightly different.

121
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:45,763
Do I look like an announcer?

122
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:49,901
Aren't you?
That is what I thought when you walked in.

123
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:52,437
You are right.

124
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:55,339
Make me look like an announcer.

125
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:57,375
Okay, an announcer it is.

126
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,877
Here we go. One, two.

127
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:05,083
What are you doing?

128
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:08,052
Sorry? I was just looking at something.

129
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:15,393
Here.

130
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:18,663
What is this?

131
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:19,864
I found it on my way here.

132
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,140
If the broadcaster
position opens up again,

133
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,577
I will recommend you for it
and do what I can.

134
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:35,646
From what I see,

135
00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:38,950
that new girl? That girl...

136
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:40,952
...is pretty.

137
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,088
She is very pretty.

138
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,058
She will probably get married right away.

139
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:50,361
You are trying to console me, right?

140
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:51,696
If she quits,

141
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:53,998
I will support you all the way...

142
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:55,229
Forget it.

143
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,568
A horse who decides to run in the wild...

144
00:08:57,768 --> 00:08:59,404
...doesn't return to the barn.

145
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:01,439
Run where?

146
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,775
If you feel guilty for what happened,

147
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,543
you should show it through action.

148
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:07,145
Sure, sure. How?

149
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:10,748
Then, I will buy you lunch today.

150
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:13,217
What do you want? Seonjiguk? Pollak soup?

151
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:14,425
What?

152
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:17,088
Well, actually...

153
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:21,893
Introduce me to the head of security.

154
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:23,494
Hey.

155
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:27,932
He is married.

156
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:34,505
The sundae truck opens at 7 PM.

157
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:35,606
I see.

158
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:37,442
Sir!

159
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:40,044
Aren't you Mr Dongman?

160
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:41,979
-Who are you?
-Me?

161
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:47,852
I am Yang Taehee of Tiger MMA.

162
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:51,723
I see. Nice to meet you.

163
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:53,658
But...

164
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,394
...what are you doing here?

165
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:59,063
Wait. How do you know my name?

166
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:00,565
Hiring Security Guard

167
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:02,900
What? Level five black belt in Taekwondo?

168
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:06,938
He isn't only good in Taekwondo.

169
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,006
He is a man of character.

170
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:11,843
He is kind of an airhead, but he is nice.

171
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,779
He's kind of dense,
but he doesn't try anything either.

172
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:17,615
Is that a compliment or an insult?

173
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,550
Conclusively,

174
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,122
he is pretty good looking.

175
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:27,091
It will be nice if our security guards...

176
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:29,494
...look good in their black suits.

177
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:33,698
Okay then. Tell him to come in for now.

178
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,068
"For now?" Why do you need to see his face?

179
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:41,139
Just, what are families all about?

180
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:44,242
I owe Miss Choi one. Come on.

181
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,144
Help me out, will you?

182
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:50,348
Fine, fine.

183
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:53,818
It would be good for us
to get someone good. Hold on.

184
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,554
What floor? Speak up.

185
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:57,955
First...

186
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:00,458
First floor.

187
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:02,493
That is the luxury brands.

188
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:11,969
RFC Amateur Tournament Application

189
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:15,440
Coach. Let's have Dongman...

190
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,742
...debut tomorrow.

191
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:19,477
What?

192
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,648
Let's win the amateur fight
Taksu mentioned tomorrow.

193
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:26,384
Let's win there and
win your ticket to revenge.

194
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:30,822
But still. Isn't tomorrow is too soon?

195
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:33,391
If not tomorrow,

196
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,294
you will never be able
to even make your debut.

197
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:39,764
-What?
-Taksu knows Dongman's skills.

198
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:43,101
Why would he have set that condition?

199
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:46,137
Don't ask me. Just show your cards.

200
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:49,640
He will cut off Dongman's arms and legs.

201
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:53,177
Forget Seoul. Not even small towns...

202
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:55,480
...will accept
Dongman's application to compete.

203
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,117
Taksu is a sponsor in this field,
so there is no way.

204
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:01,152
Then, why aren't you following suit?

205
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,889
I am a believer that
birds of a feather flock together.

206
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:07,191
To be honest, I...

207
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:11,863
I used to be Taksu's waiter at a club.

208
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:13,631
For several years,

209
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:16,234
I cleaned up after his messes...

210
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,269
...and learned to know too much about him.

211
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:22,240
Of course, he didn't
want me to become arrogant.

212
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:25,643
He is the type to make
enemies left and right.

213
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:28,012
Tomorrow's amateur tournament...

214
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:30,648
...is the last one I can use my pull on.

215
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,486
Let's create a new stage together.

216
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:39,223
I understand why
you want to join our side,

217
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:41,392
but I don't trust migratory birds,

218
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:43,895
and tomorrow is ridiculous.

219
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:45,563
Why?

220
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,298
What do you mean?

221
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:48,666
What else can you do other than kick?

222
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,136
Let's win his ticket to revenge
before it is too late.

223
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,538
We can train after...

224
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:57,275
Look. I promised to take
responsibility for his life.

225
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,544
I will check every bridge carefully...

226
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:01,179
...before crossing them.

227
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:04,048
We won't do it. We won't.

228
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,586
Darn it. He is so inflexible.

229
00:13:09,187 --> 00:13:12,023
Mr Ko. I don't bet on a losing fight.

230
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:16,394
You are Dongman,
the man who defeated Taksu.

231
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:18,463
That is why I am betting my life on you.

232
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:21,966
Trust me and go with me.

233
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:28,339
Where are you? Get over here.

234
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,241
I am not going.

235
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:31,676
I will kill you.

236
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:33,711
Play it slowly.

237
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,980
That is it.

238
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:38,583
Stop.

239
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:41,285
You are right. She did take it.

240
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:43,688
It disappeared when she walked by.

241
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:46,391
That watch costs 10,000 dollars.

242
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:54,098
Welcome.

243
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:59,670
-Enjoy your day.
-Enjoy your day.

244
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,209
I said to rush over.
Why are you showing up now?

245
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:07,545
What now? Why did you call me here?

246
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:10,448
Just go up to the security room
on the ninth floor.

247
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:11,983
Tell them I sent you.

248
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:13,651
Why would I go to the security room?

249
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:15,720
Get a job with the security team here.

250
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,655
Go and tell them
you can start working tomorrow.

251
00:14:18,022 --> 00:14:20,191
You don't listen to a word I say.

252
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:22,593
I told you I am going to do MMA.

253
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,862
Stop being stupid.

254
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:26,464
Live as you have been.

255
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:27,598
Why are you suddenly...

256
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:29,567
You loved it when you
grabbed the microphone.

257
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:32,103
You said one must do what they love.

258
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,039
Rather than end my life
running in a hamster wheel,

259
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:36,941
I am going to do something stupid.

260
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:39,177
Are you a pubescent teen?

261
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:40,912
What is wrong with you?

262
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:43,548
-I am leaving. Bye.
-Hey.

263
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:46,217
That lady.

264
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:49,954
She can't leave.

265
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:55,960
Madam. Did you enjoy your time here?

266
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,152
Yes.

267
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:01,132
Did you find everything you wanted?

268
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,668
What is it? Do you want to say something?

269
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:06,504
Madam. Did you...

270
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:09,674
...forget to pay for anything?

271
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:12,176
What?

272
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:14,979
If you forgot...

273
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:19,016
Madam. Would you like some coffee or tea?

274
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:20,385
Aren't you moving?

275
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:23,354
Did you by mistake

276
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:25,523
drop something in your bag...

277
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:30,661
Look.

278
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:32,964
Is there anything in there? Is there?

279
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:36,067
I am sorry.
I mistook you for someone else.

280
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:37,735
Are you out of your mind?

281
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:40,338
I am sorry.

282
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:42,740
Put them back in.

283
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:45,143
Pardon?

284
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,644
Yes, of course.

285
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:53,251
Look carefully.
Do you see a watch in there?

286
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:03,494
Madam.

287
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:06,998
I never said it was a watch.

288
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:12,370
Do you know that you just
made an incredible mistake?

289
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:13,705
What is your problem?

290
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,888
I don't think I made a mistake.

291
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:34,392
I am sorry, madam.

292
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:37,261
Our employee insulted you.
She didn't know better.

293
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:39,497
I will not let her get away with this.

294
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:44,435
Ms. Choi,
will you please apologize to her?

295
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:45,636
Excuse me.

296
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:49,574
Sorry for butting in,

297
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:53,544
but why should she apologize
when she caught a thief?

298
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:56,114
What? A thief?

299
00:16:56,814 --> 00:16:59,050
Shall we go inside, madam?

300
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,251
Please?

301
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:02,053
Follow me.

302
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:10,061
Stay out here.

303
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:11,362
This doesn't make any sense.

304
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:12,764
Stay here.

305
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:15,199
I don't want to be shamed in front of you.

306
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:26,010
Goodness.

307
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,081
Don't you know me?

308
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:32,817
I am King's chairman's second wife.

309
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:36,721
Do you want to go and check just how
much...

310
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:38,022
I spend here a month?

311
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:40,191
I apologize, madam.

312
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:43,961
My employee didn't recognize you
and crossed the line.

313
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:45,963
I was going to show
my husband the watch...

314
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:48,633
...and then pay for it later.

315
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,068
Yes, of course.

316
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:51,803
I apologize.

317
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:54,672
This happens due to our employees' fault.

318
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,975
You are quite proud of someone
who named me a thief.

319
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:02,480
Why did you hide it under
your hat if you meant to pay?

320
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:04,716
-How dare you?
-Forget it.

321
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:08,252
I will tell my members
not to shop here anymore.

322
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:10,188
Let's see how you do
without your VIP customers.

323
00:18:11,222 --> 00:18:13,691
I won't spend a dollar
at a place with untrained staff.

324
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,260
Miss Choi, apologize immediately.

325
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,463
Let's see how you manage.

326
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:19,697
Madam.

327
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:23,735
Miss Choi, come on.
Why won't you apologize?

328
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:36,748
I apologize, madam.

329
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,186
She is still very young, madam.

330
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:44,155
Please let it go.

331
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:48,659
I feel even worse
because a girl treated me so badly.

332
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,262
What should I do about this?

333
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:54,532
What should I do to make
myself feel better?

334
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,412
They should reward her
for catching a thief.

335
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,080
Why are they scolding her?

336
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,022
Thank you, madam.

337
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,092
I was merciful enough
to let it off at this.

338
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:22,994
Anyone else would have made a huge fuss.

339
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,831
Train your staff properly.

340
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:31,169
The money I spend here
includes her pay, tips,

341
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:35,273
and the right to make her kneel,
doesn't it?

342
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,742
I will reprimand her.

343
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:40,745
Sorry.

344
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:42,714
-My goodness.
-Hey.

345
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,516
What are you doing?

346
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:49,787
Goodness!

347
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:52,857
She quits as of this moment.

348
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:54,492
Hey!

349
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:56,494
Does the teeny salary you pay her...

350
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:58,062
...give you the right to do this?

351
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:02,133
What you spend doesn't
include the right to abuse.

352
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,335
You have no right to do this.

353
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:07,438
VIP or not, you are just a thief!

354
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:10,641
She is an employee who caught a thief.

355
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:21,686
Let go.

356
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:23,921
That hurts.

357
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:27,759
Why are you always causing trouble?

358
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:30,061
You just made me lose my job.

359
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,163
Were you going to stay
after going through that?

360
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:36,167
Kneeling for a bit
won't break my kneecaps.

361
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:37,735
What?

362
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:39,971
I just have to grit my teeth.

363
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:41,639
Then,

364
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,241
I can pretend that nothing happened.

365
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:44,742
I can...

366
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,112
I can go back to working
at the information desk.

367
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:52,283
It will be like nothing happened...

368
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,521
...and no one will find out
that I knelt in front of her.

369
00:20:58,389 --> 00:20:59,457
It will just...

370
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:07,932
My feet.

371
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,234
They hurt so much.

372
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:19,177
Back in my locker, there are...

373
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:22,580
...my slippers, bag,

374
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:25,783
clothes and everything.

375
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:27,285
I need to get them all.

376
00:21:34,358 --> 00:21:35,827
It is so embarrassing.

377
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:39,864
Why did you stay out there?

378
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,234
Because of you...

379
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:46,804
Because of you...

380
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:49,574
That was honestly nothing.

381
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:22,974
It's okay even if you're jobless.

382
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,359
Are you still at work?

383
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:43,461
Yes.

384
00:22:56,774 --> 00:22:57,775
Ta-da.

385
00:22:58,309 --> 00:22:59,343
I didn't ask for...

386
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:01,779
Yejin.

387
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,415
I heard you would be working late.

388
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,432
Isn't work too hard or anything?

389
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,535
It is hard.

390
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,772
The worst part is
waking up in the morning.

391
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:29,374
Why do you work then?

392
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:31,309
What?

393
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:34,379
You don't have to work, do you?

394
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:35,780
Well...

395
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:39,217
Everyone thinks I work here...

396
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,086
...just for the fun of it.

397
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,956
I want to go on working here.

398
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,393
I love coming to work.

399
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:51,496
Are you born to have...

400
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,432
...a career of your own or something?

401
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:58,469
It is not really that.

402
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,574
It is because of you.

403
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:06,144
I get up at six every morning...

404
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:08,046
...to curl my hair...

405
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,647
...for an hour just for you.

406
00:24:15,186 --> 00:24:16,821
My goodness. Sorry.

407
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:21,192
No.

408
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:23,561
Pretend you didn't hear that.

409
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,464
That was hilarious.

410
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:28,433
Hello.

411
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:37,775
Hello, Seolhui.

412
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,679
Hi. I left something behind.

413
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,150
We are wearing the same hoodie.

414
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:49,487
We are. It must be a popular item.

415
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,389
I should have gotten a fake too.

416
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:53,391
What?

417
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,160
I bought it overseas
and had it shipped over.

418
00:24:56,594 --> 00:24:59,964
The logo looks so similar,
you can't tell them apart.

419
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:01,199
It is a waste of money.

420
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:04,068
I had no idea.

421
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:05,837
I just got it because it was pink.

422
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,606
I love everything in pink as well.

423
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,708
Where do you usually shop?

424
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:12,977
-What?
-I think...

425
00:25:13,177 --> 00:25:15,012
...we have similar tastes...

426
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:16,914
...and you look much older than me.

427
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:18,750
Can I call you by your name?

428
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,118
Sure, why not?

429
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:23,054
I don't think I am that much older.

430
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:25,990
It is my mom.

431
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,560
I have to go first.

432
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,262
-Okay.
-See you tomorrow.

433
00:25:31,462 --> 00:25:32,764
-See you.
-Bye.

434
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:33,831
-Bye.
-Bye.

435
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,738
Why are you still waving?

436
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,441
She is so cheerful, isn't she?

437
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:48,479
Why did you bring me food?

438
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:49,847
To surprise you.

439
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,883
What was so funny?

440
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,584
You were laughing really loudly.

441
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,654
-Me?
-Yes.

442
00:25:58,389 --> 00:25:59,390
I wasn't.

443
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,296
Please wire your rent to the landlord.

444
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,368
Look what you put us into.

445
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:13,104
Do you want both of us to be homeless?

446
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,573
Why do you keep causing trouble?

447
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,111
I will take care of you.

448
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,947
How are you going to take care of me?

449
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,818
You can be my manager.

450
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:29,654
What did I just hear?

451
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,290
Do I have to reply?

452
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:35,593
You will be a sports manager.
It is a professional job.

453
00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:37,662
You got in through connections.

454
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:38,901
Really?

455
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:42,934
You get me fired and what do you say?

456
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:47,739
You are just a loser.
Are you out of your mind?

457
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:53,945
Manager?
Shut your nerveless mouth right now.

458
00:26:57,648 --> 00:26:58,716
Is that what you want?

459
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:09,394
Please save me this once.

460
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:10,962
Thank you so much.

461
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,398
So,

462
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,834
please fill in for a few more days.

463
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:18,936
Why did she quit all of a sudden?

464
00:27:19,203 --> 00:27:21,172
-I am glad she left.
-What?

465
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,675
He threw the hat and they ran off.

466
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,077
I was so relieved.

467
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:31,749
I think she will do well
in whatever she does, right?

468
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:34,519
Also, I hope she does.

469
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,294
You were looking for
Aera last time, right?

470
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:44,462
Right.

471
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,265
I guess she is not here again.

472
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,234
She quit.

473
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,704
Sorry? She quit?

474
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:54,338
Why?

475
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,340
Since when?

476
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,878
We are both unemployed,
so should we have a drink?

477
00:28:01,412 --> 00:28:03,181
I have a few bottles of soju in my fridge.

478
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,851
-I can't.
-No way. Is this real?

479
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:09,053
Did you just turn down soju?

480
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,155
My face will get puffy.

481
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,559
Who cares? You are unemployed.
You have nowhere to go.

482
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:16,961
I do have somewhere to go.

483
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,996
Where are you going?

484
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,469
Where are you going?
Why aren't you telling me?

485
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:27,271
You are going to go see that punk, right?

486
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,676
I told you not to call him a punk.

487
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,044
What are you going to do with him?

488
00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:36,080
We are going to do something
a child doesn't know.

489
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,820
Baby, sleep early. Okay?

490
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,222
Sleep tight.

491
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,060
My goodness.

492
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,532
You crazy punk.

493
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,536
Is he really a child or what?

494
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,686
Intern Yejin:
I won't like it if you ignore me.

495
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,632
Mr Kim, let's go to
Yeouido this Saturday.

496
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,935
Please help me find some
information at the library.

497
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,105
I can take you to the fireworks...

498
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,441
...and treat you to rib eye with wine.

499
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:40,445
You are not going to
ignore me like last time, right?

500
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:55,059
Honey, let's take
the selfie stick to the fireworks.

501
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,962
I haven't posted too many pictures of us,

502
00:29:58,162 --> 00:30:00,398
so people on my blog are wondering.

503
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,667
They are just saying that.

504
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,937
There are going to be
so many people at the fireworks.

505
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,874
Should I wear the dress you bought me?

506
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,442
Yes, wear whatever you like.

507
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,681
Juman,

508
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,449
should we just not go?

509
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,418
What?

510
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,389
I mean, if you are busy,
we don't have to go.

511
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:28,793
To tell you the truth,

512
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,665
I do have to work this Saturday.

513
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,734
What? What is it for?

514
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,807
Please don't lie to me. Please don't.

515
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,543
The thing is,

516
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:52,483
the intern keeps on asking me to help.

517
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,989
If all this goes wrong,
my overtime work goes to waste.

518
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:01,893
The intern said if I helped, I would get...

519
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,494
...rib eye and wine.

520
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,863
That is not what I wanted.

521
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,766
People like that intern...

522
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:13,504
...who are bright,
but clueless are troublesome. Right?

523
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,607
Be nice.

524
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,309
Stop criticizing.

525
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:22,680
This is when Mr Kim
of the sales team steps up.

526
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,217
Let's go on our date next week.

527
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,686
Let's go for good food.

528
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,088
Okay.

529
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,662
This is all because of Chanho.

530
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,667
Who?

531
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,237
It is this new, scrawny intern named Chanho.

532
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,540
This is all his fault.

533
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,603
Let's sleep.

534
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,576
Someone who plays
recreational soccer doesn't become...

535
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,578
...a professional player with new cleats.

536
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:04,916
Should I tie it?

537
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:06,984
Or should I let it down?

538
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:10,154
You have to tie it.
He has to see your neckline.

539
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,956
You didn't forget
the move I told you, right?

540
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,394
-Right. The one Juman fell for?
-Yes.

541
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,564
Try it. Let's do it.

542
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,800
The other way.

543
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,872
-Turn your neck completely.
-Is it true?

544
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,709
I pretended to fall for it.
She did that all day.

545
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,146
You are truly incredible.

546
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:37,849
Who won't fall for it? Any guy will.

547
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:41,018
Even I would fall for it.

548
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:46,157
You two, stop putting on a show.

549
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,860
I think you should look it up.

550
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,362
What is the date plan?

551
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,867
Well, we will watch a movie,

552
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,903
have tea and a drink. That should be it.

553
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:02,073
-I am so jealous.
-Hey!

554
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,575
-Why are you putting that on?
-You startled me.

555
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,812
-Why are you yelling at me?
-You punk.

556
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,048
Make sure you get back
before the sun goes down.

557
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,419
-Do I look like a child?
-Get back by 7 p.m., okay?

558
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,622
Who are you to tell me what to do?

559
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,491
Hey, get this straight. I am Aera.

560
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,461
Let me tell you our levels. If I am here,

561
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,463
you are down here.

562
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:30,668
You used to hold my school bag for me.
How dare you?

563
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,704
Come home by 7 PM.

564
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,605
If you are late, I will tell your dad.

565
00:34:34,805 --> 00:34:38,176
"She put on perfume and
went on a date with some guy,"

566
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,111
"and she is not back yet." Goodness.

567
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,814
What is wrong with you?

568
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,083
Why are you overreacting?

569
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,924
What do I do? He is almost here.

570
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,094
-Get ready.
-What do I do?

571
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,005
Excuse me.

572
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,808
Yes? Who are you?

573
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:12,910
Me?

574
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:15,913
I live on the fifth floor.

575
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,184
I am the new landlord and
the owner of this villa.

576
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,420
I see.

577
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,656
Hello. Nice to meet you.

578
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,226
Didn't you see my text message yesterday?

579
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,497
Well. I saw it,

580
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,832
but I am facing some changes.

581
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,602
Can I pay the rent by the end of the month?

582
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,771
Did you lose your job?

583
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,240
Then,

584
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:46,477
pay me what you can for now.

585
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,285
I don't think I have any.

586
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,857
Take out what you have.

587
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:04,362
Is she stealing money from me?

588
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:11,169
Do girls really find men
who can reverse hot?

589
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,907
Yes, 100 percent.
Make sure to reverse with one hand.

590
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,209
You must hold the passenger seat
with your right hand.

591
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,778
Left hand is there to assist. Good luck.

592
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,649
Like this?
Right hand on the passenger seat.

593
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,418
Left is here to assist.

594
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:30,855
This is the way to do it.

595
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:41,566
Aera.

596
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,872
Why did you come so early?

597
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,748
Get in. We have a busy day today.

598
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,282
Okay.

599
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,230
I am so glad you are on vacation.

600
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,565
We can go on a date
together on my day off.

601
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,102
Yes, right.

602
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,973
I should take
a long vacation while I am at it.

603
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,208
You can look forward to today.

604
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:28,379
I have prepared the perfect date course.

605
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,749
You have really silky hair.

606
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,861
I have never seen anyone
reverse like that.

607
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,364
I am sorry.

608
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,571
You are taking today off?

609
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,373
I already took it off.

610
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:58,076
I know you can't go because of work.
I can't miss it.

611
00:37:58,743 --> 00:37:59,877
I told you not to go.

612
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,846
I hate thinking about you
going there alone.

613
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,347
I have to.

614
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:04,749
It is the first birthday
of your cousin's baby.

615
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,317
I will make a quick drop by.

616
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,469
Why aren't you checking your chat?

617
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:25,684
What?

618
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,140
This is our work group chat.

619
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,842
It is annoying to check.

620
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:32,910
Who is in the chat?

621
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,812
Is Chanho in it?

622
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,714
-Who?
-Intern Chanho.

623
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,350
How do you know Chanho?

624
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:43,554
Right, I mentioned him yesterday.

625
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:47,392
Yes. He wanted you
to help him this weekend.

626
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:49,227
Right.

627
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,662
He promised to treat you
to steak and wine.

628
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:55,600
The weakest among the interns.

629
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,303
I should tell him when I meet him.

630
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,039
Tell him what?

631
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,807
He should prepare the presentation...

632
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,375
...on his own instead of
asking you for help.

633
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,452
The soup is red.

634
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,554
Instead of cabbage, it would be nice...

635
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,456
...to use radish kimchi.

636
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,959
Hey, did you get my text from yesterday?

637
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,495
You didn't reply.

638
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,964
Sure. We can prepare it
together on the weekend.

639
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,766
We have to do a good job.

640
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,001
Really?

641
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,703
Then, I will reserve...

642
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,705
...a really nice restaurant for dinner.

643
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:35,840
We can watch the fireworks
after we are done.

644
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,108
We can order dinner in.

645
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,911
-Pardon?
-Instead of going so far,

646
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,213
we can prepare at the office.
As for dinner,

647
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,382
we can order jjajangmyeon.

648
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:45,717
Well...

649
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:49,754
While we are at it,
let's invite Chanho and Minjung.

650
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:50,788
I will contact them.

651
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,291
Am I...

652
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,194
...being dumped right now?

653
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,262
Pardon?

654
00:39:58,463 --> 00:39:59,897
The presentation...

655
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,434
It is okay. I will do it by myself.

656
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,779
I broke up with my ex
because he cheated on me.

657
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,081
I see.

658
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:21,919
I am not sure why,
but seeing you shut me down...

659
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:23,855
...like that makes me trust you more.

660
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:25,590
Sorry?

661
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:28,259
I think you will
do the same to other girls.

662
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,762
That is why I...

663
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:32,964
Yes?

664
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:34,532
I like you even more.

665
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,501
I want to date you.

666
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:40,138
You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

667
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,042
I...

668
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,620
I heard the dish today is hangover soup.

669
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,823
I drank so much until
I threw up last night.

670
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,594
Just burping makes me feel drunk.

671
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:06,831
Hey, give me a bowl.

672
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,672
Have you tried your trick yet?

673
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,612
I thought the movie would be good,

674
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,347
but their trailer was all there was.

675
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,491
Yes, you are right.

676
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,708
What is it? Why are you staring?

677
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,543
What is wrong?

678
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:54,145
Pardon?

679
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,314
You look like a giraffe.

680
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,715
Does your neck hurt?

681
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,718
No.

682
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,453
Is it here?

683
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,324
I can see that your
cervical spine is protruding.

684
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,092
Here, this. What is this?

685
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:10,261
It is my trapezius muscle.

686
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,964
I see, trapezius muscle.

687
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,167
You must work out a lot.

688
00:42:16,258 --> 00:42:17,216
Yes.

689
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,052
Who are you eating lunch with?
Eat with me.

690
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,154
I am full. I am not eating.

691
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:37,488
Why not?

692
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,037
Counselor on break

693
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,473
Mr Kim, what do I do with this?

694
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,541
Can you give that to Chanho?

695
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:31,828
Okay.

696
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,078
Pass it to me.

697
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:36,280
Here.

698
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,051
-Hot!
-It is hot!

699
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:41,786
-I am sorry, Mr Kim.
-Goodness.

700
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,755
-Chanho, the ladle.
-What do we do?

701
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:44,931
-That is hot.
-It was hot, right?

702
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:45,990
It's okay.

703
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,759
-Let me do this.
-Hold on.

704
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,494
-You should see a doctor.
-Hang on.

705
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:52,397
You shouldn't rub right there.

706
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:56,701
It looks like love is blooming.

707
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,441
Seolhui, what brings you here?

708
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,476
I should know...

709
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:08,780
...what it tastes like to sell them.

710
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:12,483
She is a professional.

711
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,555
What are you doing, Chanho?
Give her a bowl.

712
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:18,689
Yes, sir.

713
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:20,992
Chanho.

714
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,662
Are you Chanho?

715
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,364
Yes, I am Chanho.

716
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:40,845
Mr Kim.

717
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,981
Yes?

718
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:45,917
I...

719
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:49,487
What is it?

720
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,957
I was a fan of Park Chanho.

721
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:54,459
Chan...

722
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:57,695
Are you talking about the baseball player?

723
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:02,133
I am Kim Chanho.

724
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:05,737
Yes. I know.

725
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:09,374
He is our hero during IMF.

726
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:11,943
Yes, sure. He was a hero.

727
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:16,647
I used to eat his ice cream a lot.

728
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:20,785
I see. I didn't eat his ice cream.

729
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:22,754
You didn't?

730
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:27,692
-Did you have something to say to me?
-Chanho.

731
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,261
-Chanho.
-Yes, Mr Kim?

732
00:45:30,357 --> 00:45:31,262
There you are.

733
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:33,197
I have been looking everywhere for you.

734
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:37,068
Shouldn't we go prepare our presentation?

735
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,337
Yes, we should. Right, Mr Kim.

736
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,206
We should meet this weekend
to prepare for it, right?

737
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:44,709
Yes.

738
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:47,512
-We have to meet this weekend.
-Right!

739
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:50,448
Yejin said she will do it all.

740
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:52,050
Did you hear?

741
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,305
She must be interested in me.

742
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,362
Pardon? What? What did you say?

743
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:05,963
Well.

744
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:09,000
She knew me and
suddenly started talking to me.

745
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,003
She was kind of cute.

746
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,273
You are very amusing.

747
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,209
-Pardon?
-You know the presentations?

748
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,546
Gather them and bring them to me.

749
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,015
Right now?

750
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:26,751
-Right this instant.
-But...

751
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:29,887
One, two.

752
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,189
Spot.

753
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,324
Jab.

754
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:34,892
One, two, spot.

755
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,196
Get it together, punk.

756
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,099
Why are you checking
the time while training?

757
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:45,002
If you are not going
to do it right, just leave.

758
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,838
Wait down there.

759
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:48,706
I am leaving.

760
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:52,143
Why? Why won't you let me go?

761
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,145
I looked up who was competing.

762
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:57,682
There is an old man
who took up boxing to lose weight...

763
00:46:57,882 --> 00:46:59,550
...and even high school kids.

764
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,786
Why won't you let me compete? Why?

765
00:47:01,877 --> 00:47:02,851
Hey.

766
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:04,389
It is because...

767
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:06,891
...you are worse than a high school kid...

768
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:08,359
in your judgment.

769
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,561
What is this?

770
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:14,031
Was that a hook? Right?

771
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:16,434
That was a hook, not a kick.

772
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:23,307
My goodness. What a great gym.

773
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,610
Hello, Coach. How have you been?

774
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,845
What are they doing here?

775
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,847
We came to discuss something.

776
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,582
Can we talk?

777
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:33,785
You are making me nervous.

778
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,388
I heard

779
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:39,323
he came by.

780
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:43,961
Taehee lives right here, you see.

781
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:46,564
I know everything he does.

782
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:50,334
Hey. Do you even know what he used to do?

783
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,003
-Do you?
-Hey.

784
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:54,272
-I am busy.
-Why?

785
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,174
-Are you preparing to make a debut?
-Yes.

786
00:47:58,076 --> 00:48:00,845
You are still so naive, aren't you?

787
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,347
And you are still just a big jerk.

788
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:05,416
Why is he here?

789
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,754
I wanted to discuss something
good for everyone.

790
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,456
Whatever. It will be good only for him.

791
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:14,392
The truth is, no good will come...

792
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:17,161
...of Taksu and Dongman
getting involved again.

793
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:20,598
If their past gets brought up,
they will both be hurt.

794
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:23,401
Taksu's father still feels...

795
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:25,536
...responsible toward Dongman.

796
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,739
The old man is such a sucker.

797
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:29,507
His father wants...

798
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:33,444
...to make Dongman
the company warehouse manager.

799
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,347
He will guarantee his retirement fund too.

800
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:39,817
You benefit so much because of me.

801
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:44,021
Your sister was able to
get surgery thanks to me.

802
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,124
Why are you bringing up his sister?

803
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:49,694
Hey. I think you should just leave.

804
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:53,164
Dongman. You stupid, easy boy.

805
00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:57,869
The lead and supporting roles
are predetermined.

806
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:00,705
The caterpillar who knows his place...

807
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,474
...and is grateful for the generosity...

808
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:07,011
...can eat the leaves, you know?

809
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:08,179
-Hey.
-Yes?

810
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,681
Do you train him to run his mouth?

811
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,251
Look at that head.

812
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:14,528
Hey, you. Get over here.

813
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,287
-Coach. Calm down.
-Hey, you.

814
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:17,688
-Get over here.
-Please.

815
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,657
-Please stop.
-How dare you?

816
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:20,992
-Why do you...
-Coach.

817
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,454
You paid for the movie,

818
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,222
so I will pay for this.

819
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:52,724
No way.

820
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,393
I told you, it is all on me today.

821
00:49:56,294 --> 00:49:58,362
Plus, this place is super expensive.

822
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:01,933
Next time,
when we go for chicken and beer,

823
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,201
it can be your treat.

824
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:07,672
I can pay for steak too.

825
00:50:10,942 --> 00:50:12,977
That is not what I meant.

826
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,547
Aera.

827
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:18,316
Yes?

828
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,551
Why are you so uncomfortable with me?

829
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:23,421
Who cares who pays here?

830
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:26,124
I doubt you would
be this way with Dongman.

831
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:29,894
That is because Dongman is Dongman.

832
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,632
To be honest,
I don't like that you are close to him.

833
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:36,534
I don't like that he lives across from you.

834
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:38,736
I feel like that neighborhood isn't safe.

835
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,839
There are many nice
studio apartments near me.

836
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:43,374
Can't you move there?

837
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,779
Sure, I can move there.

838
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:50,248
But my place grew on me.

839
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,523
How is it working at the department store?

840
00:50:58,756 --> 00:50:59,690
Isn't it hard?

841
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,394
It is not bad.

842
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:10,068
They say you can know
a woman from her mom.

843
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,537
Do you take after your mom too?

844
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:17,041
I do not.

845
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,110
And I don't want to.

846
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:22,480
Because I want to live long.

847
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:25,850
Tell me more about your mom.

848
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:29,287
I feel like you would be a lot like her.

849
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,224
Well...

850
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:35,693
It is the same.

851
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:40,531
We fight all the time
like other moms and daughters.

852
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:44,068
She nags like crazy and makes me food.

853
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:46,537
Just the same things.

854
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:51,776
It is so obvious that you
were loved a lot as a child.

855
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,678
I like your cheerful disposition.

856
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:56,347
Really?

857
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:00,251
-I need to use the restroom.
-Sure.

858
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:21,806
Why did I lie?

859
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:27,712
I am such a loser.

860
00:52:31,015 --> 00:52:32,917
I feel so uncomfortable.

861
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:37,755
Seolhui.

862
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,894
Why did you have to check my phone?

863
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:44,562
Don't you trust me?

864
00:52:45,363 --> 00:52:47,532
Is me checking your phone
the problem here?

865
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:49,033
That is not what I mean.

866
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:51,035
I trust you, so I don't check yours.

867
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,970
Then, go ahead and check it.

868
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:55,139
I have nothing to hide. I don't lie.

869
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,309
I lied in case you would worry.

870
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:00,378
In case you would let...

871
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,013
..your imagination
run wild and stress out.

872
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:04,515
I told Yejin that I can't go to Yeouido,

873
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:06,284
that I won't go.

874
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:07,852
You must talk to her a lot.

875
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:10,455
It was a white lie for your benefit.

876
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,458
A little white lie.

877
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:15,560
How could a lie be white?

878
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,161
Who are you to call it white?

879
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:19,363
I told her I won't go this weekend too.

880
00:53:19,454 --> 00:53:20,364
Just meet with her.

881
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:22,734
-What?
-That would be better.

882
00:53:22,934 --> 00:53:25,203
Meet with her and tell her the truth.
Don't lie.

883
00:53:25,403 --> 00:53:26,838
I was worried you would be bothered...

884
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:28,373
...that I got a text
from a woman late at night.

885
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:30,575
More than the fact
that Yejin texted you at night,

886
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:33,344
more than the fact
that she asked you to get rib eye,

887
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:34,979
the fact...

888
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:39,083
The fact that you lied Yejin was Chanho,

889
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:40,918
to me, that was really...

890
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:44,555
That was really...

891
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,258
...like a bullet through the heart.

892
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:52,263
My dear, Seolhui.

893
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,834
I am really sorry. I was wrong.

894
00:53:57,168 --> 00:54:00,304
Let go. You have never lied to me before.

895
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:02,173
It is true that you are being weird.

896
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:04,575
I made a mistake.

897
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:08,146
I am a jerk.

898
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:11,015
I must have lost my mind.

899
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:15,987
I was shot.

900
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,523
You weren't shot.

901
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:21,192
It was...

902
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:24,562
...just a white lie.

903
00:54:25,063 --> 00:54:26,864
All lies are black.

904
00:54:27,165 --> 00:54:30,001
They are all dirty.
They are all gibberish.

905
00:54:31,002 --> 00:54:34,038
They are all fake.
Don't give me that garbage.

906
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:35,973
Don't try to fool me.

907
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:37,268
-Seolhui.
-Please.

908
00:54:38,543 --> 00:54:40,678
I am sorry. I was wrong.

909
00:54:41,813 --> 00:54:42,847
But Seolhui,

910
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:45,450
you should stop playing with Aera.

911
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:52,123
Mr Ko. Today's amateur tournament...

912
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:54,192
...is at Road House in
Cheongdam-dong at 8 PM.

913
00:54:59,564 --> 00:55:02,133
Dongman. You stupid, easy boy.

914
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:07,238
The lead and supporting roles
are predetermined.

915
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:16,280
Mr Yang.

916
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:18,616
Can we really turn things around?

917
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:31,462
Finally, Dongman makes
his debut as an amateur.

918
00:55:32,363 --> 00:55:34,699
Come to Road House
in Cheongdam-dong by 8:30 PM.

919
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:39,404
Aera. Where we are heading to...

920
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:40,671
...is the highlight of the night.

921
00:55:40,905 --> 00:55:42,640
The view of the city lights
is incredible there.

922
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:44,942
It is?

923
00:55:48,246 --> 00:55:50,248
Get over here. I need my manager.

924
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:52,717
I am kind of scared.

925
00:55:58,189 --> 00:55:59,690
I am really sorry,

926
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:02,560
but can we go to the highlight another time?

927
00:56:02,994 --> 00:56:05,296
-Why? Is something wrong?
-No.

928
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,999
My friend wants to meet urgently
in Cheongdam-dong.

929
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:11,803
I see.

930
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:14,205
Would you drop me off up there?

931
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:18,543
Sure. We can do the rest another time.

932
00:56:24,248 --> 00:56:25,583
I am not loose enough yet.

933
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:28,019
You will be fighting a Brazilian man.

934
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:31,355
There is no information on him.
He seems brand new.

935
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,692
But you have to avoid injury at all cost.

936
00:56:35,193 --> 00:56:36,194
Okay.

937
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,362
You are nervous, aren't you?

938
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:40,965
Should I ask Coach Hwang to come?

939
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:47,505
No. He will probably stop me
if he finds out.

940
00:56:48,473 --> 00:56:49,574
I will call my manager.

941
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:52,310
Do you have a manager already?

942
00:56:53,945 --> 00:56:57,281
You are supposed to eat hot dogs
while watching MMA.

943
00:56:58,116 --> 00:56:59,717
I will take two. Buy me two.

944
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:02,920
I will eat one now and
one while watching the fight.

945
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,622
Didn't that punk even feed you?

946
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,624
-I will take two.
-Okay.

947
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,459
I ate a steak the size
of a chicken's head...

948
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:10,194
...for the price of ten whole chickens.

949
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:12,063
So, hurry. I am starved.

950
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:13,398
Let's get chicken feet and soju.

951
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:15,600
Hey. I have a question.

952
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,302
It is your first time watching
an MMA fight live.

953
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:21,205
Aren't you worried about me...

954
00:57:21,472 --> 00:57:23,708
...or more nervous than I am or something?

955
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:25,576
This isn't the first time
watching you compete.

956
00:57:26,177 --> 00:57:27,712
It is an amateur fight.

957
00:57:27,912 --> 00:57:29,147
One kick from you and it is over.

958
00:57:29,414 --> 00:57:30,448
You punk.

959
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:34,752
You have a lot of faith in me, don't you?

960
00:57:35,553 --> 00:57:38,656
You rejected steak and came to watch me win.

961
00:57:40,358 --> 00:57:41,993
I came here today...

962
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:45,163
...because this is your debut
and retirement fight.

963
00:57:45,363 --> 00:57:47,598
You need to try it once before giving up.

964
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:51,369
Insolent little brats need
to burn their hand...

965
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:54,338
...on the frying pan before
knowing never to do it again.

966
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:57,975
You should thank the stars
you were born a girl.

967
00:57:58,476 --> 00:58:00,144
-Your hot dogs are ready.
-Okay.

968
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:01,646
Thank you.

969
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:03,815
Thank you.

970
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:12,190
You will get the best view from here.

971
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,858
Sit here and watch.

972
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,132
Are you fighting that foreigner?

973
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:23,401
He looks smaller than you.

974
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:25,770
Yes. He is shorter.

975
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,405
I doubt winning will do much for me.

976
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:31,709
Fighters, please enter the cage.

977
00:58:32,043 --> 00:58:33,044
I am coming.

978
00:58:33,711 --> 00:58:35,213
-Here.
-Okay.

979
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:39,584
I will be back.

980
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:42,353
Okay!

981
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:53,631
Ready?

982
00:58:54,098 --> 00:58:55,900
Ready? Fight.

983
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,503
-Okay.
-Let's go!

984
00:58:58,703 --> 00:58:59,837
Okay.

985
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,606
-Good.
-Let's go.

986
00:59:02,507 --> 00:59:04,375
-Move quickly.
-Get low.

987
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,377
-Waist. Attack.
-Attack!

988
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:08,813
-That is it.
-Yes.

989
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:10,081
Attack.

990
00:59:17,155 --> 00:59:19,257
-Hang in there!
-Let's go!

991
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:23,094
Good.

992
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:25,963
-That is right.
-Good.

993
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,232
Yes. Good.

994
00:59:47,018 --> 00:59:48,052
Doctor!

995
00:59:49,087 --> 00:59:50,154
Doctor!

996
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:04,902
I got the video.
I will send it now, so post it online.

997
01:00:05,103 --> 01:00:06,137
Okay.

998
01:00:09,207 --> 01:00:12,043
You are such a great actor.

999
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:13,511
Thank you.

1000
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:16,347
I chase Dongman and you pull him in.

1001
01:00:17,515 --> 01:00:19,150
Our teamwork was great.

1002
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:20,752
Did you send an ambulance?

1003
01:00:35,867 --> 01:00:37,368
Dongman!

1004
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,407
What are you doing?

1005
01:00:46,677 --> 01:00:47,845
What are you doing there?

1006
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,314
-Do you work here?
-No.

1007
01:00:50,715 --> 01:00:51,783
We are unemployed.

1008
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:53,518
Pardon?

1009
01:00:54,352 --> 01:00:56,454
Unemployed. We are unemployed.

1010
01:00:56,921 --> 01:00:57,989
We are both unemployed.

1011
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,893
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

1012
01:01:02,593 --> 01:01:03,861
Where did we park our car?

1013
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:06,798
Hold on.

1014
01:01:07,598 --> 01:01:08,633
Run.

1015
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,835
Hey! Stop!

1016
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:13,204
If you go around stealing again,

1017
01:01:13,738 --> 01:01:16,574
you are out. Got it?

1018
01:01:18,443 --> 01:01:19,477
Get in.

1019
01:01:21,412 --> 01:01:23,347
Thief!

1020
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:24,782
Who did this?

1021
01:01:25,483 --> 01:01:27,585
What is this?

1022
01:01:27,819 --> 01:01:28,820
"Thief"?

1023
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,688
King's second wife is a thief.

1024
01:01:38,296 --> 01:01:42,400
Fight For My Way

1025
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:44,035
Don't look down on Seolhui.

1026
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:46,070
Why should she work during the party?

1027
01:01:46,337 --> 01:01:48,740
Tell me. Did we make you work?

1028
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,175
I won't forgive you if you look down on her.

1029
01:01:51,509 --> 01:01:53,478
Are you even going to marry her?

1030
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:55,813
Do you like coming here now?

1031
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:58,549
I will get to the point.

1032
01:01:58,783 --> 01:02:00,818
You're just pretending to be a friend.

1033
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:03,287
A psycho is better than a pathetic girl.

1034
01:02:03,788 --> 01:02:06,324
Do you like me? Let's not cross the line.

1035
01:02:06,524 --> 01:02:09,193
I don't want to hear
the psycho call me pathetic.

1036
01:02:09,494 --> 01:02:12,563
Let's be careful how
we act toward each other.
