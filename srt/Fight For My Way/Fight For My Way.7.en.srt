1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,160
You can't do this when someone is sick.

2
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,060
That is low.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,600
Then, I will be low today.

4
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:31,581
I...

5
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:34,051
Dongman.

6
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,760
This isn't what you think.

7
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:21,190
-Are you two dating?
-What?

8
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,660
Are you boyfriend and girlfriend? Are you?

9
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,230
No, not exactly.

10
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,540
If you aren't dating,
why would you kiss her?

11
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:32,470
You should ask her to be your girlfriend
and make it clear before kissing her.

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,780
Why are you coming onto
her without being clear?

13
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,640
Why are you just kissing
her like a scumbag?

14
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,516
Why do you care?

15
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,640
Drop the friends mumbo
jumbo and tell me clearly.

16
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,020
Who are you to her?

17
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,700
Do you like Aera?

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,280
Do you?

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,740
I...

20
00:02:06,977 --> 00:02:08,300
I am her guardian.

21
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,440
What?

22
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:13,680
He is so dependable that
I want to stab him.

23
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,880
Just have a fling. A fling.
Don't cross the line.

24
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,110
Watch it before I lose my temper.

25
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,640
Who are you to lose your temper?

26
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:21,825
What?

27
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,320
Why are you crossing the line?

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,180
Is there any reason why I can't date him?

29
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:32,636
He does all sorts of things to impress me.

30
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:34,437
He says I am a goddess.

31
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:36,606
That is why he is a fraud.

32
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:40,370
You are not a goddess, to be honest.

33
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,700
I said she is a goddess because she is.
Is it wrong?

34
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,082
See? He is a freak. So, put
up a wall between you.

35
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,052
-No. I don't want to.
-What?

36
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,350
Excuse me?

37
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,699
He is successful and kind.

38
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:55,280
He likes me like crazy. He
is crazy in love with me.

39
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,340
Why must I put up a wall between us?

40
00:02:58,528 --> 00:02:59,663
Why?

41
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,460
Did I say anything?

42
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,340
Who are you to interfere?

43
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,720
Do you like me?

44
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,880
I do like you! I do.

45
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,920
You, Seolhui and Juman
are all important to me.

46
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,280
You're a friend like family.

47
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,900
Since I am your friend,

48
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,172
congratulate me.

49
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:33,420
Congratulate you for what?

50
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,731
We kissed.

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,640
If friends do that, he is a
scumbag as you said. So,

52
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:42,305
we are dating as of today.

53
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,300
End of the argument.

54
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,520
I am so sorry.

55
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,167
Not at all.

56
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:16,006
I was totally moved by
what you said earlier.

57
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,340
When you said, "we are
dating," my heart...

58
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:23,913
I am sorry because,

59
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,710
it is not like I am totally
into you or anything.

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,754
I was being impulsive when
I said we were dating.

61
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,560
Even if you were, you can't take it back.

62
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,225
You can't take it back.

63
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,280
-What?
-Plenty of people kiss and then date.

64
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:42,332
Many grow on each other
after they start dating.

65
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:46,336
So, please give me just ten dates.

66
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,000
I know I can get you to like me.

67
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:54,577
I will make you a princess.

68
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,620
A princess?

69
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,960
-Me?
-Yes.

70
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:04,554
So whatever the case may
be, we are dating, right?

71
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:19,369
Hey!

72
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,980
Taxi will be expensive after midnight.
Aren't you ill?

73
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,600
We need to get a taxi!

74
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,480
Did you throw a rock at me?

75
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,710
Is that a real rock?

76
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,840
You didn't get hurt,
so you can't complain.

77
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,180
I can't complain?

78
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,753
What gibberish is that?

79
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:46,663
-Lovely Aera-Chan.
-What? Lovely what?

80
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,833
Call me before you go to sleep.

81
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,504
What? Why? Do you have
something to tell me?

82
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,820
Well...

83
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,940
Couples usually...

84
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,311
I see. That is why.

85
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:04,770
It has been so long since
I dated someone new.

86
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,120
I dated Mooki for two years, and my dating
brain cells have all died. Thus, I forgot.

87
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,089
Why are you rambling on like an idiot?

88
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,420
Anyway, let's talk before going to sleep.

89
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,890
Get home safely. Aera-Chan.

90
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,060
Okay.

91
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,237
Hey. Sit up front.

92
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:39,635
Episode 7

93
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:40,967
Hey, IBS.

94
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,180
Hey, Gas Girl.

95
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:44,954
Are you really dating?

96
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:47,657
Are you really?

97
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:49,058
Why would I fake it?

98
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,200
-Extra pork ears, please.
-Okay.

99
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,495
Extra liver for me.

100
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:55,965
Please, please!

101
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,000
Jerk.

102
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,440
I wasn't that crazy about Mooki at
first either, but I grew to like him.

103
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:04,240
Once I start dating, it lasts long.

104
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,470
I will do my best not to hurt a nice guy.

105
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,100
I told you that I am against it.

106
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,813
It seems shady.

107
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:12,170
Calling you a goddess is already weird.

108
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,884
How can you be a goddess? How?

109
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,560
Have you ever been slapped while eating?

110
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,560
Hey. Take it.

111
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:25,950
Aera. If he asks you to guarantee a loan,

112
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,164
tell him that you know a martial artist.

113
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,160
The way he sweet talks people is so fake.

114
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,703
"My lovely Aera-Chan"? A goddess?

115
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:35,305
I need to date him.

116
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:39,075
My life is too bitter and exhausting.
I need sugar.

117
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:42,979
Not a stupid guy friend.
Someone that is mine.

118
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,649
Someone sweet and forward. I
need someone that is mine.

119
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,355
It is a shame you aren't a
dog I can put a leash on.

120
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,630
Seolhui, this tastes good.

121
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,003
It is good.

122
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,980
Did you really get a boyfriend?
Today's the first date?

123
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:15,078
Yes. It is black or white with me.
No gray.

124
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:18,340
How could Aera be dating Moobin?

125
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,484
You and he keep getting
involved with the same girl.

126
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:24,110
What girl?

127
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,230
Don't you remember from high school?
Jang...

128
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,240
-Jang Heekyung.
-Jang Heekyung? No.

129
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,494
Then, is it Shim Minyoung?

130
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:34,220
I already told you that I never dated her.

131
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,200
Then, Choi Yunmi? The big mouth Yunmi?

132
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,237
Jang Boram. One of the Five Princesses.

133
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:45,108
Oh, the "I only date the best" girl?

134
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,320
I only date the best.

135
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:50,446
Moobin liked her.

136
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,370
-Really?
-Yes.

137
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,580
Why would my Moobin like someone like her?
She must have mistaken.

138
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,986
"My Moobin"?

139
00:08:57,387 --> 00:08:59,989
Yes. My lovely Moobin.

140
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:02,559
You have your Hyeran too.

141
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,020
Hey, Aera.

142
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,700
Don't do anything stupid
and come home early.

143
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,640
-Why?
-Why?

144
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,980
Is something going on?

145
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,210
Don't you want to watch "Happy Together"?
Twice is on.

146
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,584
Is Twice going to be on?

147
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:30,553
So don't talk back and
just come home early.

148
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:32,480
I'll see about that.

149
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,660
What? You will see?

150
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:37,493
My roommate. You aren't
staying out all night, right?

151
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,950
Will all Twice members be on?

152
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,666
Goodness. All of you have lost your minds.

153
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:47,403
Dongman. There is your bus.

154
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,280
See you tonight.

155
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:51,307
No. See you tomorrow.

156
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:56,100
I think you look great with a ponytail.

157
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,340
You look like Twice.

158
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,640
-Really?
-Yes.

159
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,816
Which member?

160
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,826
Ugh, I will kill you for sure.

161
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,060
There is a new building over there.

162
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,735
It is very profitable.

163
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,603
What about this gym?

164
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:24,000
This here? This is just a warehouse.

165
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,075
It isn't worth investing in.

166
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:31,114
I like this building.

167
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,330
What?

168
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,450
I feel like it's in a good location.

169
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:37,654
Right.

170
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,424
If the owner ever wants to
put it on the market,

171
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,460
contact me very first.

172
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,966
Yes, sure. I got it.

173
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,660
Become an Announcer with Boom Up Academy!

174
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,880
For a special case like you...

175
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,960
A special case?

176
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,520
You would need to take the
premium intensive course.

177
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:03,640
You are not young.

178
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,760
Also, you have no experience at all.

179
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,795
I see.

180
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:11,954
We just started a special course.

181
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:17,160
We have famous announcers come in
who are likely your role models.

182
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:19,996
-You look so pretty.
-You are beautiful!

183
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,520
-Oh my!
-You are my role model.

184
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,399
Can I take a picture with you?

185
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:27,904
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

186
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:29,806
Isn't she so pretty?

187
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,300
What an ill-fated relationship.

188
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:37,013
Interview for New Announcers

189
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,120
What kind of an announcer
do you want to become?

190
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,820
I want to become just like Baek Jiyeon.

191
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,850
I don't want to take after anyone.

192
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,520
I will make a name for
myself as Park Hyeran.

193
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,434
Honey.

194
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:07,120
She beat me with a "honey,"
then she upgraded to...

195
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,810
Father.

196
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:17,253
Upgraded to "Father-in-law."

197
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,440
And the game was already over.

198
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,700
Are you really going to try it?

199
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,480
What do you mean by that?

200
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:37,140
I just think you are brave.

201
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,242
If you can do it, why can't I?

202
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,480
If I try my best...

203
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,500
You sure do try hard at everything.

204
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
Did you park?

205
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,150
Yes, it is 2079.

206
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,225
Sure.

207
00:12:57,627 --> 00:12:58,628
Aera!

208
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,240
Oh, Moobin.

209
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,760
You are early.

210
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,500
Yes. It is our first official date.
I can't be late.

211
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,741
Hello.

212
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:14,143
Yes, hello.

213
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:20,049
What is it? Are you her fan too?

214
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,900
No, she's a VIP of my dad
hospital's, so I met her few times.

215
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,339
You were worried, but
it is settling in well.

216
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:34,890
Excuse me?

217
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,434
I see. Announcer Park,

218
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,520
you sure try hard too, huh?

219
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,880
-Let's go, Moobin.
-Okay.

220
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:51,840
Let's say your opponent
is weak and on the floor.

221
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,820
However, he is trying to
survive and is circling.

222
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,520
Then, just circle around with him.

223
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:59,180
Keep on hitting. Just keep punching.

224
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,040
Then, he will fall.

225
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,490
Then, choke him. This
isn't the Ultraman pose.

226
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,060
It is a choke. If he still has
strength, punch him again.

227
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,060
Hello!

228
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,669
He lost his strength! Take his left arm,

229
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,140
and do an arm lock.

230
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:18,841
Arm lock! This is the special move.

231
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:22,640
This is very dangerous and
you could kill people.

232
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,280
So don't use it recklessly.

233
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,210
Why would I ever need to choke anyone?

234
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,585
Come on. I think you do.

235
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:31,510
Is your husband coming home early?

236
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
Don't ask me.

237
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,201
I wish a dog would just snatch him away.

238
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,594
-What?
-The coach is the sexy type,

239
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,198
while he is cute like a son.

240
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,113
By the way, does Youngki's
mom know about him?

241
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:48,838
She wouldn't sit still if she did.

242
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,400
Who is Youngki's mom?

243
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,430
The landlord. Since the
coach is behind on rent,

244
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,740
she'll be mad if she knows a
new instructor was hired.

245
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,900
Wait.

246
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,640
We are behind on rent?

247
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,610
Brazilian Jiu-jitsu player played dirty!

248
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,790
The press is all about timing.
They are going to release this,

249
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,890
right after the match with Ko Dongman.

250
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,720
I got this in advance. Even
your initials are mentioned.

251
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,260
They are crazy.

252
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,120
Are they crazy?

253
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,214
Sue them for defamation right away.

254
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:24,500
Taksu, it is a fact. How can we sue them?

255
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,170
Then, what do you plan on doing?

256
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,440
Hold on. Issues need
another issue to cover it.

257
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,170
We need to find something bigger.

258
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,470
Like what?

259
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,817
What is worse than this?

260
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:36,690
Do you even realize how bad it is?

261
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,830
Instead of scheming something, train...

262
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,880
Forget it.

263
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,900
I am going to do things my way this time.

264
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,280
You all better keep your mouths shut.
Got it?

265
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:49,620
I can't give you any more time.
That is it.

266
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,578
Madam, I promise.

267
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:55,381
I will pay the rent next month for sure.

268
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:57,740
I am not a charity.

269
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,330
I have someone who wants to
buy this place right now.

270
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,500
Why should I be considerate of you?

271
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,815
Madam, don't be like that.

272
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:09,620
Don't you know I respect you?
I always bring you sundae.

273
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,480
Why do you keep bringing me sundae?
I am on a diet.

274
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,220
Are you on a diet? You
should be working out here.

275
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,261
Forget it. Anyway, I gave you a notice.

276
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,870
Madam, how can I move out next month?

277
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,160
Can't you please understand?

278
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,004
I know we will have a star
born from here. Madam?

279
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,506
Hey, scholarship student.

280
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:37,680
Hey, you. Jangho's favorite, Dongman.

281
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,249
What is with you again?

282
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,900
Shut up.

283
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,620
Why does the coach have to spend
his own money to train you?

284
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,320
Why does he have to do
this for your dream?

285
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,480
Did you know he started
working lunch hours too?

286
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,110
He told me it is a busy season for sundae.

287
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,360
How can there be seasons
for sundae, you fool?

288
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,307
Geez.

289
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:17,086
Madam.

290
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,020
Hello.

291
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:21,410
Did you finish talking already?

292
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,250
Well, I told him.

293
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,940
I am sorry.

294
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,980
The chief director came
from Japan all of a sudden.

295
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,000
I'll just greet him and come right back.

296
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,740
It is okay, take your time.

297
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,682
I will wait in the coffee shop.

298
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:49,685
Right? You are my girlfriend now,

299
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,580
so you wouldn't mind waiting for me.

300
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,960
Since you are my girlfriend.

301
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,700
You are like...

302
00:17:58,612 --> 00:17:59,490
Like?

303
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,429
A little kid!

304
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,367
Didn't you say you were born in 1990?

305
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:07,636
Pardon?

306
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:11,140
Dramas these days ruined all men.

307
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,976
Little kid? What?

308
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,140
My lovely Aera-Chan is sexy
when you sound like an old man.

309
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,880
It is just Aera. Don't say
"my lovely Aera-Chan."

310
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:24,987
Use your tongue properly.

311
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,580
I will. I will be right back.

312
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,590
What brings you here?

313
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,367
I have business to attend.

314
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:39,430
I see.

315
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,003
He even speaks Japanese.

316
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,440
Why is he so perfect?

317
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:49,011
New Patient Registration

318
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:09,231
Oh, hello.

319
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,980
I have been wanting to see you.

320
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,980
Why would you want to see me?

321
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,040
Well.

322
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,200
I wanted to officially apologize.

323
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:23,200
What? Same with me.

324
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,248
I want to officially apologize as well.

325
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,460
We heard from Moobin.

326
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:31,180
We didn't know this would happen.

327
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,920
Please excuse my manners.

328
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,220
So is it okay to do that if the girl
has nothing to do with your friend?

329
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,240
I am sorry.

330
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:45,960
We will have to keep
seeing each other, so...

331
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,236
Don't bother to sit.

332
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:51,600
Sure. Also, we have to
meet up tomorrow night.

333
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,977
It would be better if we
can make up in advance.

334
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,960
Why should I see you tomorrow?

335
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,200
Aren't you coming to the event
at 6 PM tomorrow?

336
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,300
The "People in Medicine" event.

337
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:03,960
"People in Medicine" event?

338
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,360
Maybe he didn't tell you yet.

339
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,820
He wasn't sure if he should ask you.

340
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,080
He didn't want to pressure you.

341
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,940
Everyone brings a date.

342
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,480
Moobin always came alone
and stayed in the corner.

343
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,900
I think he really likes you, Aera.

344
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,120
I think he almost loves you already.

345
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,160
Is that seafood stew?

346
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,720
You will never make a profit doing that.

347
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,382
The sundae too.

348
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:58,974
Do they really have to be so well-stuffed?

349
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,180
Your debut match is days away.
Why worry about sundae?

350
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,300
Aren't you getting back to training?

351
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,440
Did you do the jiu-jitsu move 100 times?

352
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,360
-I will come with you.
-Where to?

353
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:13,656
To sell sundae.

354
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:15,958
Why would you do that?

355
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,480
I will help you from today.

356
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,160
I will be your intern for no pay.

357
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,360
Drive-in cinema is so outdated.

358
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,840
One netizen,

359
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:40,316
had his first kiss in a drive-in cinema.

360
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:47,356
You should really stop
looking things up online.

361
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,200
Let's go to a street stall after this.

362
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:54,090
In "A Moment to Remember",
the actor and actress,

363
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,266
drink shots of soju
together at a street stall.

364
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,635
That was them acting.

365
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:03,772
To me, you are prettier than
Son Yejin or Koo Hyesun.

366
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,420
You are up there with Song Hyekyo.

367
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:11,980
You must like Song Hyekyo.

368
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,180
She's my ideal type.

369
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,180
Hey.

370
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,500
Is this your

371
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,680
first time?

372
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,020
What? What is?

373
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,900
When was your last relationship?

374
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,640
My last relationship,

375
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,380
was when I did my mandatory army service.

376
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,880
I liked the daughter
of a barbeque restaurant.

377
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,920
Now, I am not sure if I
liked her or the barbeque.

378
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,320
Did it go both ways? Did
you like each other?

379
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,710
That means you never
really dated a girl...

380
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,100
I am much experienced.

381
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,820
I am well-versed.

382
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:19,047
You are really well-versed.

383
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:21,750
Watch your hand.

384
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:24,153
Right.

385
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,440
-What?
-Hey, where is the salt?

386
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,020
-What?
-The salt!

387
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,800
The salt you borrowed from me last August.

388
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:40,469
Why do you need salt so late at night?
What a freak.

389
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:44,730
Not you, Moobin. I meant him.

390
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,308
Sure.

391
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,500
Hey, are you still with that jerk?

392
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,480
It is none of your business.

393
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,880
Are you indoors or outdoors?

394
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,760
I really think you need help.

395
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,950
Moobin, I will go outside
and be frank with him.

396
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,862
You can talk here.

397
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,600
Are you indoors or outdoors?

398
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,900
We are both indoors and outdoors.

399
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,142
What nonsense is that? Where are you?

400
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,950
In a car.

401
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,820
What? A car?

402
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,060
Why are you in a car?

403
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,440
To watch a movie.

404
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,580
Why would you watch a movie in a car?

405
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:35,280
We are at a drive-in.

406
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,759
What? A drive-in cinema?

407
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,430
Hang on.

408
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,780
Are you just watching a movie?

409
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,400
I will decide whether
I'll just watch a movie.

410
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,020
If you keep calling me for
nothing, I will block you.

411
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:04,686
Just hang up.

412
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,420
Wait. What is this noise?

413
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,500
What is this lunatic doing?

414
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,828
What is this noise?

415
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:14,029
This?

416
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,220
It is the sound of kissing.

417
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:19,434
Hello?

418
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:28,577
Damn!

419
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:34,016
No. Hang on. Let me think.

420
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:38,353
Drive-in cinemas in Seoul

421
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,450
Coach, are drive-in cinemas
different from DVD rooms?

422
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,590
What?

423
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,560
-Drive-in cinemas and what?
-Never mind.

424
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,440
How would you know? You
have never been to one.

425
00:25:56,872 --> 00:25:59,700
I have been to one before. I'm a huge fan!

426
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,860
"Are drive-in cinemas family-friendly?"

427
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,460
"Of course not."

428
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,020
"In a drive-in, I..."

429
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,010
What is he laughing about?

430
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,210
Laughing

431
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,287
What is he laughing about?

432
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:15,320
Laughing

433
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,220
Laughing

434
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,329
Damn!

435
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,772
What are you doing?

436
00:26:31,473 --> 00:26:32,700
Get in right now!

437
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,920
Why? What for? What is wrong?

438
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,550
I need to put these away. Wait a bit.

439
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,930
I need to go now!

440
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,480
-We need to take these!
-Get in!

441
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,260
Talk to me. Where are we going?

442
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,320
To sell sundae.

443
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:55,040
Hello? Is that the Jamsil drive-in cinema?

444
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,566
Are you showing a movie right now?

445
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,920
Movie sundae?

446
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,350
Are we selling in a cinema?

447
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,700
Is that the Namsan drive-in cinema?

448
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,920
Hey, don't be so rough.

449
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,060
Park properly. Hey you!

450
00:27:23,425 --> 00:27:24,526
You!

451
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,720
Where are you going?

452
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,440
Why did it go in there?

453
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,540
Aera!

454
00:27:49,117 --> 00:27:51,430
You brat! I am so sorry!

455
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,550
I am sorry.

456
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,900
I'm so sorry!

457
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,630
Another couple is kissing.
I hate this place.

458
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,080
This is so annoying.

459
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,280
Where is she?

460
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,390
-Hey, you!
-Why are you here for?

461
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,920
I was just...

462
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:22,084
Just a moment. I...

463
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,240
Where is he?

464
00:28:49,044 --> 00:28:50,730
Did you eat half the popcorn?

465
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,640
Yes, I was so hungry.

466
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,240
Aera, wear your seatbelt.

467
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,890
The movie is not over yet.

468
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,160
It is a happy ending.

469
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,350
What?

470
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,620
Where is he? Moobin!

471
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:11,199
Hey!

472
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,780
What did you just do?

473
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,600
-Hey!
-I've always wanted to pull a girl's hair.

474
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:31,787
Who on earth are you looking at?

475
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,100
It was worth the try.

476
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:51,206
But there is something
called a business district.

477
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,680
If we sold sundae, what about
the dried fish sellers?

478
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,230
What?

479
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,110
Drive-in cafeterias need the business.

480
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,480
I don't want to steal their
business to sell sundae.

481
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,360
That is my business motto.

482
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,340
Okay, fine. I won't come
up with ideas anymore.

483
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,128
I always told you.

484
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:16,665
Your head isn't meant to think of ideas.

485
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:38,787
What? Why do you keep calling?

486
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,590
What are you doing? Why
didn't you answer earlier?

487
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,960
I went around looking for you.

488
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,260
What do you mean?

489
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:47,362
What is it?

490
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:48,870
Is it urgent?

491
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,490
Never mind.

492
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,930
Get me some ice cream on your way home.

493
00:30:55,537 --> 00:30:58,340
When did I ever get you ice cream?

494
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:01,670
You never do, so you can get me one now.

495
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,580
Stop calling for no reason.

496
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,920
Is it Dongman again?

497
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,940
I don't know what is wrong with him today.

498
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:17,659
What is she doing? Why
does she keep hanging up?

499
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,527
Goodness.

500
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,260
Dongman.

501
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,510
I got grocery to make dinner for you.

502
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,800
You like carbonara pasta.

503
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:33,775
I don't like carbonara pasta.

504
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:35,911
I ate because you like it.

505
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:38,850
I guess there's something
I don't know about you.

506
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,500
You hardly know me.

507
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,380
When I was with you, I wasn't myself.

508
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:53,762
There she goes again. There she goes.

509
00:31:54,029 --> 00:31:56,564
Why isn't she getting off?

510
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,960
Aera, hold on.

511
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:07,642
Have a seat.

512
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,330
What is this?

513
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,490
Look at what the scumbag is doing.

514
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,865
Before we were dating,
I gave you sneakers.

515
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,380
But now that we are dating, I wanted
to give you something Cinderella-like.

516
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:38,306
Cinderella?

517
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,545
Try it on. I remembered your shoe size.

518
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,340
This too.

519
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:46,984
I wrote you a card too.

520
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,800
Hey.

521
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Aren't these real jewels?

522
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,370
-Pardon?
-If you keep giving me gifts,

523
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,160
I feel a little uncomfortable.
These look expensive.

524
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,431
Then,

525
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,220
I will be throwing 68
dollars down the drain.

526
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,738
What? 60 what?

527
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:15,076
The scary owner said they're on
sale, so they aren't refundable.

528
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,900
The owner who sold you these shoes?

529
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:21,783
Wait.

530
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:26,730
I will take these and buy you a pair too.

531
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,650
I'll get you something
costs about 100 dollars.

532
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,900
Let's just do it that way.

533
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:36,464
You don't have to give something back.

534
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:39,968
Hey. Move your car.

535
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:42,150
Move your car. Move.

536
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,180
Don't you know this
parking lot is reserved?

537
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,609
Is this your spot?

538
00:33:47,976 --> 00:33:49,110
Do you even have a car?

539
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:52,947
Right. Go back to your place. Why are
you trying to get in between us?

540
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:54,482
Annoyed?

541
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,330
They, do not come here!
This is my territory.

542
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,380
Huh!

543
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:02,380
Didn't Aera tell you to keep your
boundary? A guy friend like you,

544
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,927
shouldn't even talk to
her official boyfriend.

545
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,596
You don't know what you are saying.

546
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,843
I am not any guy friend to her.

547
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,130
What are you then?

548
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,869
Yes. What are you then?

549
00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:17,872
I am,

550
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,277
sort of,

551
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:26,147
her wifey.

552
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:29,710
What? Wife what?

553
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,686
Friends who have been through tough times.

554
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,080
Her owner. Major shareholder.
Her dad's proxy.

555
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:38,390
Did my dad say he will
give you the permission?

556
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,894
Are you taking his side?

557
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:42,220
Aera, are you taking my side?

558
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,133
Why would she take your side?
You are funny.

559
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,640
Why do you keep talking down on my Moobin?

560
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,870
My Moobin?

561
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,000
Have I ever called your
Hyeran this wench or witch?

562
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:55,210
You haven't?

563
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,420
I did it behind her back.

564
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,060
Only did it behind her back!

565
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,785
Chief

566
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:05,540
They're calling you again.

567
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,280
You should get going.
I'll call you tomorrow.

568
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,580
You should go too. Please!

569
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,694
I don't eat carbonara pasta.

570
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:15,730
My lovely Aera-Chan, tomorrow...

571
00:35:19,134 --> 00:35:20,135
Never mind.

572
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:22,310
Geez.

573
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,060
Damn it!

574
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:34,149
Hyeran was waiting in front of my house.

575
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:36,710
I didn't call her.

576
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,286
To Aera

577
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:47,896
From Dongman

578
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:51,733
Aera

579
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:56,810
-Yes.
-Why are you telling me this?

580
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,820
Well...

581
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,630
You might think I called her.

582
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,179
What was that about salt?
What about ice cream?

583
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:06,170
Why did you ask him to move the car?

584
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,740
It is reserved parking!

585
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,384
It isn't your parking lot.

586
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,470
You got home and he parked the car,

587
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,980
then you should get off and say goodbye.
Why were you wasting time?

588
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,092
For what?

589
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,761
Hey!

590
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:24,866
Goodness, she hung up again.

591
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:29,404
It is bothering me so much.

592
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:38,150
Pretty ladies fart too.

593
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,730
You're prettier than actresses.

594
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,830
He did all this by hand.

595
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,280
Don't be sick, Aera-Chan.

596
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,253
I spent three hours making this.

597
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,280
Back in middle school,

598
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,850
we used to write love
letters to our crush.

599
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,390
That is exactly what he is doing.

600
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,820
Stress causes gas!

601
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,930
Is this me?

602
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,238
I want you to date somebody
like him, and not Mooki.

603
00:37:09,177 --> 00:37:10,570
My day off

604
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,082
Aera, you are so pretty.
You are a goddess.

605
00:37:15,183 --> 00:37:17,552
For a woman to be happy,

606
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:20,680
she is supposed to meet a
man that likes her more,

607
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,310
and not the other way around.

608
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,750
Choi Aera

609
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,860
Oh, my. He liked all my photos.

610
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,033
Look at that.

611
00:37:34,402 --> 00:37:37,605
Moobin is a total psycho.

612
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
There are hearts everywhere.

613
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:43,721
He is chirping on her social media too.

614
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:45,513
My day off

615
00:37:46,748 --> 00:37:48,483
Aera, you're so pretty.
You are a goddess.

616
00:37:56,658 --> 00:37:57,659
What?

617
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,400
Why did this hater like it?

618
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:03,898
You are ugly.

619
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,769
My goodness.

620
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:14,070
He says she is prettier than
Son Yejin, Koo Hyesun,

621
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,943
and Song Hyekyo.

622
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,879
Song Hyekyo? Come on!

623
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,570
You mean Songhae, the old man?

624
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,770
National...

625
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,360
-Singing Contest!
-Singing Contest!

626
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,010
He made her a nice scrapbook,

627
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,955
and he got her heels like
Cinderella's crystal shoes.

628
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:32,120
Hey, this girl never watched any
princess cartoons when she was a kid.

629
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,590
Zhang Fei from "Three
Kingdoms" was her role model.

630
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,900
If Aera was a princess, she would have
ridden a horse and started a war.

631
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:41,502
Hey.

632
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:44,872
Are you going to that the
"People in Medicine" event,

633
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,270
today? Are you going?

634
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,677
Of course she is.

635
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:51,746
He is so good to her.

636
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:53,690
I can't stand him being discouraged.

637
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,850
I am going to look so insanely sexy...

638
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,280
Insanely what?

639
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:00,080
I am going to boost his morale.

640
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,624
Aera is such a loyal person.

641
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,690
If Aera were a dog,

642
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,596
she won't be Chihuahua or a Yorkshire.

643
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,099
She is more like a Shepherd, Jindo dog,

644
00:39:11,532 --> 00:39:15,190
Chow Chow, Tosa, a stray
dog on Mount Bukhan.

645
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,471
That is enough.

646
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,840
Let it go.

647
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:19,707
I'll bite you.

648
00:39:22,243 --> 00:39:23,470
Organic Food Development

649
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,710
Dolsan kimchi will be
delivered right to homes.

650
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,782
That is the important point.

651
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,240
-Mr Kim.
-Yes.

652
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:32,453
Mr Kim, are you familiar
with Chun's Kimchi?

653
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:35,010
I did speak to their marketing team.

654
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,380
I am trying to reach the owner, but...

655
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,220
No, I mean the family.

656
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,930
Do you personally know the Chun's family?

657
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,330
No way I do, but I will
try to get to know them.

658
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,835
Why did they say that then?

659
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:53,841
They picked you as the launching manager.
Specifically Juman of Sales Team.

660
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:55,743
What?

661
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:17,799
What happened?

662
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,280
I have good news. I got the
contract for Chun's Kimchi.

663
00:40:23,538 --> 00:40:24,700
-Really?
-Yes.

664
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,630
-Did you reach them?
-No, they picked me.

665
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,140
-They only want to speak to me.
-Really?

666
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,080
I'm trying to remember anybody with
that last name. But there aren't any!

667
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:36,784
I think it is because word
got out on how good you are.

668
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,650
The fishcakes and the salted fish.

669
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,680
Everything you launched sold out.
Everything!

670
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,125
You have a point.

671
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,120
They said if you make this one a
success, you would be promoted for sure.

672
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,932
Right. I am so happy I am losing my mind.

673
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,760
Why is this locked?

674
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:00,608
Someone must be inside.

675
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:05,160
They would have opened the door then.
It's locked.

676
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:07,181
-Get the key.
-Okay.

677
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,395
"It is becoming difficult to gauge,"

678
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:13,554
"the effect this will have
on the investment market."

679
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,400
"In order to revive the market..."

680
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,940
You are coming to the
event at 6 PM right?

681
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,300
The "People in Medicine" event.

682
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,380
Do I have to go?

683
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,920
Everyone brings a date.

684
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,480
Moobin always came alone
and stayed in the corner.

685
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,456
I think it would be awesome.

686
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,080
It would be awesome if
you would surprise me.

687
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,320
Why is he so foolishly nice?

688
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,460
I feel so bad.

689
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,220
Hello.

690
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,040
Were you napping?

691
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,520
Yes. I had food coma.

692
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:38,583
You had fries for lunch, right?

693
00:42:38,673 --> 00:42:40,007
I had cold noodles.

694
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,280
Then, why are your lips all shiny?

695
00:42:44,946 --> 00:42:46,781
It's like you are wearing lip gloss.

696
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,790
If there was girl here, we would
have thought you were,

697
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,700
kissing or something.

698
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,060
What brings you all here?

699
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,100
Didn't you get the
emergency meeting email?

700
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,940
The Chun's Kimchi was
scheduled for a show.

701
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,140
So, where should we start?

702
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,000
Chun's Kimchi.

703
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,560
Hey. The gym was sold.

704
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:19,246
What? What do we do then?

705
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,950
Are we out on the street?

706
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,550
But they said to stay.

707
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,780
They said to move out just yesterday.

708
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:28,255
The buyer from yesterday didn't buy it.

709
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,124
A new buyer showed up and bought it.

710
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,820
-So sudden?
-But that new owner said,

711
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,220
to let the gym continue operating.

712
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,399
Why did that warehouse
suddenly become so hot?

713
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,280
Is it going to undergo redevelopment?

714
00:43:42,603 --> 00:43:44,860
Darn it. The owner's
daughter-in-law is back.

715
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,710
Hey, you! Mandong!

716
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,600
If you swipe the money
again, you are dead meat!

717
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:54,482
Mister!

718
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,280
How could you do this in
front of our restaurant?

719
00:43:58,786 --> 00:43:59,854
Move it!

720
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,820
Rather than what we always do,

721
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,640
is there a fresh, new idea?

722
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,680
Who is snoring?

723
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:31,180
Why don't we step out
and get some fresh air?

724
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,700
Let's have a smoke.

725
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,180
Yejin. Why don't you use
the restroom or something?

726
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:48,560
-Mr Kim.
-Yejin.

727
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,620
Don't say anything.

728
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,280
How about a smoke,

729
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,900
or a snack.

730
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:58,070
How much must I show you?

731
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,210
What do you mean? What did I see?
Don't say that.

732
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,110
My heart. How much of my
heart must I show you?

733
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,087
Let's talk another time.

734
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:09,340
We even kissed by the copier.

735
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,970
Why won't you say
anything about that kiss?

736
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,160
When did we ever...

737
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,460
You kissed me. I didn't kiss you.

738
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:22,436
Since we kissed, there
should be something else.

739
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,700
Why are you acting the same?

740
00:45:25,206 --> 00:45:28,870
To you, is a kiss nothing but a kiss?

741
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,890
Why do you keep talking about kissing?

742
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,180
-All we did was kiss.
-Stop it.

743
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:34,810
All we did was kiss!

744
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,083
Forget it.

745
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,520
Did you two kiss?

746
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,260
I should have told him my true size.

747
00:46:13,554 --> 00:46:14,510
Guest List

748
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,626
Only members are permitted
in our private lounge.

749
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:23,820
People who are not on the list must
be accompanied by someone who is.

750
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:25,800
I see.

751
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:30,738
Then, I will call him and come back later.

752
00:46:34,108 --> 00:46:36,977
People in Medicine

753
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,500
I wanted to surprise him.

754
00:47:27,962 --> 00:47:29,420
What's going on?

755
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,080
Who is she? Do you know her?

756
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,700
She is a patient.

757
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:37,471
She got a nose job,

758
00:47:37,638 --> 00:47:39,440
at our hospital.

759
00:47:40,174 --> 00:47:41,242
I see.

760
00:47:44,378 --> 00:47:45,379
Dad!

761
00:47:46,013 --> 00:47:47,270
I will wait for you inside.

762
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,430
Okay. Go in first with the director.

763
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,500
Okay.

764
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:51,986
Dad.

765
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,900
Hi, my sweet Mei-Chan.

766
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,820
I am done with the consultation.

767
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,200
I will be right in.

768
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:12,039
Chief

769
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:21,600
The chief that kept calling,

770
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,880
was the woman you are marrying?

771
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,054
Yes.

772
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,320
She's your "sweet Mei" and
I'm your "lovely Aera"?

773
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:33,150
So you always listened to Japanese songs.

774
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,280
Aera. My feelings for you were sincere.

775
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:39,166
I like you more than Mei.

776
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:40,930
I could really talk to you...

777
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,000
That is a given. It is
because I am Korean.

778
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:48,840
You are funnier and spunky. Also,
you're beautiful like a goddess.

779
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:52,040
You are 100 percent my dream girl.

780
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,360
So what?

781
00:48:55,749 --> 00:48:57,985
Did you want to break off your engagement?

782
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:59,153
No.

783
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,380
-I'd be a horrible son.
-This makes you a good one?

784
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,620
They bought all the tickets
for the event too.

785
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,793
Stop.

786
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:11,240
When were you planning on dumping me?

787
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,080
The day before your wedding?

788
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,200
I wasn't planning on breaking up with you.

789
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:20,380
Why should we break up just
because I get married?

790
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:22,643
What?

791
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,900
Nothing has changed between us.

792
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,220
When I'm in Korea, I can
completely focus on you.

793
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,385
You...

794
00:49:35,689 --> 00:49:38,230
You are a real piece of trash.

795
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,800
Aera. This costs ten times
more than 68 dollars.

796
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:47,360
I will make it up to you by making
you a princess with other things.

797
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,940
Why did you have to,

798
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,580
come when I didn't even ask you to?

799
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,300
With that innocent-looking face,

800
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:02,180
you lied about everything. How...

801
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,640
I didn't lie. I was sincere.

802
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,820
I told you,

803
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,580
to go out on ten dates with me.

804
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,440
Is that what,

805
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,320
those ten dates meant?

806
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,940
It is so good to see you again.

807
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,170
Has it been ten years after graduation?

808
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,390
Hey. We met once after graduation.

809
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,000
Oh, did we?

810
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,820
When was it?

811
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:39,160
That is how I finally grew up.

812
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,100
You know, right?

813
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,780
I only date the best.

814
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,080
I will introduce you to
my man, Moobin soon.

815
00:50:49,263 --> 00:50:50,764
-Okay.
-Gee.

816
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,910
I haven't heard that line in so long.

817
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,160
Where are we going anyway?

818
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:59,500
I ran into someone I
hadn't seen in a while.

819
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,720
I wanted to show you too.

820
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:08,520
Darn it. I barely took a bite.

821
00:51:09,883 --> 00:51:10,984
Let's go.

822
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,460
-Welcome!
-Welcome.

823
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,520
-How much would you like?
-Fill it up.

824
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,292
Fill it up? Okay.

825
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,290
Excuse me. You don't need
to wash my windshield.

826
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,870
-Okay.
-You are so sweaty.

827
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,980
Wait a second.

828
00:51:34,975 --> 00:51:37,021
What high school did you go to?

829
00:51:37,111 --> 00:51:38,812
Chunbang High. Why?

830
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:41,360
Right? Moobin.

831
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,940
It is me, Dongman. From Chunbang High!

832
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:48,120
Boram. Do you know this man?

833
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,760
He says he went to our school.

834
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:55,790
I felt like he dated me just to show
you that he took something from you.

835
00:51:58,398 --> 00:51:59,600
Dongman.

836
00:52:02,236 --> 00:52:05,706
Dongman adores you so much.

837
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,260
I think that's why I was
so drawn to you at first.

838
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:13,720
But...

839
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:17,740
My feelings for you are sincere now.

840
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,680
What does Dongman have to do with it?

841
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,050
He is such a show-off.

842
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,140
He has nothing, but he is always so happy.

843
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,980
That annoys me.

844
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,020
Even if he shows off, even
if he has nothing,

845
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,980
he's better than a piece
of trash like you.

846
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,800
Why won't she pick up?

847
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,420
He is a scumbag through and through.

848
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,657
What? What did he send?

849
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,240
How could he send me his
wedding invitation?

850
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,480
You must think,

851
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,260
the world is full of women dying
to ride on your white horse,

852
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:18,780
but Cinderella stories are
centuries old already.

853
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:20,814
In the real world,

854
00:53:21,582 --> 00:53:25,085
it is filled with moronic
women who work hard,

855
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,760
and succeed on their own.

856
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,600
So, take your glass slippers,

857
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,360
and feed them to the dogs.

858
00:54:00,354 --> 00:54:02,990
Dongman

859
00:54:06,526 --> 00:54:09,963
Forget that Cinderella brat
who sold a lie to girls.

860
00:54:10,364 --> 00:54:12,699
The barefoot general Zhang Fei,

861
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:17,804
of the Three Kingdoms who commanded
thousands is much sexier.

862
00:54:22,743 --> 00:54:26,280
You know that Shikyung is a prankster.

863
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,100
I understand.

864
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,480
That is how ugly an
inferiority complex is.

865
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:38,880
Then, you wasted that money
for the suite for nothing.

866
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,960
The suite at the hospital?

867
00:54:41,928 --> 00:54:43,297
I didn't pay for that.

868
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,690
What?

869
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:49,970
When I went to pay for it,
someone had already did.

870
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,520
Dongman must have paid for it.

871
00:54:54,608 --> 00:54:57,854
Then, you didn't lose anything.
Good riddance.

872
00:54:57,944 --> 00:55:00,614
That girl was a total freak anyway.

873
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,284
Dongman

874
00:55:45,692 --> 00:55:46,793
Hey.

875
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,190
What happened? Why are you here like this?

876
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,740
How did you know I'm here?

877
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,000
Where is that punk? Get up!
Take me to him!

878
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,680
Sit down.

879
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,940
Just stay with me.

880
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,020
Look at me.

881
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:16,480
Did you get hit again?

882
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,250
Did he hit you?

883
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,229
Would I let a punk like that hit me?

884
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,570
I let him have it and left.

885
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,420
Then, why are you shivering?

886
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:31,000
Why are you looking so pathetic?
It is annoying!

887
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,680
Also, why do you keep losing your shoes?

888
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:42,780
It is not like he scammed me out of money.

889
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:45,285
It is not like I love him.

890
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:49,350
I only dated him because I was angry.

891
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,380
I'm not pathetic just because
he looks down on me.

892
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,460
As long as I don't think I am pathetic,

893
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,800
it doesn't matter then.

894
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,470
What the...

895
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,300
Just tell me where the hell he is!

896
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:19,200
I just stepped on a turd, that's all.

897
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:24,050
So, stop overreacting. It is annoying.

898
00:57:26,259 --> 00:57:28,295
If you get slapped by someone,

899
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,380
and then someone else takes your side,

900
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,540
it just makes you cry for no reason.

901
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,660
It's nothing to cry about.

902
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:19,540
Stop doing things like this.
Stay out, will you?

903
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,649
Stop roaming around and getting me angry.

904
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,600
Just stay holed up in
your house or something.

905
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,240
Just don't think of dating any men.

906
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,820
What's it to you whether
I date a man or not?

907
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:38,060
Why are you hugging me?

908
00:58:43,403 --> 00:58:45,205
I told you to stay out of it.

909
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,540
I told you that you'll get into a trouble.

910
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,060
Would I get involved if
you did anything right?

911
00:58:52,812 --> 00:58:56,540
It is because you always
cry and step on a turd...

912
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,920
You make my heart flutter!

913
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,700
What?

914
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,280
My heart flutters,

915
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,660
every time you do that.

916
00:59:16,269 --> 00:59:17,904
That is why.

917
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,920
My heart flutters.

918
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,400
Something is wrong with me.

919
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,860
Thanks Choi Wooshik for
the special appearance.

920
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,570
It is Moobin.

921
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,810
That doctor is Park Moobin, right?

922
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,386
Yes, he is.

923
01:00:06,553 --> 01:00:09,810
There is no justice in this world.

924
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,320
-Why?
-Well, never mind.

925
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,520
Do you know Dr. Park?

926
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,070
Personally?

927
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,400
I really shouldn't say this.

928
01:00:18,632 --> 01:00:20,600
It's so gross, I am shaking.

929
01:00:20,734 --> 01:00:22,002
-Did you hear?
-What?

930
01:00:22,235 --> 01:00:24,037
Dr. Park Moobin of cosmetic surgery.

931
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:27,751
He seduced an innocent woman
while he was engaged.

932
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:31,870
He asked her to see him even
after he got married. Nasty.

933
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,840
-So?
-So...

934
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,970
So, she...

935
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:39,653
I turned it into a huge rumor
and made people gossip.

936
01:00:40,453 --> 01:00:42,355
She hung herself.

937
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:47,190
-The woman hung herself.
-What?

938
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,361
She's dead.

939
01:00:48,795 --> 01:00:49,796
Really?

940
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,320
She already died.

941
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,499
She died?

942
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:54,834
She died.

943
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:58,960
This wedding is canceled.

944
01:00:59,939 --> 01:01:00,970
Fight For My Way

945
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:05,745
You can make this kimchi project
a big hit and get married.

946
01:01:07,047 --> 01:01:09,910
You can't forget about him
from my failed love stories.

947
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,950
My first true love.

948
01:01:13,286 --> 01:01:16,656
Do you still think about your first love?

949
01:01:17,457 --> 01:01:18,650
You guys are dating?

950
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:21,061
Soon, he'll be my official boyfriend.

951
01:01:21,227 --> 01:01:23,930
Why are you doing this to me?

952
01:01:24,531 --> 01:01:27,230
You don't listen to me at all.

953
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,502
You said you don't like seeing me fight.

954
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,330
Is this your playground?

955
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:32,816
Why did you bring a woman?

956
01:01:32,906 --> 01:01:35,200
You'll get knocked out
in your debut match.

957
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:36,980
Get it together, punk.
