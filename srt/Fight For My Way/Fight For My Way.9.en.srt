1
00:00:02,152 --> 00:00:03,320
Episode 9

2
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,720
Why does he have his shirt off?

3
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:24,908
No way!

4
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:27,110
He is so handsome.

5
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:29,646
He must be a rookie.

6
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:31,815
Yes?

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,664
Why are you zooming in?

8
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:36,930
-Pardon?
-I said, why are you zooming in?

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,450
Goodness, what is this?

10
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:43,334
I can zoom in or take a video if I want.
Who are you?

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,120
Why are you zooming in when
he is about to get beat up?

12
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,465
What is wrong with you?

13
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:50,567
Weighing 70 kg.

14
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:52,760
Professional MMA debut match.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,660
Is she out of her mind?

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,374
He is a rookie street fighter.

17
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:01,945
Here comes Ko Dongman!

18
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:05,115
Keep it clean!

19
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:06,540
Keep it clean!

20
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,251
Ready, fight!

21
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:26,670
What do I do?

22
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:29,606
What if he gets beaten up again?

23
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,338
What are you doing?

24
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:05,475
I won.

25
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,612
Do you really have to do this?

26
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:13,016
I can't bear to watch.

27
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:20,657
I am in trouble.

28
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:26,129
Now,

29
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,960
you look pretty even when you cry.

30
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:52,713
Look at you. You are such a girl now.

31
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:15,322
Hey.

32
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,251
What?

33
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:20,415
Why are you holding my hand like that?

34
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:23,757
What about it?

35
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:25,873
Does your heart flutter?

36
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:29,464
Does it?

37
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:33,601
Why do you keep asking me?

38
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:37,138
I don't think it is just you.

39
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:39,740
I feel strange too.

40
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:41,642
What?

41
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:44,745
I could only see you from afar.

42
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,317
I feel like you are
somehow getting pretty.

43
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:54,621
I only thought about doing headlocks,

44
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,811
and mooning each other before.

45
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:57,938
Hey!

46
00:03:58,264 --> 00:03:59,954
How can you say that?

47
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:05,266
When I hold your hand,

48
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,769
it feels good.

49
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:11,672
What?

50
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,941
When you look at me...

51
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,111
What about when I look at you?

52
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:20,381
I sometimes want to kiss you.

53
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:25,519
What? How are you so honest?

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,884
You should keep that to yourself.

55
00:04:27,974 --> 00:04:29,623
Why? Do you feel the same?

56
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,892
Do you think about it by yourself?

57
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:37,464
Don't think out loud. Okay?

58
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,219
Thank you.

59
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:01,989
Honey. Do you think Dongman...

60
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,659
"Honey"?

61
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:13,824
What are you doing here?

62
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:15,903
I swear I heard you say "honey".

63
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:18,927
You did, didn't you?

64
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,141
What?

65
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:27,915
She called him "honey".

66
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:32,419
I swear I heard her say it.

67
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:02,549
She got it done.

68
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,992
What is she? An ostrich?

69
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:14,392
Why are her lashes so long?

70
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,742
Are they hers?

71
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,513
I am speechless.

72
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,862
Are they yours?

73
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:32,467
Then, why did he make
100 photocopies for me?

74
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:35,415
Why did he fix the copier?

75
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,150
Did Mr Kim do things like that for you?

76
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:43,921
Who cares if he looks like Park Bogum?

77
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,156
I really...

78
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:49,487
I really...

79
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,429
I really like him.

80
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,233
I really like him, that is why.

81
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,537
Why did you run?

82
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:01,667
What?

83
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:04,907
What do I do?

84
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,467
What do you mean? Why do you care?

85
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:09,887
Still, she is a coworker.

86
00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:13,827
She got drunk and passed out at a
bus stop. We can't just leave her.

87
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:16,502
Then? Will you let her
sleep at your place?

88
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,591
Mom

89
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:29,333
I am so glad she has such nice coworkers.
Thank you.

90
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:32,567
You must live in the same neighborhood.

91
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:37,441
We had a company dinner nearby.

92
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:39,776
You are Kim Juman, correct?

93
00:07:40,507 --> 00:07:42,287
Yes. How did you know my name?

94
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:45,916
I would really like to
see you again sometime.

95
00:07:48,307 --> 00:07:49,417
Sure.

96
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:01,932
Goodness.

97
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:06,737
Why can't you stop moving your chin?

98
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:09,506
Well...

99
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:13,877
Why don't you two spend some time alone?

100
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:17,514
Hey. What do you mean?

101
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:22,519
There you go again.

102
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:24,988
Will you cry every time I win?

103
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:28,387
You flew high in ten years.

104
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:32,767
I followed you around for ten years,

105
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,533
just to see that again.

106
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:41,537
Be good to me.

107
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,541
Give me a life of luxury.

108
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:52,282
Go home.

109
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:54,484
Get in your truck and leave.

110
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:56,147
Hey.

111
00:08:56,847 --> 00:08:59,517
Let me hug you just once.

112
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:04,617
-What?
-Didn't you see Park Jisung hug Hiddink?

113
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:05,727
Like this.

114
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:09,957
This guy is such a pain.

115
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:11,778
Try it.

116
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:15,005
People will get the wrong
idea if they see us.

117
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,146
My baby.

118
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,949
-Move your car.
-Hello!

119
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:37,627
Look. I don't judge,

120
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:40,867
but move the car first,
then you can continue.

121
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,834
Continue what? What do you mean?

122
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:46,536
Who is that?

123
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,239
I have seen her before.

124
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:57,347
You are a star now. Eat some meat.

125
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:00,117
Here, Mr Star.

126
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:02,527
Star?

127
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,059
You all...

128
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:11,928
Did you see?

129
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,096
Here.

130
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:40,056
What's going on? Why is
he working out so early?

131
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:48,642
Super Rookie Ko Dongman KOs
Opponent in 19 Seconds

132
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,987
Kim Taksu Stunned by Rookie's Kick

133
00:10:50,077 --> 00:10:52,369
It must eat him up inside.

134
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,173
No wonder he tried to keep him out.

135
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:04,387
Donghee, it is time for breakfast.

136
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:06,087
Come out.

137
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:09,152
Ko Dongman KOs Opponent in 19 Seconds

138
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:15,317
Thanking a Fan

139
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:17,861
Why am I a fan?

140
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:20,487
We are true fans.

141
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:23,154
We were Dongman's cheering
squad since grade school.

142
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,569
Why did they blur out my face?

143
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:27,370
Am I a criminal or something?

144
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:30,637
Are you practicing enunciation?
Cheongju, tomorrow?

145
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:32,075
Cheongju KBC.

146
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:36,107
I am going to knock them
dead at this interview.

147
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:38,715
That is right.

148
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:40,967
-Seolhui.
-Yes?

149
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:46,497
I will deposit this month's
rent by next weekend.

150
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:49,517
Let's forget about this month.
I paid it already.

151
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:52,927
Hey. Why did you pay the rent by yourself?

152
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:56,487
If I end up quitting my job,
you can pay that month.

153
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:57,868
Then, we will be even.

154
00:11:58,027 --> 00:12:00,737
Then, I will use my
"announcer friend lifeline."

155
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:08,422
Go on. Practice.

156
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:15,187
Namil Villa

157
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:39,637
Why are you calling so early?

158
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:43,197
Can't your daughter call
early in the morning?

159
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:44,907
Why are you being like that?

160
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:47,551
What have you been up to?

161
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,954
-Well.
-Are you even making money?

162
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:53,290
Are you even eating?

163
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:55,659
What about rent?

164
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,717
You don't think I can
even afford to pay rent?

165
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:00,627
Stop being stupid. I will send you money.

166
00:13:00,717 --> 00:13:02,457
Don't you dare.

167
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:05,297
Don't annoy me, okay?

168
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:07,867
How can you pay rent
after quitting your job?

169
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:11,308
I am the one who quit. Why
should you have to pay?

170
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,445
I am the one who quit, so
I'll take care of it myself.

171
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:18,407
Spend your own money, Dad.

172
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:22,485
Your grown daughter can't even send
you money. Why are you keep giving?

173
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:26,323
I feel really cruddy
whenever I take your money.

174
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,292
Don't you dare send it.

175
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:37,167
His store isn't even doing well.

176
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:45,867
Youth, My Way

177
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:51,007
So this is a program about super
rookies of all different fields.

178
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:54,347
So I will be the super
rookie of MMA fighting?

179
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:55,477
Of course.

180
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,420
I know what your fist feels like.

181
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,697
-I see.
-Don't feel bad.

182
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:05,057
We can laugh about it now.

183
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:08,164
I don't know about laughing.

184
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:11,557
Anyway, after what happened back then,

185
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:14,337
I never thought you would
call me first like this.

186
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:16,539
With this too,

187
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:18,451
and the blind date.

188
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,707
Come on. That was ancient history.

189
00:14:20,797 --> 00:14:23,267
We can have a drink and
let bygones be bygones.

190
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:24,881
You are so sensitive.

191
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,807
Anyway, while we are on the
topic, should we set it up?

192
00:14:27,897 --> 00:14:29,552
What's Aera up to these days?

193
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,088
Don't ask me about her.

194
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,566
The fight money has been
deposited minus the tax.

195
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:25,775
Mom! It is your son!

196
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:29,479
Yes, that great son of yours.

197
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:31,981
Your son sent you some money.

198
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:34,307
If you don't do it right, I won't pay you.

199
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:35,985
I sent you spending money.

200
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:37,647
Do you need spending money?

201
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,989
No, I sent you money.

202
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,027
Did you send me spending money? Why?

203
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:47,297
Mom. I made money doing
something I actually like.

204
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:49,275
It is really meaningful, you see.

205
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,967
So I decided to wire you some.

206
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,169
Are you in trouble?

207
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:57,073
I am about to get into some real trouble.

208
00:15:57,774 --> 00:15:59,242
Believe in your son.

209
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:05,248
Why? Is Dongman in trouble again?

210
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,950
Don't say "again."

211
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:11,087
Gosh, seriously!

212
00:16:12,756 --> 00:16:15,592
It is just that my eldest son,

213
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:17,957
said he wired me some money.

214
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,227
For me to use.

215
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:23,043
He is so concerned that I work too hard.

216
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:25,535
That is all he seems to care about.

217
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:27,470
He doesn't want me to suffer.

218
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:30,984
He is always saying he will
let me retire comfortably.

219
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,309
It was a really short call.

220
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:35,407
Did he say all that?

221
00:16:36,112 --> 00:16:37,113
What?

222
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:39,949
You know he talks fast.

223
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,218
Where would he get the money?

224
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:46,923
He can be so silly.

225
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,725
I told him not to bother.

226
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:52,105
Can you post it from here?

227
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:53,196
Yes.

228
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:56,527
Write down the recipient's address.

229
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:57,727
Sure.

230
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,539
Wonmi-dong, Bucheon

231
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:07,977
Kangmi Villa Suite 101, Ko Donghee

232
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:21,491
I have to give a presentation
on tomorrow's show.

233
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:24,861
I can't get promoted if you
don't charge my batteries.

234
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:26,629
Right?

235
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,766
This is just a charge.

236
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,137
A rapid charge.

237
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,419
No way. Who is that?

238
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:17,647
Why are you coming out of there?

239
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:20,747
I wanted to get some coffee.

240
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:21,985
Did you walk down?

241
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:26,489
Did you walk down from the
10th floor to get coffee?

242
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,191
Yes.

243
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,117
I am trying to lose weight, you see.

244
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:34,457
Wow, Mr Kim's quite
interested in fashion.

245
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:37,667
Look. He got something on his lips.

246
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:38,868
Hang on.

247
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,787
Were you in there...

248
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,342
-Eating something?
-No.

249
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,344
Excuse me.

250
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:52,148
I am right. He ate something.

251
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:58,655
You said MMA is your priority
and sundae is second.

252
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:02,347
Then, why are you out here at lunchtime?
You aren't a breadwinner.

253
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:04,387
The mothers who live here,

254
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,397
wait for my suondae to
come by at lunchtime.

255
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:11,997
Of course, it could be
me they are waiting for.

256
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:14,237
Right, of course it is.

257
00:19:14,647 --> 00:19:16,907
Why don't you run for office?

258
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:20,376
Get ready to go to Daecheon tomorrow.

259
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:21,607
Daecheon beach?

260
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,656
To eat clams?

261
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,249
Do you think you have time for clams?

262
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:28,247
We are going to make money.

263
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:33,723
Daecheon Scallop Festival. You are going
to demonstrate how to smash things.

264
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,658
I must perform in public?

265
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:38,567
You can practice and make money.

266
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:42,057
You can't do anything
on 900 dollars a month.

267
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,334
You want to buy your mom a house,

268
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,337
get your dad a new car,
and support your sister.

269
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,647
You need to get married soon too.

270
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:51,107
How much for this?

271
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:53,147
As if you ever paid for the sundae.

272
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:55,611
I will pay for everything I ate so far.

273
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:59,617
Hey, I thought you wouldn't be here today!

274
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:01,577
Hello, madam.

275
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:05,098
Jangho had to come because
he misses you so much.

276
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:07,617
-I miss you too.
-I miss you more.

277
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,759
You two are ridiculous.

278
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:11,417
-Sundae?
-Yes.

279
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:12,817
-How much?
-Three portions.

280
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:13,927
-Three?
-With offal.

281
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:16,833
-I'll give you some extra.
-Thank you.

282
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:20,603
The offal is extra tasty today.

283
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:22,271
Sounds perfect.

284
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,417
I turn 30 pretty soon.

285
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,857
This is an embarrassing present.

286
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:47,157
You loved stuffed toys since you were six.

287
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,332
These can't even be recycled.

288
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,101
They don't fit in trash bags either.

289
00:20:52,387 --> 00:20:55,037
They need to be torn into pieces first.

290
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:59,777
Juman, brace yourself and log in.

291
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:02,227
What? Me? Why?

292
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:05,977
I left a little something
in your item box.

293
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,520
A suit of armor? You bought me armor?

294
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:14,047
This is awesome! I feel like crying.

295
00:21:14,137 --> 00:21:16,793
Did you not get Aera anything?

296
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:19,227
This. They are supposed to be comfortable.

297
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:22,397
Hey, this is for everyone.

298
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,257
Why don't I get anything?

299
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:27,403
You don't like stuffed toys or games.

300
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:30,273
-I couldn't get you anything.
-I didn't ask you to!

301
00:21:32,642 --> 00:21:34,848
Get me something for me.

302
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,515
Let's have another drink.
How about mulberry wine?

303
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,467
Let's order chicken feet.

304
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:48,191
Which one? Very spicy? Medium? Not spicy?

305
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:51,327
I suddenly feel very sleepy.

306
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:55,727
I think I am coming down with something.

307
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,903
Great. Alcohol will chase away the aches.

308
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:03,827
Forget it. We're tired as well.

309
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:05,547
Let's all go home.

310
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,577
-Are you tired?
-Just go.

311
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:12,487
Is it normal for someone
to suddenly feel sick?

312
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:25,827
Do you think those two will
really cross the line?

313
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,432
That man,

314
00:22:30,627 --> 00:22:33,927
will make it big one day.
He is my friend,

315
00:22:34,504 --> 00:22:36,339
but I swear he is a great man.

316
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:40,137
Why? Because he got you the armor?

317
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:42,907
I told you to quit playing games.

318
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:47,917
I need to shower.

319
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:06,997
What? Do you have something for me?

320
00:23:08,104 --> 00:23:09,597
You got me something, right?

321
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:10,806
Hey.

322
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:21,217
Where are you taking it out from?

323
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,090
Open it.

324
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:45,074
Why is it so yellow?

325
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:47,777
Pure gold.

326
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:50,112
Pure gold?

327
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,537
Who gifts gold rings these days?

328
00:23:53,627 --> 00:23:55,952
Pure gold is an investment.

329
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:57,687
Pure gold,

330
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:00,327
can be sold when you are broke.

331
00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:03,487
Are we a third-world country?

332
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:07,167
You played a big role,

333
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:09,747
in making me get back into sports.

334
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:12,227
Seeing you with a microphone,

335
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:14,667
made me want to try again.

336
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:18,908
You even came to root for me.

337
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:22,712
Is that why you got me a gold ring?

338
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:27,377
Gold is an investment as
well as an emergency fund.

339
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,327
It could pay rent.

340
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:35,691
You really are a country bumpkin.

341
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:38,307
Pure gold is the best.

342
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,796
Thieves never leave gold behind.

343
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:43,332
We lost all the gold rings we had hidden.

344
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:47,937
I can't wear this in public,

345
00:24:48,037 --> 00:24:49,797
and I can't sell it right away.

346
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:52,967
Gold is priced quite high at the moment.

347
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:59,415
Why did you get me a ring of all things?

348
00:25:00,787 --> 00:25:02,627
You are giving me the shivers.

349
00:25:27,237 --> 00:25:30,047
Don't I look too simple for an interview?

350
00:25:30,347 --> 00:25:33,377
I did your hair since you were six.

351
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:38,487
You need to look twice as neat to
look as neat as everyone else.

352
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:42,925
One mistake could turn you
into a rowdy country girl.

353
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:49,532
By the way, did he go running again?

354
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:51,467
He's acting like a professional.

355
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,305
I have been following
him since I was a kid.

356
00:25:57,187 --> 00:25:59,867
He probably forgot that I
have an interview today.

357
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:04,880
Hey.

358
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,583
Here comes the martial arts master.

359
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:14,287
Have some taffies.

360
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:16,327
Did you go to get those?

361
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:18,707
Who sells taffies early in the morning?

362
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:22,767
Well, I was walking,

363
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:25,401
and saw some.

364
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:28,337
-On the way back...
-Was it on the ground?

365
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:31,907
-Yes.
-I guess people drop things on the ground.

366
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:36,379
It is leftover taffy then.

367
00:26:42,952 --> 00:26:44,430
I am going to Cheongju KBC.

368
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,589
-I am...
-You are going to fight.

369
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:48,958
I am going to get the kimchi contract.

370
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:52,687
I am going to look after you.
I am your office wife.

371
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:57,199
-Let's do our best.
-Let's cause some trouble.

372
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,211
Cause trouble? Are you a ganster?

373
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:02,271
Our youth doesn't have to be filled
with only pain but troubles.

374
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,406
Deal!

375
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:04,567
Go.

376
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:07,167
You can't influence Seolhui in a bad way.

377
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,007
Kimchi, office wife,

378
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,115
KBC, and a fighter?

379
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:17,720
What a mess.

380
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:24,960
Youth Is Only Youth
When You Cause Trouble.

381
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,020
-What is it?
-My ears hurt.

382
00:27:51,821 --> 00:27:52,822
Let me see.

383
00:27:57,888 --> 00:27:59,857
It is finally your time.

384
00:27:59,952 --> 00:28:02,522
My ears get rubbed against
the ground too much.

385
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:04,552
I can't even sleep because of pain.

386
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:08,198
Wait for it. They don't hurt
once they turn like this.

387
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:10,002
How long does it take?

388
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:13,304
I don't know when they turned this way.

389
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:17,318
I think they look cool. It's like a medal.

390
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:19,977
What medal? My daughter,

391
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,113
cries and says, "You
have a monster's ears."

392
00:28:24,462 --> 00:28:26,182
Let's go, everyone.

393
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:28,686
Let's go. We have to go to Daecheon.

394
00:28:28,782 --> 00:28:31,452
-Byungju is not here yet.
-Well...

395
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:34,235
He's coming next week. He has a cold.

396
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:35,836
Is he that embarrassed?

397
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:38,829
Let's just say he is sick. Hurry up.

398
00:28:49,173 --> 00:28:51,642
Pain is a blessing to youth.

399
00:28:57,681 --> 00:29:00,184
It took you long enough.

400
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:04,121
The divorce was a few months
ago, and you come now?

401
00:29:04,355 --> 00:29:07,334
I was a little busy. How have you been?

402
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:09,226
It is always the same with me.

403
00:29:10,422 --> 00:29:14,672
Looking at these reminds
me of the old days.

404
00:29:14,762 --> 00:29:16,262
Do you want to sit in?

405
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:20,862
Show your face so that they
can't look down on us.

406
00:29:21,772 --> 00:29:22,806
I'll pass.

407
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,481
Application Form, Aera Choi

408
00:29:36,222 --> 00:29:37,552
Yes, madam.

409
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:41,122
Are you referring to the
kimchi that is airing now?

410
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:44,652
I am sorry, madam,

411
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:48,198
but the product doesn't
include radish kimchi.

412
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:51,952
Can you take that radish kimchi out?

413
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:53,203
What? Why?

414
00:29:53,303 --> 00:29:55,832
That crunchy sound is
grabbing people's attention.

415
00:29:55,922 --> 00:29:59,043
It looks good to me, so what
would the customers think?

416
00:30:00,502 --> 00:30:03,342
Focus the camera on the host
and take the radish out.

417
00:30:03,972 --> 00:30:06,602
Why does she keep scratching herself?

418
00:30:11,882 --> 00:30:15,042
How can the food taster
be allergic to pork?

419
00:30:16,326 --> 00:30:17,752
-Take her out.
-Hold on.

420
00:30:17,842 --> 00:30:20,252
But if only the old man, woman
and the child are left,

421
00:30:20,342 --> 00:30:22,032
it will look so sad.

422
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:23,734
Goodness.

423
00:30:25,982 --> 00:30:28,812
Instead of having the
grandparents and grandchild,

424
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:31,362
let's do grandparents
and a married couple.

425
00:30:32,076 --> 00:30:35,512
I'm sorry, but they don't come with it.

426
00:30:36,146 --> 00:30:39,283
-Right.
-Why would you show it then?

427
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:42,482
Hey, I will buy the kimchi,

428
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:45,189
so give me some boxes
of radish kimchi too.

429
00:30:45,522 --> 00:30:48,522
They look good, so I want both of them.

430
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:50,828
Why do you keep saying no?

431
00:30:51,222 --> 00:30:52,740
Hey, do you hear me?

432
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,432
No! Radish kimchi doesn't come with it!

433
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:18,282
Who is she? Stop her!

434
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:19,890
Play the video.

435
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:25,028
Come out. What is going on?

436
00:31:43,714 --> 00:31:45,592
It has a good variety.

437
00:31:45,682 --> 00:31:47,484
Should we order those?

438
00:31:48,012 --> 00:31:50,282
Why does that look so tasty?

439
00:31:51,622 --> 00:31:52,542
My dear!

440
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:54,057
Isn't that Seolhui?

441
00:31:54,324 --> 00:31:57,194
Look. Seolhui is on TV.

442
00:31:57,928 --> 00:32:00,522
It is her. Isn't that Juman next to her?

443
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:02,676
It is a great dish.

444
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:04,322
It goes great with rice. As you see...

445
00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:06,392
Wow, she's awesome.

446
00:32:06,482 --> 00:32:07,622
Kimchi?

447
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:11,362
Kimchi? Sure.

448
00:32:11,452 --> 00:32:13,454
Please go ahead.

449
00:32:13,544 --> 00:32:16,313
-What is your number?
-Yes, madam.

450
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:18,712
Is that it?

451
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:20,602
Here is your order.

452
00:32:35,062 --> 00:32:38,162
Why is she always so full of herself,

453
00:32:38,502 --> 00:32:40,482
and always

454
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,222
above my level?

455
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:46,742
Here is your first question.
Out of you three,

456
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:48,702
who do you think will not pass today?

457
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:54,672
Announcers don't hesitate.
They are quick on their feet.

458
00:32:54,762 --> 00:32:58,322
I think number 17 will not make it.

459
00:32:59,162 --> 00:33:01,482
I think so as well.

460
00:33:02,422 --> 00:33:03,982
Then,

461
00:33:04,722 --> 00:33:08,102
number 17, Choi Aera got all votes.

462
00:33:08,802 --> 00:33:10,722
You are older and have no experience.

463
00:33:10,812 --> 00:33:14,072
Your face also looks the
biggest on screen. So, why?

464
00:33:14,162 --> 00:33:16,722
Can you give me 10 reasons
why we should pick you?

465
00:33:18,322 --> 00:33:19,462
Ten reasons?

466
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:22,112
Yes, sure.

467
00:33:23,142 --> 00:33:25,229
First of all, I am very passionate...

468
00:33:26,322 --> 00:33:28,762
Is it about passion again?

469
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:32,102
-Pardon?
-Oh, Sorry.

470
00:33:32,356 --> 00:33:36,193
I have heard that too many times today.

471
00:33:38,202 --> 00:33:39,102
I see.

472
00:33:39,222 --> 00:33:41,662
To be honest,

473
00:33:41,882 --> 00:33:45,002
what you like to do and what
you can do are different.

474
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:50,262
Whoever figures that out first
succeeds in their field.

475
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:54,332
This is hurting my pride.

476
00:33:54,422 --> 00:33:58,122
People think anybody can
become announcers nowadays.

477
00:33:58,342 --> 00:34:00,882
Why don't you just do what you were doing?

478
00:34:02,262 --> 00:34:04,762
I was going to do that,

479
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:08,882
but I wanted this so much
that I couldn't just live.

480
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:12,502
I don't know if I should say you are bold.

481
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:15,999
Everybody has their limits.

482
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:18,642
Do you know what a Maginot Line is?

483
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:24,802
It has been less than ten
minutes since we have met.

484
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:28,042
How do you know what I am capable of?

485
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:31,002
You have aged without wisdom.

486
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:34,117
You don't know how to reply
to interview questions.

487
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:37,282
Are you seeing how I
can adapt to pressure?

488
00:34:37,912 --> 00:34:39,722
Or is this a personal attack?

489
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:44,832
Miss Choi, as an experienced person,

490
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:46,682
let me give you some advice.

491
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:48,362
Don't.

492
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:51,842
You are not going to pass me.

493
00:34:52,803 --> 00:34:55,238
Then, don't hurt me. I...

494
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:58,462
Have the right not to be hurt.

495
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,282
I will decide

496
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:03,462
what I am capable of.

497
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:13,590
Aera.

498
00:35:15,392 --> 00:35:17,602
Do you think you will make it?

499
00:35:22,582 --> 00:35:23,532
Yes.

500
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,002
Seeing you, I think I can.

501
00:35:26,762 --> 00:35:30,352
You were the main anchor and got
married to a wealthy family.

502
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:32,152
You were first place in everything.

503
00:35:32,242 --> 00:35:33,243
So?

504
00:35:33,672 --> 00:35:36,742
Are you going to consider
me as your role model?

505
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:40,712
I thought first place was
reserved for the best,

506
00:35:40,802 --> 00:35:43,002
but seeing you makes me doubt myself.

507
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,889
I know I can be better than you.

508
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:46,990
Aera.

509
00:35:47,322 --> 00:35:49,342
That is an ambitious plan.

510
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:51,122
We can talk if you pass.

511
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:52,996
You will see.

512
00:35:53,392 --> 00:35:55,402
I will make sure

513
00:35:55,782 --> 00:35:57,792
you never smirk again.

514
00:36:24,322 --> 00:36:25,782
I wired you money.

515
00:36:26,082 --> 00:36:27,193
Go and check.

516
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,742
Are you in Daecheon?

517
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,517
I am going there right now.

518
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:53,523
Daecheon?

519
00:36:55,252 --> 00:36:56,862
Why would you come here?

520
00:36:58,622 --> 00:37:00,582
You have to watch your weight.

521
00:37:02,092 --> 00:37:03,822
I am spending the night here.

522
00:37:04,901 --> 00:37:05,902
What?

523
00:37:06,562 --> 00:37:08,662
I am not going home tonight either.

524
00:37:14,502 --> 00:37:16,382
I don't want to go home tonight.

525
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:18,582
I won't.

526
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:27,442
You can eat it all!

527
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:32,582
When I saw it, I really wanted to eat it.

528
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,710
It turned out fine,

529
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,969
but we were really startled.

530
00:37:39,262 --> 00:37:42,019
Sunhee, are you gluttonous?

531
00:37:42,606 --> 00:37:46,372
We sold out thanks to her eating well.
It was for the better.

532
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:48,362
Still, we were on live.

533
00:37:48,472 --> 00:37:51,556
We need things to be controlled,
at least internally.

534
00:37:52,249 --> 00:37:55,512
You needed another person anyway.

535
00:37:55,602 --> 00:37:57,582
We will consider them the couple,

536
00:37:57,852 --> 00:38:00,942
and she can be the sister-in-law.
That sounds good, right?

537
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:02,662
I am not the sister-in-law.

538
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,089
I am the wife.

539
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:06,322
Is that important right now?

540
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,350
-Do you think we're playing house?
-Sir...

541
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:12,802
Who cares who the wife is?

542
00:38:13,302 --> 00:38:15,142
Madam! You are here.

543
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:18,441
Welcome.

544
00:38:20,243 --> 00:38:21,672
I heard we sold out.

545
00:38:21,762 --> 00:38:24,402
We sell out every time.

546
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:27,202
You should allow us to handle
your next sale as well.

547
00:38:27,902 --> 00:38:30,302
I know it is all thanks to Mr Kim.

548
00:38:30,982 --> 00:38:34,682
He has an absolute taste.
Where did you hear about him?

549
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:39,252
My little sister recommended him to me.

550
00:38:39,342 --> 00:38:41,422
I heard he's really good at what he does.

551
00:38:41,512 --> 00:38:43,962
Is this your sister?

552
00:38:44,052 --> 00:38:45,892
But how do you know him?

553
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:47,732
I am her sister,

554
00:38:47,822 --> 00:38:49,272
and Yejin's mother.

555
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:50,332
Mother?

556
00:38:50,422 --> 00:38:53,972
Then, do you own Granny Park's Jokbal?

557
00:38:54,062 --> 00:38:56,756
All of our family members
are in the food industry.

558
00:38:56,846 --> 00:38:57,847
I see.

559
00:38:58,782 --> 00:39:03,122
So that is why you asked for Mr Kim.

560
00:39:06,756 --> 00:39:09,559
Is that you?

561
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:15,872
It is you, isn't it? You were with Mr
Kim before.

562
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:17,342
The one wearing pink?

563
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:20,342
You said you had a team
dinner in Oksu-dong.

564
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:22,082
When?

565
00:39:22,405 --> 00:39:23,884
Did we have a team dinner then?

566
00:39:23,974 --> 00:39:27,277
Did you guys go out without me?

567
00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:29,402
No, sir. It is not like that.

568
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,281
Why isn't she speaking?

569
00:39:31,414 --> 00:39:33,116
We saw each other, right?

570
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,319
What is it? Is something off?

571
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:37,520
Hey.

572
00:39:38,282 --> 00:39:41,022
You have been going home early these days.

573
00:39:41,324 --> 00:39:42,325
What is this?

574
00:39:42,692 --> 00:39:43,952
Were you with Sunhee?

575
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:46,522
Why won't you say anything? Just say it.

576
00:39:46,612 --> 00:39:49,562
Sunhee, what is going on?

577
00:39:49,733 --> 00:39:50,967
Miss...

578
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:55,002
Let's cause some trouble.

579
00:39:57,932 --> 00:40:01,962
I am Mr Kim's
common-law-wife, Baek Seolhui.

580
00:40:03,272 --> 00:40:06,822
That is why you shouldn't kiss him, Yejin.

581
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,351
Also, Mr Choi.

582
00:40:09,182 --> 00:40:11,662
I am not Sunhee.

583
00:40:12,822 --> 00:40:15,225
It is Baek Seolhui. Baek Seolhui!

584
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,460
My name is Baek Seolhui.

585
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:20,587
Seolhui.

586
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:24,542
Why aren't you talking?

587
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:26,542
She is strange.

588
00:40:28,738 --> 00:40:29,873
Well...

589
00:40:32,982 --> 00:40:34,522
She is my girlfriend.

590
00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:37,691
What nonsense are you talking about?

591
00:40:37,781 --> 00:40:38,948
It's not nonsense.

592
00:40:40,402 --> 00:40:42,021
I am dating Seolhui.

593
00:40:43,752 --> 00:40:45,282
It has been six years,

594
00:40:46,122 --> 00:40:47,662
and I like her a lot.

595
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:55,242
So, Mr Choi. Please
stop calling her Sunhee.

596
00:40:55,692 --> 00:40:57,002
Yejin.

597
00:40:59,132 --> 00:41:01,062
Please don't cross the line.

598
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:20,290
We will invite a team to do a
martial arts demonstration.

599
00:41:25,028 --> 00:41:26,696
Could that be it?

600
00:41:40,143 --> 00:41:41,745
Thank you.

601
00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:44,814
Next up,

602
00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:48,122
we will have them break boards in order.

603
00:41:49,786 --> 00:41:52,188
Daecheon Scallop Festival

604
00:42:04,601 --> 00:42:05,802
It is fake.

605
00:42:06,102 --> 00:42:09,142
They cheated. I know so!

606
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:12,762
They have the boards pre-cut.

607
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:15,612
Quiet down, darling.

608
00:42:24,612 --> 00:42:25,722
Hana.

609
00:42:26,423 --> 00:42:27,424
Hana.

610
00:42:27,842 --> 00:42:28,942
Hana!

611
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,922
Your lines. Keep going.

612
00:42:36,562 --> 00:42:37,610
My lines...

613
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,503
Next up is...

614
00:42:48,044 --> 00:42:49,412
Wait.

615
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:50,522
Oh, no.

616
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:53,922
This is crazy.

617
00:42:54,522 --> 00:42:57,792
Why did you tell them to break
boards again? We ran out of boards.

618
00:42:57,882 --> 00:43:00,852
Can you go to a construction site

619
00:43:00,942 --> 00:43:02,722
to see if we can get something similar?

620
00:43:02,812 --> 00:43:05,892
What are you talking about?
They are not superheroes.

621
00:43:05,982 --> 00:43:09,292
Didn't you say a singer was coming? Who
was it, Hong Seri? When's she coming?

622
00:43:09,382 --> 00:43:12,432
She's on her way. We need you
to delay us a little bit.

623
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:13,792
Breaking once more, deal?

624
00:43:13,935 --> 00:43:16,202
What about the host?

625
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:19,172
I told you to delete the line about soju.

626
00:43:19,262 --> 00:43:21,672
Just looking at something
green makes me puke.

627
00:43:21,762 --> 00:43:24,072
Why would you come to work,

628
00:43:24,162 --> 00:43:27,372
and drink so much soju with scallops?

629
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:28,942
Seriously.

630
00:43:29,032 --> 00:43:30,482
We need a host to delay the show.

631
00:43:30,572 --> 00:43:33,282
Please, we need you to go again.

632
00:43:33,372 --> 00:43:35,752
-I already told you no!
-Then, do you want me to?

633
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:38,452
-Why do we need to do that?
-I'll do it!

634
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:40,196
It is up to you to fix it.

635
00:43:40,622 --> 00:43:41,722
What's going on?

636
00:43:42,092 --> 00:43:43,622
Is this a festival?

637
00:43:46,336 --> 00:43:48,805
-Why won't you...
-Hold on!

638
00:43:49,382 --> 00:43:52,032
I know a well-qualified person.

639
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,242
Let me get this straight.

640
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:02,072
The host is drunk and Hong Seri is late.

641
00:44:02,162 --> 00:44:04,382
He has to continue breaking boards,

642
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:06,182
and the governor is mad.

643
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:10,822
What time is Hong Seri arriving?

644
00:44:10,912 --> 00:44:12,495
In 20 minutes, she said.

645
00:44:13,182 --> 00:44:15,042
She has been saying that for a while.

646
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,032
Then...

647
00:44:18,701 --> 00:44:20,703
I have 20 minutes to myself, right?

648
00:44:20,942 --> 00:44:21,942
Yes.

649
00:44:22,802 --> 00:44:23,802
Pardon?

650
00:44:24,572 --> 00:44:25,702
Hey...

651
00:44:26,742 --> 00:44:30,132
Don't do anything too crazy. There
are political circles here.

652
00:44:30,222 --> 00:44:32,682
The governor will be watching you.

653
00:44:34,484 --> 00:44:36,412
You can't get involved once I am up there.

654
00:44:36,502 --> 00:44:39,422
Those 20 minutes are mine. Okay?

655
00:44:41,491 --> 00:44:42,492
Okay.

656
00:44:59,676 --> 00:45:02,845
Excuse me, you have to go up this way.

657
00:45:06,822 --> 00:45:09,312
Mr Governor, please excuse me.

658
00:45:11,421 --> 00:45:13,289
What?

659
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:17,522
Hey, who are you? How dare you...

660
00:45:17,612 --> 00:45:21,122
I thought you'd be upset at the pictures
later. My grandpa was like you.

661
00:45:21,212 --> 00:45:23,982
There is that one strand.

662
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,041
Why are you getting rid of that?

663
00:45:33,343 --> 00:45:34,792
Just let her be.

664
00:45:34,882 --> 00:45:36,942
We have a lot of room.

665
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:38,615
Madam.

666
00:45:39,482 --> 00:45:42,085
Come sit up close. Come on.

667
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:44,187
Don't forget what I told you.

668
00:45:49,993 --> 00:45:52,052
Hello, residents of Daecheon Beach,

669
00:45:52,142 --> 00:45:55,602
the heart of Korea in the summer.

670
00:45:55,692 --> 00:46:00,662
Welcome to the sixth Daecheon Scallop
Festival. I'm your host today, Choi Aera.

671
00:46:04,707 --> 00:46:07,702
How about a round of applause
to thank the governor,

672
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:13,302
for tearing down the wall and for
providing us a venue for the festival?

673
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,899
Governor Jang isn't good at his job,

674
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:21,612
but he is a good man.

675
00:46:21,702 --> 00:46:22,925
Of course.

676
00:46:23,026 --> 00:46:26,829
It doesn't matter who wins.
No one does the job well.

677
00:46:27,296 --> 00:46:29,322
Anyway, where is Hong Seri?

678
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,800
You are right.

679
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,692
Isn't she coming out? Where is she?

680
00:46:32,782 --> 00:46:34,704
Where is Hong Seri?

681
00:46:35,402 --> 00:46:37,222
Everyone.

682
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:39,802
You are dying to see
Hong Seri, aren't you?

683
00:46:39,892 --> 00:46:43,272
She should change the
subject, not bring it up.

684
00:46:43,362 --> 00:46:47,083
Hong Seri is always on TV.

685
00:46:47,712 --> 00:46:49,282
Every single day.

686
00:46:50,153 --> 00:46:51,492
But not me.

687
00:46:51,582 --> 00:46:53,842
You can't see me on TV.

688
00:46:54,123 --> 00:46:55,682
This is your only chance.

689
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:57,552
She is such a feisty one.

690
00:46:57,642 --> 00:46:59,452
How did she keep it in all these years?

691
00:46:59,542 --> 00:47:01,922
I don't sing for people ever.

692
00:47:02,012 --> 00:47:04,233
You can't even pay to hear me sing.

693
00:47:05,182 --> 00:47:06,762
Choi Aera, who's rarer than Hong Seri.

694
00:47:06,852 --> 00:47:11,662
Chungnam's daughter. Chungnam's pearl!
How about a song by Kim Wansun,

695
00:47:11,752 --> 00:47:13,532
Chuncheon's very own?

696
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,032
-Applause!
-Yes!

697
00:47:15,122 --> 00:47:16,112
Go!

698
00:47:25,421 --> 00:47:28,858
Wearing a red hat

699
00:47:29,192 --> 00:47:32,829
I am a clown that always smiles

700
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:37,967
Behind the blue smile

701
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:41,504
Are tears that no one sees.

702
00:47:42,972 --> 00:47:45,012
Dooshik's mother, your husband is here.

703
00:47:45,102 --> 00:47:46,902
Please take him back.

704
00:47:52,615 --> 00:47:56,272
Even if you laugh at me

705
00:47:56,362 --> 00:48:00,052
I think I look beautiful

706
00:48:01,124 --> 00:48:02,112
Amazing.

707
00:48:02,202 --> 00:48:05,952
Once she has a microphone,
it is game over.

708
00:48:06,042 --> 00:48:08,698
No one can say a word

709
00:48:09,899 --> 00:48:11,000
What is that?

710
00:48:11,182 --> 00:48:12,662
Is Hong Seri here?

711
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:14,432
Awesome.

712
00:48:14,522 --> 00:48:16,516
My battery

713
00:48:16,606 --> 00:48:17,602
Madam!

714
00:48:17,692 --> 00:48:19,972
You don't need to be the best looking

715
00:48:20,062 --> 00:48:21,172
-You don't need to!
-Mister?

716
00:48:21,262 --> 00:48:23,702
You don't need to have the best body.

717
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:24,791
You don't need to!

718
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:28,094
You care only for me

719
00:48:28,184 --> 00:48:31,387
And that makes you the best for me

720
00:48:32,152 --> 00:48:34,392
Did you have fun today?

721
00:48:34,482 --> 00:48:36,692
-Yes!
-She's talented!

722
00:48:36,782 --> 00:48:40,062
She is part of an agency, right?

723
00:48:41,242 --> 00:48:44,792
Hey. If the martial
artists and that moron...

724
00:48:44,882 --> 00:48:47,970
I mean, if the martial artists
and she travel as a team,

725
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:49,922
would we get paid more?

726
00:48:53,476 --> 00:48:56,279
Yes. That is right.

727
00:48:57,212 --> 00:49:00,222
I was the MC. The MC.

728
00:49:00,582 --> 00:49:03,062
Daecheon is a short drive away.

729
00:49:03,886 --> 00:49:05,288
Should I go tomorrow?

730
00:49:05,512 --> 00:49:07,222
You said you'll do it tomorrow too.

731
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:10,882
Why would the father of a
future star come to this?

732
00:49:11,122 --> 00:49:13,792
Dad. Just stand by.

733
00:49:14,142 --> 00:49:18,568
I will repay you for raising
me all on your own.

734
00:49:18,962 --> 00:49:20,982
I will give you a life of crazy luxury.

735
00:49:22,338 --> 00:49:24,540
I don't need luxury.

736
00:49:26,382 --> 00:49:28,382
Just take care of yourself.

737
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:35,151
Goodness.

738
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,389
Is this really Aera?

739
00:49:40,622 --> 00:49:43,492
She was the MC of the festival.

740
00:49:43,582 --> 00:49:46,392
Really? Are you paying today too?

741
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:48,798
I told you,

742
00:49:49,098 --> 00:49:51,334
the dream I had before
she was born, right?

743
00:49:52,101 --> 00:49:54,871
A huge dragon the size of the house,

744
00:49:55,402 --> 00:50:00,822
was holding a magic pearl the size
of my fist with its front claws,

745
00:50:01,244 --> 00:50:03,772
and shot up.

746
00:50:03,862 --> 00:50:06,342
He added a pearl this time.

747
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:10,282
Every time he tells the
story, things get added.

748
00:50:10,372 --> 00:50:11,387
Right?

749
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:12,752
Have a drink.

750
00:50:12,922 --> 00:50:14,700
Sure!

751
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:16,993
-Drink up.
-Thank you.

752
00:50:17,393 --> 00:50:20,352
This is a large. I put in a lot.

753
00:50:20,442 --> 00:50:22,702
-Wow!
-Thank you!

754
00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:24,533
Thank you.

755
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:27,762
This is on the house. Enjoy.

756
00:50:27,852 --> 00:50:29,682
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

757
00:50:29,772 --> 00:50:31,974
They are so nice.

758
00:50:38,712 --> 00:50:41,682
Which one should I post?
Which came out the best?

759
00:50:42,482 --> 00:50:44,042
Are you addicted to social media?

760
00:50:44,132 --> 00:50:45,382
Why are you posting already?

761
00:50:45,472 --> 00:50:48,552
Others always brag about
eating and buying nice things.

762
00:50:48,642 --> 00:50:50,259
Why can't I brag too?

763
00:50:50,742 --> 00:50:52,322
Go ahead. Brag.

764
00:50:54,797 --> 00:50:56,832
This one looks the most human.

765
00:50:57,562 --> 00:50:59,232
I will post this one.

766
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:04,874
I feel

767
00:51:05,782 --> 00:51:07,402
so good right now!

768
00:51:07,492 --> 00:51:11,180
Our MC seems to be in a good mood.

769
00:51:11,847 --> 00:51:13,582
Your MC?

770
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,121
Why are you grinning like a madwoman?

771
00:51:19,655 --> 00:51:23,693
Since we are at the beach, let's drink.
Let's drink.

772
00:51:23,942 --> 00:51:24,822
Go home.

773
00:51:24,912 --> 00:51:26,322
-Let's drink!
-Let's drink!

774
00:51:26,412 --> 00:51:28,022
-Let's drink!
-Let's drink!

775
00:51:28,112 --> 00:51:29,862
-Let's drink!
-Let's drink!

776
00:51:29,952 --> 00:51:30,967
Let's drink.

777
00:51:31,242 --> 00:51:35,371
Aera. He won't drink. What should we do?

778
00:51:35,538 --> 00:51:36,572
Dooho.

779
00:51:36,932 --> 00:51:38,712
You didn't finish your shot?

780
00:51:38,802 --> 00:51:40,682
Is it because no one is singing?

781
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:43,779
Don't do what I think you are about to do.

782
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,112
Big brother, bottoms up!

783
00:51:47,202 --> 00:51:50,453
You have to shoot it!

784
00:51:55,082 --> 00:51:57,222
I don't know about "big brother".

785
00:51:57,962 --> 00:52:00,730
I am three years younger... Madam.

786
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:03,522
How long will you make me dance?

787
00:52:03,612 --> 00:52:06,402
Bottoms up, up, up!

788
00:52:07,603 --> 00:52:09,962
-Drink it up!
-What if,

789
00:52:10,052 --> 00:52:12,132
she gets worse the more she drinks?

790
00:52:12,222 --> 00:52:14,120
2NE one shot! One shot!

791
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,842
-Drink it up!
-She...

792
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:18,072
Bottoms up!

793
00:52:18,162 --> 00:52:19,582
She looks cute.

794
00:52:21,117 --> 00:52:23,486
Hey. Take her inside.

795
00:52:28,182 --> 00:52:30,622
You are drunk. Go in and go to sleep.

796
00:52:32,728 --> 00:52:35,252
Since we are at the beach, let's drink!

797
00:52:35,342 --> 00:52:36,632
Let's drink!

798
00:52:39,442 --> 00:52:42,762
I was in such a good mood.
Why did you make me leave?

799
00:52:42,902 --> 00:52:45,002
Where did you learn things like that?

800
00:52:45,772 --> 00:52:48,521
Big brother, bottoms up!

801
00:52:48,611 --> 00:52:51,414
You have to shoot it. Huh?

802
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:53,459
Is Dooho your "big brother"?

803
00:52:53,549 --> 00:52:55,172
He was born in 1992!

804
00:52:55,262 --> 00:52:57,482
That is just how the song goes.

805
00:52:57,572 --> 00:53:01,791
You have never sung that "bottoms up"
song to me. Why did you sing it for him?

806
00:53:01,952 --> 00:53:03,982
Why were you so cute?

807
00:53:04,282 --> 00:53:05,222
What was that?

808
00:53:07,122 --> 00:53:08,362
Was I cute?

809
00:53:17,372 --> 00:53:19,922
They never have enough rooms
at times like this,

810
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:22,822
and always have just one left, right?

811
00:53:24,947 --> 00:53:26,715
She is taking a while.

812
00:53:27,149 --> 00:53:30,519
It is peak time after all,
so it is to be expected.

813
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,121
Right.

814
00:53:33,822 --> 00:53:37,062
I am sorry, but we have plenty of rooms.

815
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:41,530
We have too many, so I was wondering,

816
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:43,302
which floor to put you on.

817
00:53:46,836 --> 00:53:50,072
Just put us on the same floor
as the festival people.

818
00:53:50,206 --> 00:53:52,007
Why are you getting angry?

819
00:54:00,582 --> 00:54:02,122
You won't be scared?

820
00:54:04,142 --> 00:54:06,522
What if I am? Do you
want to sleep with me?

821
00:54:08,252 --> 00:54:09,962
Who said that?

822
00:54:10,562 --> 00:54:13,152
How could you say something
like that so easily?

823
00:54:13,242 --> 00:54:15,097
Literally, sleep!

824
00:54:15,292 --> 00:54:16,922
Just sleeping.

825
00:54:17,092 --> 00:54:19,462
You have such a dirty mind.

826
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:22,838
You must be possessed.

827
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,884
Motel

828
00:54:45,728 --> 00:54:46,996
What is this?

829
00:54:48,942 --> 00:54:51,042
Why do I feel like I am being watched?

830
00:54:52,182 --> 00:54:53,802
Is there a camera in here?

831
00:55:12,054 --> 00:55:14,156
Damn! You scared me to death!

832
00:55:14,323 --> 00:55:15,524
Damn!

833
00:55:19,728 --> 00:55:20,729
Die!

834
00:55:22,031 --> 00:55:23,962
Die!

835
00:55:24,052 --> 00:55:26,435
Die!

836
00:55:33,475 --> 00:55:34,577
Darn it.

837
00:55:36,072 --> 00:55:37,622
Hey, Aera!

838
00:55:39,512 --> 00:55:43,002
Dongman! Did you hear me scream?

839
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:45,212
Cockroach!

840
00:55:45,302 --> 00:55:48,757
There is a cockroach in my room! Gross!

841
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:52,828
I hate them! I think I am going to die!

842
00:55:55,431 --> 00:55:57,062
There's another one next to you.

843
00:55:57,152 --> 00:55:59,935
Where, where?

844
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:07,942
Hey.

845
00:56:09,562 --> 00:56:12,442
-I am going to Daecheon to film.
-Okay.

846
00:56:20,452 --> 00:56:21,782
Are you a man?

847
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:24,226
Why do you dry your hair like that?

848
00:56:24,693 --> 00:56:26,652
Should girls dry their hair differently?

849
00:56:26,742 --> 00:56:29,842
Why are you drying your
hair like my army sergeant?

850
00:56:29,982 --> 00:56:30,932
Hey.

851
00:56:32,082 --> 00:56:33,202
Get down.

852
00:56:33,302 --> 00:56:35,471
Why are you on the bed?

853
00:56:36,972 --> 00:56:39,662
You can clean it up and
sleep on the floor.

854
00:56:40,602 --> 00:56:43,602
Why are you like this, little punk?

855
00:56:43,946 --> 00:56:45,714
Then, just sit next to me.

856
00:56:45,972 --> 00:56:47,982
We sat on the same bed all the time.

857
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:51,362
Things are different now.

858
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:55,702
Are they?

859
00:56:58,892 --> 00:57:00,382
I mean, they're the same.

860
00:57:13,842 --> 00:57:15,344
Let's watch TV.

861
00:57:16,578 --> 00:57:17,813
Don't turn it on.

862
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:20,222
Why not?

863
00:57:21,282 --> 00:57:22,942
Just don't.

864
00:57:23,185 --> 00:57:25,854
It will get awkward.

865
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:34,792
Hey.

866
00:57:35,642 --> 00:57:40,002
Why are you facing me? Turn away.

867
00:57:40,102 --> 00:57:42,122
-I can't.
-Why not?

868
00:57:42,722 --> 00:57:44,702
-My ear hurts.
-Your ear?

869
00:57:46,442 --> 00:57:47,622
What happened?

870
00:57:48,642 --> 00:57:50,652
I've been doing ground training lately.

871
00:57:50,742 --> 00:57:51,962
What is that?

872
00:57:52,081 --> 00:57:55,517
When you roll on the ground,
like in wrestling,

873
00:57:55,782 --> 00:57:57,462
you get your ear scratched.

874
00:57:58,612 --> 00:58:01,982
You are driving me crazy!

875
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:07,796
Your ear is super hot.

876
00:58:12,901 --> 00:58:15,262
You shouldn't,

877
00:58:15,352 --> 00:58:17,706
touch people's ear like that.

878
00:58:18,672 --> 00:58:21,742
It feels like it'll explode.
It is super hot.

879
00:58:22,444 --> 00:58:25,881
Maybe it is infected or something.

880
00:58:26,042 --> 00:58:27,862
Are you a doctor now?

881
00:58:30,052 --> 00:58:32,855
That is not,

882
00:58:33,355 --> 00:58:35,524
why it is hot.

883
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:40,996
Did you

884
00:58:42,482 --> 00:58:43,662
get something done?

885
00:58:44,967 --> 00:58:45,951
Like what?

886
00:58:46,149 --> 00:58:48,093
Your face

887
00:58:49,642 --> 00:58:51,422
seems different.

888
00:58:53,342 --> 00:58:55,277
Did you get a filler or something?

889
00:58:56,612 --> 00:58:58,882
I can't afford rent. How
could I afford a filler?

890
00:58:59,442 --> 00:59:01,442
Aren't you going back to your room?

891
00:59:01,882 --> 00:59:05,802
Not until Coach gets back. I
can't be alone with a cockroach.

892
00:59:07,275 --> 00:59:08,552
You are such a pain.

893
00:59:11,022 --> 00:59:12,082
Then,

894
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,042
why don't we drink some more?

895
00:59:14,797 --> 00:59:15,798
Should I go get some?

896
00:59:15,902 --> 00:59:18,442
Delivery numbers are
usually on the tissue box.

897
00:59:22,482 --> 00:59:25,972
You know so well. You
must go to motels often.

898
00:59:26,802 --> 00:59:27,962
It is my first time.

899
00:59:37,686 --> 00:59:38,887
Dongman!

900
00:59:52,668 --> 00:59:54,937
Neither of them is home?

901
00:59:57,005 --> 00:59:59,708
I said it wasn't allowed before marriage.

902
01:00:52,794 --> 01:00:54,096
Darn it.

903
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:11,380
We Did It! Motel
