1
00:00:00,866 --> 00:00:03,892
Dongman! Seolhui! Hurry up!

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:05,102
Okay!

3
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:13,178
You drunkard. Aren't you going to work?

4
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,878
I need to go do the news.

5
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:18,248
That's not how you wear a tie.

6
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:21,848
This is much more stylish.

7
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:23,418
Honey. Wife.

8
00:00:23,778 --> 00:00:26,748
Things are a mess up there.

9
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:27,843
What?

10
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:33,378
North Korea's Kim Il-sung
stated he will break...

11
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:36,379
...the Non-Proliferation Treaty,
causing tension.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,467
With KBC News, I'm Baik Jiyeon.

13
00:00:43,074 --> 00:00:44,949
I told you not to say things
that I can't understand.

14
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,983
We aren't playing "News time".

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,666
Playing house is boring for me!

16
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,270
No. It's fun. It's super fun.

17
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,258
Honey, I'm going to the studio now.

18
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:07,354
Kids, it's time to eat
and get to kindergarten.

19
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:10,507
Taekwondo!

20
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,359
Dongman! You made Seolhui cry again!

21
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:20,219
Why do you keep breaking everything?

22
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:24,778
Mommy. Aera hit me again!

23
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:28,309
Sorry! I'm sorry!

24
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:30,849
Seoul 2017, Namil Villa

25
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:34,337
Sorry. I'm sorry.

26
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:36,453
Do this for me, will you?

27
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,151
For old times' sake.

28
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:43,452
You annoying brat.

29
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:46,912
Thanks.

30
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:53,963
Seriously.

31
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:02,641
Thanks again, Dongman.

32
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:04,831
Are you immigrating?

33
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:07,201
Juman forgot to pack for his business trip.

34
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:08,571
See you later.

35
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:10,201
Make a lot of money, honey!

36
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:13,821
Honey, throw them away.

37
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:17,601
Honey? Don't call me "honey." I'll kill you.

38
00:02:17,692 --> 00:02:19,839
Fine, honey. Thanks.

39
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,931
Look at that shameless punk.

40
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:29,110
Round 2: Whatever they say,
we'll go our way.

41
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:39,031
Going somewhere?

42
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:41,401
A classmate's wedding. How do I look?

43
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:43,601
Do I look like a career woman?

44
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,918
Does it scream, "I'm doing very well?"

45
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,771
You're like Australopithecus.

46
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,831
-What?
-I witness evolution...

47
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,271
...on a daily basis thanks to you.

48
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:55,671
How can you change so quickly in an hour?

49
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:57,501
Do I look that pretty?

50
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:01,571
Don't try to act pretty.
I haven't eaten yet.

51
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:03,731
I'm annoying if I act pretty, right?

52
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,331
It's such a dilemma.

53
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:10,856
I'm not acting pretty. I was born pretty.

54
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:18,531
I can hit a girl.

55
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:23,187
But people say I'm acting pretty,

56
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:24,631
so it's hard for Aera.

57
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:29,101
So stressful.

58
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,401
Wait for me.

59
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:39,540
Hey. You must like this bag.

60
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:40,626
You're still carrying it.

61
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,371
Yes, it's super convenient.

62
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:46,431
Do you want another
if a new one comes out?

63
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:51,901
Will you buy Aera another bag?

64
00:03:57,501 --> 00:04:00,801
Stop it. I said to stop. Stop it!

65
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,871
How can you put a choke hold on a girl?

66
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:06,631
How did you find Grandpa's Tteokbokki?

67
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:10,441
It's sold out for
five shows since its launch.

68
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:15,371
People think I'm chubby
because I eat anything,

69
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:16,731
but I'm quite the epicurean.

70
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:19,941
When I first tasted it
in Gyeongdong Market,

71
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:22,501
I surpassed joy and felt a sense of duty.

72
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:25,301
"The people of this country
need to taste this."

73
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:28,101
Awesome.

74
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:32,601
We sold 200 million won
worth of rice cakes...

75
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,231
...that cost 2,340 won per pack.

76
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:36,901
-Two hundred million won?
-Yes.

77
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:39,771
It really is a big hit.

78
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:42,401
Then my commission...

79
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:43,901
Of course, you'll get it.

80
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,271
After taxes,

81
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:49,441
it'll be 195,000 won. You'll get it.

82
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:52,171
You are such a valuable worker.

83
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:53,971
Thank you.

84
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:01,701
Awaiting Approval

85
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:04,271
Movie ticket

86
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,831
Waiting by elevator car eight
on the first floor.

87
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:53,671
I packed your shaver in the inside pocket...

88
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:56,231
...and some emergency cash.

89
00:05:56,871 --> 00:05:57,871
Did you?

90
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:00,901
How could you not pack
for your business trip?

91
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:03,731
You're more absent-minded
than I am at times.

92
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,231
You're so bold.

93
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:07,301
When did you come to my desk?

94
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,431
-What?
-I heard "Yongja" is super fun.

95
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,101
"Yongja?" Did that start already?

96
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,601
-What?
-When?

97
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:18,231
-Come on.
-I mean it.

98
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:28,631
-Mr Kim.
-Yes?

99
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:32,071
I hear "Yongja" is very fun.

100
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:34,901
Pardon?

101
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:37,171
They say it's very fun...

102
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:39,071
...and hard to get tickets.

103
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:49,031
-See you.
-Let's go.

104
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:54,401
Excuse me. You forgot your luggage.

105
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:56,801
That isn't mine.

106
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:08,971
You must like pink.

107
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:15,101
Is he the "Mr Kim" that
Yejin's smitten with?

108
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,131
Yes, that's him.

109
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:19,731
But what's "Yongja?"
Did she give him movie tickets?

110
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:20,901
I guess so.

111
00:07:30,258 --> 00:07:32,371
This is made in Germany,

112
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:34,922
so its parts are crazy expensive.

113
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,001
Don't you train them?

114
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:41,301
Don't you know the motor breaks...

115
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:43,671
...if you don't clean the filter?

116
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:46,301
I told you at least 1,000 times...

117
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:47,831
...to clean it.

118
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:49,334
You again?

119
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:51,405
Why do you always cause trouble?

120
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,096
It wasn't me. This isn't mine. It's his.

121
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:57,002
Did you drink again last night?

122
00:07:57,432 --> 00:08:00,502
-I did, but...
-Look. It's yours.

123
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:02,841
You're borderline alcoholic.

124
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:05,802
Forget it. Get to work. Now.

125
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:07,456
Have a nice day. Sorry, sir.

126
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,710
Sir.

127
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:16,705
Isn't this your machine?

128
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:20,379
Didn't you go to the army?

129
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,942
You act like you were never in the army.

130
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:25,969
You're incredibly frustrating.

131
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:29,445
You don't want to do it?
Quit. I won't stop you.

132
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,744
Clean it.

133
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:40,466
Get lost!

134
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,169
You went already. It's my turn now.

135
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,535
It's our last chance, so I should do it.

136
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,808
Woori Stationery

137
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:55,173
Step aside. I'll earn you another round.

138
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,443
-Why should we let you?
-Why?

139
00:08:57,534 --> 00:09:00,213
Seriously, these little kids. Fine.

140
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:02,513
Here. Happy?

141
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:05,743
I'll do it, okay?
You'll get a bonus round anyway.

142
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,013
Wow. He's so full of it.

143
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:23,130
There.

144
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:26,320
Don't you see that?
It says, "No kicking!" there.

145
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,444
-He's awesome.
-I'm sorry.

146
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:37,660
-Incredible.
-See? I said I'd win you another game.

147
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:38,973
Have fun.

148
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:41,843
-No way.
-Isn't he a cyborg?

149
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:46,343
-He's unbelievable.
-I got to warm up.

150
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:49,243
Kyungkoo

151
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,381
Hello? Hi, Kyungkoo.

152
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:54,956
Right now? I'm free.

153
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:57,786
What? Do you have a blind date lined up?

154
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:03,551
My poor legs.

155
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:06,629
Why is the wedding held so far from town?

156
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,871
Here comes the bride.

157
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:35,724
She looks so happy.

158
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:39,077
All that dating since high school
was good practice.

159
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:42,474
-Thanks.
-She's marrying a doctor.

160
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:47,445
-What's his specialty?
-Plastic surgery.

161
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,597
I heard Choi Aera's coming.

162
00:10:57,797 --> 00:10:59,073
-Where?
-Would she want to come?

163
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:01,097
Hello.

164
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,283
-Aera.
-Gosh, are you Aera?

165
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:09,294
It's been so long.
I didn't think you'd show up.

166
00:11:09,557 --> 00:11:11,995
I wanted to come earlier, but I was busy.

167
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,880
We'd have understood
if you decided not to come.

168
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:17,292
I had to come.

169
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:20,126
I missed you guys so much.

170
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:23,193
-I'm glad you're here.
-It's good to see you.

171
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:28,487
-Dongman.
-Kyungkoo.

172
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,287
-The weather's great today.
-Isn't it?

173
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:31,788
-We have to go.
-Now?

174
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,396
-We're late.
-Like right now?

175
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:35,187
-Let's hurry.
-Just like that?

176
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:39,787
I came because you asked,
but can I appear on the show?

177
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:42,687
You're replacing a random guy
that didn't show up.

178
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,034
We won't ask anything.
You just have to stand there, okay?

179
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,164
Okay.

180
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:51,157
"No place has a mountain,
clean water, and this."

181
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:55,117
What's missing?
One, water veins. Two, pavilions.

182
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,123
Three, house price.

183
00:11:57,587 --> 00:12:00,617
We'll ask contestant 12
to tell us what he thinks.

184
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,087
Which do you think is the correct answer?

185
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:08,034
Number one sounds a bit superstitious.

186
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:09,423
Number two...

187
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:10,817
Well...

188
00:12:11,257 --> 00:12:14,617
I don't think the word
is fit for television.

189
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:17,496
What's he talking about?

190
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:19,587
Why isn't that word fit for TV?

191
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:23,226
I think the answer's number three,
house price.

192
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:26,996
I thought this question was
selected to reflect...

193
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:29,487
...the current housing situation and trend.

194
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:32,187
He is very smart.

195
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:35,317
The house price within Seoul is crazy.

196
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:38,274
I chose number three.

197
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:40,357
The correct answer is...

198
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:44,314
Number two, pavilion.

199
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:47,536
I'm sorry, Bronin, you're out.

200
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:49,357
Who brought him?

201
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:52,887
-Picking a lock in one go...
-He's not a bad guy.

202
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:57,004
-Sorry.
-Two, two percent.

203
00:12:57,357 --> 00:12:59,487
Three, seven percent.

204
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:03,826
This question will decide
if we have a winner.

205
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,357
Select your answer.

206
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,857
The correct answer...

207
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:11,294
...is number one, one percent.

208
00:13:11,717 --> 00:13:14,387
We have a final winner.

209
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:16,374
-Congratulations.
-One percent.

210
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:29,087
Park Hyeran joined KBC
as an announcer in 2013.

211
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:32,157
Known for her good looks,
she hosted variety shows...

212
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:33,917
...and talk shows on current issues,

213
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,357
gaining the trust and love of the public.

214
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:39,717
You forgot to take your drink.

215
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,117
It's fine. I don't drink coffee milk.

216
00:13:42,357 --> 00:13:46,017
Would you mind if I took yours as well?

217
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:48,657
-No, go ahead.
-Thank you.

218
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:51,787
Excuse me.

219
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,487
It's you, the smart kid!

220
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:00,717
I recognized you right away.

221
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:04,887
-Who...
-I'm Ko Dongman from Chunbang High.

222
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:06,257
Who?

223
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:08,857
-"Who?"
-I'm, it's Moobin.

224
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,687
-Hello, I'm Producer Jang Kyungkoo.
-Hi.

225
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:13,850
-Would you like to join us?
-Sure.

226
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:16,626
It's been so long. How've you been?

227
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:19,068
-You're a legend.
-Thanks.

228
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:24,017
Okay, so you see...

229
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:26,357
We're doing a year-end special...

230
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:29,287
...with all the winners,
and we'd like you to be on it.

231
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:32,587
You don't remember me?

232
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:35,107
I'm Ko Dongman from Chunbang High.

233
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:36,988
I don't know you.

234
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:40,017
Think harder. I'm the Ko Dongman.

235
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:43,217
You lent me a t-shirt one day,

236
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:45,957
and you came to cheer me on.

237
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:49,517
I won and did this
to celebrate in front of the crowd.

238
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,187
Don't you remember that?

239
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:52,817
I don't.

240
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:56,257
-You're making him feel uncomfortable.
-But...

241
00:14:56,717 --> 00:14:59,287
-Can I take this call?
-Sure.

242
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:00,517
Take your time.

243
00:15:00,957 --> 00:15:02,787
-Hello?
-Stop it.

244
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,087
He isn't happy.

245
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:10,826
Dongman, I'm sorry.

246
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:14,057
We give the guests gift certificates,
but this one's...

247
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:18,307
...registered in the other guy's name.
You can't have it.

248
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:21,728
Do you know that doctor?

249
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:24,085
-The doctor?
-Today's winner.

250
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:29,417
Can you ask him to appear on the year-end...

251
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:30,957
...winners only special?

252
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:32,987
Never mind.

253
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,787
-What?
-I don't think...

254
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:38,499
...you two are that close.
Forget that I asked.

255
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:42,557
We weren't that close.

256
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:43,717
Here.

257
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:46,726
-Take this.
-It's fine.

258
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:49,024
-I called you over.
-Well...

259
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:51,699
Okay, thanks. Bye.

260
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:03,117
I'm a fan.

261
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:09,087
-She's so pretty.
-She's back. She's beautiful.

262
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:20,017
In a short while,

263
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:23,917
we will begin
the second part of the celebration.

264
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:27,857
Can the guests stop walking about...

265
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:30,787
...and take your seats, please?

266
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:35,017
Come over here.

267
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:37,887
When can your aunt sing pansori?

268
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:40,417
-It's her bedtime soon.
-Mother.

269
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:41,757
Must she really sing?

270
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:44,387
-Wait just a bit longer.
-Hey.

271
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:47,257
Why are you hosting your own wedding?

272
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:48,417
Where's the MC?

273
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:49,687
-Well...
-Hey.

274
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:52,617
-She needs to sing soon.
-Come here.

275
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,687
What do you think you're doing?

276
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:58,957
Where's your announcer friend
who said she'd host?

277
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:02,057
You're the bride.
You shouldn't be doing it yourself.

278
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:03,857
I don't know.

279
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,387
She works in Hong Kong.

280
00:17:05,587 --> 00:17:07,687
Her flight was delayed,
and I can't reach her.

281
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:09,787
-I don't think she can make it.
-What?

282
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:14,187
You told your in-laws
you had an announcer friend.

283
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:16,117
This is so embarrassing.

284
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:19,117
Why did you call a friend from Hong Kong?

285
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:21,287
She speaks fluent Korean.

286
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:23,657
She's the foreign friend
who will make me look good.

287
00:17:23,857 --> 00:17:25,617
My goodness. That is true.

288
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,017
Do you have a replacement?

289
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,287
Like who?

290
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:32,287
How have you been, Aera?

291
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:33,917
Are you...

292
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,087
-...dating?
-Are you?

293
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:38,787
I'm just...

294
00:17:38,987 --> 00:17:40,487
I'm more focused on work.

295
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:43,757
Next time,
we'll come over to where you are.

296
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:46,157
Let's meet up
in her part of town next time.

297
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,257
-Our treat.
-Yes.

298
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,917
Come over. I'll treat you.

299
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:52,687
Really?

300
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:57,227
-Okay, then. You can buy.
-Okay.

301
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:59,957
Try not to miss our gatherings.

302
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:02,357
We should see each other
from time to time.

303
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:04,957
Right. What are friends for?

304
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:07,227
We'll let you pay half the membership fee.

305
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:08,887
-Right.
-Why?

306
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:11,417
Why should I pay half?

307
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:14,157
-What?
-Watch it.

308
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:21,387
What are you doing?

309
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:24,787
Are you being considerate or insulting?

310
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:28,117
I don't have a boyfriend,
I didn't study abroad,

311
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,227
and I don't have a flashy job.
Am I a charity case?

312
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:33,087
I'm doing fine.

313
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:35,357
I enjoy my life just fine.

314
00:18:35,887 --> 00:18:39,617
I'm fine with my life.
Why do you look down on me?

315
00:18:40,257 --> 00:18:41,287
That's ridiculous.

316
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,947
-We just...
-Well...

317
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,257
We only meant...

318
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:53,070
This is when I should
go to the restroom, right?

319
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:58,487
Wait.

320
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:03,187
You won't go straight home
or anything, will you?

321
00:19:03,387 --> 00:19:04,357
Hey.

322
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:07,187
I'll tell you if and
when I decide to leave.

323
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,017
Goodness.

324
00:19:21,657 --> 00:19:24,457
Choi Aera, how lame.

325
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:26,357
You're twisted.

326
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,727
I should have just let it slip.

327
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:34,757
Gosh, stop being embarrassing.
Let's leave.

328
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:36,687
They won't notice if I'm gone.

329
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:38,457
Aera.

330
00:19:40,487 --> 00:19:41,557
Please save me.

331
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:48,117
I'm Choi Aera, not Cindy Jung.

332
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,227
No, I won't do it. Ask somebody else.

333
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,287
You like speaking into the microphone.

334
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:56,117
If not the next Baik Jiyeon,
who would be the host?

335
00:19:57,987 --> 00:20:00,057
I don't even know who Cindy Jung is...

336
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:02,287
...and all our friends know I'm not her.

337
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:04,687
I'll make sure they don't say a word...

338
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:08,787
...and nobody else knows
who Cindy Jung is either.

339
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:10,557
What?

340
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:12,287
Have you watched
Hong Kong news in your life?

341
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:15,917
Cindy is an anchor in Hong Kong
and was raised abroad.

342
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:18,057
Nobody would know her face.

343
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:20,987
If you say okay to this, you'll become...

344
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,257
...Cindy Jung this one evening.

345
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:24,617
Forget it. I don't want to. I won't.

346
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:28,017
Hey, you owe me this.

347
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:29,857
You stole my boyfriend from me.

348
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,957
Hey, is that what you want to
say on your wedding day?

349
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:38,887
If you don't help me,
my wedding will be ruined.

350
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:41,117
Please save me.

351
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:47,457
Why do you have to
make me feel uncomfortable?

352
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:48,857
If you agree to do it...

353
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,417
You get to wear this.

354
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,057
It was for Cindy Jung,

355
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:01,687
but you can wear it.

356
00:21:19,017 --> 00:21:21,657
It mustn't have been the prince whom...

357
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,657
...the innocent Cinderella
fell in love with,

358
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:27,727
but the dress.

359
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:42,017
I'm late.

360
00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:44,157
-It's okay.
-Welcome.

361
00:21:46,457 --> 00:21:48,217
I wore the dress...

362
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:51,887
...and at the end
of this aisle is a microphone.

363
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:55,987
Everybody is looking at me.

364
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:58,157
I'm supposed to say I'm nervous,

365
00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:01,057
but I feel so happy.

366
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:07,657
As soon as I wrap my hand
around the microphone,

367
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:10,717
the world becomes mine.

368
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:21,457
Here's an announcement for all the guests.

369
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:25,287
In a short time,
we'll be starting the wedding party...

370
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:28,417
...of Kim Younggyu and Park Chansook.

371
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:31,657
Please don't remain seated...

372
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,517
...and please show us how carefree you are.

373
00:22:35,717 --> 00:22:37,857
All right. Let's get the party started.

374
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:40,587
Who is she?

375
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:47,157
Before we get to the performance
by the groom's aunt...

376
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:51,657
Let's see if you can't get married...

377
00:22:51,857 --> 00:22:53,787
...if you can't sing.

378
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:56,087
We'll find that out.

379
00:22:57,817 --> 00:22:59,387
You can do everything you want,

380
00:23:01,017 --> 00:23:04,257
but I just need one thing.

381
00:23:05,687 --> 00:23:07,587
Let me sing.

382
00:23:08,657 --> 00:23:09,887
Make it as smooth as you can.

383
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:13,227
Where's our beautiful bride?

384
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:14,396
-Chansook.
-Oh, dear.

385
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:17,487
Oh, dear. Why is she doing that?

386
00:23:17,578 --> 00:23:18,696
Why is she doing that?

387
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:19,987
-Go on.
-Please come up.

388
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:21,117
No.

389
00:23:22,257 --> 00:23:23,417
My gosh.

390
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:25,387
She's an anchor from Hong Kong.

391
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:27,057
She was raised abroad.

392
00:23:27,617 --> 00:23:29,387
Her name is Cindy Jung.

393
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:32,087
She's a global talent.

394
00:23:46,387 --> 00:23:49,687
Why didn't you say it?

395
00:23:50,217 --> 00:23:53,387
Or couldn't you say it?

396
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:55,287
Didn't you...

397
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:57,817
She's singing a song
like she has an untold story.

398
00:23:58,057 --> 00:23:59,787
It's so emotional.

399
00:24:00,487 --> 00:24:02,557
If you liked me...

400
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:03,917
She never studied, right?

401
00:24:04,717 --> 00:24:07,057
I noticed at first sight.

402
00:24:07,257 --> 00:24:09,617
Why didn't he hook up...

403
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:11,587
...with a girl at his level?

404
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:14,909
Why did you say that?

405
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:21,957
Must I hate you?

406
00:24:22,187 --> 00:24:24,487
Younggyu's bride is so talented.

407
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:26,287
-She's so good.
-Sure.

408
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:29,417
Do I have to blame myself?

409
00:24:29,657 --> 00:24:32,517
If I can turn back time...

410
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:34,857
Why is she singing
"Resignation" on her wedding day?

411
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:40,117
I want to return...

412
00:24:40,587 --> 00:24:45,787
To the old days...

413
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:53,117
Please give her a round of applause.

414
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:02,757
I can't believe
Chansook is getting married today.

415
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:04,717
It's a miracle.

416
00:25:05,157 --> 00:25:07,787
I never imagined that Chansook...

417
00:25:07,878 --> 00:25:09,779
...would get married before me.

418
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,917
When we were in Pungmul Band together,

419
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:15,412
she was something else.

420
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,387
She must be crazy.

421
00:25:18,757 --> 00:25:21,117
Is she going to talk about
that guy from the band?

422
00:25:21,817 --> 00:25:24,012
Miss Park Chansook...

423
00:25:36,717 --> 00:25:39,717
She only knew how to strike a gong.

424
00:25:40,087 --> 00:25:43,017
She never knew how to hang out with guys.

425
00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:47,157
I can't believe that
innocent fool met a man.

426
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:52,887
She met a reliable lifetime partner...

427
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:54,917
...and she's getting married today.

428
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:59,087
I'm so touched and moved to tears.

429
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:04,987
A precious daughter from a family...

430
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:08,957
...became a precious daughter-in-law.

431
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:12,517
Our bride is still young and sensitive,

432
00:26:13,187 --> 00:26:14,817
but I hope that her road to a new life...

433
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:19,387
..is filled with guidance by the adults.

434
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:22,557
We'll now have the woman of great influence,

435
00:26:23,057 --> 00:26:25,957
the groom's aunt,
give us a special performance.

436
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:27,557
-Me?
-Yes.

437
00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:32,157
Good job.

438
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:36,887
Hey, I think I'm going to
change my host to Aera too.

439
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:39,787
She's the same Aera
as before with the microphone.

440
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:41,617
Baik Jiyeon is back.

441
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:57,917
I never stole your boyfriend,

442
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,487
but I paid back what I owed anyway.

443
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:01,487
Be happy.

444
00:27:02,357 --> 00:27:03,357
Thank you.

445
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:05,987
-Hey.
-Gosh.

446
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:08,417
You still make me feel uncomfortable.

447
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:14,017
She's so smart.

448
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:16,657
Don't you see a halo around her?

449
00:27:16,857 --> 00:27:19,157
She's so charming.

450
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:22,917
I need to meet
a luxurious person like her.

451
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:42,387
Why did you buy this?

452
00:27:42,687 --> 00:27:45,657
You should use money on yourself.
This is unnecessary.

453
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:51,017
I wanted to eat outside.

454
00:27:51,257 --> 00:27:53,117
Why would you prepare
your own birthday dinner?

455
00:27:54,217 --> 00:27:57,657
Stop saying that your back hurts.

456
00:27:57,917 --> 00:28:00,787
This is actually really good.

457
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:03,587
As soon as I put it on,
it feels like my back is fine.

458
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:08,117
But it was expensive, right?
How much did you pay?

459
00:28:08,857 --> 00:28:11,787
You're so talkative. We need to eat.

460
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:16,217
Stop yelling at Mom.

461
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,534
She's 60 soon.

462
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:21,287
Where did you get the money to buy that?

463
00:28:22,817 --> 00:28:25,057
I earned it. I didn't steal it.

464
00:28:25,148 --> 00:28:26,587
Do you even work?

465
00:28:28,157 --> 00:28:29,787
You do some part-time work, right?

466
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:32,157
You're starting again.

467
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:35,157
He won't come home because of you.

468
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:36,957
I don't do nothing.

469
00:28:37,987 --> 00:28:39,017
I work.

470
00:28:39,257 --> 00:28:42,657
Don't waste your time.
Become a Taekwondo instructor.

471
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:46,487
You need to work in your field.

472
00:28:47,117 --> 00:28:48,299
Why would you do something else?

473
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:51,517
Just look for an instructor job somewhere.

474
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:53,217
Father.

475
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:57,087
If you look up my name on the website,

476
00:28:57,657 --> 00:29:00,287
the articles from
November 3, 2007 still pop up.

477
00:29:01,817 --> 00:29:04,021
Who would take lessons from me? Who?

478
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:07,287
Stop being unmanly.
Does that still bother you?

479
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:10,217
You're so pathetic.

480
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:11,817
How will you live a proper life
with that mindset?

481
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,587
You're right. I can't live a proper life.

482
00:29:14,757 --> 00:29:17,657
I just live day by day as it goes by.

483
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,457
All I'm capable of doing is Taekwondo.

484
00:29:21,548 --> 00:29:23,887
It's not easy to earn money
by doing something else.

485
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:25,387
It's pathetic.

486
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:27,887
You want me to become an instructor?

487
00:29:29,357 --> 00:29:32,617
I'm not even going to go
near that sport again.

488
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:34,457
So don't ever say that to me again.

489
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:35,787
Just let it go.

490
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:37,757
Why are you still so angry about...

491
00:29:37,848 --> 00:29:39,744
It's not because I'm angry!

492
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:44,987
I'm scared that
I might want to do it again.

493
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:48,787
Okay? I'm scared that
I might really want to do it.

494
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,057
So I don't even want to think about it.

495
00:29:56,117 --> 00:29:57,926
If you were able to use
your connections back then,

496
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:00,887
I wouldn't have gotten eliminated.

497
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:04,087
If you hadn't failed your business,

498
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:07,187
I wouldn't have entered
that competition at all.

499
00:30:08,687 --> 00:30:09,757
Dongman.

500
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,017
-Donghee will hear you.
-You're the one...

501
00:30:17,987 --> 00:30:20,187
...who should've protected Donghee,
not me.

502
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:24,057
Why did it have to be me?

503
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:26,917
Why me?

504
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:29,829
Why is it always me?

505
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:35,957
My gosh.

506
00:31:10,517 --> 00:31:11,857
-Here.
-Hey.

507
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:13,757
Why did you bring so many bottles?

508
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:17,787
You completely saved me today.

509
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:20,717
You brought so many bottles.

510
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:22,617
You can drink everything here.

511
00:31:22,817 --> 00:31:24,217
This is French cheese.

512
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:28,287
They should be serving shark's fin soup.

513
00:31:28,378 --> 00:31:31,417
Hey, try to pronounce it more softly.

514
00:31:31,508 --> 00:31:32,544
Cheers.

515
00:31:33,387 --> 00:31:34,387
Bottoms up.

516
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:36,917
My goodness.

517
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:39,787
So many people are watching you.

518
00:31:39,987 --> 00:31:41,287
Okay, fine.

519
00:31:41,757 --> 00:31:42,887
Let's drink this.

520
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:45,457
I'm so happy today.

521
00:31:45,657 --> 00:31:47,117
Pour me a glass.

522
00:31:47,317 --> 00:31:48,587
Honey, we should greet our guests.

523
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:49,887
You shouldn't be drinking right now.

524
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:53,417
Honey, do I reek of alcohol?

525
00:31:53,508 --> 00:31:54,417
Yes.

526
00:31:56,117 --> 00:31:59,557
My gosh, you're such a jolly person.

527
00:32:00,387 --> 00:32:02,511
Please take care of my friend, Cindy.

528
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:09,517
Hello, Cindy.

529
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:11,757
Let's have a drink together.

530
00:32:12,157 --> 00:32:13,157
Okay.

531
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:39,787
-My gosh.
-That's incredible.

532
00:32:39,878 --> 00:32:42,787
I never saw a woman pull
this kind of trick before.

533
00:32:43,257 --> 00:32:46,457
How should I say this?
Seeing a woman doing this is...

534
00:32:46,657 --> 00:32:48,017
How should I put this in words?

535
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:49,917
Do you mean...

536
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:53,017
I'm unique. I'm a unique woman.

537
00:32:53,657 --> 00:32:56,787
"Unique." You just used English.

538
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:59,657
-Drink as punishment.
-Drink as punishment.

539
00:32:59,804 --> 00:33:01,629
-Drink...
-Why am I the only one getting caught?

540
00:33:01,787 --> 00:33:04,456
You should drink slowly.

541
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,757
You drank a lot.

542
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:08,487
Cindy, I'll drink that for you.
Give me your glass.

543
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:11,357
Why would I share my drink with you?
It's such a waste.

544
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,917
Cindy, I'll drink it for you.

545
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,987
Instead, my wish is to drive you home.

546
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:20,517
Cindy, I'll drink it for you
and drive you home.

547
00:33:20,757 --> 00:33:23,387
No, I said it first. I'll drive you home.

548
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:24,617
What are you saying?

549
00:33:24,817 --> 00:33:26,757
My goodness, what's with you guys?

550
00:33:26,987 --> 00:33:28,717
I'm a strong drinker. Don't worry.

551
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:30,487
Cindy, tell us.

552
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:32,317
Which one of us will you choose?

553
00:33:34,287 --> 00:33:35,517
-It's me, right?
-It's me, right?

554
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:36,757
I'm just asking for fun.

555
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:40,087
Then...

556
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:44,087
I'll ask him to drink it for me.

557
00:33:44,178 --> 00:33:45,687
He was the quietest.

558
00:33:47,017 --> 00:33:49,457
-Me?
-You can't give it to him.

559
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:51,317
He can't drink.

560
00:33:51,787 --> 00:33:53,387
-Hey!
-No!

561
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:54,617
-Hey.
-It's too late.

562
00:33:57,117 --> 00:33:58,417
My gosh, we're in trouble.

563
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,217
Please give us a glass of ice water.

564
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:10,127
The Path of Martial Arts

565
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:17,887
National Athlete's Sundae

566
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:19,287
Mom

567
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:21,687
Give your dad a call.

568
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:23,517
If you leave like that,

569
00:34:23,857 --> 00:34:25,817
he won't be able to sleep tonight.

570
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:28,157
And Donghee...

571
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,657
...will also feel upset.

572
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:37,287
He has a great kick.

573
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:40,387
He doesn't have a great kick.
He has a weak hook.

574
00:34:40,587 --> 00:34:41,857
His kick is just better than his hook.

575
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:45,717
My gosh, you're so cheap with compliments.

576
00:34:45,808 --> 00:34:46,964
He's not satisfied with anyone.

577
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:49,627
What are you talking about?

578
00:34:49,718 --> 00:34:51,853
He's very generous towards his first love.

579
00:34:54,787 --> 00:34:57,257
Coach, is he that good?

580
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:58,887
Is he better than me?

581
00:34:59,627 --> 00:35:02,887
You think too highly of yourself.

582
00:35:03,517 --> 00:35:06,517
On the other hand,
he underestimates himself too much.

583
00:35:08,717 --> 00:35:10,457
By the way, you jerk.

584
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:13,627
I heard that you still go around...

585
00:35:13,827 --> 00:35:15,357
...fighting people like a dog these days.

586
00:35:15,617 --> 00:35:17,057
I guess I fight like a dog
because I am one.

587
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:19,917
This is my last warning.
Don't fight, okay?

588
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:35,857
Mom packed a lot of side dishes for me.

589
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:38,127
I came to have a drink with my coach.

590
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:41,414
It's been ages since
your coach opened a restaurant.

591
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:44,310
It took you so long
to drop by and say hello.

592
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:47,917
I heard you had the best kick ever.

593
00:35:48,117 --> 00:35:49,457
Stop talking nonsense.

594
00:35:50,627 --> 00:35:52,157
Let's have a match.

595
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:54,757
I'd love to learn a few moves from you.

596
00:35:55,217 --> 00:35:56,957
That's funny.

597
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,957
I'm just curious about
how talented you are...

598
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,078
...because our coach is still
head over heels for you.

599
00:36:01,657 --> 00:36:03,017
I just want to see for myself.

600
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:04,887
I'm really jealous.

601
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:06,157
Are you drunk?

602
00:36:06,387 --> 00:36:09,457
Oh, right.
He doesn't fight for nothing, does he?

603
00:36:11,787 --> 00:36:13,787
Then let's bet 100 dollars.

604
00:36:14,017 --> 00:36:15,587
Let's just have one light match.

605
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:19,226
Go inside and sleep if you're drunk.

606
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:20,657
Okay, fine. Forget it.

607
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,057
You probably aren't proud
to say that you played it.

608
00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:29,287
I guess that makes you a normal person.

609
00:36:29,757 --> 00:36:31,757
It won't be fair for you
to go against a pro like me.

610
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:35,017
Let's do it.

611
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:39,957
Let's fight.

612
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:44,917
Dongman.

613
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:47,757
You haven't worn this in 10 years,
have you?

614
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:49,387
I wonder if it'll still fit you.

615
00:36:49,987 --> 00:36:51,017
I don't want to wear it.

616
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:53,387
You're going to fight with no protection?

617
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:55,657
I guess you think you can easily beat me.

618
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:58,657
You're right. It's not like
you're a nonprofessional.

619
00:36:58,917 --> 00:36:59,957
You won't need this.

620
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:03,517
Just think of this as a warm up, okay?

621
00:37:08,387 --> 00:37:09,939
This is the first and last round.

622
00:37:12,257 --> 00:37:15,017
Let's see how good you are. Come on.

623
00:37:34,817 --> 00:37:37,487
Coach, you told me that he's fast.

624
00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:38,957
I'm not even doing my best right now.

625
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:43,271
Again.

626
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,057
Stop it!

627
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:13,587
Get out, all of you.

628
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:16,287
I'm going to go sell sundae.

629
00:38:22,871 --> 00:38:24,989
That jerk has become useless.

630
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:50,417
National Athlete's Sundae

631
00:38:53,517 --> 00:38:54,517
Coach.

632
00:38:55,517 --> 00:38:56,987
You're on your way
to my neighborhood, right?

633
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:58,517
Can you give me a ride?

634
00:38:58,787 --> 00:39:00,487
I'm not going near
your neighborhood anymore.

635
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:07,017
Right? I'm hopeless, aren't I?

636
00:39:07,957 --> 00:39:10,757
How could I ever fight again?
I'm a total moron now.

637
00:39:11,257 --> 00:39:12,257
Hey.

638
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:17,487
Wipe your mouth. Stop upsetting me.

639
00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:26,679
But it was nice.

640
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:30,557
It was nice being hit.

641
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:36,388
I felt so relieved when I got hit.

642
00:39:37,457 --> 00:39:38,487
Seriously.

643
00:39:40,487 --> 00:39:42,487
I said go, you punk!

644
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:50,127
If you can't drink, you should've refused.

645
00:39:50,457 --> 00:39:52,987
What are you, a kid?

646
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,187
So inconvenient.

647
00:40:09,127 --> 00:40:11,302
-Because of the wish.
-Sorry?

648
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:15,120
I really can't drink,

649
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:18,317
but I risked my life to drink for you.

650
00:40:19,657 --> 00:40:20,957
Gosh.

651
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:23,487
Was that the first time
you drank for a girl?

652
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:27,127
I'll use my wish now.

653
00:40:27,387 --> 00:40:29,627
Go ahead. What do you want?

654
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,487
Well, you see...

655
00:40:33,817 --> 00:40:36,287
You're going home later, right?

656
00:40:36,557 --> 00:40:38,457
Of course, I'm going home.
Where else would I go?

657
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:42,187
Get it together and stop babbling.

658
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:45,257
Take the bus home alone later.

659
00:40:47,157 --> 00:40:48,187
Sorry?

660
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:52,187
Take the bus home alone. That's my wish.

661
00:40:53,587 --> 00:40:54,787
But...

662
00:40:55,157 --> 00:40:58,657
...your friends insist on taking me home,

663
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,127
-so why would I take the bus?
-No.

664
00:41:00,387 --> 00:41:02,257
Just take the bus home alone.

665
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,857
It's all about the 1 million won.

666
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:12,317
Awesome.

667
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:15,587
-Look at this.
-What is it?

668
00:41:16,987 --> 00:41:18,357
This is Cindy Jung?

669
00:41:18,987 --> 00:41:22,517
-Then who is she?
-An impostor, obviously.

670
00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:26,487
She must've wanted to
become Cinderella today.

671
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:30,357
Cinderella would've been found
easily in modern times.

672
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:32,517
-I'm sure she had a reason.
-Okay.

673
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:36,187
Then should we
make her the 1 million girl?

674
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:38,587
She should be punished
for doing something bad.

675
00:41:39,887 --> 00:41:40,887
-I'm in.
-I'm in.

676
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:42,871
Come on. You don't even know anything.

677
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:46,057
Okay, depending on whose car...

678
00:41:46,257 --> 00:41:47,787
...the fake Cindy Jung gets into later,

679
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:49,717
that person gets one million won.

680
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:51,487
Let's play fair.

681
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:53,757
-One, two, three, let's go.
-Let's go.

682
00:41:53,987 --> 00:41:56,757
Getting her in your car
gets you 1 million won.

683
00:41:56,957 --> 00:41:58,917
If you take the fake to a hotel,
it's 2 million won.

684
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:01,557
She isn't classy enough for a hotel.

685
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:04,517
-Let's make it a motel.
-You need to send a photo.

686
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:06,557
She really will be Cinderella for the night.

687
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:15,317
Please go first. I'll be right out.

688
00:42:16,157 --> 00:42:17,157
Okay.

689
00:42:17,557 --> 00:42:19,157
I'll wait outside.

690
00:42:55,957 --> 00:42:59,987
Dongman

691
00:43:07,257 --> 00:43:08,287
Hey.

692
00:43:09,457 --> 00:43:10,587
Pick me up.

693
00:43:13,387 --> 00:43:15,144
Just come.

694
00:43:18,127 --> 00:43:19,652
I feel so humiliated...

695
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:25,457
I can't leave by myself, so come.

696
00:43:25,692 --> 00:43:26,957
I'm not your driver.

697
00:43:27,657 --> 00:43:29,287
I don't even have a car.

698
00:43:32,587 --> 00:43:33,717
Hey, what's wrong?

699
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:35,587
Did something happen?

700
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:38,787
-It must be that microphone girl.
-Speak clearly!

701
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:41,287
Where are you?

702
00:43:42,357 --> 00:43:43,417
Okay. Bye.

703
00:43:47,387 --> 00:43:48,387
I'm leaving.

704
00:43:51,817 --> 00:43:52,887
Sure.

705
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:56,257
Only that girl can awaken
that side of Dongman.

706
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:01,587
Cindy, sorry our weakling friend
caused you trouble.

707
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,287
Cindy, did you wash your face?

708
00:44:06,587 --> 00:44:09,017
Yes. I wanted to wake myself up.

709
00:44:09,287 --> 00:44:11,057
What's wrong with being a little drunk?

710
00:44:11,287 --> 00:44:14,387
I'll take you home safely anyway.

711
00:44:14,587 --> 00:44:16,687
-I'll go home on my own.
-Cindy.

712
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:18,687
I'll drive you.

713
00:44:20,757 --> 00:44:21,887
I won't go with you.

714
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,157
I just got a new car.

715
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,417
It's super hot.

716
00:44:27,287 --> 00:44:28,457
Do you know what it is?

717
00:44:29,687 --> 00:44:31,787
-What car is it?
-That there.

718
00:44:32,287 --> 00:44:34,517
-Isn't it awesome?
-Just go in my car.

719
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:37,417
-A classic luxury car is the best.
-Cindy.

720
00:44:37,687 --> 00:44:39,417
-My car...
-And what do you drive?

721
00:44:39,617 --> 00:44:40,657
Mine is, what?

722
00:44:40,841 --> 00:44:42,217
So, it's...

723
00:44:42,587 --> 00:44:45,610
These, right? One, two, three.

724
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:00,517
Oh, no!

725
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:05,117
Stop it! No!

726
00:45:09,117 --> 00:45:12,157
No! Darn it.

727
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:22,257
Listen up. I won't repeat myself.

728
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:24,987
I'm not Cindy Jung,

729
00:45:25,217 --> 00:45:27,638
but Choi Aera of Lucky Department Store.

730
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:31,526
Bring me your invoice
for fixing your mirrors.

731
00:45:31,617 --> 00:45:32,917
I'll give you your 1 million won.

732
00:45:34,817 --> 00:45:36,417
I'll pay you back.

733
00:45:36,887 --> 00:45:39,817
Make sure to bring the receipt
and come to get revenge.

734
00:45:40,057 --> 00:45:42,417
Why you...

735
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:43,557
You freak show!

736
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:47,617
Freak show?

737
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,687
You can't even talk straight.

738
00:45:54,757 --> 00:45:58,787
If we meet again,
I'll show you a real freak show.

739
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:01,957
Let's bet our lives for one million won.

740
00:46:03,157 --> 00:46:05,434
Let's meet again.

741
00:46:10,257 --> 00:46:12,587
You crazy witch.
Where do you think you're going?

742
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,917
Hey. Let go of her.

743
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,117
Let go. Are you insane?

744
00:46:18,387 --> 00:46:20,457
How dare you cheap schemer
pull this garbage?

745
00:46:20,657 --> 00:46:22,287
What? You have pride, is that it?

746
00:46:22,487 --> 00:46:25,757
If I'm a schemer,
you're just lowlife scumbags.

747
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:27,787
What, 2 million won
if you take me to a hotel?

748
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:32,117
Only because it's a bet among us.
You're not worth 2,000 won.

749
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:36,117
I wouldn't sleep with you
for 20 million won.

750
00:46:37,617 --> 00:46:39,817
You couldn't get
a girl in bed without money.

751
00:46:40,017 --> 00:46:42,357
-They're fighting.
-You loser.

752
00:46:44,257 --> 00:46:46,287
-Hey.
-Get up.

753
00:46:46,487 --> 00:46:47,495
Hey.

754
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:51,817
Brats like this need to learn a lesson.

755
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,987
You can repay me for my mirror with this.

756
00:46:55,517 --> 00:46:56,857
Hey, you!

757
00:47:17,817 --> 00:47:20,457
Run. Get in your car and lock the door.

758
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:23,517
Hey. Call the cops. Get in.

759
00:47:23,717 --> 00:47:24,617
Run.

760
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,557
Hey. What are you? He just hit my hand.

761
00:47:48,817 --> 00:47:49,957
He hit my hand.

762
00:47:52,017 --> 00:47:53,487
He slapped me.

763
00:47:53,857 --> 00:47:55,557
My face...

764
00:47:55,757 --> 00:47:57,257
He slapped me.

765
00:47:59,657 --> 00:48:01,217
-That hurts!
-It does, right?

766
00:48:01,657 --> 00:48:02,817
Then why did you hit her?

767
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:05,887
-Why did you slap a girl?
-Why you...

768
00:48:08,057 --> 00:48:10,457
-Why did you hit her?
-That was a vital point.

769
00:48:10,817 --> 00:48:12,217
I'm getting...

770
00:48:12,717 --> 00:48:14,017
Why did you hit her?

771
00:48:15,757 --> 00:48:16,817
That hurts.

772
00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:20,917
That's enough. Let's go.

773
00:48:23,057 --> 00:48:24,817
Hey. Did you call the cops?

774
00:48:25,017 --> 00:48:26,617
-I did.
-Yes.

775
00:48:26,817 --> 00:48:29,357
You pathetic losers!

776
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:34,357
Hey, you. If you want to live,
shut your mouth.

777
00:48:35,387 --> 00:48:37,857
A witch like that needs to be hit
to learn her lesson!

778
00:48:38,517 --> 00:48:39,987
I said to shut your mouth.

779
00:48:40,557 --> 00:48:43,157
-Why that little...
-Goodness.

780
00:48:45,557 --> 00:48:49,501
He suddenly ran at me
and did a flying kick.

781
00:48:49,787 --> 00:48:51,917
I can't bend my wrist.

782
00:48:52,157 --> 00:48:54,157
I didn't hit him.
I didn't want to stoop to his level.

783
00:48:55,787 --> 00:48:58,957
They hit each other.
Why is he the only one locked up?

784
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:01,787
Look, miss. How was this mutual?

785
00:49:02,457 --> 00:49:04,757
Look before you speak.

786
00:49:04,957 --> 00:49:06,887
They deserved to be beaten up.

787
00:49:07,087 --> 00:49:08,642
Plus, for Ko Dongman,

788
00:49:08,757 --> 00:49:10,717
if he hit people,
it becomes an attempted murder.

789
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:12,887
Why would a former
Korean Taekwondo representative...

790
00:49:13,004 --> 00:49:14,417
...hit civilians?

791
00:49:14,687 --> 00:49:16,617
See? I knew it.

792
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,887
I usually don't get hit.

793
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:22,487
I'm not negotiating.
Officer, you should arrest her.

794
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,717
She's a gold digger.

795
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:25,657
No, she's not.

796
00:49:26,157 --> 00:49:27,257
She only broke your rear view mirror.

797
00:49:27,657 --> 00:49:28,757
Be quiet.

798
00:49:28,848 --> 00:49:30,236
Here, Coach.

799
00:49:31,217 --> 00:49:33,057
Is he here to negotiate for you?

800
00:49:33,717 --> 00:49:35,645
I'm sorry for calling you, Coach,

801
00:49:35,757 --> 00:49:37,417
but I didn't know whom else to call.

802
00:49:38,357 --> 00:49:40,657
I'm not negotiating.

803
00:49:43,357 --> 00:49:44,417
Are your ribs broken?

804
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:45,817
What?

805
00:49:46,457 --> 00:49:48,117
Maybe.

806
00:49:48,357 --> 00:49:50,287
How did you get hit?
Was it a punch or a kick?

807
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:52,217
-What?
-What about your teeth?

808
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:54,757
Are they okay? Open your mouth.

809
00:49:55,357 --> 00:49:57,817
I have a few loose teeth,

810
00:49:58,487 --> 00:50:00,287
but I'm not negotiating.

811
00:50:00,557 --> 00:50:03,017
Did it just take one punch? Two teeth?

812
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:04,857
-Yes.
-Are you sure?

813
00:50:05,057 --> 00:50:07,057
What are you doing?

814
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:08,687
Where did you come from?

815
00:50:13,117 --> 00:50:17,257
In his heyday, he knocked out
two teeth with one blow...

816
00:50:17,817 --> 00:50:19,717
...and broke three ribs with one kick.

817
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:23,687
But I guess he can still do it.

818
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:24,987
Does he have a criminal history?

819
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:26,817
It wasn't in his record.

820
00:50:27,017 --> 00:50:28,657
He's still powerful.

821
00:50:28,857 --> 00:50:30,387
Are you here to check his strength?

822
00:50:31,717 --> 00:50:33,857
Did you guys all go insane?

823
00:50:34,087 --> 00:50:37,657
Officer, I don't need money.
Please put him in jail.

824
00:50:38,357 --> 00:50:41,287
How dare a dumb athlete hit me?

825
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:43,557
What did you say?

826
00:50:45,487 --> 00:50:46,757
A dumb what?

827
00:50:47,217 --> 00:50:50,557
You picked on the wrong person.
Do you know who I am?

828
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:55,657
My uncle is a judge
at Jeonju Prosecutors' Office.

829
00:50:56,117 --> 00:50:57,257
My gosh.

830
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,487
Fine, put him in jail.

831
00:51:03,187 --> 00:51:04,787
But do you know who I am?

832
00:51:05,617 --> 00:51:08,387
What? Who are you? What did you do?

833
00:51:08,687 --> 00:51:11,217
You should pick on me less than...

834
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:13,087
...the nephew of the judge
at the prosecutors' office.

835
00:51:15,157 --> 00:51:16,217
I'm crazy.

836
00:51:17,417 --> 00:51:18,417
What?

837
00:51:19,017 --> 00:51:22,657
If he goes to jail,
I'll go to your hospital every day.

838
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:26,026
I'll print out your dirty chatting logs...

839
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:28,757
...and hand them out
at the entrance of your hospital.

840
00:51:28,848 --> 00:51:30,917
I'll follow you until the day I die.

841
00:51:31,387 --> 00:51:32,457
Your wedding?

842
00:51:32,717 --> 00:51:35,987
Of course.
I'll follow you with the chatting logs...

843
00:51:36,187 --> 00:51:37,617
...even on your
children's school entrance ceremonies.

844
00:51:38,117 --> 00:51:41,987
Fine, let's do this for life. All right?

845
00:51:44,487 --> 00:51:45,787
How did you find her?

846
00:52:01,287 --> 00:52:03,787
Did you do something wrong?
Why are you looking down?

847
00:52:05,387 --> 00:52:06,457
I'll pay you back.

848
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:08,557
We were supposed to pay him
for the damage anyways.

849
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,387
Let's just say that
was your settlement money.

850
00:52:10,917 --> 00:52:11,917
You saved that up.

851
00:52:14,057 --> 00:52:16,287
You saved up to get married.

852
00:52:18,857 --> 00:52:21,657
I'm not getting married.
Hurry. I'm hungry.

853
00:52:28,957 --> 00:52:29,957
By the way,

854
00:52:30,757 --> 00:52:33,087
wasn't that your first
spinning kick in a long time?

855
00:52:34,557 --> 00:52:35,617
Aren't you happy?

856
00:52:37,457 --> 00:52:38,487
What's the whole point?

857
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:43,887
This was the first time
I held the mic in a while too.

858
00:52:46,287 --> 00:52:47,487
Were you happy?

859
00:52:49,817 --> 00:52:51,357
You're unbelievable when you kick, right?

860
00:52:51,687 --> 00:52:53,257
I'm the same way when I grab onto a mic.

861
00:52:58,257 --> 00:53:00,117
What? Let me see.

862
00:53:00,687 --> 00:53:02,257
Did your gum split open?

863
00:53:03,387 --> 00:53:05,857
I should have killed that crazy jerk.

864
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,585
Let's see. Let me see.

865
00:53:10,817 --> 00:53:12,517
You can't even look after yourself,

866
00:53:12,717 --> 00:53:14,657
but you always try to defend others.

867
00:53:15,557 --> 00:53:17,587
Hey, we're not strangers.

868
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:23,617
I can live an embarrassing life,
but you shouldn't.

869
00:53:23,957 --> 00:53:25,817
Don't let others think lowly of you.

870
00:53:29,787 --> 00:53:31,469
Why is your life so embarrassing?

871
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:40,457
Remember...

872
00:53:42,087 --> 00:53:44,817
...how he said I was a dumb athlete?

873
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:47,717
I'm that lame dude.

874
00:53:52,517 --> 00:53:53,687
Hey, Dongman.

875
00:53:55,817 --> 00:53:57,187
You're dumb,

876
00:53:58,487 --> 00:53:59,517
but you're not lame.

877
00:54:02,557 --> 00:54:03,557
What?

878
00:54:03,817 --> 00:54:05,957
You'll make it big. I know it.

879
00:54:09,487 --> 00:54:11,017
Everybody thinks I'm lame.

880
00:54:11,887 --> 00:54:13,187
Do they even know you?

881
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,287
I've known you for 20 years.

882
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:19,017
Nobody else knows you more than I do.
Trust me.

883
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:21,387
Regardless of what people say,

884
00:54:22,357 --> 00:54:23,387
you'll make it.

885
00:54:25,117 --> 00:54:27,017
And you're still so young.

886
00:54:28,157 --> 00:54:29,395
You'll become something.

887
00:54:29,757 --> 00:54:31,487
You'll make it. I promise you.

888
00:54:34,287 --> 00:54:35,787
Darn it.

889
00:54:40,117 --> 00:54:42,757
Let's go. Let's go home and
order some chicken feet.

890
00:54:48,357 --> 00:54:49,587
What are you doing?

891
00:54:49,817 --> 00:54:50,917
You...

892
00:54:51,887 --> 00:54:53,687
You made me cry.

893
00:54:54,587 --> 00:55:00,110
You give Seolhui a hug
like this when she cries.

894
00:55:01,617 --> 00:55:03,617
-Are you crying?
-Come on.

895
00:55:05,187 --> 00:55:06,257
You...

896
00:55:10,257 --> 00:55:14,217
You fed me gimbap when I was starving.

897
00:55:17,557 --> 00:55:20,557
I was really hungry today.

898
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:27,117
You...

899
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:30,687
You are not really crying, right?

900
00:55:31,857 --> 00:55:34,357
Pat me. Go ahead.

901
00:55:38,687 --> 00:55:40,957
When did you get so big?

902
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:54,257
Is this your bottom?

903
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:56,957
It's my waist.

904
00:55:57,357 --> 00:56:00,857
Please stop hanging around with bad guys.

905
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,817
Stop making me mad.

906
00:56:03,257 --> 00:56:04,687
Gosh.

907
00:56:07,057 --> 00:56:10,787
You just got dumped by Mooki
and came home crying too.

908
00:56:11,617 --> 00:56:12,657
Darn it.

909
00:56:12,783 --> 00:56:13,910
-Get up. Let's go.
-Gosh.

910
00:56:14,657 --> 00:56:16,244
You hit me so hard...

911
00:56:16,587 --> 00:56:18,917
...so why do you let other people hit you?
Don't let them.

912
00:56:19,517 --> 00:56:20,587
Don't go around crying.

913
00:56:21,457 --> 00:56:24,204
Don't drive around breaking
people's rear view mirrors.

914
00:56:29,717 --> 00:56:30,787
Just hang around with me.

915
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:35,487
Hang around with me.

916
00:56:36,617 --> 00:56:37,617
I'll spend time with you.

917
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:41,887
What do you mean?

918
00:56:42,587 --> 00:56:44,387
Are you drunk?

919
00:56:48,117 --> 00:56:51,085
Go. Let's have soju with chicken feet.

920
00:56:51,176 --> 00:56:52,117
Let's go.

921
00:56:55,457 --> 00:56:56,657
It's on me today.

922
00:56:58,587 --> 00:57:00,357
Soju and chicken feet are on me.

923
00:57:01,087 --> 00:57:02,287
Yes, it's on you.

924
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:08,817
Hey! What are you guys doing?

925
00:57:09,787 --> 00:57:10,987
Go.

926
00:57:12,857 --> 00:57:14,387
I can't even work in the fields...

927
00:57:15,987 --> 00:57:18,357
...because of you.

928
00:57:22,087 --> 00:57:25,287
Goodness. Why do you even learn Taekwondo?

929
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,357
You see...

930
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:28,887
I was...

931
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:32,587
...supposed to be the prince,
but they hit me.

932
00:57:36,357 --> 00:57:38,117
Hey, watch me.

933
00:57:39,587 --> 00:57:41,557
This smallest guy is you.

934
00:57:42,217 --> 00:57:45,657
You're a crybaby and
bed wetter who's weaker than me.

935
00:57:46,187 --> 00:57:48,717
But you're sometimes cute, Dongman.

936
00:57:50,017 --> 00:57:52,487
But if you hide this,

937
00:57:52,787 --> 00:57:55,382
nobody will know that you're a dork.

938
00:57:58,587 --> 00:58:01,687
So open your eyes wide...

939
00:58:01,987 --> 00:58:03,087
...and say, "I'll never cry."

940
00:58:03,457 --> 00:58:06,217
Think, "I'll beat all of you,"

941
00:58:06,439 --> 00:58:08,963
and punch them. Got it?

942
00:58:12,787 --> 00:58:15,957
But I still won't marry you.

943
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:19,187
I won't marry you either.

944
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,176
I won't marry you.

945
00:58:55,887 --> 00:58:58,587
Fight For My Way

946
00:58:58,987 --> 00:59:02,417
People have to do what they want in life.

947
00:59:02,857 --> 00:59:04,957
Are you happy you got to do
what you wanted?

948
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,817
If I do mixed martial arts,

949
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:09,987
can I make a lot of money?

950
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:12,517
If you want to make money,
stay away from here.

951
00:59:12,957 --> 00:59:14,757
I made myself clear.

952
00:59:14,957 --> 00:59:17,750
I said I'd kill you if
I ever saw you again.
