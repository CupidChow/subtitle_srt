1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,700
THE ORIGIN OF THE FANTASTIC FOUR

2
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,510
I am too scared to ride alone.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,700
Then, what? Do you want me to ride alone?

4
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:21,361
You know,

5
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:23,905
I am a girl.

6
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:26,074
Is there anyone riding alone?

7
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:27,013
Here.

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,960
Juman, look here.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Ready?

10
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,560
One, two, three.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,190
FINAL EPISODE

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,430
That's enough.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,128
You will have nothing left
if you give away so much.

14
00:00:59,223 --> 00:01:03,934
Text Lush Lady,
"Thank you for the plum extract."

15
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:10,250
Seolhui, by the way...

16
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,245
how did you decide to make wine
when you don't drink?

17
00:01:13,335 --> 00:01:15,870
My dad, you, Dongman, Juman.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,277
Everyone I like is a lush.

19
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:20,867
I noticed that everyone
becomes happy when they drink.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,776
That's true.

21
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:25,110
We were happy thanks to your plum wine.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,895
By the way...

23
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:29,592
everything else is fine,

24
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:32,231
but I miss the four of us
drinking at Namil Bar,

25
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:35,226
and having breakfast together.

26
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:37,416
That's when we recharged ourselves.

27
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:39,687
Why do you miss something that stupid?

28
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,670
One shot himself in the foot,

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,060
and the other left so that he could fight.

30
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:48,447
Juman, that little...

31
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:54,518
Hey, Diaphragm!

32
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:56,955
Why are you being gross
and cooking for me...?

33
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,930
What is this?

34
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:02,339
What are you wearing? That's awful.

35
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:05,281
I'm going to start a lunchbox service.

36
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:06,450
You haven't eat yet, right?

37
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,067
Eat the end pieces.

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,211
I always ate Seolhui's cooking,

39
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,930
but I never cooked for her myself.

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,840
I guess your diaphragm is wide awake now.

41
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,417
I will make her breakfast...

42
00:02:25,507 --> 00:02:28,058
and pick up dinner
from the best restaurants.

43
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:31,154
Don't be like that.

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,597
Why not?

45
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,064
Well, that...

46
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:37,755
That makes me look bad in comparison.

47
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,879
Did you really date Aera?

48
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:42,642
It wasn't in your head?

49
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:45,040
Do you want a beating?

50
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,531
I had no idea at all but
how did you break up already?

51
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:01,887
I guess your plum extract
is selling well now.

52
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,023
I won't eat it.

53
00:03:04,113 --> 00:03:05,425
Don't bother to make it.

54
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,259
Aera, this isn't...

55
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,325
This is between us.

56
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,066
It's between us.

57
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:14,200
This is...

58
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:17,351
...lunch I made for Seolhui.

59
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:20,130
Goodness, this punk.

60
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,160
Did you make this?

61
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:26,736
Yeah.

62
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,350
Also, can you come with me for a minute?

63
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:57,784
Do you want to carpool?

64
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:00,998
What's this?

65
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:04,122
Mr. Choi from team two
was dispatched to an overseas branch.

66
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:05,984
I bought it for cheap.

67
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:07,853
Isn't Mr. Choi a man?

68
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:10,213
Why is everything pink inside?

69
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:11,957
I did some tuning.

70
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:14,356
So you could carpool with me?

71
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,577
-Our country doesn't produce any oil...
-I'm not getting in.

72
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,966
I shouldn't have mentioned the oil.

73
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,780
Get out.

74
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:07,244
When did you learn how to drive?

75
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,736
My parents' restaurant.

76
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,426
We make deliveries by car.

77
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:15,003
My Seolhui got even cooler
after starting her own business.

78
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:17,047
I am not your Seolhui.

79
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,773
You can eat the porridge in the freezer.

80
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,863
Just defrost it and then boil it.

81
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:34,234
Are you cool with it?

82
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,996
Are we talking again
two weeks after breaking up?

83
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,357
I never said that.

84
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:39,687
I am not cool with it.

85
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,360
I feel the same about you
as I did two weeks ago.

86
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:45,887
I want to hold your hand,

87
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,980
and take you home.

88
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,540
But you still wanted to break up.

89
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:54,600
I can't even tell you to eat
what's in the fridge?

90
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,860
Don't.

91
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,357
If you linger around and talk to me too,

92
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,160
I won't be able to stand it.

93
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:02,864
So,

94
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,394
unless you plan on
going out with me again,

95
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:07,814
don't talk to me.

96
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,330
Why is he so straightforward?

97
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:25,093
My goodness.

98
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:26,078
What?

99
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:27,470
What is it?

100
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
What?

101
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:30,423
Why haven't you returned my pot?

102
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:34,981
Did you think I'd keep it?
Why do you always come up here?

103
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:37,675
That's the only big pot I have.

104
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,575
Hey.

105
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:41,961
Did you bring that for me?

106
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:43,651
Why are you such a busybody?

107
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:47,561
Do you have...

108
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:49,963
...cancer?

109
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,873
What?

110
00:06:52,164 --> 00:06:54,389
Who would you ask such a thing so frankly?

111
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,628
You are not terminally ill, right?
It doesn't suit you.

112
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,746
My breast cancer is now gone.

113
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,405
I am completely recovered.

114
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:02,795
That's good then.

115
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:04,627
Thank you.

116
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:09,906
Aren't you going down?

117
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:13,028
It's hot. Let me get some cool air.

118
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:16,453
Do you this is the bank, huh?

119
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:32,042
Are you home?

120
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:39,593
Why are you throwing your bag?

121
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:42,627
I am so mad. I won't go to school.

122
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:45,003
Did you not get picked
as the class president?

123
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:47,266
Why does every homework
have to do with moms?

124
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:51,489
We have to draw her,
write to her, and help her.

125
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:55,730
Then they should only allow
kids with moms to enroll at schools.

126
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:57,696
Why am I the only one without a mom?

127
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:00,660
Seolhui has one, and Dongman does too.

128
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,520
Why don't I?

129
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:06,925
But you are still the boss
out of the three.

130
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:08,185
I don't want to be the boss.

131
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,516
Bring my mom.

132
00:08:14,457 --> 00:08:16,157
Did she really die?

133
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:19,627
She's an angel up there now.

134
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:21,188
She's protecting you...

135
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:24,412
and made you the boss of the town.

136
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:27,709
Grandma's poker friend told me...

137
00:08:28,347 --> 00:08:30,558
that my mom was kicked out.

138
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,136
She must have gone senile.

139
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,977
Are you sure...

140
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,870
she is up there?

141
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:39,097
What is it?

142
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:40,929
Are you upset?

143
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,215
I don't know.

144
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,905
I have never even seen her before.

145
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,009
Then, throw these out.

146
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:55,973
What is it?

147
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,770
All the other kids...

148
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:01,207
...were making them.

149
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:10,797
Mom, Merry Christmas.

150
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:15,437
I made it just in case.

151
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:19,347
Our dog came back home after a while too.

152
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,993
I thought maybe Mom might too.

153
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:26,463
Aera.

154
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:30,563
Do you want me...

155
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:33,813
...to make you a snack?

156
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:36,991
Try making two.

157
00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:41,064
All right.

158
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:42,926
We can share.

159
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:05,403
I love you, I love you.

160
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:07,533
Aera loves you, Mom.

161
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,740
Who are you?

162
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:27,793
Those pictures....

163
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,706
...are me, right?

164
00:10:45,507 --> 00:10:46,873
I will explain it all to you.

165
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:49,331
The reason why I had no choice
but to do this...

166
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,960
It's strange.

167
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:55,821
I'd understand if you had died.

168
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,840
You are...

169
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:02,591
...doing so well and aging beautifully.

170
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:05,259
Why?

171
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:07,650
No.

172
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:09,354
Aera...

173
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:14,640
I didn't leave you. It's not like that.

174
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,500
Were you watching me as a landlady?

175
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:22,609
You weren't here when I needed a mom.

176
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:25,469
Now, are you watching me secretly?

177
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:27,589
That's unfair.

178
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,560
I just missed you so much.

179
00:11:31,553 --> 00:11:35,213
I feel strange like I was thrown away.

180
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,260
I will just remember that you are alive.

181
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,740
But...

182
00:11:48,694 --> 00:11:50,054
I don't want to see you.

183
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:01,290
Make sure to eat it!

184
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,510
Why does she care if I eat or not?

185
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,274
If she's so worried, then don't break up.

186
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,470
Why would bother make food
if we are breaking up.

187
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:32,507
Can you tell Aera not to go overboard?

188
00:12:36,893 --> 00:12:37,963
What is this?

189
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:40,224
Porridge.

190
00:12:44,187 --> 00:12:46,387
I am giving it to you
because I made too much.

191
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,280
What kind of logic is that?

192
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,941
It's...

193
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:56,170
the same porridge she made...

194
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,031
when you left for the army service,

195
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,420
and when you were sick in the army.

196
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:04,277
Eat some before serving the army!

197
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,597
I will be waiting.

198
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:07,648
From your First Lady, Choi.

199
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,667
Eat some before serving the army!

200
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,074
Oppa.

201
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,760
Oppa, can't you stay?

202
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,800
-I can't live without you.
-Why is she holding that?

203
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:42,759
I know...

204
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,810
you thought I waited for you...

205
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,630
because of this porridge,

206
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:49,211
but...

207
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,891
it wasn't me.

208
00:13:51,427 --> 00:13:52,288
What?

209
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:55,286
The one who waited for you
while you were in the military,

210
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,105
and convinced me to get married...

211
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:58,431
is Choi Aera.

212
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,512
Let go.

213
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:05,424
You are getting married tomorrow.

214
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:06,900
I can't do it.

215
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,243
I don't think I can do it.

216
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,833
Dongman is dumb.

217
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,397
He doesn't care about
what's beneficial for him.

218
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:17,647
He liked you with everything he had.

219
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:22,267
If you sway him and get married tomorrow,

220
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,230
Dongman won't be able to live.

221
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,870
What should I do? I can't do this either.

222
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:33,076
I can't...

223
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,051
I know you liked Dongman.

224
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:39,853
I get you want to
get married to a wealthy guy,

225
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,593
but leave Dongman alone.

226
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:45,256
Leave him so that he can live.

227
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,720
What is it?

228
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,861
My boiler is broken,

229
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,833
and Seolhui went to Juman's.

230
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,640
-So you want to stay at my place?
-Can't I?

231
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:10,245
How can she sleep so well?

232
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,773
She sleeps as soon as
she puts her head down like an old man.

233
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Hey, eat.

234
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:32,721
I don't want it.

235
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:34,681
Why? Why not?

236
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,326
Are you telling everybody you got dumped?

237
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,530
Stop overreacting. Just eat.

238
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,937
It's braised short ribs.

239
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:48,800
Are you having a party?
Why would you get that?

240
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,190
Hey, what are you doing?

241
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:56,630
What are you doing?

242
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,817
-Goodness.
-Hey!

243
00:15:57,907 --> 00:16:00,267
What do you think I am doing?

244
00:16:00,766 --> 00:16:02,166
Do you have constipation?

245
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:04,603
I didn't hear the water running,
so I checked.

246
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,623
Please go home.

247
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:18,528
No way.

248
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:20,133
Dongman!

249
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:31,030
His heart is beating too fast.

250
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,850
I think he really took something.

251
00:16:35,185 --> 00:16:36,119
Hey.

252
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:37,894
Gosh, it's for indigestion.

253
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:41,065
You fed me so much
that I have a bad stomach.

254
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:43,585
My goodness.

255
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:46,479
Why would you get a big bottle of it?

256
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:49,713
Choi Aera.

257
00:16:50,364 --> 00:16:51,470
What, you punk?

258
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,020
Your boiler didn't break, right?

259
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:55,900
-What?
-You are watching me because...

260
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,796
you are afraid I might die, right?

261
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:00,696
Do you think I am going to hang myself?

262
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,097
Do you think I will take some pills
when I'm alone?

263
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:04,604
My boiler is broken.

264
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:08,627
Why would you stay at a guy's house
because your boiler broke in the summer?

265
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:10,987
You are not that smart, you know.

266
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:13,359
What's this?

267
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,397
It's chicken soup.

268
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:16,389
Chicken soup with two abalones.

269
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:17,526
Goodness.

270
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:20,086
Goodness.

271
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,146
Stop feeding me.

272
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:23,776
I got dumped...

273
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:26,735
...but gained 3kg because of you.

274
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:28,733
Shut it.

275
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:34,467
You are both naive, so I got in the way.

276
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:37,409
Put yourself together and get her.

277
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,923
A dummy like you...

278
00:17:40,312 --> 00:17:41,842
needs another dummy like her.

279
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:51,402
You are a strong candidate this time.

280
00:17:51,727 --> 00:17:52,927
If you get promoted,

281
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:56,155
there is this new spicy chicken place...

282
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:58,285
We can talk once it's confirmed.

283
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:01,000
-What?
-It won't be chicken then.

284
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:03,612
I will treat you to steak.

285
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:08,631
You are so good with words.

286
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:10,091
Yes.

287
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:15,805
What do I do, Mr. Kim?

288
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,965
I think I broke this.

289
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:20,687
Why do I keep causing trouble?

290
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,708
All right.

291
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:25,761
Stand up.

292
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:28,537
Don't crouch down in the photocopy room.

293
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,340
You can fix it by yourself.

294
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,927
There is a manual here.

295
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:35,870
You can read it carefully and
never make the same mistake again.

296
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:53,013
You deserve a full-time position.

297
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:57,659
People keep taking credit
for someone else's work.

298
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,989
But Ms. Manager...

299
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,479
I know.

300
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,320
I am sorry for saying this to you.

301
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,976
What's this?

302
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,452
Resignation Letter

303
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:12,272
Don't do this out of anger.

304
00:19:12,362 --> 00:19:14,251
It's not out of anger...

305
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,737
My plum extract is on high demand,
so I need time to package them.

306
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,657
You are quitting work because of that?

307
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:24,365
I am sorry. It's so sudden.

308
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,064
Seolhui...

309
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,710
Out of all the resignation letters...

310
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,530
You must be flustered.

311
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:32,602
It's very satisfying.

312
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:35,895
My goodness.

313
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:38,483
Do they sell that well?

314
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,558
It's really good if you mix it with soju.

315
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:43,949
Baek Seolhui.

316
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:47,668
Please do well and
come on our home shopping channel.

317
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:51,158
Then boss everybody around
like an owner. Okay?

318
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:52,593
Okay.

319
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,081
I am home.

320
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,649
What is it?

321
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:07,591
You are not even looking at me.

322
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:08,851
Did something happen?

323
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:12,482
Namil.

324
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,130
Yes?

325
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,600
Can you get my flip phone back?

326
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,613
You wondered about it.

327
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:27,446
Let's...

328
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,770
...go back to Japan.

329
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:46,554
Anyway,

330
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:49,171
what's in here?

331
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:52,319
Money?

332
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:54,451
Documents or something like that?

333
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:58,393
You can probably figure out the lock code.

334
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:00,077
Pardon?

335
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:02,927
She said it's her daughter
and son's birthdays.

336
00:21:06,637 --> 00:21:10,277
It's the will she made
when she had cancer.

337
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:53,991
It's yours.

338
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:55,372
It's from Mom.

339
00:21:57,313 --> 00:21:58,473
I don't want it.

340
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,040
Whatever it is, I don't want to see it.

341
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,360
Mom...

342
00:22:03,024 --> 00:22:05,294
...was by your side for all 30 years.

343
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:08,784
Sorry?

344
00:22:08,902 --> 00:22:10,932
That's why she kept this phone,

345
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,679
so just have a look.

346
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:21,313
I will get going.

347
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,884
Dad.

348
00:22:45,593 --> 00:22:47,793
I was looking at something right now.

349
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:51,029
What's this?

350
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:54,817
What's all this?

351
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:57,412
Who is she?

352
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:02,374
This is not everything.

353
00:23:04,294 --> 00:23:06,324
She would come to
the graduation ceremonies,

354
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:09,461
fields days, and picnics.

355
00:23:09,793 --> 00:23:11,643
She showed up for all special events.

356
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:15,383
She covered her face
with sunglasses and a hat,

357
00:23:15,473 --> 00:23:16,903
but she stood out even more.

358
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,440
My mom was really horrible to her.

359
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,395
So everyone knew except me.

360
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:31,085
Don't hate her.

361
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,183
For every dollar she made when in Japan,

362
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:37,404
she sent you 8,000 won.

363
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:41,153
She couldn't even do
that when her business failed,

364
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,966
but she sent a lot
while you were growing up.

365
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,443
What money?

366
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:47,959
I never got a cent from her.

367
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:49,544
There were times...

368
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:52,824
when I only sold two mackerel stews a day.

369
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,619
How could I afford to send you to college?

370
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,042
Also,

371
00:23:57,331 --> 00:23:58,637
you were hardcore.

372
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:01,348
You got into a lot of trouble
while growing up.

373
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:02,796
I did not.

374
00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:04,736
You rode a scooter in college,

375
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:06,424
and scratched someone's car.

376
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:08,612
That's not even an accident.

377
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:09,843
In middle school,

378
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:12,863
you played with matches
and set fire to a field.

379
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,752
You burned 300 hectares.

380
00:24:17,587 --> 00:24:19,887
-You were almost jailed.
-Come on.

381
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,492
That's enough.

382
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,472
You spent hundreds of millions won.

383
00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:36,107
Landlady

384
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,335
Mom

385
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:44,195
Now, there is an entry written...

386
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,650
"Mom" in my phone.

387
00:24:56,816 --> 00:24:59,336
You don't want to talk,
but you can carry my food?

388
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:02,725
He, Egg Porridge.

389
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,600
What?

390
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,621
You saw your dad so late.

391
00:25:07,985 --> 00:25:09,725
It means you met your mom.

392
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:11,881
How did you know?

393
00:25:11,971 --> 00:25:14,771
I knew everything about you for 23 years.

394
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:17,353
Don't pretend we are close.

395
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:19,307
You...

396
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,560
Lie low for about two months.

397
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,369
Don't go on blind dates...

398
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,700
or see anyone else for two months.

399
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,200
I will go clubbing.

400
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,900
For the time being, we went our own way.

401
00:25:40,763 --> 00:25:44,653
You are the first female announcer
in Korea's MMA history.

402
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,668
So, the concept of the cover shoot...

403
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:49,678
is "pioneer" or "role model".

404
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:52,862
Why should a role model
wear something like this?

405
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:56,802
You will wear this and
hold a microphone and a glove.

406
00:25:56,892 --> 00:26:01,250
Why should an announcer
wear a short skirt and hold a mic?

407
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,080
I guess you weren't briefed beforehand.

408
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,170
I guess you weren't told
about me beforehand.

409
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,084
Aera became a microphone moron
with a louder voice.

410
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,210
Without a prince charming or a makeover,

411
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,460
Seolhui stood on her own two feet.

412
00:26:30,313 --> 00:26:34,313
Send this photo to Drunk Fairy.

413
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
To Drunk Fairy

414
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,248
Drunk Fairy,

415
00:26:41,338 --> 00:26:44,125
your lovely plum extract is on its way.

416
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:55,805
Business License

417
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:03,587
Meanwhile, Juman...

418
00:27:04,143 --> 00:27:06,718
...has been apologizing for 61 days.

419
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,629
That pizza...

420
00:27:24,648 --> 00:27:25,974
...is family-sized.

421
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,300
Can you eat it all?

422
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,105
Dongman...

423
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:40,163
just trained like a monster
who was getting an upgrade.

424
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:45,877
I tapped out.

425
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:47,704
Tap?

426
00:27:48,253 --> 00:27:49,492
There is no tap.

427
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:51,632
We ain't got time for tap.

428
00:28:00,918 --> 00:28:01,918
One more time.

429
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,220
One more time.

430
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,140
There is no standing up
when you learn from me.

431
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,528
-Let's go.
-Darn it!

432
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:15,264
Listen, Dongman.

433
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:18,171
We only have two months
for you to get ready.

434
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:21,230
So I will just teach you
three techniques for you to master.

435
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,426
Three?

436
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:25,225
I got it.

437
00:28:27,025 --> 00:28:27,915
Just three.

438
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:29,737
Master, go.

439
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,896
These are all finishing techniques,

440
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:34,796
and you only need one
for you to win the fight.

441
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,883
Why do you care about me?

442
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,230
It's your birthday.
Of course I had to visit.

443
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,943
Who did you say ordered the large size?

444
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:47,281
Ma'am...

445
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,171
I will deliver that.

446
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,326
Where to?

447
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:52,116
This is too awkward.

448
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,600
You are back.

449
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,847
How are you?

450
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:58,287
Wear something with sleeves.

451
00:28:58,377 --> 00:28:59,532
That's gross.

452
00:28:59,757 --> 00:29:01,904
Did the gym close early today?

453
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,200
I heard you broke up.

454
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,590
Why are you here?

455
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,430
I heard you broke up.

456
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,900
Why are you here?

457
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,000
Why are you here?

458
00:29:22,813 --> 00:29:23,983
Seolhui.

459
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,460
It's our new menu. See if you like it.

460
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,530
Okay.

461
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,000
It tastes good.

462
00:29:40,594 --> 00:29:41,731
I thought...

463
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,389
the phone was the key to a fortune.

464
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,496
Why would I give you guys
if I had a fortune?

465
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:48,069
It's not even enough for me myself.

466
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,119
Why do you keep making me
look like a lose?

467
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:53,397
You put me in such horrible situations.

468
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,700
Namil.

469
00:29:56,926 --> 00:29:58,226
Back in Japan,

470
00:29:58,953 --> 00:30:02,146
the police told me they had
the pickpocket that stole my wallet.

471
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:05,036
That's when I met 15-year-old Kim Namil.

472
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,887
Kim Namil...

473
00:30:07,218 --> 00:30:09,503
who was born in Korea in 1989.

474
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,570
An orphan with no guardian.

475
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:15,703
I was shocked.

476
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:19,636
Were you a mess
because your mom failed you?

477
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:21,896
You reminded me...

478
00:30:22,396 --> 00:30:24,810
of the daughter I couldn't raise.

479
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,871
So what?

480
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:28,507
You raised Namil instead of Namil?

481
00:30:28,597 --> 00:30:30,026
You weren't a replacement.

482
00:30:30,116 --> 00:30:31,292
You are my son.

483
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,495
From then on,

484
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,255
I lived for you.

485
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,260
I didn't save you. You saved me.

486
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,760
Would I leave you
because I found Aera, you fool?

487
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,200
Are you trying to make me cry?

488
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,866
You are all I have.

489
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:53,425
I am bound to feel jealous.

490
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,130
When will you fully grow up?

491
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,900
Is our flight tomorrow at 7 p.m.?

492
00:31:02,322 --> 00:31:04,197
I will head to Japan alone.

493
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:06,347
You stay a bit longer.

494
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:10,142
-What?
-You said we shared 14 years...

495
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:12,232
but you spent less than a year with her.

496
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:15,229
Let's say...

497
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,478
I am lending you to her.

498
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,200
Spend a little more time here.

499
00:31:26,446 --> 00:31:27,355
Gosh.

500
00:31:28,168 --> 00:31:30,183
Why are you doing this?

501
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:40,270
Why did you come here?

502
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,930
Why care about your ex's dad's birthday?

503
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:46,283
Seolhui, I think I am sick.

504
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:48,603
Why you couldn't say a word?

505
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:54,151
-Seolhui, you know...
-What?

506
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,183
-Your third brother...
-He is sweet.

507
00:31:58,273 --> 00:32:00,080
He should be a soldier.

508
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,604
Prick your thumb at home.

509
00:32:01,694 --> 00:32:03,964
My thumb? Myself? With a needle?

510
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,500
My back still hurts.

511
00:32:08,486 --> 00:32:10,626
My whole back could get infected.

512
00:32:13,777 --> 00:32:15,807
-Darn it.
-"Darn it"?

513
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:18,035
Brother!

514
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:20,685
-Don't.
-Brothers!

515
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:26,229
-Come on.
-What do you want?

516
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,819
If your student for 15 years
ends up a loser,

517
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,723
you said your life would be a waste too.

518
00:32:31,813 --> 00:32:32,913
So what?

519
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,600
Dongman's been filming commercials,

520
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:39,402
using the media, and threatening me.

521
00:32:39,492 --> 00:32:41,096
We have to fight.

522
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:42,293
How exactly?

523
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:43,925
Will you bribe people...

524
00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:45,578
and try to cheat?

525
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:48,033
I will fight for real.

526
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,230
Just come with me.

527
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,530
I won't lose this time.

528
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:03,307
Do you have your passport?

529
00:33:03,397 --> 00:33:04,910
You can't go without it.

530
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,538
Thanks for everything, Sundae.

531
00:33:07,146 --> 00:33:09,646
Did he just call me, "Sundae"?

532
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,300
Dongman.

533
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,502
I am sorry for training you so hard but...

534
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,460
we only had two months to get you ready.

535
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:18,227
Sorry?

536
00:33:19,353 --> 00:33:21,153
Why are you sorry?

537
00:33:21,363 --> 00:33:23,633
All I can say is thank you.

538
00:33:26,153 --> 00:33:27,353
Thank you, brother.

539
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,254
I am sorry for...

540
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:33,453
...yelling at you and everything.

541
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,462
We won't see each other again,

542
00:33:38,147 --> 00:33:39,153
but see you again.

543
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:40,157
You never know.

544
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:41,998
We might meet in a ring very soon.

545
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:46,996
Yes. You can come eat sundae.

546
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:49,556
Here. Air. Eat it there.

547
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:52,039
Take care of yourself, Sundae.

548
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:54,368
Sure. Thank you.

549
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,669
-See you later.
-Bye.

550
00:34:00,643 --> 00:34:03,306
Dongchun Gymnasium

551
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,840
Thank you everyone for your patience.

552
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,826
It's finally time for tonight's big match.

553
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:17,562
The match of RFC's top predator,
Kim Taksu...

554
00:34:17,652 --> 00:34:21,893
versus the rising star that
shook the octagon, Ko Dongman,

555
00:34:21,983 --> 00:34:23,570
will start soon.

556
00:34:23,926 --> 00:34:26,826
Please welcome them
with your warm applause.

557
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,130
That's my daughter.

558
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:35,976
She got that talent from me.

559
00:34:36,423 --> 00:34:37,770
RFC final.

560
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,140
Championship title match for
the lightweight group.

561
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,700
Here comes Ko Dongman!

562
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:06,056
He is so cool, isn't he?

563
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:21,044
I will fight in standing
for the first round.

564
00:35:21,134 --> 00:35:22,730
-Dongman.
-From the second round...

565
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,820
Dongman.

566
00:35:26,217 --> 00:35:27,917
Just do what you want.

567
00:35:28,658 --> 00:35:31,653
-Pardon?
-Forget coaching.

568
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:33,603
Just do what you want.

569
00:35:34,187 --> 00:35:35,257
Just for today,

570
00:35:35,723 --> 00:35:38,286
I won't yell at you to do something.

571
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,780
What's gotten into you?

572
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,140
Look.

573
00:35:46,427 --> 00:35:47,427
See?

574
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:49,353
Think about it.

575
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:51,106
Dongman.

576
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:53,876
Just standing here...

577
00:35:54,493 --> 00:35:55,663
...makes you the winner.

578
00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:00,851
I don't like...

579
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,487
...open endings that are ambiguous.

580
00:36:03,877 --> 00:36:04,877
What?

581
00:36:05,044 --> 00:36:06,360
If I am going to win,

582
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,348
I want to win properly
and end it for good.

583
00:36:09,573 --> 00:36:10,573
Open.

584
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:14,867
Enjoy the match.

585
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,130
Against him...

586
00:36:22,657 --> 00:36:25,017
...is Kim Taksu

587
00:36:42,887 --> 00:36:44,430
Today's game will have three rounds...

588
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,950
-...and one extra round.
-Okay?

589
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,440
Okay?

590
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,080
Ready, fight.

591
00:37:25,737 --> 00:37:29,437
Taksu wants to use
the ground from the start.

592
00:37:30,586 --> 00:37:31,696
Stop. Stand up.

593
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,820
Fight.

594
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,400
Can't you fight on the ground?

595
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,950
This is your limit, isn't it?

596
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:00,501
Is this the best you got?

597
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:01,591
What?

598
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:03,887
Thank you for the show.

599
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:05,698
I will start playing now.

600
00:38:05,788 --> 00:38:07,197
What are you talking about?

601
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:20,437
Dongman is taking him on the ground now.

602
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:38,526
Give up?

603
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
Give up?

604
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:42,607
Give up?

605
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:43,887
Dongman, end it!

606
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,170
Taksu, get out of it!

607
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:48,977
Give up?

608
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:50,105
Stop.

609
00:38:54,603 --> 00:38:55,970
Spit it out.

610
00:38:57,807 --> 00:38:58,807
What's with him?

611
00:38:59,156 --> 00:39:01,209
-He's good on the ground?
-We have no choice.

612
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:02,741
-Face him head on.
-No.

613
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:04,900
Let's wait until the judges' call.

614
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:07,753
If you can last, I will make it happen.

615
00:39:10,637 --> 00:39:11,878
Are you sure you won't coach me?

616
00:39:11,968 --> 00:39:14,498
Why bother coaching an animal?

617
00:39:15,054 --> 00:39:16,294
Ready? Fight!

618
00:39:25,623 --> 00:39:26,565
Hyung...

619
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,072
I told you to do it properly
if you are going to copy.

620
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,240
KO!

621
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:54,268
Hey.

622
00:40:17,717 --> 00:40:20,717
I have to protect Donghee until the end.

623
00:40:21,114 --> 00:40:23,214
I shouldn't go if I know I can't win.

624
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,200
I want to do it.

625
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:30,867
I am dying to do it.

626
00:40:30,957 --> 00:40:32,595
I am going to fight!

627
00:40:32,685 --> 00:40:34,381
I am going to do it!

628
00:40:34,471 --> 00:40:36,561
I am telling you I can do it!

629
00:40:36,994 --> 00:40:38,910
Don't stop me!

630
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,495
I can do it!

631
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:42,077
I can!

632
00:40:47,187 --> 00:40:48,287
This match...

633
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,564
...ended at 27 seconds
in the second round.

634
00:40:50,654 --> 00:40:52,467
Due to a knock out from a kick,

635
00:40:52,557 --> 00:40:55,613
Taekwon Boy, Ko Dongman is the winner!

636
00:41:01,616 --> 00:41:03,586
Good job, Dongman!

637
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:11,984
He is my son.

638
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,680
I didn't say anything.

639
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:20,313
Dongman ended up getting the gold medal!

640
00:41:20,403 --> 00:41:22,263
That punk.

641
00:41:22,543 --> 00:41:25,169
I better break his legs
to stop him from fighting.

642
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:32,087
Why is he so cool?

643
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,740
How annoying.

644
00:41:49,261 --> 00:41:52,011
You fool. Not again.

645
00:41:53,937 --> 00:41:59,100
I dare to say that no one in Korea
will be able to beat him.

646
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:11,129
I think...

647
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:14,460
we could say that it's a feat
achieved in ten years.

648
00:42:19,013 --> 00:42:21,953
Could you say a few words
about how you feel?

649
00:42:24,144 --> 00:42:25,144
Okay.

650
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:29,867
I am happy since I was able to overcome...

651
00:42:29,957 --> 00:42:32,387
my weakness on the ground.

652
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,340
I want to thank everyone
for cheering for me.

653
00:42:42,717 --> 00:42:45,900
We will do a detailed interview
in the studio.

654
00:42:47,747 --> 00:42:49,077
Ko Dongman.

655
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,280
I sincerely congratulate you.

656
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:09,807
Why are you crying again?

657
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,930
Who cares if your ex wins or loses?
Why are you crying?

658
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:19,206
We should have never dated.

659
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,960
Aera.

660
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:24,103
I...

661
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,640
...can't live without you,

662
00:43:28,293 --> 00:43:31,144
but I can't ask you to take me back
in case we break up again.

663
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:36,281
I should have listened to Seolhui.

664
00:43:37,307 --> 00:43:38,367
So...

665
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:42,717
Let's forget this dating
and breaking up business.

666
00:43:45,783 --> 00:43:47,183
Just live with me.

667
00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:51,671
What?

668
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:53,397
Live with me.

669
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,300
Do you want to move in?

670
00:43:58,003 --> 00:43:58,898
Hey.

671
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:01,473
If we kiss, we are dating.

672
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,903
If we live together,

673
00:44:05,914 --> 00:44:06,944
it's marriage.

674
00:44:10,707 --> 00:44:11,855
Marry me.

675
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,421
I...

676
00:44:19,096 --> 00:44:20,585
...can't live without you.

677
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,390
That's how it's been for 20 years.

678
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,396
If I have to choose...

679
00:44:26,486 --> 00:44:28,886
between never seeing you
and seeing you every day,

680
00:44:29,813 --> 00:44:30,853
I would choose...

681
00:44:34,907 --> 00:44:36,267
...to see you forever.

682
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:42,027
What about MMA fighting?

683
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,464
You.

684
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,481
You.

685
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,090
It's you. You.

686
00:44:50,517 --> 00:44:51,787
It has to be you.

687
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,052
Marry me.

688
00:44:57,627 --> 00:44:58,667
Okay?

689
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,500
Why are you asking?

690
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:17,933
Goodness.

691
00:45:18,813 --> 00:45:22,091
Who will stop those young kids?

692
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:23,883
Why, that punk...

693
00:45:23,973 --> 00:45:26,633
What did he say to make her cry?

694
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,133
You punk.

695
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,680
Why are you calling my son a punk?

696
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,240
I am just...

697
00:45:33,668 --> 00:45:35,424
...letting you hold my hand for a minute.

698
00:45:35,514 --> 00:45:37,944
People watching soccer hold hands
at times too.

699
00:45:39,387 --> 00:45:40,241
Anyway,

700
00:45:40,331 --> 00:45:43,430
I didn't forgive you and
we are not back together.

701
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:44,973
Why you...

702
00:45:45,419 --> 00:45:47,337
Why did you kiss me? Why?

703
00:45:47,427 --> 00:45:48,907
Why did you kiss me?

704
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,910
I am fine being beaten for kissing you.

705
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Goodness...

706
00:45:57,206 --> 00:45:58,536
Did you just swear?

707
00:46:01,689 --> 00:46:02,763
Ko Dongman, Choi Aera

708
00:46:02,853 --> 00:46:05,105
It's not a small wedding
because I want it small,

709
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:06,895
but because it's forced on me.

710
00:46:16,054 --> 00:46:19,594
The groom is clueless
and totally unprepared.

711
00:46:20,623 --> 00:46:21,618
Huh?

712
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:23,100
Is a wedding a joke to you?

713
00:46:23,433 --> 00:46:25,717
We need to plan what we are going to do.

714
00:46:25,807 --> 00:46:27,161
Just trust me.

715
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,649
I have a plan.

716
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,263
You shouldn't make plans.

717
00:46:33,783 --> 00:46:36,183
You shouldn't abuse your head.

718
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:38,711
Okay.

719
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,184
What is that?

720
00:46:48,948 --> 00:46:50,608
Juman, are you crushing garlic?

721
00:46:51,852 --> 00:46:54,309
Why would he crush garlic?

722
00:46:57,944 --> 00:46:59,014
I think...

723
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,096
I know this sound.

724
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,426
What? What is it now?

725
00:47:05,097 --> 00:47:06,167
Get up.

726
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,607
Let's go.

727
00:47:14,393 --> 00:47:15,463
Hey, Diaphragm.

728
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,730
Were you peeling green plums?

729
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:21,493
That's what that sound was.

730
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,793
Stop calling me "Diaphragm".

731
00:47:24,986 --> 00:47:26,856
Why are you peeling green plums?

732
00:47:31,006 --> 00:47:32,976
It's just a side job.

733
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:35,621
I am helping Seolhui
with her plum extract.

734
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:38,483
I get paid a set amount
for every bowl I peel.

735
00:47:38,573 --> 00:47:39,493
Juman,

736
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:43,011
did you know that Seolhui ran away
from home often when she was little?

737
00:47:43,101 --> 00:47:44,801
-She did?
-Yeah.

738
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:49,046
She came to my house
because her brother ripped her doll.

739
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:50,650
She went to her house.

740
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,507
She also came when her mom
didn't buy her a dress for a picnic.

741
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,706
Take a guess what she did each time?

742
00:47:56,796 --> 00:47:57,885
Take a guess.

743
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,400
What? What do you mean?

744
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:14,407
What?

745
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,554
Seolhui.

746
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:22,664
You said you'd never take Juman back.

747
00:48:22,913 --> 00:48:24,686
You said you'd go to Seoul.

748
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:25,632
Well...

749
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:28,415
Goodness.

750
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:29,470
Wel...

751
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,500
Who said I'd take him back?

752
00:48:31,688 --> 00:48:33,946
We are just peeling green plums.

753
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,928
You are too busy with your invitations.

754
00:48:37,018 --> 00:48:38,738
Who else would help her?

755
00:48:38,828 --> 00:48:40,110
Seolhui, just be cool and...

756
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,138
kick him to the curb, start over...

757
00:48:42,228 --> 00:48:43,410
What?

758
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,640
Why does everyone have to be cool?

759
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,720
Sometimes, I want to beat him up, but...

760
00:48:53,371 --> 00:48:55,036
Please let us just love each other.

761
00:48:57,669 --> 00:48:59,869
I ought to give you a flying kick.

762
00:49:12,231 --> 00:49:14,701
We never asked you to donate liquor.

763
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,960
Goodness.

764
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,800
I will start calling you "Mom" then.

765
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,030
What?

766
00:49:28,744 --> 00:49:29,672
Already?

767
00:49:29,762 --> 00:49:30,909
That easily?

768
00:49:31,747 --> 00:49:35,417
It's strange being
all loving from the start,

769
00:49:35,922 --> 00:49:38,530
but it'd be rude
to call "ma'am" to my mom.

770
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,363
Sure...

771
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:43,490
Okay, thank you.

772
00:49:43,735 --> 00:49:45,435
Thanks for being well-mannered.

773
00:49:48,147 --> 00:49:49,097
Also,

774
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:52,736
"Dwarf Flower" was kind of awesome.

775
00:49:53,113 --> 00:49:54,793
I was proud of you.

776
00:49:54,883 --> 00:49:56,213
It was Cannes-worthy.

777
00:49:59,511 --> 00:50:02,129
Why did you watch something like that?

778
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:03,859
You are embarrassing me.

779
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:07,858
By the way,

780
00:50:08,149 --> 00:50:11,231
in some awkward relationship
to have a formal dinner...

781
00:50:11,321 --> 00:50:12,951
with Dongman's dad?

782
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:15,300
Not at all.

783
00:50:15,787 --> 00:50:18,935
Every guy in Seosan...

784
00:50:19,025 --> 00:50:20,843
was into me back then.

785
00:50:22,194 --> 00:50:24,009
But he wasn't...

786
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:28,070
...cool enough to even talk to me.

787
00:50:28,387 --> 00:50:29,486
I see.

788
00:50:29,576 --> 00:50:30,842
I am glad.

789
00:50:34,813 --> 00:50:36,413
Then, does that mean...

790
00:50:37,537 --> 00:50:38,837
I am rich now?

791
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:42,834
I lived my own life and
took care of myself.

792
00:50:43,576 --> 00:50:45,895
I had three businesses that failed.

793
00:50:46,306 --> 00:50:47,284
I have only...

794
00:50:47,594 --> 00:50:49,345
a few hundred millions left in debt.

795
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,100
Only a few hundred millions?

796
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:56,497
The villa and store are all mortgaged.

797
00:50:57,316 --> 00:51:00,229
I sold parts of the villa
to pay off my debt,

798
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,561
and the one you live in
is all I have left.

799
00:51:02,651 --> 00:51:05,381
Make sure not to fall behind on rent.

800
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,929
Pay on time, okay?

801
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,620
I should have known.

802
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,050
Why don't I ever get a break?

803
00:51:13,873 --> 00:51:16,279
I bought Hwang Jangho's Gym.

804
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:17,865
I had to support you guys.

805
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:20,085
My debt only grew because of you.

806
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,080
Goodness.

807
00:51:23,698 --> 00:51:24,765
Anyway,

808
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:26,770
why am I Namil?

809
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,060
I am a girl.

810
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:32,407
Fetus name.

811
00:51:32,774 --> 00:51:34,153
What does it mean?

812
00:51:34,243 --> 00:51:35,273
I don't know.

813
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,260
No clue.

814
00:51:38,237 --> 00:51:39,452
By the way,

815
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,792
why was her name Namil?

816
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:44,460
Well...

817
00:51:45,756 --> 00:51:48,386
You see, Namil Expressway is where...

818
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,889
-Aera was...
-What?

819
00:51:51,848 --> 00:51:53,610
The interstate...

820
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:55,843
The highway?

821
00:51:55,933 --> 00:51:57,059
Yeah.

822
00:51:57,149 --> 00:51:58,370
That's where I...

823
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,330
That's where you gave birth to her.

824
00:52:01,974 --> 00:52:04,450
What kind of a life did you lead...

825
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,335
-...that you gave birth on a highway?
-No.

826
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:11,350
I mean, when you exit Namil Expressway,

827
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,647
there is Namil Inn.

828
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:14,819
What?

829
00:52:15,275 --> 00:52:16,572
Namil Inn?

830
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,563
Yes. That's where...

831
00:52:19,581 --> 00:52:20,547
...we conceived her.

832
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,171
Oh my goodness.

833
00:52:23,261 --> 00:52:24,815
Hey, Jangho.

834
00:52:27,668 --> 00:52:28,963
Okay.

835
00:52:29,053 --> 00:52:32,731
Should we start a sundae business?

836
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,100
What?

837
00:52:34,756 --> 00:52:37,371
Let's pursue our dream.

838
00:52:37,461 --> 00:52:40,366
National Athlete's Sundae

839
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,957
Congratulations

840
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,181
Be happy.

841
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:54,042
I will come back if I see a way in.

842
00:53:08,332 --> 00:53:10,663
Olympic Silver Medalist, RFC Champion

843
00:53:18,286 --> 00:53:20,546
Is this the plan you mentioned?

844
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:23,530
Yeah, we are starting a business.

845
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:27,647
We will work together to run the business,

846
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:30,100
and he will fight only during the seasons.

847
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:34,851
I said I'd tell her
after we register our marriage.

848
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:40,089
Must you...

849
00:53:40,704 --> 00:53:43,094
...spend the rest of your lives together?

850
00:53:43,184 --> 00:53:45,196
We have agreed
to spend this life together.

851
00:53:49,876 --> 00:53:50,801
Aera.

852
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:56,004
You see, our lives may be
intertwined in many ways.

853
00:53:56,094 --> 00:53:57,488
Intertwined?

854
00:53:57,578 --> 00:53:58,861
You are making me nervous.

855
00:53:58,951 --> 00:54:02,740
I have a feeling you and I
will see each other...

856
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:05,040
for the rest of our lives.

857
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:06,830
Why would you and I do that?

858
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,570
Anyway, I am just saying I wish...

859
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,850
you'd just see me as a cute boy.

860
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,486
How are you cute?

861
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,406
Your mom says I am cute.

862
00:54:17,496 --> 00:54:18,636
What the...

863
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,545
Don't get too close.

864
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:23,365
That would be weird.

865
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,490
Are you the only ones who can love?
I can too.

866
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:36,737
Let's have a cold drink.

867
00:54:36,827 --> 00:54:37,710
Okay.

868
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:40,030
Are you insane?

869
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,060
Not even one?

870
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,630
Our wedding is tomorrow.
You can't drink today!

871
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:51,654
Darn it.

872
00:54:52,536 --> 00:54:53,936
Just one.

873
00:54:55,196 --> 00:54:56,221
Order chicken feet.

874
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:57,754
Okay. Medium spicy.

875
00:54:58,273 --> 00:55:01,023
Is your mom buying you a place to live?

876
00:55:01,113 --> 00:55:02,970
My mom has several hundred grands in debt.

877
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,157
So make sure to pay your rent on time.

878
00:55:05,426 --> 00:55:07,990
I hoped I'd benefit from knowing
the owner's child.

879
00:55:08,752 --> 00:55:10,444
Are you going to move
into Dongman's place?

880
00:55:10,534 --> 00:55:12,840
I don't know. He has no plans whatsoever.

881
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:15,214
He thinks living together
means you are married.

882
00:55:15,304 --> 00:55:17,022
Do you have to have plans in life?

883
00:55:17,112 --> 00:55:19,016
It's fun to just wing it.

884
00:55:19,106 --> 00:55:21,306
It's not like planning makes it happen.

885
00:55:21,786 --> 00:55:24,357
If it's random anyway,
we might as well have fun.

886
00:55:26,747 --> 00:55:29,947
I don't know what possessed me
to say I'd live with him.

887
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,690
If we weren't reckless,

888
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,260
you wouldn't be an MC,
I wouldn't be a fighter,

889
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:36,936
Seolhui wouldn't be a CEO.

890
00:55:37,026 --> 00:55:38,531
Also, our Senior Manager...

891
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,010
wouldn't have found his diaphragm.

892
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,330
Why are you so obsessed with diaphragms?

893
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,170
Even if we can't win, let's play anyway.

894
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,856
Living our way is winning.
Who cares what others say?

895
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:50,901
You need to be reckless to hit a jackpot.

896
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,060
Don't mind what others are eating.

897
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,500
Where I am is the major league.

898
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,586
Okay, cheers.

899
00:55:59,676 --> 00:56:00,755
Cheers!

900
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,330
Dongman, when you become a married man...

901
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,517
Did you just sigh?

902
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,023
Why did you sigh?

903
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:16,370
Because I was happy.

904
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:23,447
Thank you for watching Fight For My Way

905
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:01,500
What's this?

906
00:57:02,175 --> 00:57:03,525
What's going on?

907
00:57:04,553 --> 00:57:05,945
Darn mosquitoes.

908
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:07,485
Darn it.

909
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,651
My wedding is today.

910
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,455
Why did I sleep here?

911
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,999
Hey, Bigfoot.

912
00:57:13,089 --> 00:57:15,240
Did you have a dream or something?

913
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,201
What?

914
00:57:16,393 --> 00:57:17,345
"Bigfoot"?

915
00:57:17,673 --> 00:57:19,032
Why am I back to being Bigfoot?

916
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:22,670
You look even uglier today.

917
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,699
What?

918
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:25,345
Aren't I getting married today?

919
00:57:26,059 --> 00:57:27,707
You want to get married?

920
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:29,385
With whom?

921
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,630
Are you seeing someone?

922
00:57:31,902 --> 00:57:33,766
I must have slept funnily.

923
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,120
Was that all a dream?

924
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,830
I can't believe it!

925
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,451
You are so cute.

926
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:47,991
Hey.

927
00:57:48,081 --> 00:57:50,770
Isn't it mad cute that she is still drunk?

928
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,060
To you, maybe.

929
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:56,027
The thought of teasing her
for the rest of my life...

930
00:57:56,117 --> 00:57:57,730
really excites me.

931
00:57:58,151 --> 00:58:01,560
This life will be super fun.

932
00:58:02,476 --> 00:58:04,106
I am sure it will be fun.

933
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,221
Right?

934
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:09,131
My wedding is today.

935
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,130
Why did we sleep here before our wedding?

936
00:58:19,593 --> 00:58:23,336
Everyone, thank you for watching
Fight For My Way.

937
00:58:23,426 --> 00:58:24,966
-Thank you!
-Thank you!
