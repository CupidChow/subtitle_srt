00:00:01,886 --> 00:00:03,456
Episode 4

2
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:21,542
RFC Lightweight Pro Fight.

3
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:24,634
Please cheer for Kim Taksu.

4
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,594
In the red corner,

5
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,007
Taksu Kim!

6
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:03,719
Coach.

7
00:01:06,102 --> 00:01:08,194
Why are you being so cruel to me?

8
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:10,831
Hey.

9
00:01:12,226 --> 00:01:14,030
Aren't you being cruel to yourself?

10
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:15,837
Look.

11
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:17,630
Look at him.

12
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:20,421
Look at how he's living now.

13
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:27,957
You did stupid things together.

14
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:29,651
Why must you hang your head?

15
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,571
That's what you call winning.

16
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,590
Here are the fighters of
the RFC Lightweight Pro Fight.

17
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:42,346
In the red corner. Height, 181 cm.

18
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,436
Weight, 70 kg.

19
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:47,900
Professional MMA record,
23 wins and 4 losses.

20
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:50,291
Tiger MMA with a specialty in Taekwondo.

21
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:52,760
The pride of Korean lightweight fighters.

22
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:56,689
Kim Taksu!

23
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:00,349
Ready, fight!

24
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:05,999
Take your time.

25
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,177
Turn!

26
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:09,758
That's it.

27
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:11,745
Right.

28
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:13,748
-Breathe.
-Right side.

29
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:16,699
That's it.

30
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:49,178
-Nice one!
-Another KO win for Taksu.

31
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,647
A KO win just one minute into the match.

32
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:54,062
He used his specialty, the roundhouse kick.

33
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:56,439
I don't think anyone can defeat him.

34
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,819
Taksu is quite impressive.

35
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:00,521
He is so powerful.

36
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:03,909
That's yours.

37
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:06,614
Him of all people...

38
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,538
...shouldn't be the one
to use your specialty.

39
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:34,398
Taekwondo National Team Selection, 2007

40
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,284
Dongman.

41
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:45,617
I don't want you to make it
tougher for yourself.

42
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,174
If you get too tired during the match,

43
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:53,125
you don't have to get up.

44
00:03:58,085 --> 00:04:00,716
Why are you making things
hard for everyone?

45
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,035
If you give in,

46
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,572
we can all be happy.

47
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,079
No.

48
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,403
No one will be happy.

49
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:18,342
No one in my family...

50
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:21,296
...wants me to lose.

51
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,356
I'll win the gold medal,

52
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:25,494
pay off my dad's debts,

53
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,841
and make my mom's life better.

54
00:04:29,507 --> 00:04:31,061
I'm going to help Donghee myself too.

55
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:35,329
So I won't lose.

56
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,252
Dongman, are you nervous?

57
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:44,796
What?

58
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:47,910
Don't be nervous. You trained hard.

59
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,182
Step lightly,

60
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,088
and take him down easily and go to Beijing.

61
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:53,646
They fly the national team business class.

62
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:54,726
Business?

63
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:57,007
Have you ever flown business?
The chair lays flat.

64
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:58,291
Ko Dongman.

65
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:02,680
Hello, sir. You finally came to
watch a tournament?

66
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,839
Dad.

67
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:06,211
Win, okay?

68
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:08,653
Lose, and I'll kill you.

69
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,149
I won't lose.

70
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:15,887
Your son never loses.

71
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:17,301
Just watch, okay?

72
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:20,031
Dongman is going to Beijing!

73
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:27,288
National Taekwondo Institute

74
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:29,821
Dongman, you can do it.

75
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:34,226
Back off.

76
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,192
Step back.

77
00:05:36,392 --> 00:05:37,259
Spin.

78
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:40,179
That's it!

79
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:42,958
Start!

80
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:51,003
Attack.

81
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:52,879
Cover.

82
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:57,461
Go!

83
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:05,958
-That's it!
-Yes!

84
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:08,678
-Dongman, you can do it.
-Start!

85
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:11,381
Dongman! You can do it!

86
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,131
Go, Dongman!

87
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:20,187
Let's go, Dongman!

88
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:24,640
Get up.

89
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,373
-Concentrate, you punk!
-One...

90
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:27,900
-Two...
-What are you doing?

91
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:30,049
-Get up!
-three, four, five,

92
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:33,492
-Again. Go for three.
-Six, seven, eight.

93
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:49,779
I heard Dongman's sister can walk...

94
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:52,131
...if she gets surgery.

95
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:03,029
Cut and go in.

96
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:10,552
I've paid the overdue hospital bills...

97
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,221
...for Dongman's sister.

98
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:36,328
Ko Dongman.

99
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:38,153
-One, two...
-Get up!

100
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:39,732
Three, four...

101
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:41,559
-Dongman!
-Five, six.

102
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:42,754
-Get up!
-Get up!

103
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,803
-Get up!
-What's wrong with you?

104
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:47,375
-Dongman! Get up!
-Get up!

105
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,561
-Dongman!
-Get up!

106
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:50,391
-Dongman!
-If you don't get up,

107
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,727
I'll never talk to you again!

108
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:54,754
I won't play with you!

109
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,510
Dongman! Dongman!

110
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:08,544
We'll pay you back by tomorrow.

111
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,594
Give me your account number and leave.

112
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,898
If you'd let Taksu win the spot
on the national team,

113
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:17,378
his wealthy father will pay off
your husband's debts...

114
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:18,520
and your daughter's hospital fees...

115
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:19,700
-You scumbag.
-Oh, my gosh.

116
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:24,123
Would you have your own child do that?

117
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:27,250
Would you tell your child
to lose for money?

118
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,906
Get out. Get out of my house!

119
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:31,449
Get out, you jerk!

120
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:33,978
Dongman's heading to Beijing!

121
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:37,043
Win, okay? Lose, and I'll kill you.

122
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,964
I won't lose.

123
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:41,954
Your son never loses.

124
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:48,508
Taksu wins.

125
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:50,608
Yes!

126
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:06,823
Hey!

127
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,154
Taksu!

128
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:49,542
We need to talk.

129
00:09:49,976 --> 00:09:51,922
-Why?
-Something's off.

130
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,696
He just grazed him, so why?

131
00:09:56,624 --> 00:09:59,575
It wasn't that he couldn't get up,

132
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:01,504
but he didn't.

133
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,024
Press Conference:
National Team Qualifier Fix

134
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:10,787
Is he banned from competing again?

135
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:11,914
Of course.

136
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,417
Why is a young kid so into money already?

137
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:20,141
Dongman, go in there alone. Okay?

138
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:22,286
-Earn your pay.
-Taksu.

139
00:10:22,486 --> 00:10:24,389
-What? Let go.
-Seriously.

140
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:27,465
We were caught because he was so obvious.

141
00:10:28,104 --> 00:10:30,849
I'm going to be disciplined
too because of him.

142
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,597
Hey, Coach Choi.
Why is this scumbag such a jerk?

143
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:37,917
Hey. What did you just say?

144
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:41,994
You lack skills, paid your way up,
and hurt Dongman.

145
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:43,915
How dare you blame him?

146
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:46,044
Taksu's father has
an election coming up next year,

147
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:48,375
so he doesn't want
Taksu gaining attention for this.

148
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:49,964
So what?

149
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:52,655
You want Dongman to be
his bulletproof vest?

150
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:55,614
You don't want to do it?
Dongman, you won't do it?

151
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:57,882
Then give back the money.

152
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,745
I won't go in,

153
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:02,423
so pay back your sister's hospital bills.

154
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:04,513
Hey. Come here.

155
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:05,784
Come here.

156
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,730
Coach.

157
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,557
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:21,888
Shut it, punk.

159
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,307
Hey. How could you make
a fool of your coach like this?

160
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:28,420
How could you do this
without even consulting me?

161
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,146
Am I just a coach to you? Am I?
Just a coach?

162
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,838
You didn't know what was going on.

163
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:38,965
You'll be blamed for nothing.

164
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:43,075
I'll go by myself. You should...

165
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:47,164
You should just leave.

166
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:51,846
If your face gets in the papers,
you can't even teach.

167
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:56,768
You idiot. Is this funny to you?

168
00:11:58,337 --> 00:11:59,196
Come with me.

169
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:07,087
-There he is.
-Please tell us what happened.

170
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:08,493
-Is it true?
-Look this way please.

171
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,778
Please tell us...

172
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,486
Why isn't he coming out?

173
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:18,923
Does he plan to watch
the whole thing alone?

174
00:12:27,186 --> 00:12:28,246
There he is!

175
00:12:28,586 --> 00:12:30,046
You were great!

176
00:12:30,286 --> 00:12:32,016
-You're awesome!
-You rocked!

177
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:35,086
You're so hot!

178
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:38,847
We'll make a public announcement.

179
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:41,245
I'll post it soon.

180
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:44,611
What?

181
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:48,007
Aren't you Dongman?

182
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:49,047
Dongman?

183
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:50,825
Do you know him?

184
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,582
It's been a while.

185
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:01,236
Yes, it has, Dongman.

186
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:03,114
What brings you here?

187
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:04,125
Why are you here?

188
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:08,912
Someone gave me tickets to the fight.

189
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:10,939
So why are you watching fights?

190
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:14,715
Taksu, come on. He can watch fights.
Why are you...

191
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:15,911
Are you here...

192
00:13:16,537 --> 00:13:17,949
...to see me?

193
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:22,109
Why? Do you need more money?

194
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:25,371
Taksu. People are watching.

195
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,010
Since I'm doing well,

196
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:30,077
are you hoping to pick up some scraps?

197
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:32,743
I see.

198
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:34,544
It's true.

199
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:37,201
That beggar's mentality would never change.

200
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:43,110
Dongman, every time I see you,
I feel like crud.

201
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:46,278
So don't come near me, got it?

202
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:49,447
Don't even come near the octagon.

203
00:13:49,647 --> 00:13:51,683
If you show up and act out again,

204
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:53,827
you'll mess up my life again.

205
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:56,403
Hey.

206
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:00,002
Are you scared?

207
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,662
What?

208
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:05,258
Why are you rambling on? How humiliating.

209
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,262
This punk. Listen to him talk.

210
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:12,009
Are you afraid I'll make a comeback?

211
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:16,439
Hey. You were an ace ten years ago.

212
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:19,302
You still have a mouth on you, don't you?

213
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:21,037
-There are cameras.
-Let go.

214
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:25,734
You need to crush these losers properly.

215
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:29,619
Gosh, I almost forgot.

216
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:31,469
What happened to your sister?

217
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,266
Can she walk now?

218
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:39,185
Kim Taksu!

219
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,516
What? "Taksu?"

220
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:11,249
If you're going to copy my move,
do it properly!

221
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:15,096
I can't believe this.

222
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:19,220
Don't get scared already.
It's only the beginning.

223
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:23,064
If we ever meet in the ring,

224
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:26,511
you're dead.

225
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:33,003
-My gosh, wait.
-Mr Taksu.

226
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:39,246
Photo Studio

227
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:53,757
ID pictures for cabin crew and announcers

228
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:05,027
-I think the black box is working.
-Who are they?

229
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:07,099
Why are they gathered
in front of my truck?

230
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,028
I didn't do anything wrong.

231
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:19,251
Excuse me. I need to take my truck out.

232
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,677
You're the owner of this sundae truck?

233
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,293
He's here.

234
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:26,396
Sir, is your black box working right now?

235
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:28,426
Yes. Why?

236
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:30,653
Please sell us the video footage of it.

237
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:33,387
Why? Did something happen here?

238
00:16:33,587 --> 00:16:36,461
Taksu got knocked out
in front of your truck.

239
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:49,397
What?

240
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:53,071
What? That crazy jerk.

241
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,292
How did he do that?

242
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:05,245
Taksu KO'd

243
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,205
I'll improve myself. I'm sorry.

244
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:36,113
You, are you crazy?

245
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:37,426
Which unit did you serve in the army?

246
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:40,501
I was only...

247
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:43,708
I'll do better next time.

248
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:45,277
Where are you?

249
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:49,218
Are you kidding me right now?
Where are you?

250
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:53,613
Clench your teeth again.

251
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:56,183
Clench your teeth again!

252
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,806
Don't even come near the octagon.

253
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,381
I guess people really
need to do what they love.

254
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,005
Are you happy now?

255
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,529
Are you doing anything intensely?

256
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:39,114
I don't think I can do a good job.

257
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:45,822
You always tell me
to quit if that's all I can do.

258
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:48,693
But you see,

259
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:53,548
that's the best I can do
because I don't like that job.

260
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:55,701
So you know what?

261
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,255
I'm going to quit!

262
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:07,647
I'm going to quit! I quit!

263
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,427
I don't care now. I'll just go for it!

264
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:19,868
Round 4: Just Go for It!

265
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:34,598
-Coach!
-My gosh, you surprised me.

266
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:37,720
Where in the world were you?
You've caused a ruckus.

267
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:39,155
Jangho!

268
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:40,414
You little punk.

269
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:42,717
-I want to do it!
-Do what?

270
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,470
I really want to do it!

271
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,402
I'm going to do mixed martial arts!

272
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,365
I'm going to do it!

273
00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:51,793
Are you being serious?

274
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:54,369
I don't care about anything.
I'll just go for it.

275
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,446
You told me to not care and give it a go.

276
00:19:56,646 --> 00:19:59,750
You're not saying this
after getting drunk, right?

277
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,210
Okay! Let's do this!

278
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,106
Aera.

279
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:48,761
You surprised me. Are you a stalker?

280
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:51,350
I heard that women
like these kinds of surprises.

281
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,197
Women don't like it
when guys show up unexpectedly.

282
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,427
It's only because I miss you all the time.

283
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:03,020
I have a three-hour break.

284
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,970
But I already used
an hour to wait for you.

285
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:06,853
I only have two hours left.

286
00:21:07,503 --> 00:21:08,865
So can you please get in the car?

287
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:19,351
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

288
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:21,999
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

289
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:25,917
Let us hear a couple words
from our new recruits.

290
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:31,808
I'm Chanho of the sales team.
I'll do my best!

291
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:38,940
Hello, I'm Yejin.
I hope we get along well.

292
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:44,265
Excuse me, madam.

293
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:46,986
Please give us 2 bottles of soju,
3 bottles of beer,

294
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:50,333
-some greens, and wet tissues.
-Sunhee...

295
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:52,132
...really is quick with
keeping things in order.

296
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,831
-My name is Seolhui.
-I know. Seolhui.

297
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:59,760
-I said Seolhui.
-You called me Sunhee.

298
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:02,378
Didn't you say that your parents...

299
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:05,957
...sell jokbal at a market
in the countryside?

300
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:10,013
I guess that's why
she's so good at cutting meat.

301
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:14,540
We should always bring her
to all of our team dinners.

302
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,931
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

303
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:22,073
-Hey, Juman. About that...
-Yes?

304
00:22:22,282 --> 00:22:25,982
My goodness, you don't need to do that.

305
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:29,851
Who makes female workers
pour drinks these days?

306
00:22:29,994 --> 00:22:34,131
I should be the one
to pour you a drink. Here.

307
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:35,707
No, I'll pour her a drink.

308
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:39,154
Let me pour you a drink.

309
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,737
Okay.

310
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:42,518
I can't drink that well,
so just pour me a little bit.

311
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:44,198
Okay. I won't give you that much.

312
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:50,741
My goodness.
After Juman poured her a drink,

313
00:22:51,384 --> 00:22:54,241
Yejin's face became red.

314
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:07,121
You can't make female workers
pour alcohol these days.

315
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,960
You said you don't have a girlfriend, right?

316
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:11,440
Shouldn't you get married?

317
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:14,781
I need to make money.

318
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:19,104
What do you think about Yejin,
the new recruit?

319
00:23:20,177 --> 00:23:22,092
I think she likes you.

320
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:26,529
If you start dating her,
you can quit right away.

321
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,984
Her family sells jokbal.

322
00:23:30,937 --> 00:23:32,710
Granny Park's Jokbal.

323
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:36,058
Her family owns that brand.

324
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,617
Really?

325
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:53,685
Hey, look at those two.

326
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,302
It's like a black and white vs color TV.

327
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:16,230
I don't like the fact
that the prince charming...

328
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:17,801
...is driving me home.

329
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:24,557
You have arrived at your destination.

330
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:27,743
You should've just
let me off at the station.

331
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:30,348
You didn't have to drop me
off in front of my house.

332
00:24:31,684 --> 00:24:33,991
So your house is really located here?

333
00:24:34,797 --> 00:24:36,446
What do you mean by "really located here?"

334
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:38,122
Yes.

335
00:24:38,964 --> 00:24:40,541
I'll get going now.

336
00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:42,967
Already? We just got here.

337
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:48,902
Then what?

338
00:24:49,607 --> 00:24:50,877
Do you want to have ramyeon at my house?

339
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:52,936
Sorry?

340
00:24:54,817 --> 00:24:56,230
Why do you look so scared?

341
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:58,386
I guess you like jjolmyeon, not ramyeon.

342
00:24:59,307 --> 00:25:03,554
I mean,
I like both ramyeon and jjolmyeon a lot.

343
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:06,164
You like both of them.

344
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:12,301
Do you know that
it's fun to tease you, Moobin?

345
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,610
You must've had
a hard time when you were in school.

346
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:16,747
What do you mean it's fun to tease me?

347
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,340
You're cute.

348
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,289
I am not cute.

349
00:25:29,816 --> 00:25:30,947
I won't be cute.

350
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,240
Your route has been off the course.

351
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,203
Your route has been off the course.

352
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:43,674
I got it, you wench.

353
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,363
I guess shoe thieves
are still active these days.

354
00:25:52,498 --> 00:25:55,121
Why did this thief
only steal one of the pair?

355
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:56,852
Is he perverted or something?

356
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:01,670
-Who is the owner of vehicle 0824?
-That's me.

357
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:03,561
-You called for chauffeur service?
-Yes.

358
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,935
That's your car, Yejin?

359
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:08,626
Oh, my. Your car is quite nice.

360
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,751
I will get going now.

361
00:26:13,951 --> 00:26:15,840
All right. See you tomorrow, Yejin.

362
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:18,282
Mr Kim,

363
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,599
don't you live in Oksu-dong?
I pass through there.

364
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,152
Should I drop you off on the way?

365
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:27,127
-Go. Hurry and get in the car.
-Gosh.

366
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:29,475
No, that's fine. I have plans after this.

367
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:30,687
I see.

368
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:35,508
You should go.

369
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,605
You are quite stubborn.

370
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:40,558
I'll feel better when I see you go in.

371
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:43,983
I live right there.
There's no need for that.

372
00:26:44,183 --> 00:26:45,463
Gosh, aren't you nice?

373
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:48,698
If you live right there,
then those shirts are...

374
00:26:50,362 --> 00:26:51,679
Talented Feet

375
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:57,392
No. I live over there. All the way there.

376
00:26:58,053 --> 00:26:59,838
I see. All the way there.

377
00:27:00,283 --> 00:27:03,478
Aera, it seems like you like gold.

378
00:27:07,414 --> 00:27:09,973
Why did the landlord put that thing there?

379
00:27:14,072 --> 00:27:17,733
Aera, don't say hi to
the tenant on the second floor.

380
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:21,238
I have a bad feeling about that man.

381
00:27:22,503 --> 00:27:26,534
Why do you think that a man lives there?

382
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,518
Aera!

383
00:27:31,178 --> 00:27:32,330
Gosh, you startled me.

384
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:34,199
Why did you have to come now? Wait...

385
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,627
Crazy jerk. I told you
not to do things like that.

386
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,355
I quit my job.

387
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:43,709
I am going to do
mixed martial arts from now on.

388
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,656
What? Are you serious?

389
00:27:45,856 --> 00:27:48,071
With this mixed martial arts career,

390
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,204
for Mom, Dad, Donghee, Coach, and you,

391
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:53,033
I'll make you live in luxury.

392
00:27:53,747 --> 00:27:55,072
I'm going to turn our lives around.

393
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:03,293
-Who is he?
-He is...

394
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:06,825
-He's my friend.
-Hey, Moobin.

395
00:28:09,141 --> 00:28:10,439
Why are you in front of our house?

396
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:14,344
-Our house?
-He lives across from mine.

397
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:17,050
It's not the same house. He lives next door.

398
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:20,318
By the way, do you know each other?

399
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:22,012
-We're high school alumni.
-We're alumni.

400
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,019
But why are you in front of our house?

401
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:31,608
I dropped Aera off here.

402
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,468
I am going to date her officially.

403
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:41,307
We don't have to date
officially not just yet.

404
00:28:41,593 --> 00:28:45,053
So don't hug her like that.

405
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,478
Moobin,

406
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,139
I think you have gotten the wrong idea.

407
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:54,561
Dongman and I are like...

408
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:58,021
We are best friends.

409
00:29:00,594 --> 00:29:04,072
Aera, guys and girls can't be friends.

410
00:29:04,272 --> 00:29:06,240
It's an excuse to keep
the other one in your reach...

411
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,876
...because you don't want
to date that person.

412
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,971
I don't want you to be friends with him.

413
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,391
We are not just friends.

414
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:22,037
He and I are like siblings.

415
00:29:22,237 --> 00:29:23,278
We are...

416
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,600
...not siblings though.

417
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,117
-What?
-We aren't siblings.

418
00:29:34,661 --> 00:29:35,652
I don't like it too.

419
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:38,761
I don't want you...

420
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:41,631
...to date him
whether it's official or not.

421
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:47,815
You have never meddled
with my dating life before.

422
00:29:47,906 --> 00:29:48,908
I don't know.

423
00:29:51,342 --> 00:29:52,323
But I don't like it now.

424
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,552
Administration Manager

425
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,272
Shouldn't you get going now?

426
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:14,720
-I...
-Bye.

427
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:18,103
-I'll have that ramyeon.
-What did you say, punk?

428
00:30:18,303 --> 00:30:20,429
You asked me if I wanted ramyeon before.

429
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:23,148
Have you gone mad?

430
00:30:23,646 --> 00:30:26,817
I said it to tease him.

431
00:30:27,017 --> 00:30:29,334
When I go back to the emergency room,

432
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:30,795
I won't get to eat anything.

433
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,200
I'll get really hungry.

434
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:35,292
We can have ramyeon together, can't we?

435
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:39,478
Let's go up together.
I'll cook you ramyeon.

436
00:30:39,678 --> 00:30:41,120
I am really good at cooking ramyeon.

437
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:48,456
I can't let this fly.
I ought to tell your dad.

438
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:49,945
What?

439
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:52,349
I'll tell him that
since he let you live alone,

440
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,702
you are about to have ramyeon with a guy.

441
00:30:54,861 --> 00:30:57,474
I am going to tell him. I'll let him know.

442
00:30:57,715 --> 00:30:58,908
Where is his number?

443
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,948
Gosh, what is wrong with you today?

444
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:02,589
Are you drunk?

445
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:04,075
Are you going to cook him ramyeon?

446
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:06,256
What is it to you if I cook him ramyeon...

447
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,157
...or a meal with 18 side dishes?

448
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:12,254
-Gosh.
-All right. I understand.

449
00:31:13,578 --> 00:31:16,351
It might have been too soon.
That wasn't gentleman-like.

450
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:19,137
You think so too, don't you?

451
00:31:19,606 --> 00:31:22,149
I thought that you could
have been a womanizer.

452
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:25,995
Please invite me to your house later.

453
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:29,256
Today, let's buy ramyeon and eat it here.

454
00:31:29,462 --> 00:31:30,732
It's on me.

455
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,879
What's the matter with you two?

456
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:41,813
I want ramyeon too.

457
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:44,057
What?

458
00:31:46,044 --> 00:31:47,445
I want to eat ramyeon too.

459
00:31:56,474 --> 00:31:57,950
Thank you, Moobin.

460
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:01,749
If you went to
the same high school together,

461
00:32:01,949 --> 00:32:03,683
were you two close?

462
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:05,001
-Not at all.
-Not at all.

463
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,287
I couldn't be friends with just anybody.

464
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:10,634
Especially with jerks who kept chirping.

465
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,085
I wasn't friends with mere athletes.

466
00:32:14,285 --> 00:32:15,781
Our teacher punished him a lot.

467
00:32:28,978 --> 00:32:29,921
Gosh, it's hot.

468
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:31,978
Did you want to eat ramyeon this badly?

469
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:36,515
Aera, I really went out
of my way to meet you today.

470
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:38,833
I might get fired when
I go back to the hospital later.

471
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:40,806
Why did you do that?

472
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:42,839
We could have met another time.

473
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:46,141
I had to see you.

474
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:48,415
From the first day I met you until today,

475
00:32:48,615 --> 00:32:50,259
I thought about you about 50 times?

476
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:56,261
Yeah, about 50 times a day.

477
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,416
If I don't see you, I can't do anything.

478
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:02,394
Gosh, it's so hot.

479
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,587
I see. You are quite straightforward,
aren't you?

480
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:12,226
Aera, let's go on a date tomorrow.

481
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:14,444
I'll plan the entire evening. Full-course.

482
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:19,235
Full-course? Goodness.

483
00:33:21,886 --> 00:33:25,442
Now that I think about it,
you like pulling surprises.

484
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,618
You startled me.

485
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:34,403
What is it?

486
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,723
Hey, your ramyeon is getting soggy.

487
00:33:38,076 --> 00:33:40,345
Stop chatting and eat up.
Let's go home soon.

488
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:43,477
Why did you pull my chair?

489
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,139
You didn't have to pull my chair.

490
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,537
You startled me.

491
00:34:10,737 --> 00:34:12,991
Why were you startled?
You didn't know I'd be here?

492
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:14,341
What?

493
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,997
I was thinking about something.

494
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:21,279
Right, there might be people from work.

495
00:34:21,914 --> 00:34:24,453
Why are you eating ice cream
after eating so much meat?

496
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:26,334
You spilled some.

497
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:29,780
I was hungry.
I was too busy grilling meat to eat any.

498
00:34:34,144 --> 00:34:36,565
Do you have to wear a uniform?

499
00:34:37,056 --> 00:34:38,691
Aren't these hard to clean?

500
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:41,509
We can dress casually if we want to.

501
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:44,183
Why do you always wear a uniform then?

502
00:34:44,613 --> 00:34:45,986
Don't you want to look pretty?

503
00:34:46,248 --> 00:34:48,878
Then I'd have to rotate
at least three outfits a week.

504
00:34:49,078 --> 00:34:51,580
I can't afford all that.
I prefer the uniform.

505
00:34:52,488 --> 00:34:54,278
I can buy you some clothes.

506
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:57,175
Why don't you ever ask me for something?

507
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:00,845
I got a raise and
I can spend it all on you.

508
00:35:00,936 --> 00:35:01,986
How can I spend that?

509
00:35:02,077 --> 00:35:04,186
You earned it by
buttering up your superiors...

510
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:07,670
...and working so hard.
I can't spend it on my clothes.

511
00:35:11,112 --> 00:35:12,211
Do you want that?

512
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:15,827
That's really expensive.

513
00:35:16,524 --> 00:35:17,750
I'll buy it for you.

514
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,179
No, it's expensive.

515
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:36,810
I don't think the color suits me.

516
00:35:37,106 --> 00:35:39,921
Your skin's so white
that it suits you perfectly.

517
00:35:40,718 --> 00:35:42,887
No, the size I mean.

518
00:35:42,978 --> 00:35:45,957
It looks almost tailored.
Don't you look so slim?

519
00:35:51,645 --> 00:35:54,130
I don't think it's my style.

520
00:35:54,692 --> 00:35:55,724
I'll pay for it.

521
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:58,194
But it's too...

522
00:35:59,347 --> 00:36:00,447
Oh, no.

523
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:08,541
I didn't want it.
Why did you go off and pay?

524
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:12,448
Where would I go wearing this?

525
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,785
To work. Wear it to work!

526
00:36:15,032 --> 00:36:17,683
Wear pink, your favorite color.
Act prim and proper.

527
00:36:17,883 --> 00:36:20,549
Don't let others walk over you.
Don't grill meat!

528
00:36:20,749 --> 00:36:21,938
Why are you shouting?

529
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:23,293
I told you to get it.

530
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:25,288
I didn't want the dress.

531
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:27,669
It's not my style.

532
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,411
What is your style?

533
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:33,234
-What?
-Cheap. That's your style.

534
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,635
I know very well that
you ended up like this...

535
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:40,459
...trying to support a poor guy
like me for six years.

536
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,886
I'm so grateful for that.

537
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:47,683
But now, it's almost suffocating.

538
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,904
I'm sorry, Seolhui.

539
00:37:00,474 --> 00:37:01,525
I lost my mind.

540
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:03,190
Seolhui.

541
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:04,996
Seolhui.

542
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:11,325
Seolhui.

543
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:41,035
Mister.

544
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:43,364
-Yes?
-Can you...

545
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:48,763
...drop me off at
the nearest subway station?

546
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:29,521
Mr Kim, you're still here.

547
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:30,883
Hi.

548
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,800
You'll never get a taxi. Get in.

549
00:38:33,972 --> 00:38:35,459
No, thanks, I'll...

550
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,731
Get in before we cause a traffic jam.

551
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:41,657
Well...

552
00:38:43,402 --> 00:38:46,465
Now, can you please leave?

553
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:47,962
You first.

554
00:38:48,053 --> 00:38:50,664
I want to see you go home safely.

555
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:54,841
Okay, then. I'll head home.

556
00:38:55,773 --> 00:38:58,122
-You can leave as well.
-Sure.

557
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:03,555
Bye.

558
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:06,441
I'll call you.

559
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:08,459
Bye.

560
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:27,733
What are you doing? Why go further up?

561
00:39:28,213 --> 00:39:30,241
I don't want him to know where you live.

562
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:31,923
We can come back down later.

563
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:37,266
Okay, then. Lead the way.

564
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,981
Let's go.

565
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:46,918
Go on home.

566
00:39:49,707 --> 00:39:50,968
Go on. Bye.

567
00:39:59,275 --> 00:40:01,201
I said go.

568
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:04,487
Bye.

569
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,423
You're being weird today.

570
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:09,247
Are you in a beauty pageant?

571
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:10,502
Shut it.

572
00:40:13,383 --> 00:40:14,725
Let's go.

573
00:40:31,499 --> 00:40:32,950
Seolhui

574
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:36,332
What's this?
It looks like a woman's clothing.

575
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:37,784
Oh, this?

576
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:40,594
It's pink.

577
00:40:41,035 --> 00:40:42,001
Yes.

578
00:40:45,602 --> 00:40:46,540
Mr Kim.

579
00:40:48,553 --> 00:40:51,229
I like pink a lot.

580
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,184
Look.

581
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:56,494
How pretty.

582
00:41:00,243 --> 00:41:01,608
Am I pretty?

583
00:41:02,331 --> 00:41:03,886
Your fingernails are.

584
00:41:09,227 --> 00:41:10,639
Let me off here.

585
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,686
Why don't you get off
in front of your house?

586
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,139
I want to get some Tteokbokki.

587
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:19,141
Can I join you?

588
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:22,128
I can call another driver
and I'm feeling a bit hungry.

589
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:24,224
-Yejin, I...
-Yes?

590
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:27,718
Some other time.
I'll gather all the interns...

591
00:41:28,128 --> 00:41:30,088
...and treat you all.

592
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:32,584
Oh, okay.

593
00:41:32,914 --> 00:41:34,519
Thanks for the lift.

594
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:37,581
Take care. Thank you.

595
00:41:46,451 --> 00:41:47,493
Mr Kim.

596
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,363
No.

597
00:41:51,026 --> 00:41:52,152
What?

598
00:41:55,677 --> 00:41:57,630
Don't call all the interns.

599
00:41:58,672 --> 00:42:00,556
Treat just me.

600
00:42:10,558 --> 00:42:12,106
Why just her?

601
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:43,719
Yes!

602
00:42:53,653 --> 00:42:56,195
You sneaky, since when did you...

603
00:42:56,286 --> 00:42:59,357
Forget about him.
Why did you quit killing bugs?

604
00:42:59,718 --> 00:43:01,750
-To get into MMA?
-Yes.

605
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:05,501
I was on a high until
I saw you and crashed.

606
00:43:05,805 --> 00:43:07,915
So you'll quit a job
that pays a salary...

607
00:43:08,006 --> 00:43:10,114
...to beat people up in a ring?

608
00:43:10,242 --> 00:43:12,325
It's an actual art of fighting.

609
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:13,316
No.

610
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,886
I said no. Don't even try.

611
00:43:16,116 --> 00:43:18,444
Why do you think you have a say?

612
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:20,332
You haven't exercised in ten years.

613
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:22,739
You'll only get beaten up.

614
00:43:24,614 --> 00:43:26,677
I really don't like the way you said that.

615
00:43:26,852 --> 00:43:29,575
You can be an announcer after years...

616
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:31,306
...and I won't amount to anything?

617
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:33,782
You'd been mentioning
MMA every now and then,

618
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:37,920
so I looked it up and
people get punched in the eye.

619
00:43:38,011 --> 00:43:40,779
They get broken noses and bleed.

620
00:43:41,033 --> 00:43:43,952
Why do you assume I'll get beaten up?

621
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:46,070
I could win.

622
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:47,612
You still get hit.

623
00:43:49,196 --> 00:43:51,390
-What?
-I saw it all.

624
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,794
You get hit whether you win or lose.

625
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,525
I can't let you get hit.

626
00:44:07,192 --> 00:44:08,848
Oh, so...

627
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:13,336
Are you saying this out of concern?

628
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:17,425
Who said I'm concerned?
I don't want you to get hit.

629
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:20,592
Would you like it if
Baekhee got beaten up?

630
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,164
What? Are you comparing me to a dog?

631
00:44:24,255 --> 00:44:26,313
That's a pet dog...

632
00:44:26,506 --> 00:44:28,775
...but you're furious inside.
That's human nature.

633
00:44:28,975 --> 00:44:30,637
Darn it.

634
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:33,798
You're so lucky you were born a girl.

635
00:44:33,998 --> 00:44:35,856
If you were a guy, I would've...

636
00:44:35,947 --> 00:44:38,746
You would've seen stars.

637
00:44:39,475 --> 00:44:42,496
Darn it. Forget it.

638
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:46,584
Anyway, get ready to get a job tomorrow.

639
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,433
Or I'll get you one.

640
00:45:08,862 --> 00:45:10,027
Where are you going?

641
00:45:10,227 --> 00:45:12,292
Let's talk some more.

642
00:45:17,565 --> 00:45:19,386
Why you...

643
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:22,212
This doesn't make you a tough guy.

644
00:45:22,646 --> 00:45:25,206
It makes you a jerk.

645
00:45:26,369 --> 00:45:28,528
What's wrong with you?

646
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:31,633
I told you, no touching. Don't touch.

647
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,927
Whatever. I'm going to do what I want.

648
00:45:38,497 --> 00:45:39,615
Play with me.

649
00:45:40,656 --> 00:45:45,203
Don't go on some
full-course whatever with that punk.

650
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:47,457
"That punk"?

651
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:50,072
Why is he a punk?

652
00:45:50,278 --> 00:45:51,902
Because he is.
What else should I call him?

653
00:45:52,102 --> 00:45:53,928
Why did you follow us when we went to eat?

654
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,549
Because I was hungry.

655
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:11,667
Why were you so weird?
Why were you so immature?

656
00:46:13,965 --> 00:46:16,153
Why do you care whom I see?

657
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:20,492
Then what? Should I not care at all?
Are we strangers?

658
00:46:20,692 --> 00:46:22,266
Yes, we're strangers. Total strangers.

659
00:46:22,466 --> 00:46:25,197
-How could you say that? I'm hurt.
-Hey, kiddo.

660
00:46:28,165 --> 00:46:29,236
Look at me.

661
00:46:33,823 --> 00:46:34,902
Darn it.

662
00:46:38,236 --> 00:46:39,240
Listen to me.

663
00:46:39,885 --> 00:46:42,952
You may have no clue what I'm saying,

664
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:46,026
but in the adult world,
your actions are unacceptable.

665
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,808
Get it together.

666
00:46:48,595 --> 00:46:50,988
Don't confuse a simple, country girl.

667
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:53,929
I swear I'll kill you.

668
00:47:11,782 --> 00:47:12,912
Darn it.

669
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,829
Darn it, that beast.

670
00:47:23,454 --> 00:47:24,660
Darn it.

671
00:47:24,824 --> 00:47:26,035
What's with him?

672
00:47:43,753 --> 00:47:46,427
Why that she used to look like Chewbacca.

673
00:47:58,357 --> 00:48:00,347
Is he going through puberty or something?

674
00:48:00,765 --> 00:48:04,099
Darn it. Why does she keep getting prettier?

675
00:48:07,306 --> 00:48:08,957
Why are his hands so big?

676
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:16,375
You look so pretty.

677
00:48:17,602 --> 00:48:20,312
I got it cleaned right away,
so the stain came out.

678
00:48:25,017 --> 00:48:26,737
Forget it. You can't wear this.

679
00:48:27,046 --> 00:48:28,369
It makes me look short, right?

680
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:30,277
It's too spectacular.

681
00:48:30,368 --> 00:48:33,544
It shows off your
incredible figure too much.

682
00:48:33,965 --> 00:48:36,822
-No.
-Exactly. I look short.

683
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:43,481
Seolhui.

684
00:48:48,857 --> 00:48:50,411
Are you going to sleep downstairs again?

685
00:48:50,738 --> 00:48:51,676
Let go.

686
00:48:52,758 --> 00:48:55,750
I'm sorry. I told you I'm sorry.

687
00:48:58,842 --> 00:48:59,835
What are you sorry for?

688
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:02,378
For everything. I'm just sorry.

689
00:49:02,831 --> 00:49:05,497
Everything? What are you sorry for?

690
00:49:06,424 --> 00:49:09,111
I'm sorry for buying you the dress,

691
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:12,407
and I was wrong for raising my voice.

692
00:49:12,607 --> 00:49:13,608
And?

693
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:15,786
Is that all?

694
00:49:17,026 --> 00:49:19,581
Is that all you did wrong?

695
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:23,393
-What?
-You don't even know what you did wrong.

696
00:49:23,484 --> 00:49:25,816
-Seolhui.
-Forget it. We need to talk.

697
00:49:25,907 --> 00:49:27,121
What's up with your skin today?

698
00:49:28,156 --> 00:49:30,232
-What about it?
-Did you do something?

699
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:34,404
Forget the popular, dewy look.

700
00:49:35,325 --> 00:49:36,462
It's fiery.

701
00:49:38,546 --> 00:49:41,300
You know fire is better than water, right?

702
00:49:41,391 --> 00:49:43,151
Fiery is the best.

703
00:49:43,351 --> 00:49:46,641
Your skin is fiery. You have fiery skin.

704
00:49:48,964 --> 00:49:51,045
Was "fiery" a bit much?

705
00:49:53,213 --> 00:49:54,487
Fiery?

706
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:16,815
Mister, I guess security...

707
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:19,151
...isn't so great
in a place like this, right?

708
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,372
How much would a place like this cost?

709
00:50:24,865 --> 00:50:27,421
Are these all month-to-month?

710
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:31,964
Oh, my gosh.

711
00:50:33,514 --> 00:50:34,879
You were a woman.

712
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:37,506
Do you want to live here?

713
00:50:37,597 --> 00:50:38,525
Pardon?

714
00:50:38,826 --> 00:50:42,485
You have over 10 million won
draped over your body.

715
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:45,603
Why are you asking about
the rent in a place like this?

716
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,579
I never said I'd like
to live in a place like this.

717
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,929
And who are you
to ask if I want to live here?

718
00:50:51,535 --> 00:50:52,564
I am...

719
00:50:53,844 --> 00:50:56,157
...the owner of a place like this.

720
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:04,410
I don't take in pretty girls.

721
00:51:05,204 --> 00:51:08,434
-Pardon?
-Pretty girls are noisy.

722
00:51:09,055 --> 00:51:12,719
Their fates are clamorous,
and so are their lives.

723
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,798
I experienced it.

724
00:51:20,192 --> 00:51:21,915
My fate is pretty good.

725
00:51:22,115 --> 00:51:24,631
Divorce is nothing in this day and age.

726
00:51:27,525 --> 00:51:28,492
Are you divorced?

727
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:35,002
This place must be a quiet, wholesome,

728
00:51:35,202 --> 00:51:38,479
and peaceful villa.

729
00:51:40,187 --> 00:51:41,669
I am wholesome.

730
00:51:42,368 --> 00:51:43,686
Gosh.

731
00:51:47,286 --> 00:51:48,350
Hello.

732
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:53,274
No sleepovers allowed.

733
00:51:56,938 --> 00:51:59,019
We sleep separately at times.

734
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:01,565
-Why are you telling her that?
-Gosh.

735
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:08,615
Hello.

736
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:10,932
Aren't you Dongman's friends?

737
00:52:11,398 --> 00:52:14,138
You're her, right? You're Dongman's...

738
00:52:14,338 --> 00:52:17,315
Yes, I am. I came to see him.

739
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,096
What are you doing?

740
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,658
Aera! Aera!

741
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:28,723
Aera! Aera!

742
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:30,334
Aera!

743
00:52:48,129 --> 00:52:50,248
How dare you come here?

744
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:52,566
You said he got married and left town.

745
00:52:52,657 --> 00:52:53,751
Why did you lie?

746
00:52:55,207 --> 00:52:58,810
I felt like it.
Would you have told the truth?

747
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:03,952
-I can't hear you.
-What?

748
00:53:04,826 --> 00:53:06,651
I need to talk to her, so be quiet.

749
00:53:07,548 --> 00:53:08,674
Okay.

750
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:10,772
Let's just go.

751
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:12,403
Stay still.

752
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:17,061
You're stuck to him like glue.

753
00:53:17,196 --> 00:53:19,756
Dongman isn't at your beck and call.

754
00:53:19,956 --> 00:53:21,957
If you keep coming back after dumping him,

755
00:53:22,048 --> 00:53:23,377
do you think he'd take you back?

756
00:53:23,648 --> 00:53:25,632
Yes, I think he will.

757
00:53:27,401 --> 00:53:29,997
Be honest. You think the same.

758
00:53:30,796 --> 00:53:32,604
Why I ought to...

759
00:53:32,893 --> 00:53:34,455
I hit girls, you know.

760
00:53:38,688 --> 00:53:39,982
Dongman.

761
00:53:44,602 --> 00:53:48,110
So annoying. There she goes again.

762
00:53:51,466 --> 00:53:52,763
Dongman.

763
00:53:54,891 --> 00:54:00,724
Stop saying his name
with that nasal voice!

764
00:54:06,431 --> 00:54:09,558
-The air is so nice here.
-Hey.

765
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:14,835
This is the scent of society.
This is the perfect food.

766
00:54:19,934 --> 00:54:21,017
Dongman.

767
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:25,256
Dongman.

768
00:54:25,923 --> 00:54:28,058
I broke up with him.

769
00:54:30,623 --> 00:54:33,138
Why that crazy little...

770
00:54:33,949 --> 00:54:36,211
How was your blind date?

771
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:38,585
Was she pretty?

772
00:54:39,499 --> 00:54:41,117
She looked like Kim Hyojin.

773
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:44,089
-That's awesome.
-Awesome.

774
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,981
Is she totally hot?

775
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,490
No. Not that Kim Hyojin.

776
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,281
She must've been cute.

777
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,086
Dongman.

778
00:55:12,678 --> 00:55:14,376
Loser. Again?

779
00:55:15,177 --> 00:55:16,223
-Zero.
-Zero.

780
00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:17,884
-Seven.
-Bang!

781
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:21,267
-Zero, zero, seven.
-Bang!

782
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:22,898
-Get over here.
-Get down.

783
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:24,398
-Drum roll!
-Drum roll!

784
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:25,928
Drink!

785
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:28,119
-Drink!
-It's here.

786
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,128
-The food's here.
-Just a minute.

787
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:34,755
We have a coupon for a free...

788
00:55:34,846 --> 00:55:36,159
Dongman.

789
00:55:42,824 --> 00:55:44,067
Dongman.

790
00:55:51,653 --> 00:55:53,059
Why are we hiding?

791
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:55,656
Then what? You want to walk out? Now?

792
00:55:56,695 --> 00:55:57,885
Freak.

793
00:55:58,844 --> 00:56:00,210
Did you just curse right now?

794
00:56:00,992 --> 00:56:02,069
Did I?

795
00:56:06,573 --> 00:56:09,485
Hyeran was like poison to Dongman,

796
00:56:10,623 --> 00:56:14,453
and we wanted to feed her poison.

797
00:56:16,889 --> 00:56:19,730
Put it back on.
Why are you taking off your vest?

798
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:24,270
I'll go for today. Answer my calls, okay?

799
00:56:25,565 --> 00:56:27,508
Why can't he speak?

800
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,114
He must be stunned.

801
00:56:30,205 --> 00:56:31,800
What is this so early in the morning?

802
00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:34,808
I'll see you all again.

803
00:56:38,071 --> 00:56:39,209
Hey, you.

804
00:56:41,354 --> 00:56:42,936
Dongman may be a moron,

805
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:45,958
but you know I've got his back,
and I'm tough.

806
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:48,093
Me too.

807
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:56,347
Look. Please keep your nose out of it.

808
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,339
I'll always keep my nose "in" it,

809
00:56:59,734 --> 00:57:02,238
so take me down first
if you want to get to him.

810
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,228
Take me down too.

811
00:57:04,693 --> 00:57:08,076
You'll have to shoot me first.

812
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:11,716
Aera. Good luck.

813
00:57:12,657 --> 00:57:14,059
Try your very best.

814
00:57:17,751 --> 00:57:18,858
See you.

815
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:39,285
Friends Dictionary Vocabulary 2

816
00:57:44,098 --> 00:57:45,113
Night.

817
00:57:52,982 --> 00:57:54,173
Do you want

818
00:57:56,332 --> 00:57:57,358
to come over for some ramyeon?

819
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:03,174
"Do you want to come over
for some ramyeon?" means...

820
00:58:03,661 --> 00:58:04,723
What?

821
00:58:06,752 --> 00:58:07,742
Sure.

822
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:12,397
What was that?

823
00:58:13,045 --> 00:58:15,570
-Come on. How could you die there?
-Who?

824
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:17,592
-Go get some rice.
-You get it.

825
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:19,484
-You get it.
-You get it.

826
00:58:19,733 --> 00:58:20,875
It means just to eat ramyeon.

827
00:58:21,075 --> 00:58:23,077
Fine. I'll get it.

828
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:24,136
Hurry.

829
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:27,296
Yes! That was awesome!

830
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:56,177
Fight For My Way

831
00:58:56,268 --> 00:58:57,431
Dongman.

832
00:58:57,522 --> 00:58:59,148
-Let's have him debut tomorrow.
-What?

833
00:58:59,322 --> 00:59:02,378
-This is the last match.
-No.

834
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:03,881
Trust me.

835
00:59:03,972 --> 00:59:05,504
I said no.

836
00:59:05,595 --> 00:59:07,190
Why not? Even local kids compete.

837
00:59:07,281 --> 00:59:10,341
Your coach said no, so no!

838
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,991
Dongman. I know why you're doing this...

839
00:59:14,082 --> 00:59:15,276
...with your head full of hot air.

840
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:18,467
You talked him into it, didn't you?

841
00:59:18,571 --> 00:59:19,485
I did not.

842
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:21,163
Train your workers properly.

843
00:59:21,254 --> 00:59:23,792
With the amount of money I spend,
I have the right...

844
00:59:23,883 --> 00:59:26,005
...to make her kneel at my feet.

845
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:28,525
-She quits as of today.
-Hey.

846
00:59:28,616 --> 00:59:31,920
You have no right to make her do that.
