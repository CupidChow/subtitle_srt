1
00:00:03,206 --> 00:00:04,546
I won't lose you again.

2
00:00:07,276 --> 00:00:09,061
Let's stop taking detours.

3
00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:15,806
Stand strong.

4
00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:20,446
We've already kissed,

5
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:23,476
and I don't know how to do flings.

6
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:26,476
We kissed, so it's official.

7
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:31,276
Let's date.

8
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:37,006
Let's date.

9
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:41,649
I said let's date.

10
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:50,006
Since we're dating now...

11
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:55,732
I'll do it again.

12
00:00:57,546 --> 00:00:58,546
What?

13
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:01,106
I want to do it again.

14
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:25,701
The government should
make fireworks illegal.

15
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:29,112
They'll burn up the beach and
get burns on their hands

16
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:32,503
just to impress girls for no reason.

17
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:36,876
Why would the beach burn?

18
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:41,500
Anyway, why are you always so extreme,

19
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,994
impulsive, vulgar, and...

20
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:47,215
Manly, like that?

21
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:49,890
It wasn't impulsive.

22
00:01:51,476 --> 00:01:53,779
It's been a while since I
could only see your lips.

23
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:55,776
Gosh.

24
00:01:57,746 --> 00:01:59,804
Then are we really dating starting today?

25
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:04,912
It's illegal, violent, and
mean to kiss a friend.

26
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:07,661
So, we have to date.

27
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:10,746
So, you

28
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,315
better not think about
dating someone else.

29
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:17,029
Even when you ride a bus,
don't sit next to a guy.

30
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:21,499
Even on the bus?

31
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:24,619
Just don't think of anyone else.

32
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:28,282
Especially not your first love.

33
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:31,002
Also, don't think about the wrist guy.

34
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:34,154
Think of only me.

35
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,339
My first love and the wrist guy

36
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:42,852
are both you.

37
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:46,837
What? What did you say?

38
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,256
I mean, my first love,
the very clueless guy.

39
00:02:51,346 --> 00:02:54,234
The one that has been
bothering me for 20 years.

40
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,476
That's you.

41
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,627
You are

42
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:09,153
like this inflammatory acne to me.

43
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,997
It suddenly shows up, then it disappears.

44
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,772
Sometime it hurts, sometime it doesn't.

45
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:17,616
It'll die down if I leave it,

46
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:19,507
but it hurts so much when I pop it.

47
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:23,092
That's how it's been like for 20 years.

48
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:29,175
That was me?

49
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:32,730
I thought

50
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:35,478
you would kidnap the man
you like or something.

51
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:40,376
That's why,

52
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:45,381
you shouldn't stay as my friend anymore.

53
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:51,513
I won't be able to live if
we go back to being friends.

54
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:53,857
Not after we kissed.

55
00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:57,306
I really...

56
00:03:58,193 --> 00:04:00,526
I really like you.

57
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:03,706
Fool.

58
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,662
Why didn't you just try kissing me?

59
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:10,316
Then I would've fallen for you right away.

60
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:13,679
Did you like it?

61
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:18,276
Do you want to

62
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:20,946
try it one more time?

63
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:55,997
Can you shoot those
fireworks towards someone?

64
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:59,887
I told you I had a feeling
this one would work.

65
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,491
EPISODE 11

66
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,486
Do people still hand out
rice cakes to new neighbors?

67
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:19,263
These stuff won't fit in a studio.
Don't you think so?

68
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:20,676
I think it's a girl.

69
00:05:21,282 --> 00:05:22,592
Do you think she'll be pretty?

70
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:33,353
Where are you going?

71
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:36,586
To take out the trash.

72
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:39,056
Why are you wearing that
just to take out trash?

73
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:40,104
What?

74
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:42,116
This is what I wear to take out trash.

75
00:05:42,206 --> 00:05:43,476
Did something

76
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:47,507
happen in Daecheon?

77
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:51,956
Did you and Dongman...

78
00:05:52,046 --> 00:05:53,635
We didn't do it.

79
00:05:55,506 --> 00:05:56,452
Did what?

80
00:05:57,392 --> 00:05:58,638
Didn't do what?

81
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:16,831
Aera, were you wringing laundry?

82
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:20,887
Hey, why are you showing off your stomach?

83
00:06:20,977 --> 00:06:23,316
Are you trying to show
the world or something?

84
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:26,570
She told me she was dressed
to take out trash.

85
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:29,163
Get going.

86
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:30,760
Aren't you going to work?

87
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:33,680
Are you two staying
together all day again?

88
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,286
Yeah, we won't be bored
since we're both jobless.

89
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:39,593
Let's have plum wine after I get off work.

90
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:40,615
Okay.

91
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:42,451
Bye.

92
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:44,246
By the way, you two...

93
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:45,450
What?

94
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:47,495
You better not do it.

95
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:52,985
Do what?

96
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:56,729
I mean, the wine. Don't open the wine.

97
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:58,146
You better not.

98
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:05,714
-Room 101.
-My goodness!

99
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,123
-You didn't get rice cakes, right?
-Pardon me?

100
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:11,318
I noticed that the new
tenant didn't give you any.

101
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:13,418
Just you.

102
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:15,108
She left you out.

103
00:07:15,198 --> 00:07:16,325
What is it?

104
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:17,963
Why did she leave me out?

105
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:20,546
-That's kind of annoying.
-I heard she's famous.

106
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:24,345
The mover even got her autograph.

107
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:26,506
Maybe she's a celebrity.

108
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:29,705
I heard that she's a very famous

109
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,242
announcer in Korea.

110
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:48,007
You...

111
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:51,521
Why did you move into the
place above Dongman?

112
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,759
You're allowed to live across from him,

113
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,670
but I can't live above him?

114
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:57,177
But I...

115
00:07:57,468 --> 00:08:00,506
I read online that you got
a huge alimony settlement.

116
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,836
So why did you move into
a cheap place like this?

117
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:05,764
I want to see Dongman-oppa every day,

118
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:06,931
just like you do.

119
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:10,497
We're dating.

120
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:12,684
We decided to make it official.

121
00:08:13,613 --> 00:08:14,613
I know.

122
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:16,682
That's better.

123
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,573
Now you've finally

124
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:22,501
lost that horrible female friend.

125
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:26,992
I'll take on that role now.

126
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,593
I'll be your friend.

127
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:32,571
I want you to experience

128
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:35,381
how annoying could that be.

129
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,623
I am his girlfriend and also his friend.

130
00:08:39,713 --> 00:08:40,772
Of course not.

131
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,226
Once you break up,
you'll be nothing to him.

132
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:45,541
Now, you can't even be his friend anymore.

133
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:47,852
What do you know?

134
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:49,846
It's all or nothing now.

135
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:51,886
There's no turning back.

136
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:53,646
Didn't you know that?

137
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,266
That's a nonsense.

138
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,684
What does she mean, "all or nothing"?

139
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,583
Hey.

140
00:09:44,656 --> 00:09:46,767
Change your clothes. Let's go out.

141
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,139
I have to get weighed in.

142
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:51,296
Go with me.

143
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,719
Afterward,

144
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:56,005
we can go on a date or anything.

145
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:02,249
Why aren't you talking?

146
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:05,524
Why are you acting like a
girly girl all of a sudden?

147
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:08,215
I'm not acting like a girly girl.

148
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:12,489
You're not sexy or innocent-looking.

149
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,476
If you don't even talk,

150
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:19,018
I don't know why I'd want to date you.

151
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,385
Your thing is to be funny and...

152
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:27,619
Of course,

153
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:30,744
when it comes to being cute,

154
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:32,589
you're above the average.

155
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:37,714
My heart flutters.

156
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:44,410
Chung Kimchi

157
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:46,804
won't do the second show.

158
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,399
However, we sold out the first time.
Can't you talk to her once more?

159
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:52,920
Talk about what?

160
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:55,102
The owner changed her mind.

161
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,920
Why would she want to help the guy

162
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,949
who rejected her daughter?

163
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:03,741
Do you even know Yejin is taking time off?

164
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:07,797
By the way,

165
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:10,527
why do you keep talking here?

166
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:11,999
What?

167
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:16,600
I mean, why are you talking here
like a courier instead of coming in?

168
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,576
Well...

169
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:21,583
I don't think I should go in anymore.

170
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,545
Why not?

171
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:25,065
Because we are

172
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:30,384
nothing but a young, energetic,
impulsive, and immature creature.

173
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:33,433
Because improper things
happen in an instant.

174
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,229
He's being so old-school.

175
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,349
What?

176
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:38,959
Nothing.

177
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:41,135
Anyway, I'll wait here.

178
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:42,671
So, go change.

179
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,139
Actually,

180
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,050
I think it'll take me
about an hour and half.

181
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,761
What? An hour and half?

182
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:54,064
Why?

183
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:56,173
-Do you need to scrub?
-What?

184
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:59,182
You can just change quickly.

185
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:00,997
It's our first date!

186
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:04,066
How are you so clueless about girls?

187
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,508
Girls?

188
00:12:06,598 --> 00:12:07,477
Sheesh!

189
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:08,839
Sheesh?

190
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:15,370
Why is this punk acting that way?

191
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,577
What?

192
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:33,454
Am I blindingly pretty?

193
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:40,454
GIRLY GIRL

194
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:46,807
Hey, go back.

195
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,800
Go back in and change.

196
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,636
Why? Do I look weird?

197
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:53,378
Your legs...

198
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,362
Do they look thick?

199
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:57,458
Why do you have such nice legs?

200
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,556
-What?
-Your legs look like a girl's legs.

201
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:04,653
Did you really think I was a guy?

202
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:05,659
Hey!

203
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:10,492
I may do roundhouse kick to
any guys looking at your legs,

204
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,276
so change into pants.

205
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:15,479
How dare you

206
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,074
tell me what to do?

207
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:28,438
You used to carry my schoolbag.
Don't order me around.

208
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:33,376
I don't care about that.
Just hurry up and change into pants.

209
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,555
You punk.

210
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:47,469
Put on pants!

211
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:50,089
Seriously...

212
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:51,730
Her legs are...

213
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:54,253
I can't believe it.

214
00:13:55,521 --> 00:13:57,644
Those legs would cause a traffic accident.

215
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,535
He hit a line drive to the second baseman.

216
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:08,792
Choo Shinsoo went 2-for-3 in the game,

217
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:12,125
and raised his batting average to 257.

218
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:17,149
You'll keep watching baseball?

219
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,119
Huh?

220
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:20,318
What?

221
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:23,586
I mean, do you really want to
just watch Choo Shinsoo...

222
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:27,014
when your girlfriend is
sitting in front of you?

223
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,016
Why?

224
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:30,846
What do you mean, "Why?"

225
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:32,442
Aren't we going to talk?

226
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:35,032
Are we going to just eat?

227
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:43,561
How can we just stare at
each other after six years?

228
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:45,825
We get comfortable and dull over time.

229
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:47,646
Are you getting dull now?

230
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:50,895
Can you not argue over semantics?

231
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm tired too.

232
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:55,346
You're tired?

233
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:58,145
What are you tired from?

234
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:01,596
We don't go on dates or even talk.

235
00:15:01,686 --> 00:15:04,548
You don't kiss me much anymore,
and we don't even do it.

236
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:05,638
Hey...

237
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:09,302
You don't do anything with me,
so what are you tired of?

238
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:14,666
What I'm tired of is

239
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:18,186
that I feel like I'm the bad
guy whenever I'm with you.

240
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:24,076
You don't get tired, nice, giving,
and overflowing with love.

241
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:27,542
So, I'm always the bad guy.

242
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:28,950
Just me.

243
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:32,106
Seolhui.

244
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,354
What's the problem again?

245
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:37,980
What do you mean, "again"?

246
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:41,489
Did I ask too much from you?

247
00:15:41,838 --> 00:15:44,144
I don't want anything from you.

248
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:45,576
I just...

249
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:48,086
I just want to be like how we used to be.

250
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:49,878
Is it that difficult not to change?

251
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:52,393
How could a person stay
the same for six years?

252
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:53,560
I have.

253
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,760
You still make my heart skip a beat.

254
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,191
I feel sorry for you and
like you more than before.

255
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:02,369
Above that, I just want to
do everything with you.

256
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:06,153
-I'm sorry.
-You sighed again.

257
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:10,276
I'm always whining and
you're always sighing.

258
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,160
Is this

259
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,842
just a stage of ennui,

260
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:18,942
or a process of breaking up?

261
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,749
What?

262
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:24,305
I feel lonelier lately when I'm with you.

263
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:36,169
Just a minute.

264
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,121
Huh?

265
00:16:39,326 --> 00:16:40,688
My hand's sweaty.

266
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,455
By the way,

267
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:07,998
will you tell them?

268
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:11,243
Juman will tease the life out of me.

269
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,316
Let's keep it a secret for now.
I think Seolhui will say something too.

270
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:15,262
Why?

271
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:17,856
I don't know. She always said thing like,

272
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:19,916
"Don't fight then start dating."

273
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,436
"You can get married, but don't date."

274
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:25,236
So...

275
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:27,928
Did you just

276
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:30,183
propose to me?

277
00:17:32,493 --> 00:17:34,826
Do you wish it were a proposal?

278
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:45,046
THE WAY OF MARTIAL ARTS

279
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,789
What would you do if I put you in a hold?

280
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:48,979
Get out of it, of course.

281
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:53,033
Wait.

282
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:54,827
What did I tell you to do?

283
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,669
You idiot.

284
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:04,119
I've told you not to tap out.
Why did you do that?

285
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,755
Because it hurts.

286
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:06,762
What?

287
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,389
Why are you so honest?

288
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,975
No one's impervious to pain.

289
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:13,451
Others don't tap out even
when they fracture bones.

290
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,792
-Why do you always...
-They're the idiots.

291
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:17,528
Why not tap out if they're in pain?

292
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:18,459
Dongman!

293
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,625
If you're in pain, tap out immediately.

294
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:22,891
Why did you twist his arm?

295
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:24,686
What a weird person!

296
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:30,943
Hey! Are you really going
to let her tag along?

297
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:32,923
I can't train with you.

298
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:34,425
When will Dooho get here?

299
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:36,060
Can't you train without him?

300
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,856
Why are you yelling at him?

301
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,877
Kim Taksu!

302
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,908
That scumbag!

303
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,502
Gosh!

304
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:54,555
Face your opponent and pose.

305
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:08,826
This is so dramatic.

306
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:23,360
Han Dooho.

307
00:19:30,976 --> 00:19:31,956
What's going on?

308
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,952
Athletes switch teams all the time.

309
00:19:36,246 --> 00:19:38,507
A better contract, a brighter future.

310
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:41,195
I need to go where I can grow.

311
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:43,498
Did you tell our coach?

312
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,795
The Tigers...

313
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:49,262
are on a different level entirely.

314
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:52,269
They have an organized system...

315
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,676
Did you tell our coach?

316
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:54,942
The PR

317
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:58,263
is also, really...

318
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:11,972
A timid dog usually barks loudly.

319
00:20:12,062 --> 00:20:13,062
What?

320
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:16,579
Keep up the dirty tricks.

321
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:19,600
That will only make
Dongman more determined.

322
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:23,690
I think you're the one
who's more talkative.

323
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,250
Taksu.

324
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,956
The people know better.

325
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:31,042
About what?

326
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,744
What stinks is never good.

327
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,148
Let's not get on each
other's nerves, okay?

328
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:47,937
Don't make it too easy.

329
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:50,940
The worse you are,

330
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,173
the less fun it gets to crush you.

331
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:00,784
What a joke.

332
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:06,215
Coach.

333
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,644
I'm really sorry.

334
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:14,413
-Coach Choi.
-Yes?

335
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:15,829
Dooho...

336
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,604
His kid is 3 years old

337
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:20,931
and he's only 26.

338
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:22,554
Pardon me?

339
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,613
I'm saying that he's still a kid himself.

340
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,865
He's trying to make a living.

341
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:31,523
Don't use him and train him well.

342
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:34,265
I will.

343
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,632
It's such an embarrassment.

344
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:48,352
I wouldn't have joined if it were just me.

345
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:50,877
But my daughter

346
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:55,041
has a severe atopic dermatitis and
she scratches until she bleeds.

347
00:21:56,593 --> 00:21:59,146
We needed to move, but couldn't afford to.

348
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:06,063
I didn't say anything.

349
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:09,571
Fighters don't cry.

350
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:13,006
Coach will slap you on the back.

351
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,113
I know they're trying to mess with you

352
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:20,638
and force Coach to close down his gym.

353
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:27,013
Take care of Coach.

354
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:31,577
How dare you two opponents
talk to each other!

355
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:41,606
Han Dooho.

356
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:43,534
Yes?

357
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:46,106
Come over for sundae whenever you want.

358
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,562
You two can go ahead and eat without me.

359
00:23:07,646 --> 00:23:10,910
I was going to treat you to
beef after the weigh-in...

360
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,400
at a famous restaurant
nearby that was on TV.

361
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:16,103
You two can go ahead.

362
00:23:17,446 --> 00:23:18,486
Are you upset?

363
00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:20,672
You said you're a fighter.

364
00:23:21,787 --> 00:23:23,423
What are you talking about?

365
00:23:23,513 --> 00:23:25,337
That's the tone of someone who upsets.

366
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:26,966
Forget it.

367
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:30,386
You two can go ahead and
have dinner without me.

368
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:32,116
We're dating.

369
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:34,809
What?

370
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:37,186
We're dating.

371
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:39,554
Why? What for?

372
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:41,209
What do you mean, "why"?

373
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,614
Let us spend some time together.

374
00:23:43,903 --> 00:23:46,553
This is our first date.

375
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:52,246
Is there something you
can't tell me about?

376
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:56,999
Do you think I got her
pregnant or something?

377
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:58,511
No, not that.

378
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:01,582
Like, do you owe her a
tremendous amount of money?

379
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:04,727
I knew that we'd never get along.

380
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:14,117
How come...

381
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,170
Why do you keep cuddling like a puppy?

382
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,106
I'm hungry.

383
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,715
Your cooking looked more
like dog food before.

384
00:24:50,082 --> 00:24:52,694
This isn't just an improvement,

385
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:55,439
but a whole new experience.

386
00:24:57,113 --> 00:24:58,684
Shut your mouth and eat.

387
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:06,605
Food's ready.

388
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,237
Is that dog food or what?

389
00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:15,003
Eat what you're given.

390
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:30,486
Why are you down there?
There's lots of space up here.

391
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,134
Don't try anything funny.

392
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,427
What?

393
00:25:35,804 --> 00:25:38,534
Do you think I'm that forward?

394
00:25:40,913 --> 00:25:42,373
Why do you want me to lie down?

395
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:44,093
I never said, "lie down".

396
00:25:44,183 --> 00:25:46,049
I told you to sit here. Sit down.

397
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:48,679
Doesn't sitting lead to lying down?

398
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,818
That's what I call funny business.

399
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:53,479
It's not like it'll work on you.

400
00:25:53,772 --> 00:25:56,556
You're like the female
equivalent of Fedor.

401
00:25:56,646 --> 00:26:00,381
If you really attack me,
I could sustain a fatal wound.

402
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:02,423
Besides, we started dating just yesterday.

403
00:26:02,513 --> 00:26:05,229
Would I want to get busy with you today?

404
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,976
Do you take me as a player?

405
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,010
I wasn't even thinking about it.

406
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,837
You're so thoughtless.

407
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:13,420
What?

408
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:17,873
We've been dating for just a day,

409
00:26:17,963 --> 00:26:19,993
but we've been friends for years.

410
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:23,533
We've been innocent friends
for over 20 years.

411
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:26,410
What?

412
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:27,919
How can you do that?

413
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:30,749
Do we have to be that rigid?

414
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:34,139
It's just upsetting

415
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:37,506
when you keep referring me to
someone like Fedor or Bigfoot.

416
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:39,221
I wonder if

417
00:26:39,624 --> 00:26:43,450
our relationship needs a turning point.

418
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:59,343
We took an incredibly long detour

419
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,049
to kiss each other after 23 years.

420
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:05,066
Shouldn't we speed up our pace

421
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,785
to make up for the delayed start?

422
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:15,676
You're so...

423
00:27:17,162 --> 00:27:18,492
Forward...

424
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:22,286
Do I...

425
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,356
Have to keep talking?

426
00:28:03,776 --> 00:28:05,507
Do you have some alcohol left, Dongman?

427
00:28:08,306 --> 00:28:10,126
I told you to change your passcode.

428
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:14,017
This is not a community
center or anything.

429
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,006
Hey, don't you guys

430
00:28:22,053 --> 00:28:24,083
want some shrimp with Chinese liquor?

431
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:30,346
I'd rather slap you punk across the face.

432
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,678
Nice. This is great!

433
00:28:43,246 --> 00:28:45,258
Are you sure you can skip work today?

434
00:28:45,698 --> 00:28:49,626
Why would I work if I couldn't take
a day off on my best friend's debut match?

435
00:28:49,716 --> 00:28:52,375
I raised you since we were six.

436
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:54,714
-Of course I have to go.
-Thank you.

437
00:28:55,146 --> 00:28:56,865
Should we get some anxiety
pills on the way?

438
00:28:56,955 --> 00:28:58,556
I can't fight with medicine in me.

439
00:28:58,646 --> 00:29:00,154
No, it's for me.

440
00:29:01,763 --> 00:29:02,635
In two, three.

441
00:29:02,726 --> 00:29:04,141
Hello.

442
00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:06,556
Are you guys going somewhere?

443
00:29:06,646 --> 00:29:08,936
Yes, I have something coming up.

444
00:29:09,026 --> 00:29:11,233
-See you later.
-Okay.

445
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,649
-House 102.
-Yes?

446
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:20,506
-About the rent...
-No...

447
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:24,442
Good luck.

448
00:29:28,106 --> 00:29:29,513
What did she just say?

449
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:32,304
I think she just cursed at you.

450
00:29:32,946 --> 00:29:34,101
High kick?

451
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:39,116
DONGCHUN GYMNASIUM

452
00:29:39,206 --> 00:29:40,776
My gosh.

453
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:45,347
Dongman, you have to trip
them and attack right away.

454
00:29:45,776 --> 00:29:48,344
But you can't fall because
ground skills are not good.

455
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:51,182
Try to knock him out in
the beginning with your kicks.

456
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:54,186
Taekwondo fighters usually
have bad ground skills.

457
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:57,648
Your kicks. Hey, what are you doing here?

458
00:29:57,738 --> 00:30:00,176
I used to be his manager.

459
00:30:00,786 --> 00:30:03,948
Can't you give me a t-shirt as well,
Mr Hwang Jangho?

460
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,868
-Anyway, remember your kicks.
-Give them a blow.

461
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:09,486
I got it.

462
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:12,756
Third match, super fight in
the welterweight division.

463
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:14,846
Let me introduce the fighters.

464
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:18,189
-Blue corner, height 183 cm...
-Let's sit here.

465
00:30:18,564 --> 00:30:20,552
Weight, 76 kg.

466
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,519
Why do guys like this?

467
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:26,300
I don't understand.

468
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,316
He's returned to the cage.

469
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:32,556
The Insane Horse,
the wonder boy of battle,

470
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:36,690
Park Jungsik!

471
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:40,805
Following...

472
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,106
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

473
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,025
How do you apply for that position?

474
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:51,268
-Apply for what?
-That.

475
00:30:51,358 --> 00:30:57,109
Killer fighter, Hong Suhwan!

476
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:07,116
Please give a round of
applause to Park Jungsik

477
00:31:07,206 --> 00:31:09,206
for showing us a great match.

478
00:31:30,176 --> 00:31:35,831
Ko Dongman!

479
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:43,112
Ko...

480
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:45,230
What is it? Why are you calling me?

481
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,757
You scared me!

482
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,893
Do you miss me in places like this too?

483
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:54,409
That's not it.

484
00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:01,292
What is she going to do now?

485
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:05,393
Ko...

486
00:32:05,483 --> 00:32:07,276
I've heard that from somewhere before.

487
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,924
Gosh, what was he doing there in silence?

488
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,699
I'm so embarrassed.

489
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:31,222
Hyung, I don't really
like triangle kimbap.

490
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:32,486
It sets an image.

491
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,367
It's touching to say that
you only had kimbap.

492
00:32:35,457 --> 00:32:38,555
-Hungry fighter.
-I don't need to be hungry.

493
00:32:38,946 --> 00:32:41,386
-You're trying to sell a story...
-Just eat it then.

494
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:42,746
Consider this as acting.

495
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:46,566
Once you air this, my mom
and dad will watch it.

496
00:32:46,656 --> 00:32:48,587
-That's a bit...
-Gosh.

497
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:50,359
Just eat that.

498
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:52,999
Hyung,

499
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:56,356
I don't think I understood
what this is about.

500
00:32:56,446 --> 00:32:57,316
It's somehow...

501
00:32:57,406 --> 00:32:58,821
Don't you want to become known?

502
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:02,942
Don't you know how to be a good son?
Are you clueless?

503
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:09,828
I guess you're here to support Dongman.

504
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:11,648
-Oppa.
-Huh?

505
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:14,165
He's going out with me.

506
00:33:14,664 --> 00:33:16,102
Okay. What?

507
00:33:16,585 --> 00:33:19,868
I'm his official supporter now.

508
00:33:21,106 --> 00:33:23,828
How did that happen all of a sudden?

509
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:25,876
Congratulations.

510
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,282
Have you heard of this before?

511
00:33:29,858 --> 00:33:33,705
Black puppies didn't bite,
but if you mess with them,

512
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,256
white puppies will bite you.

513
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:38,746
If you mess with him, I'll bite you.

514
00:33:39,576 --> 00:33:40,821
Don't film this.

515
00:33:42,012 --> 00:33:45,286
Aera, I already discussed
it with him and...

516
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:48,876
I've clearly told you. Don't do this.

517
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,076
I'm leaving.

518
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:04,272
Why can't she hold back herself?
She's so strong.

519
00:34:21,776 --> 00:34:23,616
RECRUITING CAGE ANNOUNCERS

520
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:24,650
Hey...

521
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,344
Do you really want to yell
like this as an announcer?

522
00:34:29,506 --> 00:34:31,676
It's not about that.

523
00:34:32,146 --> 00:34:35,026
Isn't it so cool to hold a mic
in the middle of the cage?

524
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:38,156
-Is it?
-It makes my heart beat faster.

525
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,886
Don't men usually do jobs like that?

526
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:44,159
Do you have to be a man
to be an announcer?

527
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,886
However, only men do it.

528
00:34:45,976 --> 00:34:47,686
That's why I want to do it so much.

529
00:34:47,776 --> 00:34:49,324
-What?
-First woman.

530
00:34:49,414 --> 00:34:51,416
The only woman, the best woman.

531
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,536
Don't those sound great?

532
00:34:57,276 --> 00:34:59,676
Don't go easy on Taksu,

533
00:34:59,976 --> 00:35:01,906
but let's be understanding of Dooho.

534
00:35:02,146 --> 00:35:04,946
I understand him.
I just feel bad if I beat him.

535
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:06,406
Goodness.

536
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:08,086
Are you sure you're going to beat him?

537
00:35:08,176 --> 00:35:10,158
Dooho is better than Byungju.

538
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:14,786
Hey, what's that?
Are you going for a hike?

539
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:16,560
Look at what you have there.

540
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,512
Be quiet. They have three coaches.

541
00:35:18,602 --> 00:35:20,653
I need to give you some support.

542
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:24,369
Hey, is this called a support?
Why didn't you just write my sundae stall?

543
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:26,782
Focus and trip them with your kick.

544
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:28,300
Once he falls, attack right away.

545
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,568
I'm going.

546
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:32,421
I'm getting nervous.

547
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:52,808
It's his debut match that is being aired,

548
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:55,329
but he's already hot within the cage.

549
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,846
That's why his debut match
was scheduled so soon.

550
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,673
Seolhui, I'm going to the bathroom.

551
00:36:09,763 --> 00:36:11,906
What? The game is about to start.

552
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,776
I have a slight stomachache.

553
00:36:35,746 --> 00:36:36,776
Okay.

554
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:40,893
Ready. Fight.

555
00:36:55,494 --> 00:36:58,680
That's a great kick by Ko Dongman.

556
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:03,505
Didn't Taksu first do
that kick or is it him?

557
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,512
Stop.

558
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,200
Due to Ko Dongman's attack,

559
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,990
Han Dooho got a cut.

560
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,646
We'll quickly have a body check.

561
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:24,676
Blue corner.

562
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:35,133
Coach.

563
00:37:35,772 --> 00:37:37,529
I think he's badly injured.

564
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:41,135
Why are you worried about his injury?
You're in the middle of a match!

565
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:55,133
Okay.

566
00:37:55,846 --> 00:37:56,846
Okay.

567
00:37:57,273 --> 00:37:58,273
Fight!

568
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:07,656
Who is getting hit?

569
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:35,384
Now! Go now!

570
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,399
He's letting a golden opportunity slip.

571
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,689
He shouldn't just wait like that.

572
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:50,945
-What's wrong with you?
-Hit him.

573
00:38:51,035 --> 00:38:52,816
-Yes, hit him!
-Hurry up.

574
00:38:52,906 --> 00:38:55,426
-Go for it!
-What are you doing?

575
00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:56,517
What?

576
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,100
Why isn't he pounding the opponent?

577
00:39:03,777 --> 00:39:05,281
What are you doing?

578
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:08,986
-Go get him.
-Come on!

579
00:39:09,076 --> 00:39:10,646
What are you doing?

580
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:19,536
Go in!

581
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
Go in!

582
00:39:36,252 --> 00:39:37,252
Stop.

583
00:39:48,976 --> 00:39:52,207
We'll now announce the official judgment

584
00:39:52,297 --> 00:39:54,995
of today's third match.

585
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:58,693
All judges unanimously
agree it's three to zero.

586
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:03,223
The winner is blue corner,
Taekwon Boy, Ko Dongman!

587
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:04,354
Winner.

588
00:40:16,537 --> 00:40:17,537
Are you okay?

589
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,000
Why would you go easy on me?

590
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:25,665
It's better to get knocked out.

591
00:40:39,162 --> 00:40:40,507
MEXX WORLD CHICKEN

592
00:40:40,597 --> 00:40:44,446
What's the point of winning
if you get this kind of nickname?

593
00:40:44,893 --> 00:40:46,033
"Octagon Waiter"?

594
00:40:46,607 --> 00:40:50,069
People think he's nice to wait for
his opponent when they tripped down.

595
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:54,005
This looks bad on you.
What kind of nickname is this?

596
00:40:54,095 --> 00:40:57,336
If you can't hit the person on the ground,
why are you in martial arts?

597
00:40:57,426 --> 00:40:58,826
What do you know?

598
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:02,409
This is different from
when I was in taekwondo.

599
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:05,452
You can feel the person's bone and skin.

600
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,881
This fighter's too soft to hit anyone.

601
00:41:07,971 --> 00:41:10,048
I can understand Dongman.

602
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:14,392
Hey, it's not good to be nice
when you're on the ring.

603
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:16,324
Being strong is the best.

604
00:41:16,786 --> 00:41:19,017
If you're going to keep
this up, just quit.

605
00:41:19,107 --> 00:41:21,052
I won't quit. I'm going to continue.

606
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,466
I'll just need to get KOs.
I won't let it get messy like today.

607
00:41:24,556 --> 00:41:27,182
I'll get a KO right off the bat.

608
00:41:27,272 --> 00:41:30,189
Do you think a KO is that easy?

609
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,913
No one's perfect from the beginning.

610
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:33,141
Life is not a movie.

611
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:34,712
Not all fighters are Rocky.

612
00:41:34,802 --> 00:41:36,532
His character is fictional.

613
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:38,087
You can overcome your faults.

614
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:40,011
What did you say?

615
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:41,769
You little...

616
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:44,693
Water, please.

617
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:48,898
Why is a coach with an
excellent steed so anxious?

618
00:41:48,988 --> 00:41:50,852
What? An excellent steed?

619
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:53,505
Being legendary is his style.

620
00:41:54,032 --> 00:41:57,413
Who would have imagined he'd become
a member of the national team?

621
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,200
Just sit back and watch.

622
00:41:59,813 --> 00:42:03,023
Also, stop hitting his head.

623
00:42:06,986 --> 00:42:08,486
You should check on him

624
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:12,233
to see if he's making a
living and eating well.

625
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:15,272
If you're that worried,

626
00:42:15,706 --> 00:42:18,019
why don't you ever call him?

627
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:19,509
What would I say on the phone?

628
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:21,539
What could I talk with him about?

629
00:42:21,629 --> 00:42:24,751
You don't need a topic
to talk between family.

630
00:42:25,192 --> 00:42:28,327
Tell him you got a new job.

631
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:31,135
You should tell him about
your business trip, too.

632
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:32,951
You should tell him.

633
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:34,071
My goodness.

634
00:42:34,462 --> 00:42:36,292
Like father, like son.

635
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,836
Then how about a call

636
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:46,741
before bed?

637
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:50,996
We live just across from each other.
Why call?

638
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:52,346
That's true.

639
00:42:53,669 --> 00:42:54,840
Then I'll come over...

640
00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:56,941
to eat breakfast tomorrow.

641
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,399
Then I better wash my hair every morning.

642
00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:03,749
You're supposed to do that anyway, idiot.

643
00:43:07,922 --> 00:43:09,892
Then I'm going to press this now.

644
00:43:10,784 --> 00:43:11,695
Yeah...

645
00:43:12,408 --> 00:43:13,980
Well, me too.

646
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:19,223
Hey...

647
00:43:20,636 --> 00:43:22,331
Shall I just go over to your place?

648
00:43:22,729 --> 00:43:23,656
What?

649
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,215
Well, we can watch TV together...

650
00:43:26,305 --> 00:43:27,905
and eat something.

651
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:31,986
Eat, what?

652
00:43:34,209 --> 00:43:36,531
Something like ramyeon?

653
00:43:37,806 --> 00:43:38,806
Ramyeon?

654
00:43:42,641 --> 00:43:44,318
No sleeping together before marriage.

655
00:43:44,408 --> 00:43:46,229
Also, I'll add no ramyeon at night.

656
00:43:48,303 --> 00:43:49,333
Why not?

657
00:43:50,352 --> 00:43:51,200
What?

658
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:53,499
Why do you tell us not to eat ramyeon...

659
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:57,116
and not to sleep together before marriage?

660
00:43:57,452 --> 00:43:59,742
That's an abuse of authority.

661
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,921
You two...

662
00:44:01,176 --> 00:44:04,366
I gave you discount on maintenance fee
and pest control come in, too.

663
00:44:04,566 --> 00:44:06,341
I never increased your rent either.

664
00:44:06,431 --> 00:44:09,617
We agree that you treat us well, but...

665
00:44:09,707 --> 00:44:11,464
Then why can't you follow my rules?

666
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,537
Are you animals?

667
00:44:15,563 --> 00:44:18,229
Why are you all dying to date?

668
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:19,405
All of my tenants

669
00:44:20,212 --> 00:44:21,506
are blinded by love.

670
00:44:22,386 --> 00:44:24,187
I think she's jealous.

671
00:44:24,277 --> 00:44:25,198
If you're unhappy,

672
00:44:25,601 --> 00:44:29,242
move to a place where you can
sleep together but pay more rent.

673
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:34,733
Stop putting me on pins and needles.

674
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:36,346
She's hysteric.

675
00:44:37,979 --> 00:44:40,509
Is it me or this neighborhood?

676
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:43,589
NATIONAL ATHLETE'S SUNDAE

677
00:44:45,872 --> 00:44:47,312
Hurry up and open.

678
00:44:48,893 --> 00:44:51,393
Are you rich?
Is this how you do business?

679
00:44:54,286 --> 00:44:55,535
How did you know...

680
00:44:56,136 --> 00:44:58,611
I was running a food truck here?

681
00:44:58,701 --> 00:44:59,771
I didn't know.

682
00:45:00,346 --> 00:45:02,233
I saw you on my way to
get a bottle of soju.

683
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:05,166
I see.

684
00:45:05,976 --> 00:45:07,476
Give me a bottle of soju.

685
00:45:08,296 --> 00:45:09,194
Pardon?

686
00:45:10,003 --> 00:45:12,261
You must have one hidden back there.

687
00:45:13,974 --> 00:45:15,042
Well...

688
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:17,423
I'm not allowed to sell alcohol.

689
00:45:17,513 --> 00:45:18,779
Then don't charge me.

690
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:20,395
That means you're not selling it.

691
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:26,423
It's truly an honor.

692
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:28,893
Don't flatter.

693
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,326
I'm not.

694
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,693
My life changed because of you.

695
00:45:34,783 --> 00:45:38,319
After watching you live
your life the way you want,

696
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:39,909
you became my role model.

697
00:45:40,399 --> 00:45:41,629
Do you want my autograph?

698
00:45:42,002 --> 00:45:43,986
No, it's not necessary.

699
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:45,499
It's not worth anything anyway.

700
00:45:48,401 --> 00:45:49,262
By the way,

701
00:45:49,352 --> 00:45:52,854
I heard that you went to Japan.

702
00:45:52,944 --> 00:45:55,146
Why did you suddenly come back?

703
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:57,899
After having a near-death experience,

704
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:00,036
I decided I should find him.

705
00:46:00,706 --> 00:46:01,799
My Namil.

706
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:03,766
Namil?

707
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:06,116
Namil,

708
00:46:06,466 --> 00:46:07,531
my son.

709
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:11,901
He'll release his anger.

710
00:46:12,246 --> 00:46:17,479
Song Youngjin!

711
00:46:17,798 --> 00:46:21,058
Isn't our landlord so strange?

712
00:46:21,323 --> 00:46:22,493
Who cares if we...

713
00:46:22,693 --> 00:46:25,993
Why does she care if we
have ramyeon or not?

714
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:27,890
I wonder what Namil is doing.

715
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,620
He should've take care of his mother.

716
00:46:30,073 --> 00:46:34,266
Namil can't do anything since he's family,
but I feel bad for his wife.

717
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:36,935
Imagine having a mother-in-law like her.

718
00:46:38,373 --> 00:46:41,003
She and I are polar opposites.

719
00:46:44,061 --> 00:46:46,119
I didn't know you had a child.

720
00:46:47,496 --> 00:46:49,576
How do you intend on finding him?

721
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,208
I already found him.

722
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:55,059
Pardon?

723
00:47:11,637 --> 00:47:13,834
So, what will you do now?

724
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:15,553
He bulked up.

725
00:47:16,148 --> 00:47:19,509
Taksu, leave Dongman to me.
You need to rest.

726
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,334
You're working out way too much lately.
You're acting like a real athlete.

727
00:47:25,907 --> 00:47:28,007
Then what do you think I am?

728
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:31,760
Taksu, just fight Dongman.

729
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,357
What?

730
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:35,742
Just fight him as soon as possible.

731
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:39,126
He doesn't protect his face
and doesn't attack low.

732
00:47:39,216 --> 00:47:40,779
Doesn't he remind you of someone?

733
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:47,005
Dongman is exactly like you when you
first switched over from taekwondo.

734
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:01,949
Come in.

735
00:48:02,866 --> 00:48:04,986
Will you fight only standing up?

736
00:48:05,076 --> 00:48:07,262
I'm confident fighting with standing.

737
00:48:07,352 --> 00:48:08,281
Hey, you punk!

738
00:48:08,837 --> 00:48:10,672
You can't do only what you want.

739
00:48:10,936 --> 00:48:14,233
Do you think your opponent
will negotiate with you?

740
00:48:14,323 --> 00:48:16,123
I won't go low.

741
00:48:16,213 --> 00:48:18,089
I won't follow even if they try.

742
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:21,436
Then you'll be half a fighter forever.

743
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:24,742
If you can't overcome it,
this is the end for you!

744
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:27,673
Let's fight.

745
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,150
If you can't avoid it anyway,

746
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:31,901
fight him now.

747
00:48:33,893 --> 00:48:35,663
Taksu, what will you do?

748
00:48:36,236 --> 00:48:37,488
I guaranteed.

749
00:48:37,578 --> 00:48:39,242
Once Dongman fixes this,

750
00:48:39,332 --> 00:48:41,062
no one can catch up to him.

751
00:48:48,786 --> 00:48:50,670
Height, 163.2 cm.

752
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,929
Weight 50...

753
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,623
45 kg.

754
00:48:53,713 --> 00:48:55,903
The first female MMA
announcer of the country.

755
00:48:55,993 --> 00:48:58,663
Choi Aera!

756
00:49:09,536 --> 00:49:11,848
Why are you knocking on
someone else's wall?

757
00:49:11,938 --> 00:49:13,138
Do you rent here?

758
00:49:14,169 --> 00:49:15,339
Who are you?

759
00:49:16,652 --> 00:49:18,092
I'm the owner's son.

760
00:49:20,122 --> 00:49:21,152
Namil?

761
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,320
That Namil?

762
00:49:26,676 --> 00:49:27,676
Do you know me?

763
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:31,008
Why are you saying my name like that?

764
00:49:31,753 --> 00:49:32,824
I'm sorry.

765
00:49:33,082 --> 00:49:34,120
Anyway,

766
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,880
isn't the staircase a shared space?

767
00:49:37,272 --> 00:49:38,569
It is. Sure.

768
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:41,668
Please avoid attires
that may offend others.

769
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,376
And please do not impinge on others'
enjoyment of the shared space by shouting.

770
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:52,499
No one will believe
you're 163.2 cm and 45 kg,

771
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,959
and no one cares.

772
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,960
Why that little...

773
00:50:00,526 --> 00:50:02,986
He's good-looking but a total jerk.

774
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:07,511
Is she a moron or something?

775
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:53,219
Yejin, I asked you not to call me anymore.

776
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:54,836
Why are you doing this?

777
00:50:57,653 --> 00:50:58,629
What?

778
00:50:59,983 --> 00:51:01,109
Take a picture.

779
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:02,278
Right here.

780
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:03,571
That's right.

781
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:06,064
Look.

782
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:07,923
Whenever a car hit from behind,

783
00:51:08,013 --> 00:51:11,270
the car in the back is at fault.

784
00:51:11,745 --> 00:51:15,575
But you backed up when the light changed.

785
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:16,771
I did?

786
00:51:17,256 --> 00:51:18,756
I backed up?

787
00:51:20,403 --> 00:51:23,369
What is wrong with you, lady?

788
00:51:23,459 --> 00:51:24,459
Yejin.

789
00:51:24,976 --> 00:51:26,006
Mr Kim.

790
00:51:29,823 --> 00:51:31,759
Let's check your dash cam.

791
00:51:31,849 --> 00:51:33,689
But it's broken right now.

792
00:51:33,779 --> 00:51:36,084
She hit us from behind, so it's her fault.

793
00:51:36,174 --> 00:51:38,536
-Why are you arguing?
-Did you call your insurance company?

794
00:51:38,626 --> 00:51:41,249
She'll lose more money
if they get involved.

795
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:44,243
Just give us 2,000,000 won
in cash and call it even.

796
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,333
That's right.

797
00:51:46,123 --> 00:51:47,841
Did you two have barbecue pork?

798
00:51:52,685 --> 00:51:54,025
Thank you.

799
00:51:54,816 --> 00:51:57,705
If it weren't for you,
I would've been totally scammed.

800
00:51:58,439 --> 00:52:02,029
There's no way two guys had
barbecue pork without soju.

801
00:52:02,832 --> 00:52:05,999
They asked for cash because
they knew they were guilty.

802
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,511
I must've been punished.

803
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:14,223
I know I should've not keep coming to you.

804
00:52:14,686 --> 00:52:16,676
That would make me a bad person.

805
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,752
So please stop it now.

806
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:22,389
Why'd you get into an
accident in my neighborhood?

807
00:52:38,866 --> 00:52:39,866
Yejin.

808
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,620
I'd like you

809
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,679
to please stop now.

810
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,870
I won't go there anymore.

811
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:54,530
I'll stop.

812
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,983
Don't worry.

813
00:52:58,199 --> 00:52:59,528
You should go up now.

814
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,079
Okay.

815
00:53:18,776 --> 00:53:19,986
Are you okay?

816
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,037
Did you get hurt in the accident?

817
00:53:24,749 --> 00:53:27,449
I think I slammed on the
brake too hard earlier.

818
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:38,633
It's here.

819
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,109
Come back to work tomorrow.

820
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:44,181
You're putting me in a bad
spot by not coming in.

821
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,923
People are talking too.

822
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:48,954
See you at work tomorrow.

823
00:53:49,579 --> 00:53:50,579
Okay.

824
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:53,295
Thank you for tonight.

825
00:54:15,406 --> 00:54:17,192
Why did you buy so much stuff?

826
00:54:42,992 --> 00:54:44,336
YEJIN

827
00:54:44,426 --> 00:54:45,586
Together.

828
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:57,508
You're returning to work?

829
00:54:58,646 --> 00:55:01,510
How did you manage to return
to work but I couldn't?

830
00:55:04,466 --> 00:55:05,690
But must you

831
00:55:06,146 --> 00:55:07,903
really stay here...

832
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,306
Anyway, okay.

833
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:12,999
Yeah.

834
00:55:16,322 --> 00:55:17,333
What is it?

835
00:55:17,604 --> 00:55:19,584
Is your dad returning to work?

836
00:55:20,459 --> 00:55:22,094
Yeah, but

837
00:55:22,815 --> 00:55:26,366
he's going to sleep over
a night at my place.

838
00:55:27,066 --> 00:55:28,490
Why is that so serious?

839
00:55:29,029 --> 00:55:31,838
Come to think of it...

840
00:55:32,743 --> 00:55:35,841
I've never slept alone with my dad before.

841
00:55:37,347 --> 00:55:38,607
He's your dad.

842
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:41,139
What's the big deal?

843
00:55:42,546 --> 00:55:43,546
I guess.

844
00:55:46,082 --> 00:55:48,497
That's right. You have an
interview in two days?

845
00:55:48,773 --> 00:55:52,002
Can you really be an MMA announcer?

846
00:55:53,346 --> 00:55:55,036
Can you watch me fight?

847
00:55:55,126 --> 00:55:57,372
If you insist on doing it,

848
00:55:57,462 --> 00:55:59,033
then I insist on watching you.

849
00:55:59,298 --> 00:56:00,541
How else can I protect you?

850
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,536
You're a tiny little thing,

851
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:07,919
but you always protect me
even when we were kids.

852
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,659
I can run into the cage if necessary.

853
00:56:14,302 --> 00:56:17,472
If you become an MMA announcer,

854
00:56:19,316 --> 00:56:20,303
does that mean

855
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:22,771
we'll have an office romance?

856
00:56:23,326 --> 00:56:24,826
An office romance?

857
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,670
I always thought that was sexy.

858
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,248
You do your thing and earn money.

859
00:56:30,338 --> 00:56:32,686
What's so sexy about it?

860
00:56:32,776 --> 00:56:33,906
You know,

861
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,666
since you can sneak away

862
00:56:38,783 --> 00:56:41,013
and kiss while working.

863
00:56:43,122 --> 00:56:44,122
What?

864
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,250
Kiss.

865
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:49,099
What?

866
00:56:50,013 --> 00:56:51,743
Are you deaf?

867
00:56:52,386 --> 00:56:53,386
What?

868
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:58,995
Are you

869
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:01,739
embarrassed now?

870
00:57:04,433 --> 00:57:05,623
No, I'm not.

871
00:57:13,746 --> 00:57:16,254
You really are a girly girl now.

872
00:57:18,295 --> 00:57:21,014
You're blushing so much right now.

873
00:57:23,465 --> 00:57:24,665
Whatever.

874
00:57:27,746 --> 00:57:30,831
Why are you grabbing my
hands for no reason?

875
00:57:31,176 --> 00:57:33,135
We grab hands for no reason, indeed.

876
00:57:35,476 --> 00:57:39,676
Why are you staring?
My make-up is a mess.

877
00:57:42,776 --> 00:57:47,424
Why are you holding my hands down?

878
00:57:56,976 --> 00:57:58,646
Why can't I see

879
00:58:01,776 --> 00:58:03,306
anything but your lips?

880
00:58:06,004 --> 00:58:06,906
What?

881
00:58:07,376 --> 00:58:08,576
Since we're dating,

882
00:58:11,555 --> 00:58:12,925
can we keep doing it?

883
00:58:14,546 --> 00:58:16,000
You psycho.

884
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,420
Psycho?

885
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,005
Why are you asking?

886
00:58:32,649 --> 00:58:33,776
Do you like it?

887
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:37,366
Why do you keep asking?

888
00:58:50,821 --> 00:58:53,319
I should've tried kissing you before.

889
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:56,541
Then I would've beaten you up.

890
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:03,708
Now that I did it,

891
00:59:07,646 --> 00:59:08,776
I really like it.

892
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:12,303
Choi Aera,

893
00:59:13,335 --> 00:59:14,542
I like you so much.

894
00:59:15,046 --> 00:59:16,476
It's driving me crazy.

895
00:59:18,876 --> 00:59:21,918
I've always liked you, you annoying brat.

896
00:59:32,976 --> 00:59:34,665
If it's all or nothing,

897
00:59:37,046 --> 00:59:38,306
let's make it "all".

898
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:40,023
What?

899
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,106
Do you want to...

900
00:59:48,776 --> 00:59:50,232
Sleep over tonight?

901
01:00:09,546 --> 01:00:12,675
Hey, punk, does the shrimp taste good?

902
01:00:12,765 --> 01:00:13,616
Does it?

903
01:00:13,706 --> 01:00:15,133
Is it crazy good?

904
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,232
What's wrong with you?
Why do you keep bugging me?

905
01:00:18,606 --> 01:00:20,846
You've done a terrible thing to me today.

906
01:00:21,732 --> 01:00:23,427
What? Is something wrong?

907
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:25,961
What?

908
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:29,006
Will you tease me if I tell you?

909
01:00:30,076 --> 01:00:31,024
What is it?

910
01:00:31,412 --> 01:00:32,663
Let me hear it first,

911
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,716
then I'll decide.

912
01:00:34,806 --> 01:00:35,661
Really?

913
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:36,951
Well...

914
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:39,959
The truth is I...

915
01:00:40,276 --> 01:00:41,706
Oh, my gosh!

916
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,818
-I got the arrow.
-The arrow?

917
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:46,667
-Really?
-The arrow!

918
01:00:46,757 --> 01:00:50,480
-You got the arrow?
-The arrow!
