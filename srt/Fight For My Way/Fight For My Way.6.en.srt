1
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,360
What do we do?

2
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,440
What do we do?

3
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,860
You are embarrassing me. Stop crying.

4
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,500
I am not dead.

5
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,390
Don't do it.

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,140
Don't ever do it. I will never
see you again if you do.

7
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,120
If you do it again, I will never see you.

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,220
Don't you dare.

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,060
Hey.

10
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,180
Does that punk know?

11
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,060
Know what?

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,340
That you look like a baboon when you cry.

13
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,690
Also, you are a crybaby.

14
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,520
Shut up.

15
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,880
Don't tell me you will do it again.

16
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,860
Why are you crying so much?
You will tire yourself out.

17
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:26,103
Gosh. Don't eat your hair.

18
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,940
Don't.

19
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,440
Come on. Don't eat it.

20
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,040
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,680
Are you okay?

22
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:53,597
Why do you keep showing up?

23
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,660
Since I am here, you can go now.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,860
Who are you to tell me to go?

25
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,120
You.

26
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,720
I pity you.

27
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,980
Who do you think you are?

28
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,200
I told you to go.

29
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,820
Just go.

30
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,120
No, you should go.

31
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,580
What?

32
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,320
You should go.

33
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,880
Don't text or call me.

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,100
Don't come looking for me at home.

35
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,800
You make me sick.

36
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,980
I will go for today since
I see that you are okay.

37
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,120
I will have more chances in the future.

38
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,140
Are you trying to pick a fight?

39
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,700
I told you not to hang around Dongman.

40
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,160
Aera.

41
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,220
You should know your place.

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,330
What?

43
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,920
I will make it clear
since you look confused.

44
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,440
The reason why he's holding
your hand right now is,

45
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,900
not because he wants to.
He's doing it to show me.

46
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,980
Hey.

47
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,900
What do you know?

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,540
Pick up the phone when I call.

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,660
If not, I will take it as
if you want me to visit.

50
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,860
Why are you glaring at me?

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,060
Did you really grab my
hand for her to see?

52
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,640
Why did you grab my hand?

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,740
I don't know.

54
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,020
I am hurt.

55
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,380
She is pure evil.

56
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,280
How could she even think
about coming back to you?

57
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,300
Still, she waited for me for two
years when I was in the military.

58
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,880
Huh!

59
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,410
I really don't know why you
think she waited for you.

60
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,260
I told you. I saw her in a
karaoke room with some guy.

61
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,540
She genuinely likes to sing.

62
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,560
Aha.

63
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,670
She genuinely likes to sing,

64
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,460
so she was singing a duet
alone with a guy at midnight.

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,900
It is all in the past.

66
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,940
You look like it isn't all in the past.

67
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,930
It is so obvious what she'll do and how
big of a sucker you'll be for her.

68
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,571
It is very clear to see.

69
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,940
What is so clear?

70
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,100
Do you know everything about us?

71
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,460
What?

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,820
-Us?
-I mean...

73
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,180
Why are you pouncing on words? You
know that's not what I meant.

74
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,980
Sure. I shouldn't get
involved in your business.

75
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,900
I shouldn't care even if you
do something moronic and die.

76
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,760
Mister, go kill him.

77
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,070
Wait. I meant to tell you.

78
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,142
Hold on. Calm down first.

79
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,310
My brow is all ripped up.

80
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,840
I am injured. I am telling
you I am injured.

81
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,920
I am glad you are alive.

82
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,360
You are lucky you didn't die.

83
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:44,894
Street Fighter's True Identity

84
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,300
That is so good.

85
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,030
So, you did land a punch, right?

86
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know. I got beaten
up too much to remember.

87
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,515
Watch.

88
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,408
He shook a little after being hit by you.

89
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,420
People are so quick. When
did they shoot this?

90
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,340
Who else? It must be Taehee.

91
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,000
Mr Yang?

92
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,360
Why are you calling him Mister?

93
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,700
Hey.

94
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,560
Those jerks completely duped you.

95
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,080
That's why they didn't
shoot Karel's face at all.

96
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,220
-Those scumbags.
-Karel?

97
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,220
Do you know the guy who fought me?

98
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,500
Look here.

99
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,360
This tattoo is their symbol.

100
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,140
Thank you, thank you. Oh, thank you!

101
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,980
Your wife will be okay.

102
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,580
And...

103
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,480
Yes. Money. Money go.

104
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,860
I go money... What am I saying?

105
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,680
Tell him I sent the money for
his wife's medical bills.

106
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,820
You...

107
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,620
He knows. He checked
right after the fight.

108
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,800
Hey, thank you.

109
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,500
Yes. What? What is it?

110
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,700
Try your best to avoid him.

111
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,300
Because you will lose.

112
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,300
Wow. What did he say?

113
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,200
The public doesn't know about Karel.
He just coached his nephews at home.

114
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,240
But what family is his like?

115
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,800
Brazilian jujitsu champions
for three generations.

116
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,600
The guy you fought is their second son.

117
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,260
The nephew that he trained
informally at home

118
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,480
is the UFC legend, John Carlos.

119
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,200
It is like a kindergartner landed
a punch on a college student.

120
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,020
You won.

121
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,100
Here is your protein-mixed coffee.

122
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,460
By the way, coach.

123
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,800
You bought him a business
class air ticket.

124
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:51,130
You are so generous with
other people's money.

125
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,220
Then? Should I have someone with a
broken rib fly coach to Brazil?

126
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,390
Is his rib broken? Why?

127
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,120
Dongman landed an attack 58 seconds into
the fight. It broke two of his ribs.

128
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,080
But the thing is, it
wasn't a kick but a hook.

129
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,380
Play the video again.

130
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,300
-Okay.
-You heard what Karel said, right?

131
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,500
How would I know what he said?

132
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,220
He said to do all you
can to avoid Dongman.

133
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,170
What?

134
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,740
He said you'll lose.

135
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,180
That punk. I gave him money,
and he spews out nonsense.

136
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,970
So? Will you go to the
hospital or the gym?

137
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,710
The hospital? Are you sick? Are you hurt?

138
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,500
He wants to get a chin Botox touch-up.

139
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's go to the gym.

140
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,920
Yummy.

141
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,650
Seolhui, just say hi and leave.

142
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,210
I don't want you staying there.

143
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,320
The cookie is over baked.

144
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,080
You are not listening.

145
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,950
-I am going.
-Make a lot of money!

146
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,520
Make a lot of money!

147
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,340
Dongman.

148
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,360
Why are you running around the
neighborhood from the early morning?

149
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,760
He needs to be beaten up more
to give up MMA fighting.

150
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,360
He wasn't beaten up enough.

151
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,120
-Not enough.
-Hey.

152
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,160
The swelling is down.

153
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,520
Seolhui. Are you going to
the baby's birthday party?

154
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,480
Yes. How do I look? Do I look sweet?

155
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,540
-That is what you look like.
-What?

156
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,323
The Cheongdam-dong, subtle look. You
know, the subtle but luxurious look.

157
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,680
I know.

158
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:39,380
Actually, you can just wear trainers. You
look like the ideal daughter-in-law.

159
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,176
Elders like the puppy type like you.

160
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:45,830
Really? Look who's talking!

161
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,800
You are the kitten type
that guys go crazy over!

162
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,320
Really?

163
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,740
Am I? A kitten?

164
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:02,819
Why aren't you saying anything?
I am offended.

165
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,850
Why would a human talk
while animals are yapping?

166
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,923
Geez.

167
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,600
Dog, enjoy the birthday party.

168
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,161
Cat, let's go eat.

169
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,070
Why would I eat with you?

170
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,820
Eat with your girl, Hyeran. Your Hyeran!

171
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,500
Why is she being different?

172
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,460
Why is she getting annoyed?

173
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,140
She is acting like a girl.

174
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,640
Wait for me!

175
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:59,342

KBC Announcer Recruitment

179
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,390
You have passed round one.

180
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,660
What?

181
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,440
Goodness.

182
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,060
It went through.

183
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,280
It went through? What did? Where?

184
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,760
I don't see anything.

185
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,820
I made it through round one
for the announcer job.

186
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,220
You did?

187
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,390
They want to interview me!

188
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,916
Oh gosh! That is great!

189
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,500
Hey.

190
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,100
What do I do?

191
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,120
What do I wear? What should I wear?

192
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,620
Hold on.

193
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,920
Hey, you.

194
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,320
Are you not...

195
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,720
What?

196
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,300
Why do you go around like that?

197
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,780
I know we are near home, but...

198
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,811
What?

199
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,520
I am going crazy. Why won't she pick up?

200
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,460
What use is a phone if you don't pick up?

201
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,570
Seolhui, hang up.

202
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,713
You drive me crazy. You
said you don't have much.

203
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:36,873
-Give it to me.
-Don't get it on you.

204
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:42,100
You should have taken a cab if you
have this much stuff, not the subway.

205
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,950
I was afraid there would be traffic.

206
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,340
Do you have liquid in here?

207
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:47,016
Yes, a few bottles of
the sweet rice drink.

208
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,086
You said you just made a
little bit of snacks!

209
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,360
How can I send that to our
future in-law's party?

210
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,327
I made little bit of japchae, some
rice cakes and a tiny bit of jokbal.

211
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,040
You know those are my specialty.

212
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,040
How could you forget that?
Where's your brain?

213
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,720
Still, this isn't necessary.

214
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,380
I know this much isn't necessary.

215
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,580
What was that?

216
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,000
Are you two close?

217
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,294
Hello.

218
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,800
Who...

219
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,320
Madam lives on the fifth floor.

220
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,760
She is our landlady and
she moved in recently.

221
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,320
Miss, not Madam.

222
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,860
Call me Ganako Hwang.

223
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,320
Hello.

224
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,420
By the way, do you wallpaper
the rooms yourself?

225
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,460
Why should I waste money on laborers?

226
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,060
I dislike people who don't
work and play all day,

227
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,260
more than anything or anyone.

228
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,740
Make sure to pay your rent on time.

229
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,280
One more thing.

230
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,220
No matter how close you may be,

231
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,620
you cannot sleep in the
same room together.

232
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,440
Well...

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,500
Why would we even do that?

234
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,940
I shut out and prevent
all possible advances.

235
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,280
Those on our floor are more innocent
than monks living in a temple.

236
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,560
What are you looking at?

237
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,440
I like how resolute the
guy is for a change.

238
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,740
Make me some instant coffee.
I like it sweet.

239
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,980
Where do you think you're coming?

240
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,040
I am blocking you out.

241
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,300
Why is she getting upset all of a sudden?

242
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,780
I said stop acting like a woman around me.

243
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,500
I guess you are ready to get married.

244
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,060
I can't believe you baked cookies.

245
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,980
It is because I got bored
after work last night.

246
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,320
Hey, why do you work so hard anyway?

247
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,560
Quit when you get married.

248
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,240
Your dad turns off the TV whenever
he lands on a home shopping channel.

249
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,240
He can't stop thinking
that his daughter is,

250
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,550
always on the phone taking orders.

251
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,100
He says it makes him sick and angry.

252
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,180
I just have to sit down
and answer the phone.

253
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,420
There it is.

254
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,200
Will you come in and say hi?

255
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,120
No, of course not.

256
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,290
I am not dressed well enough.

257
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:46,095
I think you look just fine.

258
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,760
-I told you to get bangs.
-Don't touch my hair.

259
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,790
My goodness.

260
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,080
When you see Jooman's mom, ask her when
to arrange meeting between families.

261
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,500
Okay, I will.

262
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,820
I'll go now.

263
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,380
They must be heavy.

264
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,844
-Are you really going?
-See you.

265
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,720
Take care and answer
your phone when I call!

266
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:27,090
To solve the North's nuclear
issue, President Trump

267
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,360
reportedly decided to put pressure on...

268
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,080
Should I just nuke her?

269
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,090
Hyeran Returns to TV

270
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,500
How dare she show up in
front of Dongman again?

271
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,640
Also, he is about to fall for her again.

272
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,620
Get your coffee from a temple somewhere.

273
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:22,050
Share a coffee with Hyeran.

274
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,600
Your Hyeran...

275
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,720
Are you talking about me?

276
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,780
You...

277
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,080
Hello.

278
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,380
Amazing. Is this where you live?

279
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,660
Do you want to become an announcer again?

280
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,840
With me as a role model?

281
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,880
Do you have a habit of coming now?

282
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,140
I dropped by to see you
before visiting Dongman.

283
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,901
I have something to tell you.

284
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,193
Say it or not. I don't care.

285
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,000
I won't do anything you want.

286
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,870
-Aera.
-What?

287
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,700
Can you see how childish you're being now?

288
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,230
Then what?

289
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,240
Shall I sit here with you and talk
over a cup of coffee or something?

290
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,020
Alright.

291
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,840
I will just get to the point.

292
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,320
Dongman and I will start over.

293
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,880
What?

294
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,360
Why would he...

295
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,580
Did he say he would?

296
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,380
Hey, he has still

297
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,720
never been married.

298
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,160
Does it have to be the man
who makes a comeback?

299
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,900
Now I have it all.

300
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,340
Money, connections and name value.

301
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,190
Now, I really just need Dongman.

302
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,370
I told you never to show
up in front of him again.

303
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,830
I am not here for your permission.

304
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,060
It is a notice.

305
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,570
He is mine, so...

306
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,960
Are you saying I should stay away?

307
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,140
No.

308
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,800
Don't make yourself any more pathetic.

309
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,320
What did you just say?

310
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,410
Who are you calling pathetic?

311
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,170
You hang around pretending
like you are his friend.

312
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,520
It is quite funny.

313
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,120
It is better to be crazy
than being pathetic.

314
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,001
Hey.

315
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,160
I told you I can hit women too.

316
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,640
Think about it.

317
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,820
Was there ever a time that you beat me?

318
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,600
Hey, unit 101?

319
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,700
I take back what I said,

320
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,300
involving you and a temple.

321
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,820
Why do you keep getting on my nerves

322
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,140
by getting upset?

323
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,540
Why do you keep acting
out of your character?

324
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,720
Are you acting out of your
character these days?

325
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,980
What for?

326
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,180
That's really sad.

327
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,080
Hey.

328
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,320
Your Hyeran is in here. Take her away.

329
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,840
Dongman.

330
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:42,691
Dongman.

331
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,000
What are you doing here?

332
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,680
I got worried and wanted
to see how you are doing.

333
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,340
Should I be grateful?

334
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
I told you to answer your phone.

335
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,760
Hyeran.

336
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,040
When I heard of your divorce

337
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,400
honestly,

338
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,760
my heart sank.

339
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,200
When you called me,

340
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,060
I thought I could barely breathe.

341
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,480
His heart sank?

342
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,660
That idiot is at it again.

343
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,260
Sure. That loser and the witch
are made for each other.

344
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,620
I won't care about
neither of them anymore.

345
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,360
A call from me was enough
to make you nervous.

346
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,910
Yes.

347
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,300
I was worried about this.

348
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,800
I got afraid you would put me through a
replay of our horrid five years again.

349
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,700
Do me a favor.

350
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,460
Please get lost.

351
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,440
You didn't have to bring all these.

352
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,290
And this is sweet rice
drink that my mom made.

353
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,480
People who tried it ask her
to send them bottles of it.

354
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,990
She sent two bottles.

355
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,730
Why did she send us jokbal?

356
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,520
This is what my family
sells in our restaurant.

357
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,580
She didn't use any additives. She
broiled it in medicinal herbs only.

358
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,460
Cover it up. It reeks of pork.

359
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,920
Everyone has morning sickness.
Don't overreact.

360
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,610
Jokbal is pork. That is
why they smell like pork.

361
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,320
Thank you so much for the
thought and effort,

362
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,490
but we are going with
a brunch party theme.

363
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,940
Jokbal doesn't fit the menu.

364
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,400
What is in the suitcase?
Are you traveling?

365
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,980
Well...

366
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,620
I made some for you to give out
to the guests as they leave.

367
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,660
My goodness. Look at those!

368
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,760
Weren't you busy at work?

369
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,450
I took a day off. I had to do
something for Minseo's first party.

370
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,624
By the way, did Juman
say he can't make it?

371
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,960
Did you try talking to him?

372
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,940
Mr Kim.

373
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,440
What do I do now?

374
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,980
All of a sudden, it...

375
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,600
I need to make 100 copies of this.

376
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,860
I think I broke it.

377
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,280
What do I do? I think I broke it again.

378
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,100
Why do I keep causing trouble?

379
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,140
Why do I keep causing trouble?

380
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,840
Move over.

381
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,760
Don't get your clothes stained.

382
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,210
Hey.

383
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,500
Open the door. Let's talk.

384
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:42,698
Moobin

385
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,300
Hello, Moobin.

386
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,180
You're at the department store?

387
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,620
Why are you there?

388
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,380
You are going to wait
for me until I am done?

389
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,020
You should just curse at me.

390
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,200
Why do you keep getting mad?
It is not like you.

391
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,420
You hang around pretending
like you are his friend.

392
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,000
It's funny.

393
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,940
Okay, let's meet.

394
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,160
Let's talk. Where are you going?

395
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,620
Let go.

396
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,900
Where are you going now?

397
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,860
Why do you care where I go?

398
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,940
It is just...

399
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,180
I didn't call her.

400
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,070
She came on her own.

401
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,140
Why are you telling me that?

402
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,280
Do you like me?

403
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,500
Or do I like you?

404
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,780
Let's keep our boundaries.

405
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,460
I don't want that crazy witch to pity me.

406
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,040
Let's behave.

407
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,060
This printer tends to get jammed.

408
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:42,184
When you print double-sided,
insert pages separately.

409
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,780
You have ink on your face.

410
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,040
Mr Kim.

411
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,680
Thank you so much.

412
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,940
I have to buy you a drink today.

413
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,830
There is this new souvlaki place.
It is really good,

414
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,140
and the atmosphere is great.
Let's have a drink today.

415
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,460
Well...

416
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,850
I have a heavy workload,
so I have to work tonight.

417
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,610
Then, do you want to watch
a movie this weekend?

418
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,050
I have family plans this weekend.

419
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,850
What about tomorrow for dinner?

420
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,940
Tomorrow...

421
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,380
I need to watch a soccer game.

422
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,600
I said I was thankful!

423
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,980
Let's have a drink. Why are
you complicating things?

424
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:49,084
Dear, don't give me that kiss.

425
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:52,320
To Aera

426
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,960
Sorry. I don't know what this is about.

427
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,400
But I am sorry anyway.

428
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,920
Hurry up. Why are you not keeping up?

429
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,840
What is this?

430
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,040
Why did you put my shoe size down?

431
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:23,670
What?

432
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,520
Why is this so detailed?

433
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,720
Taught by the Sydney
Olympic Silver Medalist

434
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,820
I don't know if women in this
town will find you appealing.

435
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,380
I mean, as an instructor.

436
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,620
This is so strategic.

437
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,980
I don't even know why
I asked him for help.

438
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,820
Come here.

439
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,280
-Hello.
-Welcome.

440
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,410
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

441
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,040
I wanted to meet the star fast.

442
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,080
-The star?
-Hello.

443
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:00,922
-Hello.
-Let's see.

444
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,380
Go to the restroom and wet
your hair for a picture.

445
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,860
What is this? What is it for?

446
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,640
Counterattack. The prelude
to counterattack.

447
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,650
What?

448
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,600
You need to give a response.

449
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,140
-Sir, have you confirmed everything?
-Yes.

450
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,800
I have Carl Carelas' hotel
check-in information,

451
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,840
and his departure information
right after the match.

452
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,520
Taksu's scheme is quite messy.

453
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,580
This will make a story.

454
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,260
Right. Did you think I was
going to let this go?

455
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,780
Look at you. You look cold,

456
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,420
but you are so warm-hearted.

457
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,400
Get ready to die from today.

458
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,380
I have booked your debut match.

459
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,980
Are you serious?

460
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,680
You are the one who
needs to counterattack.

461
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,600
You didn't look too bad
fighting that Brazilian.

462
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,630
Coach Hwang, can I call you my brother?

463
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,200
-You!
-Guard.

464
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,251
Guard.

465
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,900
Look here. Lift one arm.

466
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:08,423
Here we go.

467
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,220
Good. Come in.

468
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,700
Different pose.

469
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,840
Okay.

470
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,080
All right. Here we go.

471
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,420
Sorry you two, do you mind moving over?

472
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,330
You too. Thank you.

473
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,540
-Last one. Here we go.
-I am sorry.

474
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,100
Good one.

475
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,581
Stand up straight.

476
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,818
Good. Looking great.

477
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,553
Great. Here it is.

478
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,750
I think that is enough.

479
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,236
Let's go for a smoke.

480
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:46,061
-Good job.
-Thank you.

481
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,940
-Thank you.
-Hey.

482
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,860
Come and be my sparring partner.

483
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,000
Sorry?

484
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,460
You don't want to?

485
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,160
I will.

486
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,280
My goodness.

487
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,400
Hey, why would you get an interview?

488
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:07,710
It is for something.

489
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,418
I see. When you got beaten up?

490
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,770
I saw that.

491
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,100
You got beaten up and I cracked up.

492
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,800
If I were you, I would have
quit from embarrassment.

493
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,560
That is not it. I got tricked into it.

494
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,260
Don't talk back.

495
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,780
In this gym, you are the sandbag.

496
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,940
Whose sandbag? Mine.

497
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,700
All right, Dongman? Take my punches.

498
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,080
Here I go.

499
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,580
I almost forgot.

500
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,990
Congrats. From Seolhui's Mom

501
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,820
I forgot the most important thing.

502
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,200
Goodness, I am tired.

503
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,940
Mother, you can leave it. I will clean up.

504
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,650
-Seolhui.
-Yes?

505
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,730
Sorry, but can you set this table up?

506
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,260
Sure. I will do it now.

507
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,160
She makes me feel so uncomfortable.

508
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,540
She even baked these cookies.

509
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,530
Is she the one your brother
started dating in college?

510
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,690
-Her mom sells pig's feet, right?
-For a man

511
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,270
to be successful, he has to
consider the girl's family.

512
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,560
He is such a moron.

513
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,160
We call her the Crawling Seolhui.

514
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,910
Her family has nothing, so
she crawls in front of us.

515
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,890
-Goodness.
-Hey.

516
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,170
It is better that way.

517
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,510
Your sister-in-law is
going to be disciplined.

518
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,149
She is not my sister-in-law.

519
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,920
You don't know who is going
to walk down the aisle.

520
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,720
Then,

521
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,740
should I cancel Juman's blind date?

522
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:59,110
What does her family do?

523
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,440
They own a restaurant.

524
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,940
They own a restaurant in Garosu Road.

525
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,140
Aera!

526
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,140
Why did you come all of a sudden?

527
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,660
I suddenly got the day off.

528
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,120
I made a surprise visit.

529
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,580
You sure love surprises.

530
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,710
Why aren't you wearing your uniform?

531
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,760
What?

532
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,720
The thing is...

533
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,380
I have a stomachache, so
I was going to go home.

534
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,360
Get in.

535
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,898
Miss Hwang. Are you leaving already?

536
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,640
You should look around. There
are many new releases.

537
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,920
This place has bad rumors.

538
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,320
Rumors?

539
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,520
You need to control those
that visit the place.

540
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,680
Pardon?

541
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,640
King's chairman's second wife.

542
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,820
She is known for her hobby in shoplifting.

543
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,520
On top of that,

544
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,620
I heard an innocent staff
had to kneel and apologize.

545
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,780
Pardon?

546
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,820
Oh, that incident?

547
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,840
You are pretty brave.

548
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,100
These days, that kind of incident
would lead to store closure.

549
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,180
All of you need to take
care of things properly.

550
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,820
What I want is simple.

551
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,320
No matter which department store it is

552
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,200
no VIPs should be able
to abuse their power.

553
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,720
Are you telling me to expel her?

554
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,920
It is simple and righteous.

555
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,380
That is,

556
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,360
what a promising department
store should do.

557
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,560
You must really love Japanese music.

558
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,160
It is another Japanese song.

559
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,140
How is your stomach, Aera?
Does it hurt often?

560
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,880
I have a minor irritable bowel syndrome.

561
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,540
Today, I had a few things happen to me.

562
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,260
I hear it has a huge
psychological influence.

563
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,020
You can't get stressed.

564
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,140
Having you show up like this
isn't actually that good either.

565
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,810
Did I make you uncomfortable?

566
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,740
I just missed you a lot.

567
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,560
If I give you a surprise visit to the
hospital, you'll be uncomfortable too.

568
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,160
I think I would love that.

569
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,250
If you would surprise me,

570
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,960
I would be so happy.

571
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,600
I will make sure to call next time.

572
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,860
Moobin.

573
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,140
I was just embarrassed.

574
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,140
I wasn't sure if I should
tell people this or not,

575
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,520
but I quit work.

576
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,380
I see.

577
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,400
There is something else I want to do.

578
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,060
What is it?

579
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,462
It is embarrassing to say.

580
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:45,620
What is it?

581
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,500
Can't you tell me?

582
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,100
Well...

583
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,580
An announcer.

584
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,540
An announcer?

585
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,060
Really?

586
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,410
I just passed through the documentation
process, so I'll go for my interview.

587
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,360
I'm not saying this to make you happy.

588
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,380
I think it suits you really well.

589
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,100
-Really?
-Yes.

590
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,840
Why do I feel so happy?

591
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:14,460
I think it is cool that you quit and
it is exciting that you passed.

592
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,560
But honestly, I am most thankful
that you told me everything.

593
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:22,560
Why are you so thankful?

594
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,758
I don't know.

595
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,840
You weren't sure if you could
tell others, but you told me.

596
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,880
That means,

597
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,160
we aren't 100 percent strangers anymore.

598
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,420
Hey.

599
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,620
Did you clean this up?
I could have done it.

600
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,300
No, it wasn't me.

601
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,195
-Really?
-Enjoy.

602
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,540
Seolhui, you are working so hard.

603
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,720
By the way,

604
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,840
when should we,

605
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:20,260
have the parents meet?

606
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:23,340
Right, we should set the date.

607
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:29,100
But I recently hurt my knee. It has been
so hectic getting treatment and all.

608
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,700
Why?

609
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,480
Are your parents rushing you?

610
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,840
No. I just asked.

611
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,300
Oh, my little one.

612
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,540
Oh, my pumpkin!

613
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,494
Baby, look. There are flowers.

614
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,010
Kim Taksu

615
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,922
57, 58...

616
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,100
59.

617
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,000
80, 81.

618
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:15,436
Why are you looking him up?

619
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:19,307
56, 57.

620
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,860
Aren't you training? Did you
practice your 100 punches?

621
00:39:22,377 --> 00:39:23,940
How can I do it 100 times?

622
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,040
-I am not like this kid.
-60.

623
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,750
Bro, Taksu is having fun at a club.

624
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,920
Bro?

625
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,520
Bro?

626
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,280
I mean, coach.

627
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,070
Why do you care if he is at a club?

628
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,340
It is just...

629
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,000
The more I think about it,

630
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:43,631
it makes me upset that they fooled me.

631
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:44,760
I am speechless.

632
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,220
Why? You were always fooled.

633
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,560
You were like that since middle school.

634
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,460
Hey, what are you thinking?

635
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,340
Don't think.

636
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:07,340
Your brain isn't meant to be used.

637
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,560
Sonya.

638
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,160
I don't even know who Alice is.
How can I have her number?

639
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,620
Fine, just show me. Let me look.

640
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,200
Sonya.

641
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:28,142
Do you want to die? So, it is true.

642
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:30,140
You texted Alice first, didn't you?

643
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,646
No, I didn't.

644
00:40:32,447 --> 00:40:34,615
Then, why won't you show me your phone?

645
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:36,310
Just show me proof.

646
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,050
This is a matter of trust.

647
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,720
Do you really want to die?

648
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,550
Seriously. Should I just show it to you?

649
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,180
I could, but what really
bothers me right now,

650
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,760
isn't the false rumor about
me hitting on Alice.

651
00:40:57,238 --> 00:40:59,817
It is that you don't believe me.

652
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:01,830
Shut up and just show me your text.

653
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,100
Sonya, watch your mouth!

654
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,820
Sonya, I am a sportsman.

655
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,370
I would never act like a thug.

656
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,760
Hey. Alice and I are in the same group.

657
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,220
You really are a thug.

658
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,400
We know that already.

659
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,460
You don't have to worry.

660
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:37,478
We already took care of all the press.

661
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,420
Of course.

662
00:41:39,614 --> 00:41:42,683
Also, please don't call me anymore.

663
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,860
Mr Yang.

664
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,220
One moment, please. Geez!

665
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,040
Dongman. What brings you here?

666
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,760
He must be downstairs.

667
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,280
What?

668
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,720
Aren't you going down?

669
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:10,160
I think I have to finish this call.

670
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,020
I am too busy.

671
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,860
Sonya, I am going to the washroom.

672
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,020
Why are you taking your
phone to the washroom?

673
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:34,960
Hey, Dongman. What are you doing here?

674
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,980
I am okay. Don't worry.

675
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,680
Taksu.

676
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,940
I didn't know zip about jiu jitsu,
but I got to learn it thanks to you.

677
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,850
Thank you for helping me train
with the famous Brazilian coach.

678
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,220
I wasn't ready for it. Such a thug!

679
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:05,390
How can you attack a drunk person?

680
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,460
Hey, Taksu.

681
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,760
You jerk.

682
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,220
Give me your best shot.

683
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,260
No matter how hard you try,

684
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,300
you will end up on the ring with me.

685
00:43:39,467 --> 00:43:42,400
Youngsoo. Kyungah.

686
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,400
There is one from a guy.

687
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:45,980
Hayun.

688
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,800
Hey!

689
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:49,690
Congrats. From Seolhui's Mom

690
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,940
Seolhui's...

691
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,280
Did her mom come by?

692
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,920
She must have sent it by the
hand of Crawling Seolhui.

693
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,440
There are 300 dollars in here.

694
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,227
The in-laws went out of their way.

695
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,700
Hey. She isn't an in-law.

696
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,640
Juman. I thought you had to work late.
How did you come?

697
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
-Where is she?
-Over there.

698
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,520
Honey.

699
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,980
You said you couldn't make it today.

700
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,640
What is it? Let go.

701
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,440
Mom. All of you.

702
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,980
Don't look down on Seolhui.

703
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,410
If you do, I won't forgive you.

704
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,470
Juman.

705
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,440
Sons are all useless.

706
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,360
Seolhui.

707
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,000
Did you call him?

708
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,570
No. I am sorry.

709
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,970
What has gotten into you?

710
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,690
You don't go to your in-laws
during the holidays!

711
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,900
Then, why must Seolhui clean
up after your son's party?

712
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,220
She is a precious daughter,

713
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,680
in her family too.

714
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,961
Get your act together.

715
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,840
Hey. You tell him.

716
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,320
Did we make you work?

717
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:20,110
No. I did it because I wanted to.

718
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,150
Juman. I wanted to do it.
Stop being angry.

719
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,880
Treat Seolhui well.

720
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,560
Don't look down on her.

721
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:29,744
-My goodness.
-What's wrong with you?

722
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,780
Am I so great?

723
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,670
I come from a poor family.

724
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,870
I went to a local college and
am only an assistant manager.

725
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,520
Whom do I have to thank for that?

726
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:42,140
All four years of college, she
worked and paid my rent,

727
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,420
and supported me when I started work.
Not you people!

728
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,460
It is Seolhui.

729
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,540
You should bow to her and thank her.

730
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,360
Don't do this.

731
00:45:55,736 --> 00:45:57,130
What a great boyfriend.

732
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,400
Are you even going to marry her?

733
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,720
You are not so...

734
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,740
Sure, I may not marry her.

735
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,440
But,

736
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,140
if I don't marry her,

737
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,920
I won't marry anyone else!

738
00:46:18,392 --> 00:46:20,661
Juman.

739
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,840
Hey!

740
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,300
My stomach!

741
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,560
You are going to watch
me go in again, right?

742
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,660
No.

743
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,240
I am going in with you this time.

744
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,380
Why would you go in with me?

745
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,780
Why do you keep saying you
will go into a woman's home?

746
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,060
Are you that...

747
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,100
Uneducated?

748
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,580
This is how one actor
proposed to his actress wife.

749
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,840
My goodness.

750
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:17,180
You should stop surfing the web.

751
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:21,510
You are prettier in my
eyes than that actress,

752
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,480
so I added to it.

753
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:26,080
You always massage your legs yourself.

754
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,090
When did you see me do that?

755
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,000
Pardon? I wasn't staring or anything.

756
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:39,240
Fine. I will say you didn't stare.

757
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,770
Right, you aren't well.

758
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,860
I will bring this in and then leave.

759
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:47,181
No, I can carry it.

760
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,900
You can't carry this up five
flights of stairs. Let's go.

761
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,000
Geez!

762
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,200
I said it is okay.

763
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:03,280
I can take it from here.

764
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,980
I will drop this off and then go.

765
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,880
I can really take it from here.

766
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,160
I will just drop this off.

767
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,780
I will take it.

768
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,000
Wait, Moobin.

769
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:18,960
Hold on. I need to tell you something.

770
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,220
Wait, Moobin.

771
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,900
Moobin, I need to tell you something.

772
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,160
What is it?

773
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,200
-Pardon?
-Why are you going up?

774
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,760
Why are you going up?

775
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,560
That is not it.

776
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,700
-Aera!
-Miss.!

777
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,360
Hey!

778
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,220
-Aera.
-Hey!

779
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,140
Don't go to my house again.

780
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:16,080
Were you worried that I
would be working too hard?

781
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:19,360
Didn't you like that? Did you get annoyed?

782
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,710
You are too submissive.

783
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,040
What do you lack that you
are like that to me?

784
00:49:26,146 --> 00:49:27,915
It is not because I lack anything.

785
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,580
It is because I like you.

786
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,620
It is because I like you so much,

787
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,350
that I want you to like me.

788
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,200
That is why I want your
family to like me too.

789
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,720
Do you like me that much?

790
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,620
-Yes.
-Goodness.

791
00:49:45,265 --> 00:49:49,940
You know, earlier, when you
got all angry and stuff,

792
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,580
I thought you looked kind of sexy.

793
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,340
Are my lips here?

794
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,420
I was so happy that you came.

795
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,720
I thought you had to work late.

796
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,180
Did you play hooky because
you worried about me?

797
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,501
Your mother texted, so I left early.

798
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,130
My mom? She did?

799
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,070
-Yes.
-My mom texted you?

800
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,270
Yes.

801
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,540
It was the first time she texted me,

802
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:30,920
so I was really surprised.

803
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,540
My mom doesn't know how to text.

804
00:50:36,817 --> 00:50:37,818
Okay.

805
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,950
-A suit, okay?
-Okay.

806
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,060
Okay.

807
00:50:46,593 --> 00:50:48,095
Friends are the best.

808
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,740
-Look at that.
-How adorable.

809
00:50:57,538 --> 00:50:59,106
Eat slowly.

810
00:51:00,174 --> 00:51:01,430
He takes after me.

811
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,680
-You must have been hungry.
-Right?

812
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,640
That moron. That idiot.

813
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:11,480
She acted all fine in front of me,

814
00:51:11,585 --> 00:51:14,121
but you are a complete idiot. Moron.

815
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,160
That jerk!

816
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,880
That jerk. That disgusting family.
I am going to!

817
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,580
Where is it? That jerk.

818
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:30,280
Forget getting married. Don't show
your face in front of Seolhui again.

819
00:51:30,704 --> 00:51:33,440
I won't let a family like
that have my daughter.

820
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,780
Forget getting married...

821
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,440
Juman. How are you doing?

822
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:06,300
It has been a while.

823
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,460
Seolhui went to the
birthday party by herself.

824
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,520
She likes you very much.

825
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,020
Please be good to my daughter.

826
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,140
What is wrong? What is it?

827
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,300
My mom

828
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,100
cleaned up the garbage.

829
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,320
What garbage?

830
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,280
My mom must have seen everything.

831
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,520
She must have seen everything.

832
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,900
Don't cry.

833
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,920
Mom.

834
00:53:05,232 --> 00:53:08,235
Seolhui's Jokbal

835
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,960
So?

836
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,640
When are the families meeting?

837
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,520
Would it be this month?

838
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,680
What about Seolhui?

839
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,860
Is she doing well?

840
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,400
Honey.

841
00:53:24,518 --> 00:53:25,519
Yes?

842
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:28,560
Should we close this shop,

843
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,700
and open a restaurant?

844
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,980
What are you talking about?

845
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:34,480
It is just,

846
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,200
I don't like that Seolhui has to,

847
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,040
have parents who own a jokbal store.

848
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,580
It is IBS. Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

849
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,960
Really?

850
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:56,180
-Is it serious?
-Yes.

851
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,040
Her stomach was full of gas.

852
00:54:00,187 --> 00:54:02,550
Then, she fainted because of gas?

853
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,040
That is not common.

854
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:08,660
I think she fainted from the
pain caused by the gas.

855
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:11,720
That means, she was extremely stressed.

856
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,900
How much did you stress her out
that she fainted during a date?

857
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,040
She is okay now, right?

858
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,040
You saw her release the gas, right?

859
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,480
I want to die.

860
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,580
Yes. Twice.

861
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,680
Once was very long.

862
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,940
I can never open my eyes again.

863
00:54:35,222 --> 00:54:40,390
Bar? Soju? Beer? Answer,
or you get nothing.

864
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,600
Are you sleeping?

865
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,880
Are you ignoring me?

866
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,280
Hey.

867
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,360
She is really getting to me.

868
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,400
Hello.

869
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,780
-What...
-You. Unit 102.

870
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,860
Are you on route to unit 101 or
the announcer who came back?

871
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,020
Pardon?

872
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,040
The Unit 101 girl

873
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,508
fainted and was taken to the hospital.

874
00:55:18,598 --> 00:55:19,633
Aera?

875
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,880
-Aera is now in the hospital?
-Yes.

876
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:25,600
Severance Hospital. Room 2701.

877
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,120
The Royal Suite room.

878
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,300
Not again!

879
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,420
I am awake now.

880
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:59,240
Are you awake? Are you okay?

881
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,600
Huh?

882
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,600
You fainted earlier.

883
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:09,000
Your belly was filled with
gas because of your IBS.

884
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,500
Thankfully, the gas came out.

885
00:56:11,718 --> 00:56:14,610
It wasn't serious, but
the gas had to come out.

886
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,523
Please stop.

887
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,380
Please stop talking about gas.

888
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,640
Can't you take this out for me?

889
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:29,710
I want to go home.

890
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,320
You should sleep here tonight.

891
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,760
I want to go home. It is uncomfortable.

892
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,940
Why do you always want to go home

893
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,580
when you are with me?

894
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,526
Dongman

895
00:56:57,297 --> 00:57:00,310
Why won't she pick up? Why did she faint?

896
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,280
She's strong enough to knock down a cow.

897
00:57:03,236 --> 00:57:04,805
Dongman

898
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,220
Don't answer that.

899
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,520
Aera, can't you look at me?

900
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,960
-Sorry?
-The truth is,

901
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,640
this room is very expensive.

902
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,200
I wanted to do all I
could to impress you,

903
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:25,960
so that is why I requested it.

904
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:30,800
I didn't even get this for my mom
when she had her appendectomy.

905
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:33,970
Why are you telling me...

906
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,820
Actually, I am off today.

907
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:42,620
But I went and got my gown to look cool.

908
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:46,900
I want to do anything to impress you.

909
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,300
Why do you find me so uncomfortable?

910
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:54,760
Why does your stomach hurt
when you are with me?

911
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,300
Why is this guy so sweet?

912
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,430
He is giving me a cavity.

913
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,080
I'm really telling the truth.

914
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,240
I think about you all day long.

915
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:08,020
I think of any excuse possible.

916
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:11,160
The massager, having the day off...

917
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,500
Just to see you one more time.

918
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,180
Please stop.

919
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:17,911
I am feeling weak today.

920
00:58:18,478 --> 00:58:21,314
A person's heart gets soft
when they are hurting.

921
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:26,820
To me, you are like...

922
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:36,800
A goddess.

923
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,900
It is just,

924
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,220
when I look at you, even if
you don't say anything...

925
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,820
Even just

926
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,100
by looking at you,

927
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,100
my heart

928
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,360
goes crazy.

929
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:10,740
You can't do this when someone is sick.

930
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,500
That is low.

931
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,760
Then, I will be low today.

932
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,060
I...

933
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:41,900
Dongman. This isn't what you think.

934
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,680
It hurts!

935
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:49,640
Who was that?

936
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,200
I think it was Aera.

937
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:02,640
-Dongman, that stinks.
-Did he poop?

938
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:13,340
Pretty boy, you did well.

939
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,380
It is all yours.
