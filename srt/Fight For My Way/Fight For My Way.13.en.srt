00:00:02,116 --> 00:00:03,029
EPISODE 13

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,349
I love you, too.

3
00:00:04,858 --> 00:00:06,075
I love you a lot.

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:08,921
That's why I hate it.

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,765
Can't you just support me?

6
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:16,769
Kim Taksu isn't an ordinary thug.

7
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:18,933
You said he is really good.

8
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:20,973
You said he is a good fighter.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,745
What's so wrong with losing?

10
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:25,584
I'd rather lose than to avoid him.

11
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:29,561
If I do, I will regret it
for another ten years.

12
00:00:30,483 --> 00:00:33,853
Even if he beats me,
I want to give it my best.

13
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:36,760
You won't just lose.

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,046
They say you will die.

15
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:41,728
Everyone is saying that you will lose.

16
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:44,301
I looked up the comments.
Everyone are saying that.

17
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:46,924
Ko Dongman will be beaten to a pulp.

18
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:48,807
You will be taken to the hospital.

19
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:51,362
A new fighter won't be
a match against Taksu.

20
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:54,298
Then,

21
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:56,827
do you agree with them?

22
00:00:59,512 --> 00:01:00,813
You said so yourself.

23
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:03,683
Other people don't know me.

24
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:06,580
You have seen me for 20 years.

25
00:01:07,163 --> 00:01:09,167
You said you knew me better than anyone.

26
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:11,249
Do you agree with them?

27
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:12,760
Does it look like...

28
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:15,826
I'd lose against him, even to you?

29
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,016
Don't you think about the people worrying?

30
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:21,270
It's good that you start fighting again,

31
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:23,836
but it doesn't have to be against Taksu.

32
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,759
Aera.

33
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:29,396
I have been living with
my head down for ten years...

34
00:01:29,676 --> 00:01:32,378
and now my heart is finally racing again.

35
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,690
Can't you just give me your trust?

36
00:02:00,807 --> 00:02:02,998
Work is work, and this is personal.

37
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,478
We should eat tteokbokki together.

38
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:12,744
It's the same with when we were friends.
He still doesn't listen to me.

39
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,476
-What did you say?
-Why date me if he won't listen to me?

40
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:18,705
Why did he kiss me?

41
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,718
Why does he say nonsense that he loves me?

42
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,080
Hey.

43
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:26,866
Are you...

44
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:29,008
talking to yourself now?

45
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,375
A monologue?

46
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,784
He will regret it when I dump him,

47
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:38,745
and he'll be in the karaoke
singing a sad song.

48
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,503
Are you going to dump me?

49
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:50,255
Are you really going to dump me?

50
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:54,842
Go away.

51
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,198
I told you to go away.

52
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:03,630
Don't act cute now.
You were my underling when we were kids.

53
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:07,273
Even if we are dating,
I will teach you manners.

54
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:11,398
My rank is over here,

55
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:12,720
and you are still...

56
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:14,505
down there.

57
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:16,010
Do you understand?

58
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,092
Hey.

59
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:24,387
What?

60
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:27,006
You can eat tteokbokki well now.

61
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:29,999
Your stomach doesn't hurt anymore?

62
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:32,857
It doesn't hurt?

63
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:36,913
I guess not.

64
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:51,005
Am I still...

65
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,111
...down there?

66
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,520
You were just...

67
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:57,516
...an errand boy.

68
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,833
I won a stuffed animal.

69
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:32,888
It's pink and...

70
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:37,296
Okay.

71
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,822
What's that?

72
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:43,336
I have to look for a new place.

73
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,775
We dated for six years.

74
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:49,215
It'd be weird to
suddenly act like strangers.

75
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:50,776
However,

76
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:54,083
it doesn't make sense to live so close.

77
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:56,012
I am looking for a new job too.

78
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:58,632
Seolhui, why are you rushing?

79
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:01,596
If I have to do it anyway,

80
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,607
I don't want to be a coward and delay it.

81
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:06,787
Let's just...

82
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:12,505
...do it all in one go.

83
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:14,457
Seolhui.

84
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:28,650
You're stubborn, but your arm is crazy.

85
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,654
It feels like a wooden pillow.

86
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:42,144
Don't fall asleep.

87
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:44,426
It'd be embarrassing if Seolhui finds out.

88
00:05:45,282 --> 00:05:47,233
I am going to leave soon.

89
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,713
Instead...

90
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:55,953
sing me a song.

91
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:58,336
The one from Daecheon.

92
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:02,902
-Kim Wansun?
-Yeah.

93
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:06,853
How do you know that song anyway?

94
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:11,266
Dad used to sing it to me as a lullaby.

95
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:12,910
I see.

96
00:06:14,327 --> 00:06:15,561
Is he a fan?

97
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:17,830
There is no way.

98
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,182
I bet mom sang it for him.

99
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,334
It's okay.

100
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:41,954
My dad loved me twice as much.

101
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:45,011
It wasn't so bad because
I had you and Seolhui.

102
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,329
You all always let me be the leader.

103
00:06:49,662 --> 00:06:52,211
You two always saved
the best stuff for me.

104
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,285
I don't think you ever talked about her.

105
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:00,335
I wouldn't know how to miss her
since I have never met her.

106
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:03,009
She was never there to begin with,

107
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:04,494
so I was just...

108
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:08,403
I was just...

109
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:48,287
Why did I bother bringing you food?

110
00:07:49,122 --> 00:07:51,290
Did she make all these for you?

111
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,519
Did something happen?

112
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:55,259
It's early for a visit.

113
00:07:56,832 --> 00:07:58,500
I came because I was worried.

114
00:07:58,798 --> 00:08:02,068
Did we commit a crime?
Why didn't you pick up our calls?

115
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:03,916
Seolhui...

116
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:05,780
...didn't pick up either.

117
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:07,303
Did you call her?

118
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:10,806
She is the one that begged to come
to your sister's housewarming party.

119
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:12,635
Why are you inviting her?

120
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:13,938
To make her do dishes?

121
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,233
When did we ever make her do that?

122
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:18,658
You don't say it,
but you make her do them.

123
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,294
Goodness.

124
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:24,330
You shouldn't protect her.
It's not any good for her.

125
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:30,630
I thought you came to drop off food.
Why are you cleaning the sink?

126
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,113
I am doing it since I am here.

127
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,692
This is why I hate it when you visit.

128
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:38,661
Goodness.

129
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:43,629
By the way,
why does that one have his arms up?

130
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:46,792
No reason.

131
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:49,088
It's being punished.

132
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:51,017
Isn't it from Juman?

133
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:54,287
Did you two fight?

134
00:08:57,056 --> 00:09:00,731
All men are the same.

135
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:04,931
You might think this one
is better than that one.

136
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:09,369
Just be thankful he is not any worse...

137
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:11,871
...as long as he doesn't cheat on you.

138
00:09:12,638 --> 00:09:15,675
Unless they cheat, they are all the same.

139
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:19,679
At least we know Juman would never cheat.

140
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:22,217
He is very fond of you.

141
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:23,511
Am I right?

142
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:27,731
Next time you come, call me first.

143
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:28,835
Why?

144
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:30,751
Because it will make
Seolhui uncomfortable?

145
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:33,508
Do you two visit each other everyday?

146
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:35,160
It's okay.

147
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:37,204
It's your loss.

148
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:39,004
Don't go visit each other everyday.

149
00:09:40,092 --> 00:09:41,034
Hello.

150
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:45,807
-I didn't expect to see you here.
-Hello.

151
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:47,664
Have you been well?

152
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,746
I have been well, of course.

153
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:52,205
Why did you wear that?

154
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,309
Seolhui is hard-working.

155
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,787
She has a full-time job,

156
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:02,178
but she maintain to fill
his fridge with food.

157
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,231
Sure.

158
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,592
Seolhui must...

159
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,941
like Juman a lot.

160
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:13,601
He likes Seolhui a lot too.

161
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,194
Yes, that's right.

162
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:24,077
-Anyway, about the family meeting...
-There is no rush.

163
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:25,509
Still,

164
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:27,939
we have to consider Seolhui's age...

165
00:10:28,823 --> 00:10:30,693
They are both getting older.

166
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,202
They are the same age anyway.

167
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:34,646
Right! Seolhui.

168
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:38,468
You know that Junhee is having
her housewarming at the end of the month?

169
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:40,502
Well, I...

170
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:42,186
Why would she go there?

171
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:43,321
She isn't going.

172
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:44,780
What?

173
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:47,306
We are inviting her because
she is like family.

174
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,336
She isn't family,
so don't order her around.

175
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,728
When did I do that?

176
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:55,937
Come on.

177
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:59,198
We broke up.

178
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:07,541
I am sorry, ma'am.

179
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:10,097
It's all my fault.

180
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:23,710
Sure, it's for the best.

181
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,867
You stalled marrying her...

182
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:28,896
because you weren't all that into her.

183
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:32,373
How could I make her live
in a tiny studio?

184
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:33,917
Why should she suffer like that?

185
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:36,450
Is that why...

186
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,821
...you couldn't get married?

187
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:40,159
Did she say...

188
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:41,715
she wanted a house?

189
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:43,006
As if she would.

190
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:47,126
I said I won't get married
if it isn't with her.

191
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:50,361
My sisters must be happy because
they won't get any sister-in-law.

192
00:11:52,482 --> 00:11:55,247
Did Seolhui really say
she will break up with you?

193
00:11:55,702 --> 00:11:56,576
For real?

194
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,714
It's a good thing for her.

195
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:02,508
I will never meet
a girl like her ever again,

196
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:06,483
but she'd be loved anywhere she goes.

197
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,566
You also know that.

198
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:12,922
Why did you two break up?

199
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:14,822
Because...

200
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:17,602
I am garbage.

201
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,749
That's why.

202
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,934
Juman...

203
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:31,745
Do you want to go home?

204
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:33,112
It's okay.

205
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:36,411
Your room has an air conditioner now.

206
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:39,766
I am completely fine. I am not a kid.

207
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:41,510
I won't die from breaking up.

208
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:45,184
No wonder you weren't talking about Juman.

209
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:48,988
-What?
-You are all about him.

210
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:52,038
"Juman likes the mixed grain drink."

211
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:54,180
"Juman gets hot easily."

212
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,717
You always talked about Juman.

213
00:12:57,897 --> 00:12:59,228
I did not.

214
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:04,688
Now...

215
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:07,362
don't think about Juman all the time.

216
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:09,149
Look for...

217
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:11,648
what do you like,

218
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:13,494
what kind of food do you like...

219
00:13:13,831 --> 00:13:15,020
Just think about yourself.

220
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:19,412
You are the queen of your life.

221
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:21,323
Go already.

222
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,497
Don't cry.

223
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Make sure to eat.

224
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:24,871
Go...

225
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:28,531
Call me.

226
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:35,570
Hello.

227
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:37,648
Mom, she is our landlady.

228
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:50,469
Hello, ma'am.

229
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:58,757
Mom, aren't you going to respond?

230
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:02,067
How have you been?

231
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:03,488
I mean...

232
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,201
Hello.

233
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:09,343
Hello.

234
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:11,562
It's nice to meet you.

235
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,884
Darn it.

236
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:27,870
Hey!

237
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,305
Why are you tiptoeing?

238
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:31,051
We didn't do anything.

239
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:33,440
Why are you acting like we did something?

240
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:35,829
Still, what if someone sees?

241
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,051
What's wrong with that?

242
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:38,853
We did nothing.

243
00:14:39,465 --> 00:14:40,806
Just say we are...

244
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:42,532
some kind of army roommates.

245
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,227
What do I tell Seolhui?

246
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,763
You should have woken me up.

247
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:48,800
You said you'd lie down for just a minute.

248
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:52,004
You said you can't sleep
unless it's in your bed.

249
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:54,632
I couldn't sleep.

250
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,185
Just wipe the drool off your mouth.

251
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:02,994
You sleep anywhere just like a dog.

252
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:07,456
That wasn't drool. I didn't sleep.

253
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:12,360
Hello.

254
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:14,067
Hello.

255
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:19,249
Why are you orange shirt and Room 102...

256
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:21,140
sticks together so early in the morning?

257
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,005
You didn't...

258
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:26,075
both come out from Room 102, did you?

259
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:28,814
I'm not wearing the orange shirt today.

260
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:29,861
You are right.

261
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:32,177
Don't hang out together
so early in the morning.

262
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,354
Are you okay?

263
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,908
Do you feel sick?

264
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:46,025
Why did you go alone to get LASIK?

265
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:47,800
What was Namil doing?

266
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:50,896
Why do I need anyone?

267
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:53,457
I am the only person I need.

268
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,589
Why don't you sit there?

269
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,524
Thank you.

270
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:20,994
Did your things not get delivered yet?

271
00:16:22,488 --> 00:16:23,914
I don't need much.

272
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:25,850
This is how I live.

273
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:29,134
You dress fancy,

274
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,486
but your home is so empty.

275
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,738
A house...

276
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,778
tends to become like the owner.

277
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:45,808
Can you even make something to eat?

278
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:47,828
It will be fine soon.

279
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:50,747
They said it will hurt
only in the beginning.

280
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,371
It's that woman from Rose Photo Studio.

281
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:22,028
That woman is living upstairs
from the children.

282
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:23,833
What?

283
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:26,374
Hwang Bokhee from Rose Photo Studio?

284
00:17:27,023 --> 00:17:28,195
Are you sure it's her?

285
00:17:28,285 --> 00:17:30,370
How could I forget her face?

286
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,735
How could I mistake her?

287
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:33,254
I am positive.

288
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:38,329
Honey.

289
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,952
When you slept over at Dongman's before...

290
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,546
Was it really to see Dongman?

291
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:46,948
Help me with the back.

292
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:49,393
Did you really go to see Dongman?

293
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:53,343
Why are you suddenly dying your hair?

294
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:55,298
What are you talking about?

295
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:57,290
Help me with the back.

296
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:00,530
Did you see someone else?

297
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:02,736
Like who?

298
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:06,305
What is it? Why are you staring at me?

299
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:07,742
Hwang Bokhee.

300
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:09,242
Who?

301
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:12,265
Bokhee from Rose Photo Studio.

302
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,958
You saw her, didn't you?

303
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,360
Hwang Bokhee?

304
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:17,692
Why?

305
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:20,428
Did she call us?

306
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:22,491
Did she ask for me?

307
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:25,963
By any chance,

308
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:29,362
did Namil live in Seosan
when he was little?

309
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:32,815
Why?

310
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,402
Doesn't he look familiar?

311
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,509
All babies look the same
because they have no hair.

312
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,670
Is that it?

313
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:48,517
But...

314
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,891
this side looks more familiar to me.

315
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:55,355
Is this you when you were young?

316
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:01,494
Dongman.

317
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:18,081
You guys...

318
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:22,514
Make me a cup of noodles before you go.

319
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:25,207
Okay.

320
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,599
Breast Cancer Prevention

321
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:41,389
Our landlady...

322
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:43,586
She appears all fancy on the outside,

323
00:19:43,905 --> 00:19:46,207
but she is like a lonely old woman
on the inside.

324
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:58,031
Why are you coming from up there?

325
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:00,842
-Look, Mr. Kim Namil.
-Don't.

326
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:03,656
Take better care of your mom.

327
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,512
On the day she is getting LASIK surgery...

328
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:09,062
you shouldn't be out eating chicken alone.

329
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:11,655
That's right. I think you need to
take a better care of her.

330
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,023
I own a chicken restaurant.

331
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:16,608
I worked all night.

332
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:19,492
I didn't know you own
a chicken restaurant.

333
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:22,675
Why do you two care about my mom?

334
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:24,901
Why were you coming from up there?

335
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,373
We prevented her accidental death...

336
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:28,642
Don't exaggerate.

337
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:30,641
...and we made her a cup noodles.

338
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:33,398
You two must be really nice person.

339
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:35,294
You are nosy...

340
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:37,178
and compassionate.

341
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:41,111
What a horrible way to say thank you.

342
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:52,380
Watch your step.

343
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:57,810
NAMIL LIVES IN NAMIL VILLA

344
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:00,572
Hey.

345
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:02,926
Does that jerk keep talking to you?

346
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:04,546
Did you say you are dating a fighter?

347
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:07,453
He does look at me with that certain gaze.

348
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:08,822
Are you sure?

349
00:21:10,497 --> 00:21:12,402
The last time, he was also...

350
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:14,128
Are you sure he was looking at you?

351
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:15,698
He was really looking at you?

352
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:18,298
Gosh! This little brat...

353
00:21:24,904 --> 00:21:26,572
Hey, it's me.

354
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,276
What? I am driving.

355
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:29,301
Listen.

356
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:31,883
Someone saw it.

357
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:33,214
What do you mean?

358
00:21:33,304 --> 00:21:34,895
Who saw what?

359
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:37,884
At the house the children live in.

360
00:21:37,974 --> 00:21:39,952
Just get to the point.

361
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:42,201
Don't call me at work...

362
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,833
and beat around the bush.

363
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:45,391
Hwang Bokhee.

364
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,713
Hwang Bokhee from Rose Photo Studio.

365
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:53,076
That's right.

366
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,852
Did you get LASIK surgery?

367
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:08,452
Why don't you just wear glasses?

368
00:22:09,553 --> 00:22:11,555
I don't look pretty with glasses on.

369
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:15,710
I want to be pretty until I die.

370
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:18,560
Stop eating cup noodles from now on.

371
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:26,419
Stop thinking about that child either.

372
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:28,378
What?

373
00:22:28,468 --> 00:22:31,409
I feel upset and I want to lash out.

374
00:22:36,445 --> 00:22:37,879
The real Namil...

375
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:42,937
...lives in Namil Villa.

376
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:45,377
Isn't it?

377
00:22:57,939 --> 00:22:59,796
Will you get a grip?

378
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,997
Why are you messing up
something this basic?

379
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:08,816
-I can't get a grip.
-What?

380
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:11,711
What are you talking about?

381
00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:15,925
Gosh, hey!

382
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:17,308
Your coffee...

383
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:20,990
I'm sorry.

384
00:23:22,422 --> 00:23:24,957
Seolhui is the only thing
missing in my life...

385
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:29,464
...but my whole life
starts to fall apart.

386
00:23:31,998 --> 00:23:35,101
Will you pick a background
and point color?

387
00:23:35,974 --> 00:23:38,300
I want a pink as the background...

388
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,739
and the point color is...

389
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:42,664
Please use black for the point color.

390
00:23:42,975 --> 00:23:44,339
-Okay.
-And also...

391
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:47,630
please use a lot of jewels, too.

392
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,607
Make it really sparkly.

393
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,185
Would you like to choose then?

394
00:23:53,055 --> 00:23:55,537
They are all priced differently.

395
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,496
Use the most expensive ones.

396
00:23:59,824 --> 00:24:00,717
Okay.

397
00:24:02,652 --> 00:24:04,354
Isn't this a new model?

398
00:24:04,948 --> 00:24:07,256
Yes, I just got it.

399
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:09,681
I got a new phone...

400
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,817
and I will fill it up again.

401
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,924
We got coaches to hone your ground skills.

402
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,359
Combine that with your judo moves,
and you will win for sure.

403
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:31,722
Are you sure...

404
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,411
...only Hwang Jangho
is training with Dongman?

405
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:38,612
They both did taekwondo.
How would they beat you?

406
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,653
They have no ground skills.

407
00:24:40,743 --> 00:24:43,650
I bet they spend the day
chatting and sparring.

408
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,190
Okay.

409
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:50,743
I am dying.

410
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,253
You might die first trying to train me.

411
00:24:58,518 --> 00:25:00,520
No, I will find you...

412
00:25:00,887 --> 00:25:03,330
a coach to teach you
ground skills exclusively...

413
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,741
even if it's part-time, so...

414
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:08,194
You must make a lot by selling sundae.

415
00:25:08,578 --> 00:25:09,534
It's...

416
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:10,916
sundae season right now.

417
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:13,608
Sundae doesn't have a season.

418
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:15,670
Don't look for a coach...

419
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,228
Don't make me talk.

420
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,503
I will...

421
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,131
ask around the jiujitsu...

422
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:23,085
and wrestling community,
so don't complain...

423
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:24,679
and just do as I say.

424
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,580
How can we help?

425
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,339
Do you want to lose weight...

426
00:25:43,217 --> 00:25:45,836
A three-month deal gets you a discount...

427
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:53,206
Byungju, stop training and go home.

428
00:25:54,082 --> 00:25:55,772
Well done...

429
00:26:01,914 --> 00:26:02,914
So...

430
00:26:05,193 --> 00:26:06,623
Did you spend some money?

431
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:09,431
I tried to bribe people, but...
My goodness!

432
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:12,183
The RFC's new representative
is a stickler.

433
00:26:12,358 --> 00:26:14,305
He apparently lived abroad.

434
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:16,876
-I can't get through him.
-Then...

435
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:21,529
You should make him get the message.

436
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:24,347
Make him want to talk to me.

437
00:26:24,437 --> 00:26:26,572
Give him a bigger wad of money.

438
00:26:29,198 --> 00:26:31,167
You are turning into a real scoundrel.

439
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,373
Coach Choi...

440
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,118
Why are you exaggerating?

441
00:26:39,385 --> 00:26:42,291
Win or lose, do one or the other.

442
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:44,700
Don't act like a scoundrel.

443
00:26:45,162 --> 00:26:47,951
If the guy I trained for 15 years
goes down a scoundrel,

444
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,846
I will also look bad.

445
00:26:53,223 --> 00:26:54,224
Coach.

446
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:58,993
You should watch what you say.

447
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,576
You are my coach and I am your student,

448
00:27:04,473 --> 00:27:07,223
but I am also your employer
and you are my employee.

449
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:08,253
Hey.

450
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:10,993
Fire me if you want, you punk!

451
00:27:14,323 --> 00:27:15,252
Coach...

452
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:18,133
Gosh.

453
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:20,502
Fine, just fire him.

454
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,373
I never liked him.

455
00:27:22,504 --> 00:27:24,828
-Then, you leave.
-What?

456
00:27:25,198 --> 00:27:27,800
You can be replaced, but Coach Choi...

457
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,744
...is irreplaceable.

458
00:27:32,323 --> 00:27:36,653
We can always find another coach.
You hurt my feelings.

459
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:40,438
Do you know how Hwang Jangho
won silver in the Olympics?

460
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:44,613
It's because that man won gold.

461
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:51,298
John... Karellas?

462
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:56,663
Do you know him?

463
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,188
This tattoo is their mark.

464
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:05,550
The best Brazilian jiujitsu families,

465
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,763
the Karellas.

466
00:28:07,263 --> 00:28:09,405
You fought the second son.

467
00:28:10,374 --> 00:28:12,992
The nephew he taught for fun...

468
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:14,759
...is the UFC legend,

469
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:16,270
John Karellas.

470
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:25,153
I'm Karl.

471
00:28:25,243 --> 00:28:28,402
My father lost all our family's money
from gambling.

472
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:31,174
We needed money for my wife's surgery,

473
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:33,166
so we had an embarrassing fight.

474
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:35,782
I'm ashamed and heartbroken.

475
00:28:36,202 --> 00:28:38,788
I will sacrifice my body to pay you back.

476
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:41,303
My nephew is better than me.

477
00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:42,652
Good luck.

478
00:28:42,742 --> 00:28:43,836
Does this mean...

479
00:28:44,437 --> 00:28:46,999
UFC legend John Karellas...

480
00:28:47,316 --> 00:28:48,615
...wants to teach you?

481
00:28:48,705 --> 00:28:50,260
I think so.

482
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,146
It is a working visa.

483
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:54,987
Two months.

484
00:28:56,122 --> 00:28:58,091
Guess what, hyung.

485
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,309
I think I might just win.

486
00:29:02,762 --> 00:29:03,725
Thank you.

487
00:29:03,815 --> 00:29:05,023
Thank you, thank you.

488
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:23,689
Your pink phone, pink nails,

489
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:26,358
and pink face look like a set.

490
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:27,988
Really?

491
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:33,686
I used to have a fungus on my fingernails.

492
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:35,928
Of course it's all gone now.

493
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:37,558
I see.

494
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:40,663
My nails got a little wonky...

495
00:29:40,753 --> 00:29:45,341
and I got too embarrassed
to ask buyers for handshakes.

496
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:46,776
I see.

497
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:47,937
Yes, so...

498
00:29:48,027 --> 00:29:49,231
I don't go often,

499
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:50,952
but only sometimes.

500
00:29:51,218 --> 00:29:52,096
Okay.

501
00:29:53,318 --> 00:29:54,395
Can you...

502
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:57,870
...keep it to yourself?

503
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,069
I won't tell even though
we don't have pinky swear.

504
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:06,526
But I am already waiting.

505
00:30:08,953 --> 00:30:09,966
Then,

506
00:30:10,431 --> 00:30:12,821
I won't tell anybody
you got a nail art...

507
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,799
I mean, you got your nails done
because of nail fungus.

508
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:20,593
I don't have nail fungus anymore.

509
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:22,249
I just...

510
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,418
I understand.

511
00:30:24,646 --> 00:30:26,981
I have short and ugly nails.

512
00:30:27,211 --> 00:30:28,139
That's not true.

513
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:29,334
You are pretty.

514
00:30:30,168 --> 00:30:31,377
Your hands are pretty too.

515
00:30:31,737 --> 00:30:32,680
Pardon?

516
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:36,483
You are pretty all over.

517
00:30:38,252 --> 00:30:40,213
You are pretty all over,

518
00:30:40,303 --> 00:30:43,211
and you even remember my name.

519
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:46,216
I am happy.

520
00:30:47,307 --> 00:30:49,977
Do you think I am pretty?

521
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:53,106
Didn't you know?

522
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:57,677
You... are very pretty.

523
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:21,754
When?

524
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,666
I am sorry, Mr. Kim.

525
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:42,447
That day, it was my...

526
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:43,571
Yejin.

527
00:31:44,883 --> 00:31:46,407
Do you want to go out for a drink?

528
00:31:57,776 --> 00:31:59,937
Come on, get up! Is that all you got?

529
00:32:11,984 --> 00:32:13,052
Wait.

530
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:14,953
Tap. Tap, tap, tap.

531
00:32:15,382 --> 00:32:16,571
Tap.

532
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:18,588
No tap, Dongman. No tap.

533
00:32:18,678 --> 00:32:20,326
No tap when you're with me.

534
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:21,944
John, tap.

535
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:24,297
I want to tap. Yes tap.

536
00:32:25,328 --> 00:32:26,328
Stop.

537
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:29,179
Look at him, Coach.

538
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:34,355
I am...

539
00:32:37,463 --> 00:32:38,528
Coach.

540
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:41,698
He keeps on going even when I tap out.

541
00:32:41,788 --> 00:32:44,500
He will kill me. He won't go easy.

542
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,411
If it's that bad,
try saying it in English.

543
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,112
-What did you say?
-If you don't know English,

544
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,507
you can't help but to handle it.

545
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:52,898
I can't help you.

546
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:54,432
Gosh.

547
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:57,997
Why didn't they make
athletes study back then?

548
00:32:58,307 --> 00:33:00,757
He should be compensated by the country.

549
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:01,998
Dongman.

550
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:05,612
You will master three finishing techniques
within two months.

551
00:33:06,827 --> 00:33:07,828
Three?

552
00:33:08,741 --> 00:33:09,696
Three?

553
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:10,798
Okay.

554
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:15,551
Enjoy your food.

555
00:33:15,641 --> 00:33:16,560
Thank you.

556
00:33:21,694 --> 00:33:22,882
Anyhow,

557
00:33:23,411 --> 00:33:25,890
I am responsible for your breakup.

558
00:33:26,258 --> 00:33:28,427
You were swayed by me too.

559
00:33:30,662 --> 00:33:32,897
It might be difficult for you now,

560
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:35,241
but I will wait for you.

561
00:33:36,569 --> 00:33:37,586
Yejin.

562
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:41,521
After a very long time,

563
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:43,781
I might meet someone other than Seolhui,

564
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:45,046
but even then...

565
00:33:46,072 --> 00:33:47,440
...it won't be you.

566
00:33:48,847 --> 00:33:49,771
Sorry?

567
00:33:51,224 --> 00:33:52,364
Why not?

568
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:56,222
You will keep reminding me of her,
so how could I date you?

569
00:33:57,123 --> 00:33:58,973
What do you mean?

570
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,579
It's not that I couldn't date you
because of Seolhui.

571
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:05,271
I was swayed by you because of Seolhui.

572
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:07,967
You reminded me of Seolhui in the past.

573
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:10,706
When you broke the copier,
got into an accident,

574
00:34:10,796 --> 00:34:12,897
and got your skirt ripped
when you were drunk,

575
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:15,708
I couldn't ignore you.

576
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:20,619
I think I broke it again.

577
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:23,503
Why do I always cause problems?

578
00:34:25,385 --> 00:34:27,329
Why do I always cause problems?

579
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:29,300
I like you so much!

580
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,081
I want your attention.

581
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:33,643
I like you so much, Manager Kim.

582
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:35,602
I want your attention.

583
00:34:39,365 --> 00:34:41,300
It wasn't because you liked me?

584
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:44,015
That was why?

585
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,619
It was my mistake.

586
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,822
So, it doesn't mean that
I have intention of dating you...

587
00:34:53,165 --> 00:34:55,046
because I broke up with Seolhui.

588
00:34:55,782 --> 00:34:57,450
This is why I wanted to talk to you.

589
00:35:23,676 --> 00:35:24,607
Hey.

590
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,947
You shouldn't go on a date
by a food truck.

591
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:38,138
The date has been set already.

592
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:41,920
I'm turning 30 next year.

593
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:47,020
I think I should finish
my 20s with passion.

594
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:54,320
There is no guarantee
I will be better next year.

595
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:00,586
Let's try something.

596
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,042
Aera doesn't like it.

597
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,805
I don't want you to do it.

598
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:14,141
Don't talk about passion
or anything like garbage.

599
00:36:15,426 --> 00:36:16,387
Please?

600
00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:18,499
Please...?

601
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:25,616
Dongman is upset.

602
00:36:27,774 --> 00:36:32,062
Aera keeps saying, "Dongman, fight no no."

603
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:34,788
That makes me upset. I am so upset.

604
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:41,053
He is mad that Aera won't let him fight

605
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:47,418
Dongman,

606
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:49,493
I am holding a knife.

607
00:36:49,723 --> 00:36:51,022
Darn it.

608
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:09,272
Results of Cheongju KBC
Announcer Interview

609
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:13,014
You have passed the second interview

610
00:37:13,953 --> 00:37:14,987
What?

611
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,303
Why did they pass me?

612
00:37:19,506 --> 00:37:22,192
I messed it up, but why...?

613
00:37:29,235 --> 00:37:30,269
Aera.

614
00:37:32,845 --> 00:37:33,823
What is it?

615
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:35,982
Well...

616
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:38,364
What is it?

617
00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:39,599
Well...

618
00:37:40,653 --> 00:37:43,723
This address was on the GPS.

619
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:49,107
Dongman was on the show,
but I didn't give him the gift card.

620
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:52,931
I got his address
to send it to him by mail.

621
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:57,010
So, I wanted to talk to him...

622
00:37:57,203 --> 00:37:58,371
About what?

623
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:00,720
He won't be on your show.

624
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,046
Take this first then. These are fruits.

625
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:08,508
There are strawberries too.
I know you like strawberries.

626
00:38:17,156 --> 00:38:19,525
I don't eat strawberries since that day.

627
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:23,531
Aera,

628
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:26,369
I am not the same Jang Kyungkoo anymore.

629
00:38:27,065 --> 00:38:29,645
The reason why I really wanted
to see you and Dongman...

630
00:38:29,735 --> 00:38:30,705
I don't believe...

631
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:33,031
...that people change.

632
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,148
Don't ever come here again.

633
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:46,426
She's making me so mad.

634
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,803
Hey, push for the broadcast.

635
00:38:59,002 --> 00:39:01,622
I will take care of it. Just do it.

636
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:06,733
Don't cry.

637
00:39:07,687 --> 00:39:11,750
I am going to make fun of you until
your third grandson becomes an adult.

638
00:39:13,738 --> 00:39:14,653
What is it?

639
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:16,969
What? Why?

640
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,267
Do you feel like you are going to die?

641
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,059
Is your whole world falling apart?

642
00:39:21,578 --> 00:39:23,780
You know how people say
you have a diaphragm,

643
00:39:24,276 --> 00:39:26,745
but you don't feel or
have any problems with it,

644
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,667
so you don't know it's there.

645
00:39:29,783 --> 00:39:31,818
It's like that's gone now.

646
00:39:33,053 --> 00:39:34,566
I can't breathe.

647
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,906
Why are you mentioning your diaphragm?

648
00:39:36,996 --> 00:39:38,297
Did you go to medical school?

649
00:39:38,932 --> 00:39:40,740
You die without it.

650
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,299
It's a scary thing.

651
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,489
The diaphragm?

652
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:49,867
Don't act like you know.

653
00:39:50,794 --> 00:39:51,782
Diaphragm.

654
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,562
I know how that feels.

655
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:57,053
No, he doesn't.

656
00:39:57,143 --> 00:39:58,479
He never had a girlfriend.

657
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:01,045
What? Use what?

658
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:02,320
I use that too.

659
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,047
I've used that. I am like it so much.

660
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:05,205
I mean...

661
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:07,369
See? He has no idea.

662
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:08,504
He was always single.

663
00:40:10,456 --> 00:40:11,593
Let's drink.

664
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:13,319
Let's drink.

665
00:40:19,072 --> 00:40:21,307
You must really like sundae.

666
00:40:31,004 --> 00:40:32,505
What are you doing?

667
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,688
I was hungry.

668
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:37,460
Do you want this too?

669
00:40:38,031 --> 00:40:40,800
Can't you be bold like your usual self?

670
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,062
Be cool and give me your support.

671
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:51,731
I was never cool.

672
00:40:52,812 --> 00:40:55,081
When I think about you
getting beat by Taksu,

673
00:40:55,308 --> 00:40:57,210
it makes me feel queasy.

674
00:40:59,172 --> 00:41:00,840
I wish you wouldn't do it.

675
00:41:01,761 --> 00:41:04,063
You had moved on and you forgot about him.

676
00:41:04,684 --> 00:41:07,387
Don't fight Taksu again.

677
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:09,840
I never forgot about him,
not for a single day.

678
00:41:11,514 --> 00:41:12,350
What?

679
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,808
I acted like I forgot doing
the many odd jobs.

680
00:41:16,663 --> 00:41:18,732
Even when I was dead beat tired,

681
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:22,922
I kept on dreaming about
November 3rd, 2007.

682
00:41:24,404 --> 00:41:27,106
I would always be at that match.

683
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:31,010
I would lose every time.

684
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:33,760
I'd fall, and I wouldn't get up.

685
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:36,669
Hey...

686
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:38,337
When I opened my eyes,

687
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:40,596
I acted like...

688
00:41:41,092 --> 00:41:42,660
I was fine and went to work.

689
00:41:44,243 --> 00:41:47,162
I just kept on going
and went on with my life.

690
00:41:49,595 --> 00:41:51,617
I acted like I wasn't thinking.

691
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:53,329
I only went out to kill ticks.

692
00:41:55,315 --> 00:41:59,529
You are the best simpleton I know.
Why didn't you tell me you were suffering?

693
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:00,503
It took me...

694
00:42:01,614 --> 00:42:04,183
...ten years to get back in the ring.

695
00:42:06,998 --> 00:42:08,734
Just let me do it. Please?

696
00:42:11,163 --> 00:42:13,065
You are such a pain.

697
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,459
Why did I have to move to Seosan?

698
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:18,375
We should have moved to Dangjin.

699
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:27,905
Seolhui.

700
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,491
If you want to quit, just walk out.

701
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:32,621
Just call me after you get out.

702
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:35,214
No matter where you are,
I will find you in an hour.

703
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:38,355
I wish you were a man.

704
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:43,250
Hurry up.

705
00:42:46,672 --> 00:42:47,940
By the way, Aera.

706
00:42:48,988 --> 00:42:50,051
You two...

707
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:51,710
...shouldn't date.

708
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:53,250
What?

709
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,319
Men and women change.

710
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:58,792
I don't want you two to become like us.

711
00:42:59,432 --> 00:43:00,520
To me,

712
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:03,399
you guys look the happiest right now.

713
00:43:14,193 --> 00:43:15,177
Open up.

714
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:30,236
Don't try anything funny.

715
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,460
Hurry, hurry, hurry,

716
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,987
hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

717
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,881
What about Seolhui?

718
00:43:48,901 --> 00:43:50,236
She went to work.

719
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:52,211
Is she okay?

720
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:53,711
Of course not.

721
00:43:55,227 --> 00:43:58,965
I feel so bad for her,
I can't tell her about us.

722
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:02,133
I couldn't tell Juman either.

723
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:07,505
By the way,

724
00:44:07,822 --> 00:44:09,939
what are you going to do
about Jang Kyungkoo?

725
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:13,306
I will talk to him in person and decline.

726
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,162
What about Kim Taksu?

727
00:44:20,434 --> 00:44:22,035
I didn't ask for a kiss.

728
00:44:24,096 --> 00:44:25,532
So, you...

729
00:44:26,193 --> 00:44:27,604
...have the interview today?

730
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,756
Is it what you really want to do?

731
00:44:30,523 --> 00:44:32,091
Don't change the subject.

732
00:44:32,425 --> 00:44:35,003
If you really fight him,
I won't see you anymore.

733
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:38,055
No more kisses. It'd be over.

734
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:44,503
I don't need you to do anything for me.

735
00:44:52,478 --> 00:44:53,371
Get on.

736
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,591
Pardon?

737
00:44:56,684 --> 00:44:57,868
I will drive you.

738
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:02,388
-You don't know where...
-It doesn't matter.

739
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:04,724
I will drive you anyway.

740
00:45:06,532 --> 00:45:07,484
Why?

741
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,382
I am interested in you.

742
00:45:11,798 --> 00:45:13,339
It's bothering me,

743
00:45:15,835 --> 00:45:17,237
but it's also interesting.

744
00:45:18,597 --> 00:45:20,649
You should know that
my boyfriend is a fighter.

745
00:45:22,075 --> 00:45:23,645
Also, I am a psycho.

746
00:45:26,546 --> 00:45:27,390
A psycho?

747
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,784
Also, I hate handsome and rude men.

748
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:32,465
Am I handsome?

749
00:45:33,092 --> 00:45:33,991
Anyway,

750
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:36,004
I have no interest in you and...

751
00:45:36,094 --> 00:45:37,763
You never know.

752
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:42,462
You might end up seeing me forever.

753
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:44,703
Have you been drinking?

754
00:45:54,007 --> 00:45:55,796
Ladies and gentlemen!

755
00:45:55,983 --> 00:45:57,726
In a few minutes,

756
00:45:57,816 --> 00:46:01,514
Korea's MMA tournament
is scheduled to begin here.

757
00:46:01,614 --> 00:46:04,584
Welcome and thank you for attending.

758
00:46:05,957 --> 00:46:08,464
Everyone's hearts race
after a tournament ends,

759
00:46:08,554 --> 00:46:11,197
the announcer to say the first words...

760
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,166
must be passionate like no other.

761
00:46:38,158 --> 00:46:39,429
I need my stuff...

762
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:42,410
FROM SEOLHUI

763
00:47:17,744 --> 00:47:20,613
This bamboo salt spray
is good for rhinitis.

764
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:23,081
Does it only have bamboo salt in it?

765
00:47:26,132 --> 00:47:27,073
Here.

766
00:47:29,035 --> 00:47:30,239
What is it?

767
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:31,513
It stings.

768
00:47:31,603 --> 00:47:32,843
Does it hurt?

769
00:47:32,946 --> 00:47:33,947
Blow it out.

770
00:48:26,578 --> 00:48:30,267
I just want to enjoy the small things
with you like now...

771
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:32,416
-and just be lovey dovey...
-Small things?

772
00:48:35,796 --> 00:48:36,931
Small things...

773
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,435
Why must happiness be so small?

774
00:49:06,354 --> 00:49:08,990
The small things that Seolhui said,

775
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,117
that sacrifice was kind...

776
00:49:12,171 --> 00:49:13,939
and it wasn't small.

777
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:16,563
It filled up the whole place.

778
00:49:35,901 --> 00:49:36,936
Explain this.

779
00:49:37,337 --> 00:49:38,316
What?

780
00:49:38,657 --> 00:49:42,001
You practically lived with me.
Why is this all I have?

781
00:49:42,258 --> 00:49:48,107
You just wore my worn-out shirts and
why do you use only free samples?

782
00:49:49,442 --> 00:49:51,511
I hated that you did this!

783
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,350
Seeing you do this...

784
00:49:53,676 --> 00:49:55,921
made me want to get promoted
and made me work harder,

785
00:49:56,011 --> 00:49:58,572
so that you wouldn't act so poor.

786
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,664
Did I ever ask for that?

787
00:50:01,183 --> 00:50:02,172
Did I say that mattered?

788
00:50:02,262 --> 00:50:04,173
It didn't matter to you, but it did to me!

789
00:50:04,263 --> 00:50:05,217
Sure.

790
00:50:06,104 --> 00:50:07,406
I am sure it did.

791
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:13,404
Your blogger friends live
in nice houses, have nice sinks,

792
00:50:13,785 --> 00:50:15,702
and bake cookies in nice ovens,

793
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:18,588
and you post comments
that their houses are nice.

794
00:50:18,738 --> 00:50:22,067
Did I ever say I envied any of them?

795
00:50:22,157 --> 00:50:23,993
I just hated that.

796
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:28,771
That's why I found all those businesses
with popular items...

797
00:50:28,861 --> 00:50:30,563
and worked hard to make commission.

798
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:32,393
I guess...

799
00:50:32,816 --> 00:50:34,592
I was just a burden to you.

800
00:50:35,588 --> 00:50:38,024
Is that why you delayed
our wedding for six years?

801
00:50:39,585 --> 00:50:40,586
Seolhui.

802
00:50:42,535 --> 00:50:44,870
How could I make you live in a studio?

803
00:50:49,515 --> 00:50:51,283
Look, I knew...

804
00:50:53,052 --> 00:50:55,029
I couldn't give you the best of the best,

805
00:50:56,649 --> 00:50:58,685
but I wanted to give you
at least the average.

806
00:51:01,288 --> 00:51:03,189
It hurt my pride too much...

807
00:51:05,485 --> 00:51:07,754
...to say something this pathetic,

808
00:51:10,254 --> 00:51:12,513
but I wanted to have
at least an annual lease.

809
00:51:12,905 --> 00:51:13,805
However...

810
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:19,372
I worked to the bone for six years,

811
00:51:25,036 --> 00:51:26,905
but that "average" was too hard to reach.

812
00:52:22,529 --> 00:52:23,697
Namil?

813
00:52:29,127 --> 00:52:31,125
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

814
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:33,089
-Here.
-Thank you.

815
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:34,168
That should be right.

816
00:52:34,258 --> 00:52:35,259
Okay.

817
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:39,983
Why don't you ever pick up
the bowl from upstairs?

818
00:52:40,734 --> 00:52:41,969
I always do.

819
00:52:42,602 --> 00:52:43,461
What?

820
00:52:43,849 --> 00:52:45,642
She orders every day.

821
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:46,810
I see.

822
00:52:46,933 --> 00:52:48,295
Why are you asking?

823
00:52:51,804 --> 00:52:54,613
If you know each other,
would you order together?

824
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,395
She always orders just one bowl.

825
00:52:57,837 --> 00:52:59,872
Have you ever seen her?

826
00:53:00,646 --> 00:53:03,349
She pays on the app and says to leave it.

827
00:53:04,298 --> 00:53:06,533
She hasn't been ordering
the past few days.

828
00:53:08,207 --> 00:53:09,275
Let's go in.

829
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:13,887
-Enjoy the food!
-Thank you.

830
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,767
Oppa...

831
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:30,990
What is this?

832
00:53:32,593 --> 00:53:34,228
You said you'd never return.

833
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:36,638
What are you thinking?

834
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:38,896
I never planned on coming back.

835
00:53:40,766 --> 00:53:44,003
Imagine how bad it was that I did.

836
00:53:44,904 --> 00:53:45,920
Darn it.

837
00:53:59,218 --> 00:54:03,417
I got a text from Cheongju KBC
for the final round of interviews,

838
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:04,977
and RFC called too...

839
00:54:05,067 --> 00:54:06,423
that I made the final round.

840
00:54:07,426 --> 00:54:09,995
Maybe we should have celebrated tonight.

841
00:54:10,745 --> 00:54:11,616
But...

842
00:54:12,278 --> 00:54:13,624
they are both on Friday.

843
00:54:15,423 --> 00:54:16,424
What will you do?

844
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:18,031
I don't know.

845
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:20,580
I have to think about it.

846
00:54:24,783 --> 00:54:25,888
Is that for Seolhui?

847
00:54:26,446 --> 00:54:27,580
She isn't feeling well.

848
00:54:28,134 --> 00:54:29,135
Then Juman?

849
00:54:29,815 --> 00:54:31,250
Why would I bring him food?

850
00:54:32,165 --> 00:54:33,500
Don't tell me...

851
00:54:37,037 --> 00:54:37,901
Yeah.

852
00:54:38,053 --> 00:54:39,339
It's for the woman upstairs.

853
00:54:44,538 --> 00:54:45,739
Oppa...

854
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,881
What are you thinking?

855
00:55:03,254 --> 00:55:05,160
What are you doing here?

856
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,266
Who is it now?

857
00:55:19,906 --> 00:55:21,040
Ma'am.

858
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:28,998
Maybe she's out.

859
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,398
Maybe we should pretend no one's home.

860
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:35,299
No.

861
00:55:37,545 --> 00:55:38,498
She's home.

862
00:55:38,588 --> 00:55:39,963
She just turned off the light.

863
00:55:40,994 --> 00:55:41,995
You're right.

864
00:55:43,903 --> 00:55:45,071
You idiot.

865
00:55:49,034 --> 00:55:50,028
What do we do?

866
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:55,468
Is the bell broken?

867
00:55:57,069 --> 00:55:58,170
Ma'am?

868
00:55:58,819 --> 00:56:00,087
Delivery.

869
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:06,473
What is it? What?

870
00:56:07,794 --> 00:56:09,232
Let me bring this in.

871
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:10,837
-No.
-Excuse me.

872
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,221
Wait. What are you guys doing?

873
00:56:14,311 --> 00:56:17,548
It's awkward ordering just one dish.

874
00:56:18,538 --> 00:56:19,508
I never requested this.

875
00:56:19,598 --> 00:56:21,066
Do you like to pour or dip?

876
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:23,292
-Pour.
-I see.

877
00:56:28,214 --> 00:56:30,830
Is someone else here?

878
00:56:31,851 --> 00:56:33,720
Who would be here?

879
00:56:35,195 --> 00:56:37,130
Namil isn't home?

880
00:56:37,646 --> 00:56:38,718
Namil?

881
00:56:39,012 --> 00:56:40,747
Is that him?

882
00:56:49,509 --> 00:56:50,371
What's going on?

883
00:56:50,715 --> 00:56:52,252
Why are they here?

884
00:57:00,807 --> 00:57:01,784
Why?

885
00:57:02,382 --> 00:57:03,505
Someone...

886
00:57:04,226 --> 00:57:05,477
...is in here.

887
00:57:08,194 --> 00:57:09,295
I don't understand...

888
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:13,115
why do I have to hide in here with you?

889
00:57:13,205 --> 00:57:14,640
It's hurting my pride.

890
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:17,844
Same goes for me.

891
00:57:20,015 --> 00:57:22,554
Wait. You dropped it off, so leave.

892
00:57:22,644 --> 00:57:23,856
Hold on.

893
00:57:26,846 --> 00:57:29,337
There were several
break-ins nearby lately.

894
00:57:54,459 --> 00:57:55,827
Pull your toes in.

895
00:58:33,818 --> 00:58:37,403
She's got incredible survival instincts.

896
00:58:45,497 --> 00:58:47,800
Why couldn't she go home to sleep?

897
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,276
Why is she torturing me?

898
00:58:51,871 --> 00:58:55,117
How does she fall asleep
so easily anywhere?

899
00:59:13,246 --> 00:59:14,547
Aren't you going home?

900
00:59:15,388 --> 00:59:16,802
Wake up!

901
00:59:17,182 --> 00:59:19,051
You will get mosquito bites!

902
00:59:29,755 --> 00:59:30,771
Darn it.
