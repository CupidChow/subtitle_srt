1
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:04,635
Aera.

2
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:06,341
I'm telling you to stop.

3
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:09,086
Aera!

4
00:00:12,086 --> 00:00:13,146
What's wrong?

5
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:17,427
Dongman.

6
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:19,941
What's wrong?

7
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:21,304
What is it?

8
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:23,380
Tell me what is it?

9
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:27,546
Why are you...

10
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:32,119
Why are you talking like that?

11
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:35,059
What?

12
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:38,746
Why won't you make a sound?

13
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:42,493
Why is everything so silent?

14
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,231
Why?

15
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:48,613
Why is it so quiet?

16
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:49,641
Why?

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,410
The storm passed,

18
00:00:54,947 --> 00:00:57,247
and the world grew dark.

19
00:01:01,346 --> 00:01:02,542
EPISODE 15

20
00:01:10,993 --> 00:01:13,493
I wasn't expecting you.

21
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:15,913
Lie down.

22
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,536
What?

23
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,386
I said to lie down.

24
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:24,382
Shouldn't we talk first?

25
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:26,872
You can't treat your own back.

26
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,380
Why did you do it?

27
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:52,453
Why...

28
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:58,703
Why did you...

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,100
You are being ridiculous right now.

30
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:27,127
Seolhui, it's okay with me...

31
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,119
...if you date Kim Chanho.

32
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,239
What?

33
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:38,265
I will wait.

34
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:42,226
I wish you wouldn't go out with him,

35
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:45,759
but even if you do,

36
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:49,304
I will wait for you.

37
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,336
You can hurt me.

38
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:56,259
You can hurt me all you want,

39
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,166
but I will still wait for you.

40
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:05,559
Do I have to go out
with Kim Chanho just to hurt you?

41
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:19,657
I will...

42
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:24,859
...wait for you until I turn 50.

43
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,006
Do as you wish.

44
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:30,406
I'm not the same Baek Seolhui from before.

45
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:33,413
I won't fall for your lame tricks.

46
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,927
Seolhui, why are you
keep talking like Aera?

47
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:38,819
Back in the Joseon era,

48
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:42,247
they even branded people for cheating.

49
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,479
You stubbed your toe
while moving Yejin's packages,

50
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,749
and you burned your back
because of the coal today.

51
00:03:54,606 --> 00:03:56,750
You are being punished.

52
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,156
So I don't feel bad one bit.

53
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:02,120
I am just putting ointment on it for you.

54
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:04,896
Get down.

55
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,912
What?

56
00:04:07,002 --> 00:04:08,772
Get down.

57
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:30,029
What happened?

58
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:32,496
Is he okay?

59
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,526
He has a concussion,
which is why he couldn't hear temporarily.

60
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:41,122
Based on the scans,

61
00:04:41,212 --> 00:04:45,182
the damage isn't severe,
so he will be fine soon.

62
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:50,673
Thank you.

63
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,140
But the problem is...

64
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:57,709
there is a hairline fracture
in his temporal region.

65
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:01,866
To be honest,

66
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:05,799
I cried a little
when I saw that flip phone.

67
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:07,938
A little?

68
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:11,156
No, I cried a lot.

69
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,915
That flip phone is the only way to show...

70
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,850
how the real Hwang Bokhee's life was...

71
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:23,166
rather than the clown Hwang Bokhee.

72
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:27,448
Keep it safe for now.

73
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:31,421
I thought...

74
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,582
you were a warrior...

75
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:37,649
who wasn't fazed by anything.

76
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,519
It turns out I am a loser?

77
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:41,302
Not at all.

78
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:42,658
You seem even cooler.

79
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,400
When...

80
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,589
I was young,

81
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,084
I was an assistant at Rose Photo Studio.

82
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:56,433
I just really liked
being in front of the camera.

83
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,039
When I met my husband,
I decided to give it up,

84
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:06,404
but the fire within me wouldn't go out.

85
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:10,459
I wanted to be in front of the camera...

86
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:12,079
and be an actress.

87
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:13,806
So that's why...

88
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,067
you auditioned for that movie.

89
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:19,426
I heard the odds were a thousand to one.

90
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:24,734
I hid it in order to beat
that 1,000 to 1 odd.

91
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,540
Back then,

92
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,660
...no one wanted
a new actress with a child.

93
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:36,670
That's when my life
started to get messed up.

94
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,810
Come on.

95
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,696
It wasn't completely messed up.

96
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:42,094
You were the fairy
in the posters in my room.

97
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:43,544
The path I chose...

98
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,016
...was a thorny one.

99
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,986
Dongman, it's time to eat.

100
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,749
Wake up already.

101
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:37,066
Dongman slept for days.

102
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,389
Eat.

103
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,779
From your First Lady, Choi.

104
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,225
Let's see how he does in the next round.

105
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:14,884
Please give him a big round of applause.

106
00:08:15,846 --> 00:08:16,846
That's right.

107
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:58,746
Wearing a red hat

108
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:04,053
I am a clown that always smiles

109
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,374
Behind...

110
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,516
the blue smile

111
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:17,208
THE CLOWN ALWAYS SMILES AT US

112
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:22,719
Will I really be on TV?

113
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,275
It's an MMA show,

114
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:26,229
so the demographic is small,

115
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:29,149
but it's a famous show among fans.

116
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:33,039
But why am I...?

117
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,735
We have always had male hosts,

118
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,010
and they all seem the same after a while.

119
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,296
Above all else,

120
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:42,445
I thought you'd shown innovation and spunk.

121
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:43,735
So I recommended you.

122
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:47,378
The director approved you right away
after he saw your video.

123
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:23,369
It's a bit pricey...

124
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:26,990
...to sell on a home shopping show,

125
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,244
so we could throw in sauces
to make it a package.

126
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:34,821
Mr. Kim, would you like the claws
and the gut separately?

127
00:10:34,911 --> 00:10:35,971
Sure.

128
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:39,550
Gosh. Anyhow...

129
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,929
we should give customers more options
to make a strategic approach.

130
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:46,303
What strategy?

131
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,443
Mr. Kim, are you okay?

132
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:56,235
One moment please.

133
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,329
Are you crying?

134
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:01,370
It's my first pay.

135
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,409
I wanted to treat you to something nice,
so I looked all over Cheongdam-dong.

136
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,429
-Juman.
-What should we get?

137
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,605
Cheese?

138
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:10,045
Chili?

139
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,620
I heard from somewhere...

140
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:19,586
that steamed cockroaches
taste the same as lobsters.

141
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:21,296
What?

142
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:22,310
I mean,

143
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,436
I am a bit grossed out,
so I can't eat this.

144
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:26,186
Let's go somewhere else.

145
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,116
You're worried about
the bill, aren't you?

146
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:31,501
It isn't like that.

147
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,610
Isn't 57,000 won too much though?

148
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,440
It's just an insect from the sea.

149
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:39,679
Seolhui, can't we just enjoy our time?

150
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,392
Please?

151
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,733
Sure. Go ahead and order.

152
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:50,901
Here.

153
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:56,891
Why are you giving me the whole thing?

154
00:11:57,686 --> 00:11:59,346
Are you going to eat fries only?

155
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,544
What?

156
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Whenever you do this,

157
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,779
I get kind of emotional.

158
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:08,710
What's wrong, Juman?

159
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,827
Why is your nose flaring again?

160
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:14,247
Why are you making me look like a bad guy?

161
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:18,030
Don't do that. You will upset me.

162
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,529
Fine.

163
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:21,059
I will eat the tail.

164
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:24,597
Forget it.

165
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:25,719
Just...

166
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:48,183
Stop this.

167
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:50,459
You should stop now.

168
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:54,590
Seolhui, I cried at work today.
I made a fool out of myself.

169
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,583
I know.

170
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:57,054
It's the talk of the office.

171
00:12:57,632 --> 00:13:00,392
Chanho knows we used to date now.

172
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,686
That's a good thing...

173
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:03,846
What?

174
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:06,947
We dated for six years
and we had two bad months,

175
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,009
but the rest was really good.

176
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:10,529
Can you forget all of that?

177
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:12,659
I missed the six years we dated for,

178
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:15,481
but because of the last two months,

179
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:17,457
I don't want to go back to it.

180
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,147
I can't bear...

181
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:22,969
...to see you changing.

182
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:27,962
You changed too.

183
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:32,816
Why are you acting like you didn't?

184
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:34,630
How did I change?

185
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,489
You were never worried about anything
and naive just like a pure...

186
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:39,926
white puppy.

187
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:41,409
Why are you talking about a puppy?

188
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:45,516
After you met me, you became mature and
started becoming conscious of yourself.

189
00:13:46,273 --> 00:13:50,620
Whenever you did that, I blamed myself,
and it was painful for me.

190
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,620
That's right.

191
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,596
The puppy changed and you did too.

192
00:13:53,686 --> 00:13:55,059
-So...
-No.

193
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,250
I don't want to.

194
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,155
-I can't break up with you.
-What?

195
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:01,551
You said you don't have regrets
because you tried, right?

196
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,602
I am going to try everything I can too
so that I don't regret it.

197
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:06,186
I am going to cling on.

198
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,059
So take this.

199
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,233
I love you so much and
I won't get married to anybody else.

200
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:20,983
Also, I need some ointment today,

201
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:22,949
so come up right away.

202
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,405
If I get infected,

203
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:25,999
I will die.

204
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:34,972
Hello.

205
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:36,749
-Thank you.
-Yes.

206
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,326
Before we start the broadcast,
we will conduct a short interview.

207
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,416
Sure.

208
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:46,352
Here is the first question.

209
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:49,405
I heard your shoulder injury
is pretty serious this time.

210
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:52,455
Aren't you afraid of
going back in the ring?

211
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:54,643
I am lucky my injury is not too bad.

212
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:56,168
You are lucky?

213
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:59,348
When I think about
Sam Vasquez or Gary Goodridge,

214
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,522
sometimes I get scary.

215
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:05,846
What happened to them?

216
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:25,749
I am putting porridge in the fridge,

217
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,856
so eat it when you get up.

218
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:30,146
Don't just lie around
and not eat anything.

219
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:35,621
Hey.

220
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:39,546
Why are you yelling at me?

221
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,439
Can you hear me?

222
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:51,286
Can you hear everything now?

223
00:15:51,986 --> 00:15:53,356
Yes, I can.

224
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:57,403
I heard you being noisy since you came in.

225
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:02,223
You are unbelievable.

226
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,416
I was really scared.

227
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:15,826
I really was.

228
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:32,517
Excuse me. What brings you here?

229
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:34,416
Excuse me?

230
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:38,816
You can't come in here.

231
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:50,989
How have you been?

232
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:58,799
You look well.

233
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:01,939
I tried looking for you everywhere.

234
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:20,186
Do you know how scary it is to not be
able to hear for merely five minutes?

235
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,746
It's like the world has been turned off.

236
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,035
It feels like I'm trapped alone...

237
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,612
in the bottom of the ocean.

238
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:30,906
I couldn't even breathe.

239
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,320
You can hear me now, right?

240
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:37,357
There is no ringing, right?

241
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:38,547
I'm completely good.

242
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:41,306
Try some.

243
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,586
It's good. Why aren't you eating?

244
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,149
Why are you so calm?

245
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:54,806
Dongman.

246
00:17:55,763 --> 00:17:58,463
You can hear me really well now, right?

247
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,679
Yes, I told you.

248
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,225
Then,

249
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:05,910
you don't need complete rest now, right?

250
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,516
What?

251
00:18:08,342 --> 00:18:09,260
Then,

252
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:12,456
listen to me carefully.

253
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:14,056
What is it?

254
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
You have...

255
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,449
...a fracture somewhere in your skull.

256
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:26,113
The problem is...

257
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,210
there's a hairline fracture
in his temporal region.

258
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,126
A fracture?

259
00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:34,528
Well, fractures in the temporal region
can heal without any treatment.

260
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:35,718
It's not a big deal.

261
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:38,939
However,

262
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:41,801
the fracture is near the ear cochlea.

263
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,086
If he receives more impact
in the same region...

264
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:48,683
So if you receive more impact,

265
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,566
you might not be able to hear forever.

266
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,517
You will get trapped
in that ocean forever.

267
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,595
What nonsense is this?

268
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,999
I can hear just fine now.

269
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:07,589
So the conclusion is...

270
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:10,871
...that you can't fight anymore.

271
00:19:11,286 --> 00:19:12,516
I won't let you.

272
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,445
Okay.

273
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,997
First,

274
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:21,722
I will meet the doctor
to hear from him and...

275
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:23,550
A fighter named Sam Vasquez...

276
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,780
was deemed brain dead
and died in six weeks.

277
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:28,952
Gary Goodridge...

278
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,976
got chronic traumatic encephalopathy
in his 40s.

279
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:32,929
Those are the extreme cases.

280
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:36,296
During a fight, injuries occur often.

281
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:37,516
They occur often?

282
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,839
So, why do I have to watch you
get injured so often?

283
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,005
Aera.

284
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,588
If I was going to quit so fast,

285
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:56,248
I wouldn't have started again
after ten years.

286
00:19:57,566 --> 00:19:58,589
Fine.

287
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,331
Do as you like then.

288
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:03,892
If you decide to fight again,

289
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:06,287
that's the end for us.

290
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,540
It's been over 20 years.

291
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,090
I still...

292
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:27,986
...can't forgive you.

293
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:34,446
You kneeling down...

294
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:39,076
...won't bring back
the years I spent in silence.

295
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:41,386
But still,

296
00:20:43,946 --> 00:20:45,716
stay like that a while longer.

297
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:49,486
I'd like...

298
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:52,556
...to watch a bit longer.

299
00:20:58,473 --> 00:20:59,494
Let go of me.

300
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,186
We already aired the preview.

301
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:05,686
We can't pull a show.

302
00:21:06,218 --> 00:21:08,254
Come on, you know that.

303
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:10,174
Don't make it difficult for me.

304
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:13,444
Mr. Director.

305
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,310
-Help me out.
-Stop it.

306
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,030
Darn it.

307
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,034
This show...

308
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,442
...can't air.

309
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,186
Stop.

310
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:33,797
Look for Dongman on VCR 3.

311
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:35,047
Hang on.

312
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:36,939
Are you sure...

313
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,492
we can air this?

314
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:40,582
We can.

315
00:21:52,386 --> 00:21:53,786
You don't mean it, do you?

316
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,747
I guess you can find out
by returning to the ring.

317
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:05,696
You can't blackmail me with this
just because I love you so much.

318
00:22:05,786 --> 00:22:07,346
I can't choose one.

319
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:12,446
I will protect you
even if it means playing unfair.

320
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:14,769
Fight again, and we are over.

321
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:16,489
We can't even be friends.

322
00:22:17,246 --> 00:22:19,246
We will never meet again forever.

323
00:22:31,346 --> 00:22:32,386
Hi, Dad.

324
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:34,473
TV?

325
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,011
I am on TV?

326
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,146
What preview?

327
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:43,632
Show her the footage first.

328
00:22:44,115 --> 00:22:46,236
The show airs in an hour.

329
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:48,509
There is no time for another inspection.

330
00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:50,486
Who is she?

331
00:22:51,952 --> 00:22:53,212
Mr. Jang.

332
00:22:53,864 --> 00:22:57,016
Did the person you filmed
agree to this broadcast?

333
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:58,377
Pardon?

334
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,156
From what I heard,

335
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,629
you and Ko Dongman...

336
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:06,531
...once met as a suspect and victim.

337
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:08,332
Are you allowed...

338
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:10,660
to use a program to get personal revenge?

339
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,208
That was in the past.

340
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:15,258
Who are you anyway?

341
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:18,552
Me?

342
00:23:18,642 --> 00:23:20,171
I represent Dongman.

343
00:23:20,886 --> 00:23:21,886
What?

344
00:23:33,763 --> 00:23:35,033
It's quite cheap.

345
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:44,439
Mackerel

346
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:52,316
Mackerel Helps Beat Cancer!

347
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,000
Where did he go?

348
00:24:06,816 --> 00:24:08,846
Is he at the gym?

349
00:24:15,186 --> 00:24:17,056
She must be upstairs.

350
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:19,001
But...

351
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:21,241
what is she dragging around?

352
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:29,553
No way...

353
00:24:30,746 --> 00:24:32,846
Is she hanging herself?

354
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:38,692
Goodness.

355
00:24:38,782 --> 00:24:42,184
Why does she try to kill herself
in the flat above mine?

356
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,726
You can't barge in like this.

357
00:25:05,816 --> 00:25:08,158
You barge into my place or Dongman's.

358
00:25:08,248 --> 00:25:09,571
Can't I...

359
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,162
What's that chair for?

360
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,514
Why is it over there?

361
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,660
You can die about...

362
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,596
60 years later quietly somewhere else.

363
00:25:23,686 --> 00:25:24,936
Why in the flat above...

364
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:26,171
Why would I die?

365
00:25:26,722 --> 00:25:27,891
Then what's that?

366
00:25:28,816 --> 00:25:31,250
I was changing the bathroom light bulb.

367
00:25:34,606 --> 00:25:35,676
The light bulb?

368
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,159
Bills

369
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,246
Do you think you won?

370
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:49,016
Gossipers say...

371
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:52,426
you got a fortune in alimony.

372
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:54,286
Why would I take their money?

373
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:58,640
Like people say,
because I am a spoiled brat?

374
00:25:59,453 --> 00:26:02,299
Because I'm a gold digger
who'd leave with a fortune?

375
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:06,556
I told them clearly
that I didn't want a cent,

376
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:08,090
and walked out.

377
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:12,642
Is that why...

378
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:15,526
you are renting a place
for 300,000 won a month?

379
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,086
I asked if you think you have won.

380
00:26:18,646 --> 00:26:22,246
No one knows more than you
what I mean to Dongman.

381
00:26:23,272 --> 00:26:25,732
He will take me back.

382
00:26:26,342 --> 00:26:28,382
I won't lose him to you.

383
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:31,742
Going way back...

384
00:26:32,646 --> 00:26:35,346
...is only good
for friendship and loyalty.

385
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:41,386
To her, this was...

386
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:44,646
Don't think that you won.

387
00:26:45,546 --> 00:26:47,502
...the only way to preserve her pride.

388
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,049
What are you doing?

389
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:00,507
You have been struggling
with this for a week, right?

390
00:27:06,306 --> 00:27:08,046
What is this noise?

391
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,229
What are you doing?

392
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,777
Come and hold the chair.

393
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:29,372
Hyung.

394
00:27:29,624 --> 00:27:30,519
Don't air the show.

395
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:32,536
I already told you this.

396
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:34,334
It will air soon.

397
00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:36,468
Pull it.

398
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:37,541
No.

399
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,719
Aera is right.

400
00:27:42,946 --> 00:27:44,956
People never do change, right?

401
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:46,746
I told Aera as well...

402
00:27:47,335 --> 00:27:49,265
that I am not the old Jang Kyungkoo.

403
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:54,116
I am not as lame or sloppy.

404
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:09,702
What are you doing outside my place?

405
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,846
What... What is that?

406
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:17,645
You mentioned in your online profile...

407
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:19,716
that you want strawberries.

408
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:22,912
Do you think I asked you to buy me some?

409
00:28:23,992 --> 00:28:26,575
You confessed to me
a day after leaving your girlfriend,

410
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:29,391
got me pulled from the show,
and text incessantly.

411
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:32,198
I heard you are telling people
we are dating.

412
00:28:32,288 --> 00:28:34,253
That's what I want.

413
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:35,613
Does that make sense?

414
00:28:36,412 --> 00:28:39,048
Why should I become an outcast
because of you?

415
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:40,831
If no one likes you,

416
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,341
maybe you will date me.

417
00:28:45,116 --> 00:28:47,586
What kind of stupid logic is that?

418
00:28:48,086 --> 00:28:49,716
Don't come here again.

419
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,497
Why are you here?

420
00:28:56,886 --> 00:28:57,820
Hyung.

421
00:28:58,018 --> 00:28:59,676
I'm out on my 100-day holiday.

422
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:01,726
I have just 546 more days to serve.

423
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:04,897
If you bother her again, I might desert.

424
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:07,649
I will bring a K2 rifle with me.

425
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:09,209
I am warning you.

426
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:12,652
Don't bother Aera again. Okay?

427
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:15,859
Did you want to get back at me that badly?

428
00:29:16,286 --> 00:29:18,556
Or do you still want Aera back?

429
00:29:18,646 --> 00:29:20,536
Just watch the show. It will air soon.

430
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,939
I bet you made up a story
to paint me like a fool.

431
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:26,217
Without a story,

432
00:29:26,637 --> 00:29:28,907
will anyone care for an unknown fighter?

433
00:29:29,716 --> 00:29:30,691
What?

434
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:34,039
The story and malicious editing
were strategical.

435
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,250
I caught the deliberate head-butt.

436
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:42,386
-What?
-Anyway, I did my best for you.

437
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:44,286
Watch it for yourself.

438
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:48,466
From my point of view,

439
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:52,426
it was an intentional outburst.

440
00:29:52,516 --> 00:29:56,485
It looks like he purposely
induced a no-contest.

441
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:58,956
This is malicious editing.

442
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:00,386
The director...

443
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:04,767
...was determined
to create fiction with fact.

444
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:07,948
He really made a fuss
by replaying the head-butt in slow motion,

445
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:10,112
and inserted an interview.

446
00:30:10,823 --> 00:30:12,681
Our people are also...

447
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:15,696
...unable to deal with the media backlash.

448
00:30:15,786 --> 00:30:18,426
Didn't you know they were filming Dongman?

449
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:21,686
Taksu, you can't get agitated.

450
00:30:22,026 --> 00:30:23,956
Even if it's a light concussion,

451
00:30:24,046 --> 00:30:26,094
you need to relax and stay calm.

452
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:27,449
Let me make this clear.

453
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:30,078
I won't ever fight against
that monster again.

454
00:30:30,168 --> 00:30:31,141
Got it?

455
00:30:31,673 --> 00:30:33,403
Get the media to stop talking.

456
00:30:33,493 --> 00:30:36,986
Make sure talks
about rematches don't start.

457
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,203
We root for Dongman, the rising star

458
00:30:47,293 --> 00:30:48,393
What is this?

459
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:50,312
Why...

460
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:51,922
Why is it so...

461
00:30:52,012 --> 00:30:53,012
Good?

462
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:55,119
Are you touched?

463
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:58,506
Did you cry?

464
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:03,036
Is my face...

465
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:06,133
Did you edit my face? What did you do?

466
00:31:09,632 --> 00:31:12,132
Are you crazy?

467
00:31:14,142 --> 00:31:17,285
Why are you slapping your husband's back?

468
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,428
You should have stopped him
if you knew he did something like that.

469
00:31:20,518 --> 00:31:22,295
Why did you support him?

470
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,516
This is a sport.

471
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:25,606
Oh my God.

472
00:31:25,946 --> 00:31:30,162
How can I watch him bleed in that a cage?

473
00:31:33,246 --> 00:31:34,306
Dad.

474
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:36,659
Yeah?

475
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:41,179
Donghee, do you need something?

476
00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:45,253
I want to go see Dongman.

477
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:46,609
What?

478
00:31:46,699 --> 00:31:48,207
I have something to give to him.

479
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:51,149
This is our newest menu.

480
00:31:51,863 --> 00:31:53,160
-Then, we will have that.
-Okay.

481
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,250
Thank you.

482
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:02,162
My wife used to be an idol trainee.

483
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:03,727
She is really beautiful.

484
00:32:03,817 --> 00:32:05,957
Our daughter is beautiful too
since she takes after her.

485
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:07,403
People call her a fairy.

486
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:08,533
A fairy?

487
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:10,592
You got it all wrong.

488
00:32:10,682 --> 00:32:14,446
Why did you have to come find Aera
and chase her around for nothing?

489
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,410
My daughter is really cute, right?

490
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:21,345
Not too long ago,

491
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:24,116
she got bullied at school.

492
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,000
One boy named Choi Jiho started it.

493
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,090
It turns out...

494
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:33,279
He thought if no one liked my daughter,

495
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,926
she'd only play with him.

496
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,565
If no one likes you,

497
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:41,929
you might go out with me.

498
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:43,719
That really woke me up.

499
00:32:45,272 --> 00:32:48,546
I think what I did is coming back
to my daughter.

500
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:51,249
That's why I came looking for you.

501
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:52,869
I wanted to get rid of it.

502
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,645
Have you been going to...

503
00:32:55,735 --> 00:32:57,305
church or something?

504
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:04,946
You shouldn't make food
and deliver them to men.

505
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:07,012
Hello.

506
00:33:09,046 --> 00:33:11,446
You don't look like the housewife type.

507
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:14,766
You are so nosy.

508
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:17,735
Are you having instant noodles again?

509
00:33:18,473 --> 00:33:20,243
You are so nosy.

510
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:25,417
Why are you coming up?

511
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:27,256
To eat with you.

512
00:33:27,713 --> 00:33:28,949
You and me?

513
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:29,933
Yes.

514
00:33:30,023 --> 00:33:30,984
Why?

515
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:34,101
We both don't have anyone
to eat with now anyway.

516
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:52,486
I couldn't cure his rhinitis 20 years...

517
00:33:53,497 --> 00:33:55,367
but Seolhui did it.

518
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,020
Ma'am...

519
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:02,516
Hey.

520
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:04,847
Why aren't you at work?

521
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:07,318
I took a half day today...

522
00:34:07,408 --> 00:34:09,317
because I had a package to send.

523
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:10,407
I see.

524
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:12,939
By the way,

525
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:16,066
why did you two break up?

526
00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:20,619
Is it because of me?

527
00:34:21,112 --> 00:34:22,112
Or...

528
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,523
was it his sisters?

529
00:34:23,613 --> 00:34:26,860
No, it's not like that at all.

530
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,020
Then, what is it?

531
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:31,315
It just happened.

532
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:32,405
Seolhui.

533
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,067
Don't lie to me and tell me the truth.

534
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:38,419
Did Juman...

535
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:40,586
...cheat on you?

536
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,706
That scumbag.

537
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:50,597
You can't really say that he cheated.

538
00:34:54,153 --> 00:34:55,193
Actually,

539
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,070
when Juman's dad was alive,

540
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:01,793
he had two more women aside from me.

541
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:07,056
I fell ill twice because of it.

542
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:09,772
You shouldn't live like that.

543
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:12,606
You don't deserve to suffer that way.

544
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,997
I didn't know that, ma'am.

545
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:19,682
A mother can be sly

546
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,540
If my child is precious,

547
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:26,006
I should know other children are too.

548
00:35:26,946 --> 00:35:29,176
I keep feeling sorry for my son.

549
00:35:30,249 --> 00:35:34,119
He was always so protective of you.

550
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,760
I guess I was jealous.

551
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:41,626
I think...

552
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,900
I was lonely.

553
00:35:44,913 --> 00:35:46,571
It was fine.

554
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:48,098
I am fine now.

555
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:51,759
Still.

556
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:54,663
If you get back together,

557
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:56,266
I won't ever...

558
00:35:57,049 --> 00:35:58,519
...visit your house.

559
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:00,427
Pardon?

560
00:36:00,517 --> 00:36:03,047
You don't have to come
to any family events.

561
00:36:03,506 --> 00:36:07,066
I won't let his sisters
ever call you again.

562
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,959
I swear it on my name.

563
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,740
I am sorry, ma'am.

564
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,260
You are right.

565
00:36:18,896 --> 00:36:20,326
What a fool I am.

566
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:23,142
I was being silly...

567
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:25,878
because I didn't want to lose you.

568
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:35,629
Ma'am...

569
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:42,309
I am really sorry.

570
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:45,529
We didn't last in the end.

571
00:36:48,117 --> 00:36:49,544
Even if I don't see you again,

572
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:51,762
please take care, okay?

573
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:04,986
I will visit your place to see
the idol and the fairy one day.

574
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:08,436
Right. Do you know Hwang Bokhee?

575
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:10,870
-Who?
-Hwang Bokhee.

576
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,746
That Hwang Bokhee.

577
00:37:18,477 --> 00:37:19,647
What is this?

578
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:22,306
Is it a soup or a stew?

579
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:23,856
It's mackerel stew.

580
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:26,681
My parents own a fish stew restaurant.

581
00:37:28,036 --> 00:37:29,863
Why would anyone make mackerel stew?

582
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:32,919
My dad is really bad at fishing.

583
00:37:33,786 --> 00:37:34,740
What?

584
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,479
He used to be a fisherman.

585
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:38,519
He could never catch the expensive fish.

586
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:41,269
He'd always get
some Pacific saury or mackerel.

587
00:37:41,672 --> 00:37:44,722
We had a big family
because we lived with my grandparents,

588
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:46,342
but there was only one mackerel.

589
00:37:46,756 --> 00:37:47,926
So, my mom...

590
00:37:48,195 --> 00:37:51,495
...got mad then put it in water
and boiled it.

591
00:37:58,852 --> 00:38:00,082
But my dad...

592
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:02,083
...liked it.

593
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:05,645
That's why we opened a restaurant,

594
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:07,153
but the business isn't good.

595
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:10,086
Do you...

596
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:13,162
...normally talk so much while eating?

597
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:14,392
Pardon?

598
00:38:14,482 --> 00:38:15,482
I am starting...

599
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,772
to get a headache.

600
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:18,886
What about you?

601
00:38:18,976 --> 00:38:20,427
Do you only eat?

602
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,974
You should have conversations...

603
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:24,234
I get indigestion if someone talks.

604
00:38:25,093 --> 00:38:26,123
So just...

605
00:38:27,186 --> 00:38:28,619
take your food and go to your room.

606
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:29,961
Goodness.

607
00:38:30,896 --> 00:38:32,856
Then, you can eat it by yourself.

608
00:38:32,946 --> 00:38:34,746
I will come back for the pot later.

609
00:38:35,836 --> 00:38:36,896
Make sure to eat it.

610
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:49,349
No wonder you don't have
anyone to eat with.

611
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,946
Hurry up.

612
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,825
Rock, paper, scissors!

613
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:37,563
Blue sky, the milky way.

614
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:40,518
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

615
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,240
What's the time...

616
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:46,593
Do you call yourself human?

617
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,774
Gosh...

618
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:50,855
What brings you here?

619
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:52,999
How can you do this?

620
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:55,216
Why would you do this to the children?

621
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:57,613
Adult Movie Actress Hwang Bokhee
Found to Be a Single Mother

622
00:39:57,703 --> 00:39:58,933
Am I an adult movie actress?

623
00:39:59,686 --> 00:40:02,100
You ruined my acting career
by hacking me to pieces...

624
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,557
for exposing my body.

625
00:40:04,673 --> 00:40:05,673
Now you...

626
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:08,860
...made it impossible for me
to be a mother forever.

627
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:15,377
Mr. Director.

628
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:19,419
The preview has already aired.

629
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,650
We can't pull a show.

630
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:24,146
Come on, you know that.

631
00:40:24,236 --> 00:40:26,036
Don't make it difficult for me.

632
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:29,075
Mr. Director.

633
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:30,337
Darn it.

634
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:32,251
-Please help me out.
-Stop this.

635
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:34,170
This show...

636
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,330
...can't air.

637
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:38,479
My baby...

638
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,366
...understands everything now.

639
00:40:42,803 --> 00:40:44,258
What did my child do wrong?

640
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:47,269
My baby Aera...

641
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:50,066
Please leave my Aera alone.

642
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:53,772
You can't tell a child that her mom...

643
00:40:56,553 --> 00:40:59,023
...was an adult movie star.

644
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:19,337
If my parents find out you are here,

645
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:22,194
they will freak out again.

646
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:25,788
Oppa...

647
00:41:27,716 --> 00:41:29,686
I couldn't even nurse my baby...

648
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:33,839
because I was kicked out
for taking off my clothes in a movie.

649
00:41:35,383 --> 00:41:36,413
Bokhee...

650
00:41:38,073 --> 00:41:39,688
I am leaving for Japan tomorrow.

651
00:41:40,556 --> 00:41:41,556
Can't I...

652
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:44,691
...sing to my baby just once?

653
00:41:55,416 --> 00:42:00,327
Wearing a red hat

654
00:42:02,346 --> 00:42:06,846
I am a clown that always smiles

655
00:42:10,546 --> 00:42:12,116
Behind...

656
00:42:13,546 --> 00:42:15,986
the blue smile

657
00:42:17,898 --> 00:42:22,768
Are tears that no one sees

658
00:42:23,529 --> 00:42:26,487
Adult Movie Star Hwang Bokhee,
a Single Mom?

659
00:42:27,136 --> 00:42:28,306
"Dwarf Flower"?

660
00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:36,394
"Dwarf Flower" star, Hwang Bokhee...

661
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,989
Dongman.

662
00:42:50,852 --> 00:42:52,813
Are you giving me this?

663
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,970
Why?

664
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:55,919
Dongman.

665
00:42:57,752 --> 00:42:59,092
You must...

666
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:03,678
protect Aera as you always have...

667
00:43:04,687 --> 00:43:06,857
...in my place, okay?

668
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,250
Caramel.

669
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:18,349
The caramel lady.

670
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,920
Why do you keep going to my place?

671
00:43:29,806 --> 00:43:32,099
I wanted to eat with your mother.

672
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:34,196
-Why?
-What?

673
00:43:34,286 --> 00:43:36,439
Why do you care so much about my mom?

674
00:43:36,529 --> 00:43:38,311
Why are you pretending to be nice?

675
00:43:38,401 --> 00:43:41,231
Is eating with her
"pretending to be nice"?

676
00:43:41,595 --> 00:43:43,156
I tend to believe...

677
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:45,186
that people are inclined to be evil.

678
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:49,283
Whenever I see you, I want to test you...

679
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,700
to see if you really are nice,

680
00:43:52,242 --> 00:43:55,012
and if you really are that clueless.

681
00:43:55,939 --> 00:43:57,116
Kim Namil.

682
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,260
People are all the same
when it comes down to it.

683
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,301
Everyone is weak and insecure.

684
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:06,794
Being so prickly looks like
you are going through puberty.

685
00:44:09,577 --> 00:44:11,407
Are you going through puberty?

686
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,099
Why did you get that on your arm?

687
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,746
-Get it removed.
-Why are you hitting me?

688
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:22,816
If you are a brat
but have no one to smack you,

689
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:26,353
that'd be the saddest thing in your life.

690
00:44:27,286 --> 00:44:30,816
I won't let Kim Namil
become that pathetic.

691
00:44:31,863 --> 00:44:33,193
Now, Kim Namil...

692
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:35,437
...is Hwang Bokhee's nice son.

693
00:44:35,956 --> 00:44:38,456
If spankings are medicine, I will hit you.

694
00:44:38,925 --> 00:44:39,965
Got it?

695
00:44:41,055 --> 00:44:43,485
Spankings are medicine for punks like him.

696
00:45:01,016 --> 00:45:02,016
By the way,

697
00:45:03,316 --> 00:45:04,516
why is it "Namil"?

698
00:45:06,155 --> 00:45:07,285
She is a girl.

699
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:13,447
Are you that sad because of her?

700
00:45:14,906 --> 00:45:17,466
Have you ever been that sad because of me?

701
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:24,386
I am tired right now.

702
00:45:25,946 --> 00:45:27,546
When your business went bust...

703
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:31,197
When you cried alone and got cancer,

704
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,200
...who was by your side?

705
00:45:37,305 --> 00:45:38,705
Was Aera there?

706
00:45:41,386 --> 00:45:42,486
Namil.

707
00:45:43,505 --> 00:45:44,705
Let's go back...

708
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,142
Let's go back to Japan, Mom.

709
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:58,261
Hwang Jangho's Gym

710
00:45:58,351 --> 00:46:00,716
Why is Donghee coming out of the blue?

711
00:46:11,006 --> 00:46:12,906
-Hi, Dad.
-Sorry we are late.

712
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:17,803
Donghee.

713
00:46:34,556 --> 00:46:36,596
Can I get this delivered?

714
00:46:36,686 --> 00:46:37,726
Sure.

715
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:39,565
Here.

716
00:46:39,655 --> 00:46:41,209
Just jot down the address.

717
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,271
Okay.

718
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:46,757
You are wearing the new sneakers.

719
00:46:50,093 --> 00:46:51,833
Didn't you come to see me?

720
00:46:52,346 --> 00:46:54,276
Why won't you look at me?

721
00:46:55,233 --> 00:46:57,103
You still don't want to talk to me?

722
00:46:59,879 --> 00:47:01,226
Do you want to see inside?

723
00:47:01,316 --> 00:47:02,570
Okay.

724
00:47:06,546 --> 00:47:07,916
Don't lose anymore.

725
00:47:11,366 --> 00:47:12,366
Donghee.

726
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:15,769
You will talk to me now?

727
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:20,019
Why did you make me feel bad
for ten years?

728
00:47:22,603 --> 00:47:24,873
You were mean.

729
00:47:31,486 --> 00:47:34,556
I told you it wasn't because of you.

730
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,660
What's this?

731
00:47:40,707 --> 00:47:41,862
I am...

732
00:47:43,786 --> 00:47:44,926
...your fangirl.

733
00:47:49,656 --> 00:47:51,086
It took me...

734
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:53,999
ten years to make this scrapbook.

735
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,472
So don't lose anymore.

736
00:48:11,946 --> 00:48:13,816
I hate seeing you unable to get up...

737
00:48:14,832 --> 00:48:17,402
more than being unable to get up myself.

738
00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:20,759
So don't lose ever again.

739
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,910
This is where Dongman practices.

740
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,560
My goodness.

741
00:48:34,819 --> 00:48:36,619
What's going on?

742
00:48:37,396 --> 00:48:38,415
Hey.

743
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:40,647
You have four interviews,

744
00:48:40,737 --> 00:48:44,282
a magazine shoot,
a water park poster shoot...

745
00:48:44,372 --> 00:48:45,702
A water park?

746
00:48:46,086 --> 00:48:49,156
Yeah. But you need to take off your shirt.

747
00:48:49,483 --> 00:48:51,583
You have an offer for a TV commercial too.

748
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,540
-A commercial too?
-Yes.

749
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:56,543
The effect of going on TV is huge.

750
00:48:57,147 --> 00:48:58,118
-Look.
-What?

751
00:48:58,208 --> 00:48:59,149
Over there.

752
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:01,223
He is an assistant director at RFC.

753
00:49:01,552 --> 00:49:06,586
Their CEO told him to get you to confirm
for a rematch with Taksu.

754
00:49:07,034 --> 00:49:07,866
Why?

755
00:49:07,956 --> 00:49:09,386
They want a fair fight.

756
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:12,359
But I...

757
00:49:12,787 --> 00:49:14,887
may be unable to continue MMA fighting.

758
00:49:15,523 --> 00:49:17,123
It is scary...

759
00:49:17,886 --> 00:49:20,246
after an injury like that, isn't it?

760
00:49:20,686 --> 00:49:23,356
They say skull fractures
heal on their own.

761
00:49:23,886 --> 00:49:25,477
It's a common injury for fighters.

762
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:28,292
Once a baseball player
gets hit in the face,

763
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,012
it's hard for him to get back
in the batter's box either.

764
00:49:31,696 --> 00:49:33,366
Traumas are tough.

765
00:49:33,653 --> 00:49:35,393
It's not because of the trauma.

766
00:49:36,052 --> 00:49:37,512
If I keep doing this,

767
00:49:37,986 --> 00:49:40,246
I have to give up something huge.

768
00:49:57,379 --> 00:49:58,419
Ma'am.

769
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,640
What brings you here at this hour?

770
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:05,373
Ma'am...

771
00:50:20,787 --> 00:50:21,947
I saw the article.

772
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:26,686
I see you made up your mind.

773
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:30,616
I was afraid.

774
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:33,546
It was the first time
that I couldn't hear.

775
00:50:34,366 --> 00:50:35,566
I was terrified.

776
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,813
Due to the trauma of the injury...

777
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:40,586
What scared me most
when I couldn't hear...

778
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,250
was that I may never...

779
00:50:44,182 --> 00:50:45,982
...stand in the ring again.

780
00:50:46,815 --> 00:50:48,196
That scared me the most.

781
00:50:48,286 --> 00:50:50,316
Then, will you fight again?

782
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,630
Yes.

783
00:51:00,646 --> 00:51:02,080
I request...

784
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:04,771
a rematch with Kim Taksu.

785
00:51:10,312 --> 00:51:12,552
That's one way of getting dumped.

786
00:51:20,435 --> 00:51:21,505
Aera.

787
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:24,673
Must we?

788
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:28,783
I really...

789
00:51:30,732 --> 00:51:32,462
...can't let you go.

790
00:51:37,086 --> 00:51:38,146
Dongman.

791
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,416
When you couldn't hear,

792
00:51:42,082 --> 00:51:44,182
I pulled all sorts of selfish tricks.

793
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:50,246
I never went to Sunday School,
but I went to do early morning prayer.

794
00:51:52,146 --> 00:51:53,946
I begged and pleaded,

795
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:59,321
"If you'd grant me this wish,
I will be good from now on."

796
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:01,953
For me to get better?

797
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,405
No.

798
00:52:05,486 --> 00:52:08,116
I begged that you'd quit MMA fighting.

799
00:52:11,946 --> 00:52:13,486
Whenever my dad....

800
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:16,763
...went out to the sea,

801
00:52:17,446 --> 00:52:20,946
my grandma would pray
with her rosary all day and night.

802
00:52:22,049 --> 00:52:24,819
Later on, she got dementia
and forgot my dad's name,

803
00:52:28,486 --> 00:52:31,086
but whenever it was windy,
she asked for her rosary.

804
00:52:33,006 --> 00:52:35,206
Grandma was trapped there all her life.

805
00:52:37,419 --> 00:52:40,819
She said, "Whenever your dad
goes out to sea,"

806
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:45,366
"I am so nervous, I can't breathe."

807
00:52:47,186 --> 00:52:49,746
I don't think I can live like that.

808
00:52:50,789 --> 00:52:52,659
I couldn't even survive that one week.

809
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:54,572
I am scared too.

810
00:52:57,625 --> 00:52:59,525
I am scared that
I will lose my hearing again.

811
00:53:00,086 --> 00:53:02,226
I am scared of being hit
and getting injured.

812
00:53:02,316 --> 00:53:03,386
But...

813
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,162
What frightens me more...

814
00:53:09,746 --> 00:53:11,316
...is going back.

815
00:53:13,426 --> 00:53:15,929
If I am told that this was all a dream,

816
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:20,189
and I need to go back
to exterminating ticks,

817
00:53:20,919 --> 00:53:22,131
I will really...

818
00:53:24,346 --> 00:53:26,146
I really can't survive a single day.

819
00:53:28,386 --> 00:53:30,616
I don't want to be an extra again.

820
00:53:31,783 --> 00:53:34,027
I don't want to live without a dream...

821
00:53:34,117 --> 00:53:35,947
and do nothing.

822
00:53:37,746 --> 00:53:39,393
To be honest,

823
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,486
I knew you couldn't stop.

824
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,519
This isn't...

825
00:53:55,252 --> 00:53:56,882
...just my dream.

826
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:59,726
It's also my dad's, Donghee's,

827
00:54:00,076 --> 00:54:01,746
and Coach's dream.

828
00:54:02,846 --> 00:54:03,886
Aera.

829
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:08,282
If you'd trust me...

830
00:54:08,616 --> 00:54:09,846
I guess this means...

831
00:54:11,316 --> 00:54:13,016
we can't even be friends, right?

832
00:54:29,105 --> 00:54:30,105
Yeah.

833
00:54:31,532 --> 00:54:32,732
I can't be.

834
00:54:35,846 --> 00:54:38,946
I didn't hide myself,

835
00:54:39,886 --> 00:54:41,116
beat around the bush,

836
00:54:43,093 --> 00:54:45,723
or plan to break up with you.

837
00:54:53,386 --> 00:54:55,386
I can't be just friends with you again.

838
00:55:00,766 --> 00:55:01,796
Okay.

839
00:55:04,746 --> 00:55:05,816
Bye.

840
00:55:08,146 --> 00:55:09,186
Aera.

841
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:15,689
Aera.

842
00:55:17,986 --> 00:55:19,086
Aera...

843
00:55:25,346 --> 00:55:26,546
Must you do this?

844
00:55:28,486 --> 00:55:30,546
Can't you just stay by my side?

845
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,472
I...

846
00:55:38,286 --> 00:55:39,765
...can't bear to watch.

847
00:55:43,334 --> 00:55:45,034
It's too hard.

848
00:55:48,316 --> 00:55:49,716
It's really hard.

849
00:55:54,346 --> 00:55:55,476
I wish...

850
00:55:58,486 --> 00:55:59,586
I wish...

851
00:56:02,016 --> 00:56:03,716
...we had never started this.

852
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,223
What brings you here at this hour?

853
00:57:07,353 --> 00:57:08,353
Ma'am.

854
00:57:12,152 --> 00:57:13,452
Please protect Aera...

855
00:57:15,763 --> 00:57:17,433
...from now on.

856
00:57:20,386 --> 00:57:21,546
I don't think...

857
00:57:24,646 --> 00:57:26,246
I can protect her anymore.

858
00:57:26,749 --> 00:57:27,849
Dongman.

859
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:32,269
I never told you,

860
00:57:33,686 --> 00:57:34,886
but I am...

861
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:38,113
...very thankful to you.

862
00:57:39,686 --> 00:57:41,286
There is no need.

863
00:57:42,516 --> 00:57:44,446
Come to think of it,

864
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:51,105
it wasn't because of
the caramel you gave me.

865
00:57:53,986 --> 00:57:56,786
I think it was always Aera for me...

866
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:02,696
...from the beginning.
