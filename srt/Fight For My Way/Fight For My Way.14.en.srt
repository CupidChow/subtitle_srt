1
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:04,019
Who is it?

2
00:00:04,593 --> 00:00:06,363
Is it Ko Dongman?

3
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:07,823
Poor him.

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:10,349
I will lift.

5
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:27,623
Every storm in life always come...

6
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:30,452
...when you have your guard down.

7
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:41,959
THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM

8
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:44,798
EPISODE 14

9
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,446
There were several break-ins
nearby lately.

10
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:28,132
Hey, Ko Dongman!

11
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:29,657
You scared me.

12
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,839
I said to be quiet.

13
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:33,985
There is no one here.

14
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:35,505
Don't be an idiot. Let's go.

15
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:39,351
I'm sure there is someone...

16
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:49,626
Goodness.

17
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:51,899
Darn it.

18
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,702
Gosh.

19
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:55,959
I'm sure there is someone in there.

20
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,179
I saw his toes.

21
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:01,355
Why are you so clueless?

22
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:02,682
What do you mean?

23
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:04,902
It's her private life.

24
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:06,458
What?

25
00:02:06,548 --> 00:02:07,557
I noticed...

26
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:09,492
she was wearing lipstick.

27
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,329
Why would she be wearing lipstick at home?

28
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,679
It's her boyfriend.

29
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:22,136
Why were you so clueless
and looking around?

30
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:24,129
So that's why...

31
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:27,247
So this is what woman's intuition is.

32
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:31,621
By the way,

33
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,660
have you ever seen Hyeran come out?

34
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,129
I never see her.

35
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:41,278
Why do you care?

36
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:43,811
Go in.

37
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:48,099
What? Are you going to follow me in again?

38
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:51,229
Don't come over anymore.

39
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:52,865
It's too hard for me.

40
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,409
Why?

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,185
If anyone heard, they might think
I'm giving you a hard time.

42
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:01,975
You do give you a hard time.

43
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,759
This isn't an army barrack.

44
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:06,499
How long...

45
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:08,629
could...

46
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:11,529
a man and woman...

47
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,448
Do you think it's
Ko Dongman's self-control test?

48
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:17,906
Sleep in your home.

49
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:44,229
Why were you hiding there?

50
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,829
Mom, who are these men?

51
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:51,568
No.

52
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:55,699
Which one of them is it?

53
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:58,502
"Mom"?

54
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:00,849
Yes.

55
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:04,092
I am Madam Hwang's one and only son,

56
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:05,726
Kim Namil.

57
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:32,612
I know why you guys are here,

58
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:36,429
but don't tell me to hide anymore.

59
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:41,224
You've been doing fine all these years.
What has gotten into you?

60
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,129
Was I...

61
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:44,999
...doing fine?

62
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:48,220
I was never fine at all.

63
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,259
For the past 30 years,

64
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:57,903
I have never stopped being a mom.

65
00:04:57,993 --> 00:04:59,163
You know that.

66
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,429
Still.

67
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:02,996
Why tell now?

68
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:04,716
Is it still bad...

69
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:09,279
...to be Hwang Bokhee's child?

70
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,529
-He takes him down.
-Darn it.

71
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:33,940
His legs grew weak.

72
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,529
What? What is it?

73
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:37,905
So...

74
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:40,984
Will you really get weighed in tomorrow?

75
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,706
Why are you kicking
your boyfriend like that?

76
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,254
Why are you dating
if you do whatever you want?

77
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,199
Am I a house plant?

78
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:53,585
Ah, right!

79
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:58,076
Your interviews overlap tomorrow, right?

80
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,667
Which one will you go to?

81
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:02,387
Did I complain about your doing MMA?

82
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:04,529
I'm saying not to fight Taksu.

83
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:05,673
Seriously...

84
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:08,693
Hey.

85
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:10,505
Turn down the TV.

86
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:22,493
What is that sound?

87
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:27,159
Hyeran...

88
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:30,099
She is home, right?

89
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,351
What is it to you?

90
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:35,106
Why do you care?

91
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:08,552
Explanation of Conditions for Alimony

92
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:12,022
You shall not speak about the family

93
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,459
When did Bokhee have such a grown-up son?

94
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:26,629
Why are you so serious?

95
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:29,199
Who says I am?

96
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:32,565
Since we are here anyway,

97
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:34,399
...should we see the kids?

98
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,689
Your non-functioning brain
was always your problem.

99
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,377
What will you tell them you are here for?

100
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,498
Will you say you came to see Bokhee?

101
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,166
By the way,

102
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:45,925
why did you come here?

103
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:47,825
We live in Bucheon.

104
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:49,909
Why does it matter where you live?

105
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:51,728
We live in Bucheon.

106
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:53,669
There is a bus that comes directly here.

107
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,099
You call that an excuse?

108
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:57,266
What gibberish.

109
00:07:57,707 --> 00:07:58,806
What?

110
00:07:58,896 --> 00:07:59,863
Gosh.

111
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:03,193
Whatever.

112
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:32,568
Hey.

113
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:35,739
What is it?

114
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,075
Antacid...

115
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,057
...and a good luck charm.

116
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,282
I think they are so amazing though.

117
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:48,832
Maybe you yelling at them
made an impact on them.

118
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:52,339
Is it something like,
"You are the first ever..."

119
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:53,754
"...to fight back at me"?

120
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,619
Choi Aera?

121
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:59,198
As someone with more life experience,

122
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,988
let me give you some advice.

123
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:02,552
Please don't.

124
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:06,045
You won't pass me anyway.

125
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,356
Then, don't hurt me.

126
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,659
I also have the right not to be hurt.

127
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:15,459
Let's go.

128
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,495
The ring announcer interview
is also today, isn't it?

129
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,285
Why did it have to overlap like that?

130
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:26,309
Have you set your mind
for the TV station,

131
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,799
and not the octagon?

132
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,119
Of course.

133
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,324
It has been my dream ever since I was six.

134
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:39,959
Was your dream to be an announcer
or to be behind the microphone?

135
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:42,065
What?

136
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:44,420
As your boyfriend and a friend...

137
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,048
who has watched you for 23 years,

138
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:48,563
let me give you some advice.

139
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,539
To be honest,

140
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:53,205
you are not announcer material.

141
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,383
Hey.

142
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:57,375
Why are you putting me down
before my interview?

143
00:09:57,465 --> 00:10:00,339
I'm saying that your skills
would be wasted sitting on a chair.

144
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:02,399
A moron should fly freely.

145
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,229
Still.

146
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,595
An announcer seems like...

147
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:08,709
...the major league.

148
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:11,315
I want to be in there too.

149
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:12,260
Hey.

150
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,025
Isn't wherever you are
the major league for you?

151
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:16,939
What?

152
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:20,199
Isn't wherever you like
the major league for you?

153
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,239
Just...

154
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:25,916
...do what makes your heart pound.

155
00:10:27,982 --> 00:10:30,897
I made it to final interview.
How could I pass up the announcer spot?

156
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,796
That would be insane.

157
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:53,565
-Taksu.
-What?

158
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:04,963
-Isn't he...
-John Karellas?

159
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:06,340
What is he doing here?

160
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:08,273
Get some photos.

161
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:09,334
Hang on.

162
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:10,859
Why is he here?

163
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:14,923
Why did you come to Korea?

164
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:17,204
I have come here to train
the first Asian fighter...

165
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:18,659
to represent my family.

166
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,907
Is that the only reason you came to Korea?

167
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:22,057
Because of him?

168
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:23,804
Focus on him.

169
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:25,757
I am just here to be in his shadow.

170
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:28,071
He is the one that
got to step in the ring.

171
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:31,596
John, when did you hear about Dongman?

172
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:33,043
-Sorry.
-Since when...

173
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,353
-Let us through.
-Can we have a moment?

174
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:37,838
Excuse me, wait.

175
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:45,776
Pose for the cameras.

176
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,479
Seoul to Cheongju

177
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:39,632
Number 11, Choi Aera.

178
00:12:41,922 --> 00:12:43,645
Is Choi Aera present?

179
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:45,556
Yes!

180
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:50,689
Choi Aera...

181
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,296
...is present.

182
00:12:58,115 --> 00:13:00,835
Seoul to Cheongju

183
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,399
What you like to do
is the major league for you.

184
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,895
Just do what makes your heart pound.

185
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,769
I think the core strategy
to make MMA more popular...

186
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:21,690
would be to target women.

187
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:24,789
Ring girls are the only females
in the octagon.

188
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,695
But ring girls can't grab
the females' attention.

189
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:29,569
A professional woman who hosts matches...

190
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:32,429
in front of fighters, not beside them.

191
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:36,321
That's what you need
to captivate female viewers.

192
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:39,229
Isn't a female announcer
too unconventional?

193
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,243
It's not unconventional,

194
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:43,857
but innovative.

195
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:45,233
What?

196
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,483
Let's just wing it.

197
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:49,110
If you don't give me the job,

198
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,829
I will apply to be
your competitor's announcer.

199
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,867
That means, you will lose
Korea's first ever...

200
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:59,939
female ring announcer to your competitor.

201
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,838
I am running short on time right now.

202
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,474
I see...

203
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:09,183
I think we are done here.

204
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:10,170
You are accepted.

205
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,099
-What?
-You are hired.

206
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:18,959
But why...?

207
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,908
Just like that?

208
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:22,260
You did well.

209
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,524
You have got spunk.

210
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:26,640
Excuse me...

211
00:14:27,104 --> 00:14:29,756
To the back of my resume,

212
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:32,623
I attached the Master's
I got from England.

213
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:35,269
You don't need a Master's
to talk into a microphone.

214
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:37,629
In the ring, it's all about competence.

215
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:39,902
Goodness.

216
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,104
I really like this place.

217
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:44,111
Then,

218
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,784
you are on for the upcoming big match.

219
00:14:47,506 --> 00:14:48,873
That's a little...

220
00:14:49,112 --> 00:14:51,149
We already hired someone for that.

221
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:12,458
Why is John Karellas in a sundae uniform?

222
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:15,765
Why is he coaching Dongman?

223
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:19,550
Well, I can't believe we must deal
with such a situation.

224
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,116
Take it away from him.

225
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:22,790
Take everything away!

226
00:15:23,099 --> 00:15:25,130
Offer him more money than Jangho did.

227
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,909
Taksu, do you think this is about money?

228
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,063
What?

229
00:15:29,153 --> 00:15:31,755
He won't work with you even for a fortune.

230
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,899
Burn down their gym,

231
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,469
have John deported...

232
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,499
or bribe the referees!

233
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:40,695
Just do something!

234
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:44,339
Something tells me you already lost.

235
00:15:54,376 --> 00:15:55,776
What is it?

236
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:58,112
What is it all of a sudden?

237
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:00,346
I don't want to do it
even for a fortune too.

238
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:03,329
-What?
-Fifteen years ago,

239
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:07,499
Dongman came to me first
before going to Jangho.

240
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,579
I noticed his talent,

241
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:12,399
but I fell for your family's money.

242
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:16,799
Jangho took a steel ax
and became a general.

243
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:19,903
Meanwhile, me and my pupil of 15 years...

244
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:21,494
became scoundrels.

245
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:24,599
I am sorry I couldn't raise you properly.

246
00:16:31,844 --> 00:16:32,914
Why?

247
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:35,333
Why must it be her?

248
00:16:35,423 --> 00:16:38,569
If a celebrity is involved,
more people show interest.

249
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:42,709
Ms. Park came to a match
and that was a big issue.

250
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:45,459
What does celebrity status
have to do with MMA?

251
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,232
Pardon?

252
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:50,639
Our representative was raised abroad.

253
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:52,609
He doesn't know how we do things.

254
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:55,848
Can you show us what you can do?

255
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,519
Are you asking me to audition?

256
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:04,842
I was asked to donate my time and talent.

257
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:08,329
I heard we offered you
ten times what she will get.

258
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,939
So, that's not a donation.

259
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:15,859
You must do it ten times better
if you are getting paid ten times more.

260
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:18,302
Isn't that common sense?

261
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:22,189
Why?

262
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:24,196
Do you lack the confidence?

263
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:26,293
It's not about confidence.

264
00:17:26,383 --> 00:17:27,954
It's about self-esteem.

265
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:45,363
I...

266
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:47,312
...passed.

267
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,324
I passed.

268
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,189
Just like that.

269
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:06,774
You beat Park Hyeran.

270
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:09,359
I guess.

271
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:12,039
I didn't mean what I said earlier.

272
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:13,759
I hope we get along.

273
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:16,001
Yes. It's okay.

274
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:20,508
By the way, I didn't think
Ms. Park would really show up.

275
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,379
I heard she doesn't have any work.

276
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,611
It must be true.

277
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:26,413
Why doesn't she have work?

278
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:30,464
Her ex-in-laws
don't want to see her on TV.

279
00:18:34,902 --> 00:18:37,192
I heard she can't return to mainstream TV.

280
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:41,019
The online comments are also vicious.

281
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:44,015
I am surprised she is still around.

282
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,859
Why is she taking a bus
instead of driving?

283
00:18:54,112 --> 00:18:55,815
This bus will take us to our neighborhood.

284
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,569
Follow me until we get home.

285
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,469
Why would I follow you?

286
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:06,969
-How much?
-It's 1,300 won.

287
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:13,229
Just a moment.

288
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:15,775
-Two people.
-Okay.

289
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:17,292
Multiple passengers.

290
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,077
No way.

291
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:27,854
Isn't that Park Hyeran?

292
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:42,769
She ditched her boyfriend
to marry an heir.

293
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:45,286
I don't care about you.
Crawl under a rock.

294
00:19:45,376 --> 00:19:47,639
I bet we can still find that photo.

295
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,499
Here is the link of the photo.

296
00:19:50,142 --> 00:19:52,567
Forever Hyeran and Dongman

297
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:31,943
What do I tell Seolhui then?

298
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:35,859
I am not exactly homeless.
I can't say I slept at Namil Bar again.

299
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:39,159
Should I sleep alone
when my match is tomorrow?

300
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,599
Don't I need to recharge myself?

301
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:44,753
Should we...

302
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:46,954
-...just tell her?
-Would you?

303
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:49,829
Are you serious?

304
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:53,859
It's a fact that you came to me first.

305
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:57,479
I want to hit your face
with my elbow right now.

306
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:58,580
Hey.

307
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,824
You can't say that to your boyfriend.

308
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:07,432
Are those plums?

309
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:09,778
They are peaches.

310
00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:13,629
Plums are so good these days, right?

311
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:15,799
I said they are peaches.

312
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:18,559
Why are you outside? Aren't you going in?

313
00:21:18,915 --> 00:21:20,015
I was about to.

314
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,496
Let's go.

315
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:24,524
Disperse.

316
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:36,999
Seolhui.

317
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:39,427
Yeah?

318
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:48,698
I will sleep with Aera tonight.

319
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:55,629
You know my match is tomorrow.

320
00:21:56,735 --> 00:21:58,542
I really...

321
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:00,740
...need her tonight.

322
00:22:02,546 --> 00:22:04,006
Let me borrow her for tonight.

323
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:06,249
Well...

324
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:09,118
Seolhui, the thing is...

325
00:22:11,281 --> 00:22:12,651
I will.

326
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:16,599
Take her.

327
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:27,899
Hey, sundae.

328
00:22:29,718 --> 00:22:30,995
Are you closing for the day?

329
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:33,550
I am not sundae.

330
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,754
I am Jangho.

331
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,659
Jang means "general",
and Ho means "tiger".

332
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:52,899
I need to ask you for a favor, honey.

333
00:22:53,444 --> 00:22:54,499
Honey?

334
00:22:55,823 --> 00:22:57,559
That's not what I meant.

335
00:22:59,376 --> 00:23:00,499
Right.

336
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:04,459
Are you going to do me the favor?

337
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:06,938
Can you keep a secret, honey?

338
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,759
I will do anything you ask.

339
00:23:20,464 --> 00:23:22,995
Keep this for me.

340
00:23:30,602 --> 00:23:33,599
Jangho, keep this and then...

341
00:24:23,787 --> 00:24:26,347
My girlfriend is the best.

342
00:24:26,684 --> 00:24:28,799
How could you make it in one shot?

343
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,243
So, if I win tomorrow...

344
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:34,084
you'll be interviewing me?

345
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:36,574
So, make sure you win.

346
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:39,029
I won't interview Taksu ever.

347
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:42,059
I will.

348
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:45,242
Are you scared?

349
00:24:46,297 --> 00:24:48,095
Are you a little scared?

350
00:24:48,997 --> 00:24:50,109
Honestly?

351
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,073
Stop being honest.

352
00:24:52,163 --> 00:24:54,229
Just say you are not scared.

353
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:58,099
It took me ten years to earn 15 minutes.

354
00:24:58,467 --> 00:24:59,929
I won't lose.

355
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:02,629
So don't worry.

356
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:09,999
Dongman.

357
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:13,513
During those 15 minutes,

358
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:15,710
I won't blink even once.

359
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:17,770
I will be watching you the entire time.

360
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:20,127
I will be right by the octagon.

361
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:23,759
I will protect you
so that nothing happens to you.

362
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:30,348
You are so tiny,
but you always talk about protecting me.

363
00:25:31,674 --> 00:25:32,933
No matter what,

364
00:25:33,316 --> 00:25:35,824
it will be over in 15 minutes.

365
00:25:37,008 --> 00:25:38,380
Once you open your eyes,

366
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:41,284
I will be in front of you.

367
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,669
To be honest...

368
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:46,835
Honestly,

369
00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:50,273
I want to make sure
you don't wake up tomorrow.

370
00:25:50,745 --> 00:25:52,135
I want to anesthetize you...

371
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:55,498
while you sleep and...

372
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:02,039
Stop crying.

373
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:07,299
I won't lose so that I won't see you weep.

374
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:13,850
If I just think...

375
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,559
you are an okay guy,
I would say go ahead.

376
00:26:18,196 --> 00:26:21,199
But I don't simply like you. I really...

377
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:24,329
I really, truly like you.

378
00:26:25,423 --> 00:26:26,829
So I can't just say that.

379
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:29,229
How do I say yes?

380
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:32,867
Why are you confessing
your feelings again?

381
00:26:34,777 --> 00:26:36,859
You are awfully cute.

382
00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:01,929
I am sorry,

383
00:27:04,972 --> 00:27:06,702
but I like you so much...

384
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:11,502
...that I can't do it.

385
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,899
You love me so much...

386
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:17,659
that you want to protect me?

387
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,307
No.

388
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,499
I like you so much...

389
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:46,268
...that I can't stop myself today.

390
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:15,043
You are like a dog.

391
00:28:15,665 --> 00:28:17,507
You are so fluffy.

392
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:23,758
Did you really anesthetize me?

393
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:27,799
I don't want to get up.

394
00:28:29,912 --> 00:28:31,252
Do you want to just sleep in?

395
00:28:31,517 --> 00:28:33,829
I will take care of Coach Hwang.

396
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,916
You know what?

397
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:41,375
What?

398
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:49,339
You know...

399
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:53,859
I liked you so much these days.

400
00:28:54,946 --> 00:29:00,129
I liked you so much that I wondered
if it's possible to like someone so much.

401
00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:03,559
That was all nothing.

402
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:06,500
What?

403
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,156
I like you today...

404
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:10,361
five hundred times more...

405
00:29:11,938 --> 00:29:13,492
...than yesterday.

406
00:29:16,195 --> 00:29:18,252
Why are you so honest, you punk?

407
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,595
You are going to give me arrhythmia.

408
00:29:21,685 --> 00:29:25,437
How did I resist you for 20 years?

409
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:29,129
I must be an idiot.

410
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:32,929
Do you...

411
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:36,809
...like me that much more?

412
00:29:37,657 --> 00:29:38,605
Yeah.

413
00:29:41,704 --> 00:29:44,329
I like your potbelly,

414
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:48,287
I like your your short limbs,

415
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,099
...and even your smell.

416
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:54,258
You smell...

417
00:29:55,738 --> 00:29:57,698
...is like my favorite dish,

418
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:01,379
...seaweed soup.

419
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:07,532
I like you so much.

420
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,929
Why would a person
smell like seaweed soup?

421
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,458
Do you want to go in together?

422
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,865
What a bully.

423
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:36,039
I'm embarrassed to death.
I don't want to think about it.

424
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:39,529
I thought you said you would protect me.

425
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:41,729
It should be between just the girls.

426
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:46,059
What do I tell her?

427
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:48,739
I should have dried my hair at least.

428
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:50,015
Aera.

429
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:51,453
Are you coming with me?

430
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,672
Good luck.

431
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:13,985
It's so nice out.

432
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:17,324
I think we can hang our laundry outside.

433
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,029
It's practically summer.

434
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:25,908
It is July, you know.

435
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:38,269
You resisted for 20 years,

436
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,099
but you finally gave in.

437
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:56,255
Don't just come in by unlocking my door.

438
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:57,615
Are you my girlfriend?

439
00:31:58,659 --> 00:31:59,659
What are you up to?

440
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:06,889
You cried, didn't you?

441
00:32:07,565 --> 00:32:08,840
You did.

442
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,320
You cried.

443
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,778
I just yawned.

444
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:17,699
Did you get dumped?

445
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:20,602
Is your diaphragm all tattered?

446
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:23,669
Don't use my diaphragm as your joke.

447
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,906
Stop embarrassing yourself and get up.

448
00:32:25,996 --> 00:32:26,979
Why?

449
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:28,572
Juman.

450
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,329
I have known you for ten years,

451
00:32:31,968 --> 00:32:34,098
but I have known Seolhui for 20 years.

452
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:37,279
If you two fight,
of course I am on her side.

453
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:38,640
Off you go.

454
00:32:38,838 --> 00:32:39,784
Get out.

455
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,354
Seolhui is not 99 percent kind,

456
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:45,029
but 100 percent kind.

457
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:48,971
It's too good to give you
such an unbelievable girl...

458
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:50,801
She is an angel.

459
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:53,119
...but I can't trust any other guy.

460
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:55,372
You are the best out of them all.

461
00:32:56,445 --> 00:32:58,605
So just go down and beg her.

462
00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:05,009
-But in that house...
-What is it?

463
00:33:07,229 --> 00:33:08,599
Aera is there too.

464
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:11,990
I have a match today.

465
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,009
Of course the fantastic four
should have breakfast together.

466
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:18,199
That has been our custom.

467
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:25,276
Why are you being like that to Juman?

468
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:27,619
No, it's okay.

469
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:30,538
I like wooden chopsticks.

470
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,429
There are only three eggs.

471
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:36,245
I am okay.

472
00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:38,439
I have high cholesterol.

473
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:40,829
Why would you have cholesterol?

474
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:42,713
Seolhui, come eat.

475
00:33:43,102 --> 00:33:45,672
Even the attacker is eating,
so why shouldn't the victim?

476
00:33:50,422 --> 00:33:51,422
Aera.

477
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:53,508
What...

478
00:33:54,223 --> 00:33:55,162
...is this?

479
00:33:55,252 --> 00:33:56,098
What is it?

480
00:33:57,008 --> 00:33:59,493
Is this a fraud?

481
00:34:01,295 --> 00:34:04,401
Seolhui, is your plum wine for sale?

482
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:06,514
I have wanted to buy the mulberry wine.

483
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:09,573
Why do they want my wine?

484
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,676
Could it be fraud?

485
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:14,054
You would be getting money. It can't be.

486
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,035
What?

487
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,810
If anything, you'd be the scammer.

488
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,109
You could get the money,
and not send the wine.

489
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,594
-Do you think so?
-There are many weirdos...

490
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:26,521
It's because you make it nice and neat,
so everyone wants to buy it.

491
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:27,949
I will buy it too.

492
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,109
Drunk Fairy wants to buy it too.

493
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,125
Drunk Fairy is a suspicious nickname...

494
00:34:32,215 --> 00:34:33,715
I guess they all wanted to try it.

495
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,865
After that one inquiry,
there are a whole bunch.

496
00:34:35,955 --> 00:34:37,209
What's going on?

497
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:39,476
How much should I sell them for?

498
00:34:39,566 --> 00:34:41,586
Let's think about the prime cost.

499
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:43,876
How much profit do you want to make?

500
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:45,699
-I am not sure.
-Net income should take...

501
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:47,832
incidental costs into consideration...

502
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:49,551
Maybe...

503
00:34:52,077 --> 00:34:52,880
...about 700 won?

504
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,404
Just say it's not for sale.

505
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:55,799
Then...

506
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,199
...800 won.

507
00:34:59,937 --> 00:35:02,742
That's not even enough for
the bus fare to the post office.

508
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,813
Then, 1,100 won!

509
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:08,809
-Think about it.
-What?

510
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:09,959
What is it?

511
00:35:10,962 --> 00:35:12,206
Is it too expensive?

512
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:15,258
Dongchun Gymnasium

513
00:35:15,348 --> 00:35:16,746
I heard a lot about you.

514
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:18,176
-I look forward to it.
-No, Sir.

515
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:20,439
Thank you for being accommodating.

516
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:23,099
Of course, I should help.

517
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,757
I told you I am fine.

518
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:28,985
I am not scared.

519
00:35:33,922 --> 00:35:38,156
Why are you sighing when your man
is about to go to the battlefield?

520
00:35:38,246 --> 00:35:39,546
Goodness.

521
00:35:40,836 --> 00:35:42,802
Why are you hitting me on the head?

522
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:45,562
I take back telling you
to win today's match.

523
00:35:46,029 --> 00:35:47,826
-What?
-You can lose.

524
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:49,652
It's okay even if you lose.

525
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:51,365
So tap out.

526
00:35:51,612 --> 00:35:53,443
If it hurts, tap out. You better tap out.

527
00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:56,211
I didn't even start,
but you want me to tap out?

528
00:35:56,301 --> 00:35:57,365
If you don't,

529
00:35:57,678 --> 00:35:59,538
I will go up there and ruin the game.

530
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:01,569
I will go over the fence.

531
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,910
Fine.

532
00:36:03,172 --> 00:36:04,869
I will tap out if I feel like I am dying.

533
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,729
I will go on my back and call it quits.

534
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,559
But if I can stand it,

535
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:12,679
...I would win properly.
It won't be half-baked.

536
00:36:14,938 --> 00:36:17,616
This punk's eyes are on fire again.

537
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:18,834
That's why...

538
00:36:18,924 --> 00:36:22,696
you should do your best today too.
Show them what you got, okay?

539
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,098
Last week,

540
00:36:39,425 --> 00:36:42,165
I drank with Mr. Kim until 11 PM.

541
00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:46,098
You don't have to tell me anymore.

542
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:49,199
He dumped me right at 8 PM.

543
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:52,676
He only talked about you for three hours.

544
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:56,859
Mr. Kim...

545
00:36:58,709 --> 00:37:00,979
...will pick you even over
Mansour's daughter.

546
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:12,199
Mr. Kim, we should go home.

547
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,008
Goodness.

548
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,191
What?

549
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:21,695
To be honest...

550
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:22,862
Be careful.

551
00:37:22,952 --> 00:37:24,151
It's okay.

552
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:27,059
It doesn't matter...

553
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,315
if it's the Granny Park's Jokbal...

554
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,949
or even the daughter of Mansour
comes to me,

555
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,222
I would still pick Seolhui.

556
00:37:35,312 --> 00:37:37,438
I get you, okay?

557
00:37:37,528 --> 00:37:38,668
Seolhui...

558
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,219
...is prettier than Kim Taehee.

559
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:44,214
She looks like Lee Youngae.

560
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,462
You two are like Park Bogum
and Lee Youngae.

561
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:48,852
And her hair...

562
00:37:49,452 --> 00:37:51,483
That hair only looks good on Seolhui.

563
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,319
That's why it's pretty. If you do it...

564
00:37:55,929 --> 00:37:57,416
Same goes for me.

565
00:37:57,736 --> 00:37:59,532
Out of the guys I have liked,

566
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:01,555
you are the fattest.

567
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:07,248
Why did I end up breaking up
with Seolhui because of you?

568
00:38:08,145 --> 00:38:09,730
Goodness.

569
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,880
You deserve to die, punk!

570
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:16,509
Because of you, he...

571
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:24,459
He had been rejecting me from the start.

572
00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:28,006
Did you say you live in Oksu-dong?

573
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,629
That's the direction I am going.

574
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:30,955
Do you want a ride?

575
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:31,981
Get on.

576
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:33,880
Hurry up and get on.

577
00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:36,575
I am okay. I have somewhere to go.

578
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:39,639
Do you want to eat it together?

579
00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:40,555
Next time.

580
00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:44,509
I will gather all the interns and
treat you to tteokbokki next time.

581
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:46,500
Yejin.

582
00:38:48,836 --> 00:38:50,496
I hope you didn't cross the line.

583
00:38:51,574 --> 00:38:52,740
Seriously,

584
00:38:53,855 --> 00:38:55,855
I hope you stop it for sure.

585
00:38:57,455 --> 00:38:59,178
Even when he said no,

586
00:38:59,982 --> 00:39:01,712
I thought he didn't mean it.

587
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,369
What is it that you want to say?

588
00:39:06,228 --> 00:39:07,093
Here.

589
00:39:22,252 --> 00:39:24,435
I didn't want to draw Mr. Kim in it,

590
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,409
but I did anyway.

591
00:39:28,129 --> 00:39:29,999
Why are you giving this to me?

592
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:34,625
To feel at ease.

593
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:38,309
I don't want to be punished...

594
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:41,039
for making someone so kind cry.

595
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,659
It's also killing me inside.

596
00:39:45,529 --> 00:39:46,899
I really wanted...

597
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:51,538
...to sincerely apologize before I go.

598
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:54,726
Are you going somewhere?

599
00:39:55,775 --> 00:39:56,817
Great work.

600
00:39:56,907 --> 00:39:58,937
-Great work.
-Great work.

601
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:06,983
Since it's also
the company's anniversary dinner,

602
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:09,369
I will consider this
my farewell party as well.

603
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:12,038
Come on! How can we send you to England...

604
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:14,035
without any farewell party?

605
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,025
Yejin,

606
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:18,361
I hear British men are really dashing.

607
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:21,459
I won't take interest in men anymore.
I will focus on studying.

608
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:37,599
Seolhui-nim, I was wondering...

609
00:40:38,825 --> 00:40:40,025
"Seolhui-nim"?

610
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:46,629
When are you going back there?

611
00:40:49,356 --> 00:40:51,224
Do you want to go with me next time?

612
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:54,759
It's more fun to go with others.

613
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,062
Sure.

614
00:40:57,152 --> 00:40:59,431
I will see if I have time.

615
00:40:59,521 --> 00:41:01,449
Chanho, here.

616
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:02,709
Thank you.

617
00:41:04,307 --> 00:41:06,771
I feel like I will die if I eat this.

618
00:41:06,861 --> 00:41:08,125
It's cooked to perfection.

619
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:09,730
You haven't tried it, right?

620
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:16,521
I guess...

621
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:19,754
...the weekend isn't so good, right?

622
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:22,285
You probably have plans, right?

623
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:25,105
You must have a boyfriend, I assume.

624
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:27,588
Right?

625
00:41:27,965 --> 00:41:29,569
Stop poking around, you punk.

626
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:33,021
I guess you don't know, Chanho-ssi.

627
00:41:33,738 --> 00:41:34,868
"Chanho-ssi"?

628
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:36,486
I had one,

629
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:39,342
but we broke up recently.

630
00:41:40,894 --> 00:41:41,936
Excuse me!

631
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:43,837
We need more charcoal!

632
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:04,799
Hello, everyone. Thank you for coming.

633
00:42:05,186 --> 00:42:07,639
Tonight, here at Grand Dongchun,

634
00:42:07,729 --> 00:42:09,982
as the greatest MMA league in the nation,

635
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:13,009
the RFC will have its 38th competition.

636
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:17,429
We welcome all of you here today.

637
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,918
We ask that you give the athletes...

638
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:23,106
endless support and encouragement.

639
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:09,477
This is not your last fight,
but your first.

640
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:11,148
Avoid injuries at all cost.

641
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:12,909
Don't get caught up in his pace.

642
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:14,635
You are not ready for the ground.

643
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:15,569
Remember.

644
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,959
It took me ten years to get here, Coach.

645
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:20,439
I will fight with no regrets.

646
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:21,529
Open up.

647
00:43:24,631 --> 00:43:25,671
Enjoy yourself.

648
00:43:34,925 --> 00:43:35,965
Who is it?

649
00:43:37,229 --> 00:43:38,299
Which of...

650
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:41,999
...the two is it?

651
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,782
The fight will consist of three rounds.

652
00:44:07,872 --> 00:44:10,102
I'm Taewook will be the head referee.

653
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:12,178
Clean fight.

654
00:44:12,268 --> 00:44:13,161
Take your corners!

655
00:44:18,685 --> 00:44:19,715
Clean.

656
00:44:20,342 --> 00:44:21,372
Clean.

657
00:44:21,678 --> 00:44:22,869
Ready? Fight!

658
00:44:29,259 --> 00:44:31,942
I told you to put a plate under it!

659
00:44:32,032 --> 00:44:34,235
Excuse me. Please remove the grill.

660
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:36,205
Careful.

661
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:51,304
Mr. Kim.

662
00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:52,824
Are you okay?

663
00:44:54,253 --> 00:44:55,483
Seolhui, are you okay?

664
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:19,959
Ko Dongman is evading Kim Taksu's attacks.

665
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:26,990
What was that?

666
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,216
Kim Taksu took a hard blow just now.

667
00:45:30,306 --> 00:45:31,350
Stop.

668
00:45:32,048 --> 00:45:33,148
Corners.

669
00:45:41,134 --> 00:45:42,069
Hey.

670
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:43,539
I am positive he wobbled just now.

671
00:45:43,629 --> 00:45:45,599
He's stunned right now.

672
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:47,546
Are you okay?

673
00:45:48,244 --> 00:45:50,035
Taksu, standing won't work.

674
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:51,995
Bring him to the ground.

675
00:45:52,647 --> 00:45:54,715
Stay alert and off the ground.

676
00:45:54,805 --> 00:45:56,075
Okay?

677
00:45:56,332 --> 00:45:58,657
Mess with his psyche. Okay?

678
00:45:59,459 --> 00:46:03,859
Make him lose his temper,
and then drag him down onto the ground.

679
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:06,908
Clean!

680
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:07,939
Clean!

681
00:46:08,029 --> 00:46:09,159
Ready? Fight!

682
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:33,309
I am sure no one expected
this fight to turn out this way.

683
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:36,639
Kim Taksu is in top shape today,
but why is he fighting like this...

684
00:46:36,729 --> 00:46:38,353
against a new fighter?

685
00:46:38,443 --> 00:46:39,483
Stand.

686
00:46:43,324 --> 00:46:44,384
Fight!

687
00:46:52,803 --> 00:46:53,897
Come down!

688
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,175
-Come down, you punk.
-Don't fall for it!

689
00:46:56,265 --> 00:46:57,400
Stay off the ground!

690
00:46:58,859 --> 00:46:59,835
Come down.

691
00:47:00,496 --> 00:47:03,396
Ko Dongman seems to be
avoiding the ground,

692
00:47:03,486 --> 00:47:08,499
but we can also say it's a standing match
between Kim Taksu and Ko Dongman.

693
00:47:30,226 --> 00:47:31,051
Why?

694
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:32,497
Are you afraid of the ground?

695
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:35,108
Your sister sits all the time,

696
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:37,329
so you want to fight standing?

697
00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:54,589
No, Dongman!

698
00:48:00,874 --> 00:48:01,874
Yes.

699
00:48:02,823 --> 00:48:04,819
Intentional head-butting...

700
00:48:04,909 --> 00:48:08,193
...is difficult to tell
if you make it look good.

701
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:11,329
If you trail behind, head-butt him.

702
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:14,825
Let's just aim for a no-decision.

703
00:48:14,915 --> 00:48:16,725
Darn it.

704
00:48:16,932 --> 00:48:20,132
If you make it look like
you led the fight,

705
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,599
I will take care of the media afterward.

706
00:49:05,729 --> 00:49:07,399
Where else can you get hurt?

707
00:49:09,162 --> 00:49:10,369
What are you doing?

708
00:49:10,459 --> 00:49:11,459
It's a spell.

709
00:49:11,786 --> 00:49:14,042
So that you don't get hit
wherever I kiss you.

710
00:49:14,132 --> 00:49:15,632
So that you don't get hurt.

711
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:22,601
My ears hurt.

712
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:23,791
Then...

713
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:28,459
Don't get hit in the eye.

714
00:49:31,252 --> 00:49:32,263
Here too.

715
00:49:32,462 --> 00:49:33,859
-Here?
-Yes.

716
00:49:38,277 --> 00:49:39,765
-Here too.
-Here?

717
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:40,829
Yeah.

718
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:47,511
Here too.

719
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:49,783
-There too?
-I think it will get hit.

720
00:50:05,299 --> 00:50:06,753
I could not move...

721
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:10,230
...my feet at all.

722
00:50:19,629 --> 00:50:20,694
Two, please.

723
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:21,763
Come in.

724
00:50:23,298 --> 00:50:24,298
Sorry.

725
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:34,781
Darn it.

726
00:50:40,182 --> 00:50:41,282
It's serious.

727
00:50:45,775 --> 00:50:47,175
Coach, I am fine.

728
00:50:48,851 --> 00:50:50,511
I am really fine.

729
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,799
I am okay.

730
00:50:55,249 --> 00:50:56,779
Don't stop the fight.

731
00:50:58,505 --> 00:51:00,350
I can fight!

732
00:51:00,608 --> 00:51:02,378
I am going to fight!

733
00:51:05,457 --> 00:51:06,449
Coach.

734
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:08,572
Don't let them stop the fight.

735
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:18,891
Stop them.

736
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:21,392
Don't let them stop the fight!

737
00:51:21,482 --> 00:51:24,429
Don't stop it! I can fight!

738
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:29,339
At two minutes 17 seconds,

739
00:51:29,429 --> 00:51:33,369
due to Ko Dongman's injury
from an accidental illegal strike,

740
00:51:33,459 --> 00:51:35,629
the fight will end as
a no contest decision.

741
00:51:35,999 --> 00:51:38,079
I can still fight!

742
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,651
I said I would fight until the bitter end!

743
00:51:41,741 --> 00:51:42,539
Why?

744
00:51:42,629 --> 00:51:45,092
I said I can fight but why...?

745
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:47,092
Don't stop the fight!

746
00:51:47,182 --> 00:51:48,481
I won't stop!

747
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:50,559
I won't stop!

748
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:54,872
Darn it.

749
00:52:06,118 --> 00:52:07,188
Mom.

750
00:52:10,999 --> 00:52:12,169
Are you sad?

751
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,029
But, Mom...

752
00:52:17,732 --> 00:52:19,562
now you don't like hearing me...

753
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,318
...call you "Mom", right?

754
00:52:23,105 --> 00:52:24,175
What?

755
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,811
There are many abandoned dogs recently.

756
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:29,129
But you know,

757
00:52:31,134 --> 00:52:33,859
...of all the many reasons
why dogs are abandoned,

758
00:52:34,999 --> 00:52:36,899
there is one very beautiful...

759
00:52:37,899 --> 00:52:40,299
and cruel reason.

760
00:52:43,129 --> 00:52:47,299
When a baby comes along,
the loving parent...

761
00:52:49,629 --> 00:52:51,299
...abandons the dog that they raised.

762
00:52:54,075 --> 00:52:56,805
What are you trying to say?

763
00:52:57,298 --> 00:53:00,229
It's only natural to bite
if someone takes what is mine.

764
00:53:00,914 --> 00:53:01,914
I told you...

765
00:53:02,999 --> 00:53:04,759
...not to touch the kids.

766
00:53:05,801 --> 00:53:06,871
Anyway, Mom...

767
00:53:07,974 --> 00:53:09,276
what did you do...

768
00:53:10,758 --> 00:53:11,988
...with the flip phone?

769
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:36,948
Punk, why didn't you just come...

770
00:53:51,779 --> 00:53:53,990
Please give us a statement
about the fight.

771
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,161
It's obvious I was leading the fight.

772
00:53:56,251 --> 00:53:57,463
I am disappointed...

773
00:53:57,553 --> 00:54:00,029
it was stopped because of his injury.

774
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:02,443
It's only a no-decision by technicality.

775
00:54:02,533 --> 00:54:04,499
-An injury shows lack...
-Taksu!

776
00:54:04,778 --> 00:54:06,977
Taksu, is your head okay?

777
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:08,829
Where were you?

778
00:54:09,174 --> 00:54:10,204
Your head...

779
00:54:11,637 --> 00:54:12,667
Taksu!

780
00:54:16,345 --> 00:54:18,045
-Taksu!
-Taksu!

781
00:54:18,363 --> 00:54:19,959
-Taksu!
-Taksu!

782
00:54:20,476 --> 00:54:21,628
What's wrong?

783
00:54:21,718 --> 00:54:23,414
-Taksu!
-Taksu!

784
00:54:23,504 --> 00:54:24,628
Excuse me.

785
00:54:24,926 --> 00:54:26,029
Kim Taksu.

786
00:54:37,238 --> 00:54:38,263
Okay.

787
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:46,502
Coach Choi.

788
00:54:46,714 --> 00:54:48,670
Give me a call from the hospital.

789
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,728
I will.

790
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:51,536
Taksu.

791
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:10,772
Come with me, punk.

792
00:55:10,862 --> 00:55:12,024
You need to see a doctor.

793
00:55:31,574 --> 00:55:32,744
You must have been scared.

794
00:55:33,899 --> 00:55:34,871
Sorry.

795
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:36,424
I am sorry, Aera.

796
00:55:41,992 --> 00:55:43,692
I told you to tap out.

797
00:55:44,354 --> 00:55:46,759
Coach said to avoid the ground!

798
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:48,929
I am fine.

799
00:55:49,311 --> 00:55:52,021
Why are you dating me
if you do as you please?

800
00:55:52,841 --> 00:55:54,441
Why do you say you love me?

801
00:55:54,821 --> 00:55:55,801
I'm sorry.

802
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,552
Sorry. It's my fault.

803
00:55:59,752 --> 00:56:00,782
I wasn't...

804
00:56:01,899 --> 00:56:04,470
...hurt much.

805
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:07,397
So it's all good, right?

806
00:56:10,102 --> 00:56:12,129
Didn't you see Taksu get wheeled away?

807
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:16,159
Can't you not do this?

808
00:56:20,473 --> 00:56:22,999
Do you realize how cruel
you are being to me?

809
00:56:24,343 --> 00:56:27,499
No matter how many times
I see you get hit...

810
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:30,439
No matter how many times,

811
00:56:32,759 --> 00:56:34,359
I just can't do it.

812
00:56:35,766 --> 00:56:37,985
I can't stand to watch it!

813
00:56:40,347 --> 00:56:42,000
If you insist on keeping this up,

814
00:56:42,377 --> 00:56:43,430
I won't date you.

815
00:56:44,304 --> 00:56:45,303
I won't...

816
00:56:48,818 --> 00:56:49,718
Aera.

817
00:56:49,808 --> 00:56:51,368
I am telling you to stop.

818
00:56:52,959 --> 00:56:54,229
Aera!

819
00:56:57,157 --> 00:56:58,297
What's wrong?

820
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,645
Dongman.

821
00:57:03,804 --> 00:57:05,044
What's wrong?

822
00:57:05,134 --> 00:57:06,538
What is it?

823
00:57:06,628 --> 00:57:08,431
Tell me what is it?

824
00:57:10,726 --> 00:57:12,699
Why are you...

825
00:57:14,061 --> 00:57:17,142
Why are you talking like that?

826
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,165
What?

827
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:23,729
Why won't you make a sound?

828
00:57:26,355 --> 00:57:28,532
Why is everything so silent?

829
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:34,983
Why?

830
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:37,712
Why is it so quiet?

831
00:57:37,802 --> 00:57:39,683
Why?

832
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:44,559
The storm passed...

833
00:57:45,069 --> 00:57:47,339
and the world grew dark.

834
00:57:56,338 --> 00:57:57,633
Should I turn off the lights?

835
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:00,059
Don't bother asking.

836
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:02,606
They are off.

837
00:58:02,696 --> 00:58:07,255
Fight For My Way must follow...

838
00:58:07,345 --> 00:58:12,287
the age 15 rating...
