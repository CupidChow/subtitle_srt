=The Legend of Zhuohua=

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 17=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,035
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:54,860
(Capital)

21
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:58,704
Jinghong.

22
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:01,304
I've never been to Jiangnan.

23
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,424
You must tell me more

24
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:04,985
before we reach Jiangnan

25
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:06,864
so that I can come up
with tailored strategies.

26
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:08,144
Rest assured, Your Highness.

27
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:09,904
I'll tell you everything I know.

28
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,505
(Man, send a maid
to take care of Zhuohua.)

29
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:16,505
Yes, Your Highness.

30
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:28,464
My Lord.

31
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:32,985
I haven't seen Miss Mu around lately.

32
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:36,785
She's an official
serving the imperial court.

33
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
Naturally, she has official duties
to attend to.

34
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:39,184
Still,

35
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:42,624
she's a lady.

36
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:44,424
Previously, I thought

37
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:46,545
she had developed some feelings for you.

38
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:49,304
She spared no effort to pass the exam
and become an official.

39
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:53,584
She didn't do this
just to stay by my side.

40
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:06,704
My Lord.

41
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:15,810
(Yan)

42
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:21,825
Oh.

43
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:23,385
My Lord.

44
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:24,945
Don't be so petty.

45
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:26,785
Would Miss Mu's handwriting

46
00:03:27,184 --> 00:03:28,225
appear one stroke short

47
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:30,424
when I look at it?

48
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:32,785
By the looks of it,

49
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:36,385
this young lady wrote your name

50
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:38,464
when she was thinking of you.

51
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:42,225
My Lord, since you're not
responding to me,

52
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:44,024
I'll go and ask Miss Mu.

53
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,345
Don't bother.

54
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,225
The caravan to the south
has been on its way.

55
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:52,265
She has already left the capital.

56
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:53,825
Gosh.

57
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:57,065
What's the rush?

58
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:00,825
Well,

59
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:02,385
disaster relief
is the priority as of now.

60
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:06,345
Back in my old days,

61
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:07,864
I experienced locust plague, too.

62
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:09,385
Swarms of locusts

63
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:12,744
loom dreadfully overhead
as if they can cover the sky.

64
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:14,184
My Lord.

65
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,985
Humans can resort to any terrible things

66
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:17,665
when they're starving.

67
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,105
You should've stopped
Miss Mu from going.

68
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:28,624
She has her own ambition.

69
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:32,465
There's no way I could stop her.

70
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:33,545
But...

71
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:49,360
(Yongding County, Huaizhou of Jiangnan)

72
00:04:57,385 --> 00:05:00,660
(Yongding County Yamen)

73
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:03,424
Do you call this a granary

74
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:06,064
when there are no grains left?

75
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:10,824
(Assistant of Yongding County Magistrate)
It's my fault.

76
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,184
But all grains in the yamen

77
00:05:13,624 --> 00:05:15,184
have been dished out.

78
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:18,705
New grain supplies from other prefectures
are still on their way.

79
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:21,504
My hands are tied.

80
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:24,345
I want the county magistrate here,

81
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:27,384
not you, a mere assistant.

82
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:30,504
Do you look down on me

83
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,184
and try to make a fool of me?

84
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:34,304
Answer me!

85
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,105
I would never have the guts to do this,
Your Highness.

86
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:39,545
But the country magistrate...

87
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:40,424
He...

88
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,264
What's wrong with him?

89
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:41,944
He...

90
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:43,064
He...

91
00:05:44,105 --> 00:05:46,545
He's exhausted

92
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:47,944
from disaster relief.

93
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:49,864
He's now recuperating at home.

94
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:52,304
So, I'm acting on his behalf.

95
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:54,785
The county magistrate of Yongding

96
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:56,184
is Zhuang, right?

97
00:05:58,665 --> 00:05:59,264
Why?

98
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:01,785
Do you know the county magistrate here,
Official Mu?

99
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:05,504
My relative once

100
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:07,384
had a short stay here.

101
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:10,465
They have heard something
about this place.

102
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:17,944
If it's County Magistrate Zhuang,

103
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:19,545
I wouldn't believe

104
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:21,264
that he collapsed from the overexertion.

105
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,458
How dare you deceive me?

106
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:26,545
You claimed that you were
running out of grain supplies.

107
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:28,025
If so, how do all civil servants

108
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:29,064
survive the famine?

109
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:31,304
Yamen runners out there

110
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:32,985
are all well-fed and sturdy, though.

111
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,585
They don't seem like they're starved.

112
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,145
Bring me all the civil servants now.

113
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:41,504
Yes, Your Highness.

114
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:50,944
Fortunately, Princess Roujia

115
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:52,864
is on her way to retrieve stored grains
from Jishan Hall.

116
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:54,824
That'd help to alleviate the situation.

117
00:06:57,864 --> 00:06:59,264
That's a relief.

118
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:22,025
I was planning to put on a show

119
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:24,905
to intimidate those officials here.

120
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:28,064
And yet, we only manage
to obtain a paltry amount of grains.

121
00:07:29,424 --> 00:07:30,624
It's better than having nothing.

122
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:33,545
As the assistant
of the county magistrate said,

123
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:36,304
most grain supplies
are controlled by local despots.

124
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:43,145
Your Highness,

125
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:46,064
how are you going to deal with this?

126
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,504
Will you distribute them directly
to famine victims

127
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:50,304
or send them
to the charity congee stall?

128
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,321
Why not send them to Jishan Hall?

129
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:57,905
Princess has been providing relief
for the poor over the years.

130
00:07:58,424 --> 00:07:59,424
Handling the grains

131
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:00,985
is a breeze for her.

132
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:06,504
We shall do what Jinghong said.

133
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,905
Transport the grain supplies
to Jishan Hall.

134
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:13,705
Ms. Mu is more familiar
with the situation here.

135
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,264
Stay and assist me.

136
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:17,985
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

137
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:25,624
Those merchants are like gluttons

138
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:27,304
who hoard all grain supplies.

139
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:29,744
I'm afraid it's not easy

140
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,065
to obtain grain supplies from them.

141
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:38,105
Maybe we can rally them

142
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:39,585
and advocate for donations

143
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:41,185
in the name of the government.

144
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:44,465
My Lord.

145
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:48,705
The Falcon Squad has searched through
the entire capital,

146
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:52,024
but there's no sign of Xue Xiaotang.

147
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,624
Please punish me for my incompetence,
My Lord.

148
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:05,664
Get up.

149
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:12,585
Xue Xiaotang is a seasoned general

150
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,544
in managing armies.

151
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:18,185
He's more prudent and vigilant than you.

152
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:23,345
Is Princess Roujia in Jiangnan?

153
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:24,624
Yes.

154
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,185
Her Highness left
together with First Prince.

155
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:29,744
He must have gone to Jiangnan, too.

156
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,544
Hurry and get ready.
We'll head over there soon.

157
00:09:33,144 --> 00:09:33,744
Yes.

158
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:47,225
The relief in Jiangnan is complicated.

159
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:50,544
But you...

160
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:36,264
Your Majesty.

161
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:41,465
What?

162
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:47,264
Lord Ding went to Jiangnan

163
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:50,144
to arrest Xue Xiaotang?

164
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:51,264
Yes,

165
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:52,825
according to the messenger

166
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,185
sent by Official Zhou.

167
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,825
How could it be?

168
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:03,985
Xue Xiaotang should be dead.

169
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:08,185
Go ahead

170
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:10,225
and tell them

171
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:13,904
to find Xue Xiaotang

172
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:16,384
before Liu Yan

173
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:19,305
and silence him forever.

174
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:21,504
Yes, Your Majesty.

175
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:31,784
Are you kidding me?

176
00:11:33,105 --> 00:11:34,585
Donating one hu of rice grains each?
[*"hu" means a unit of measurement]

177
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:36,624
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?

178
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:37,784
Calm down, Your Highness.

179
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,384
I wouldn't dare to deceive you.

180
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,504
I have some income,

181
00:11:41,904 --> 00:11:43,864
but I need to support my whole family.

182
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:45,585
Now that the locust plague

183
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:46,825
has caused a big loss to me.

184
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:48,904
I'm in heavy debt now.

185
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:50,425
That's right.

186
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,705
You said you're in debt?

187
00:11:54,585 --> 00:11:55,225
Yes.

188
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,211
All of you are in debt, too?

189
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:00,744
Yes.

190
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,585
Those famine victims out there

191
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:04,384
are all skin and bones.

192
00:12:05,144 --> 00:12:06,105
But look at

193
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:08,664
your plump faces.

194
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:10,465
Obviously, you're overfed
and developed edema.

195
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:11,664
Your Highness.

196
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:13,624
There's no need

197
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:15,664
to press them anymore.

198
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:18,784
Get lost.

199
00:12:19,144 --> 00:12:19,825
Scram!

200
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:21,425
Yes, Your Highness.

201
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:25,345
Your Highness.

202
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:28,425
These merchants
were evading their responsibilities.

203
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:30,664
We might need some other ways

204
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:33,624
to make them donate.

205
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:36,264
Any ideas in your mind?

206
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:38,744
I'm ashamed

207
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:41,225
that I can't think of one now.

208
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,225
You don't have to.

209
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:47,664
I don't have any ideas either.

210
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:52,585
I wonder how things
are going on with Shen

211
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:54,384
and Her Highness.

212
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:02,024
Don't be anxious, everyone.

213
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:04,345
Calm down.

214
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:09,185
We got these grains

215
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,105
from Jishan Hall in other places.

216
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:12,585
They'll be cooked into congee,

217
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:14,425
and that's enough for each of you.

218
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:18,144
Thank you for your great grace,
Your Highness.

219
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:18,864
Let me do this.

220
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:51,744
Don't be anxious.
You'll have your portion.

221
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:54,544
Careful. No need to push.

222
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:55,345
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

223
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:57,065
It's fine. Get back to your work.

224
00:13:57,065 --> 00:13:58,345
Please stand in line.

225
00:13:58,624 --> 00:13:59,585
This way.

226
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:00,784
Stand in line.

227
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:02,024
Here, please.

228
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:02,864
Don't push.

229
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,384
Be patient. You'll get your portion.

230
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:07,624
Don't push.

231
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:09,105
You'll have your share.

232
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:11,024
Be patient.

233
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:18,065
What did you add?

234
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,544
- What was it?
- What did you put into the congee?

235
00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:21,904
- Weren't they wheat and rice bran?
- Yes.

236
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:22,985
Why did you add that

237
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:24,024
to the congee?

238
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:24,985
I doubt

239
00:14:25,345 --> 00:14:26,465
if we can eat this congee.

240
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,585
That's right. Can we eat the congee
after adding those?

241
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:29,784
That's right.

242
00:14:29,784 --> 00:14:30,744
True. It's dirty.

243
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,544
What are you talking about?

244
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,904
Wheat and rice bran

245
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:36,065
are edible, too. Am I right, folks?

246
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:36,705
Folks.

247
00:14:37,425 --> 00:14:38,864
As she said,

248
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,544
though wheat and rice bran

249
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:42,664
have a rough texture,

250
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:44,305
they fill our stomachs.

251
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,305
We didn't mean to do this,

252
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:50,305
but we want to take precautions against
freeloaders who don't really need this.

253
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:52,705
Who is the freeloader?

254
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,264
How could there be freeloaders?

255
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:56,705
The two men at the front here.

256
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,744
They look well-fed.

257
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:01,624
I guess you have abundant food at home.

258
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:03,945
That's why you're nitpicking here.

259
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,624
Don't accuse me of that.

260
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:07,945
Nonsense.

261
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:14,744
You deserve your title
of Gifted Scholar.

262
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:16,345
Your idea is brilliant.

263
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:19,544
Actually, it's not something new.

264
00:15:21,264 --> 00:15:22,864
You should've worked
on something more important

265
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:25,105
to perform your talent,

266
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:26,384
instead of helping me here.

267
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:28,305
Food is the primary need of the people.

268
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:29,705
I think this is

269
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:30,784
of equal significance.

270
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:34,425
The congee is ready.

271
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:35,465
Give me first.

272
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:36,225
Give me first.

273
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:37,144
I want some.

274
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,024
I want congee.

275
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:39,144
Here, here.

276
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:42,105
Official Shen, let me.

277
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:47,504
Thank you, Your Highness.

278
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:49,664
Your Highness.

279
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:51,664
Did you hurt yourself?

280
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:53,624
- Your Highness, I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

281
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:56,144
Thank you so much.

282
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,864
Thank you, Your Highness.

283
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,185
I don't deserve your appreciation.

284
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:03,425
It's the world that is cruel to you.

285
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:06,024
No one is inferior to another.

286
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:11,264
I'll take over here.

287
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,345
You should take care of your wound.

288
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:13,504
It's just trivial.

289
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:14,985
It needs to be treated,
even if it's minor.

290
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:16,105
I'll take care of it

291
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:17,305
once everything is settled.

292
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:20,784
Please be careful as well.

293
00:16:21,784 --> 00:16:22,624
I will.

294
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,825
Here.

295
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:54,945
Your Highness, are you worried
about First Prince and the others?

296
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:03,065
(What would you do)

297
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:05,185
(if you were in my shoes?)

298
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:14,225
(Secure food supply.)

299
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:21,064
(I know we should secure food supply.)

300
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:22,784
(But how?)

301
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:28,945
(The mightiest levee)

302
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:30,865
(can be breached by a tiny ant hole.)

303
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:32,584
(A tall building)

304
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:34,784
(can be burned down
by a wisp of smoke from a chink.)

305
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:37,264
(To secure the food supply,)

306
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:39,064
(you need to start with one opening)

307
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,040
(that can influence the whole.)

308
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:44,104
(Otherwise, everything
is but an impregnable wall)

309
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:45,784
(that shieds you off.)

310
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:51,465
(I got it.)

311
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:53,344
(Cut the head)

312
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:55,185
(off the snake.)

313
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:04,985
(Merchants are devious.)

314
00:18:05,425 --> 00:18:06,465
(Therefore,)

315
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:10,425
(you can give them
the taste of their own medicine.)

316
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:14,985
(Yes, that's right.)

317
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:17,905
(You used to mock me that)

318
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:18,985
("Only women and villains
are hard to tackle.")

319
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:20,465
(Isn't that a suitable way)

320
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:21,544
(to deal with this problem?)

321
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,225
(Merchants are the villains,)

322
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:24,425
(while I'm a woman.)

323
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:27,064
(I might as well outfox them)

324
00:18:27,544 --> 00:18:28,344
(and be more shameless than them.)

325
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,465
(Jishan Hall)

326
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:39,225
Your Highness.

327
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:43,665
You forget to apply ointment.

328
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:46,665
Thank you for reminding me.

329
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:53,905
(It's him again.)

330
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:03,544
I remember him.

331
00:19:03,905 --> 00:19:06,225
He was sneakily wandering

332
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:07,705
around Jishan Hall yesterday.

333
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:31,705
Xiaotang.

334
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:41,865
Your Highness.

335
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,185
Were you calling General Xue just now?

336
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:01,665
Do you think

337
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:03,064
he's General Xue?

338
00:20:04,744 --> 00:20:05,705
Could it be a mistake?

339
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:07,145
No.

340
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:08,865
I wouldn't make such a mistake.

341
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,225
It turns out he's alive.

342
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,824
But why does he avoid me?

343
00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:32,385
Thank you.

344
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:34,824
Remember this.

345
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,705
I want the best bird's nest
and moose face meat.

346
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:38,665
Never brush me off
with inferior-quality ingredients.

347
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:39,865
It's Butler Zhang.

348
00:20:40,544 --> 00:20:42,185
I can ask him
what Zhimo's favorite food is.

349
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:43,784
Thank you.

350
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:44,744
Have a nice day.

351
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:52,104
What a coincidence.

352
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,385
Butler Zhang.

353
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:56,544
Are you

354
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:58,865
Miss Mu's maid?

355
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,359
That was an intense hit.

356
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:04,264
My bones were almost dislodged.

357
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:06,225
My apologies, Butler Zhang.

358
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:07,905
I lost control of my strength.

359
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:08,784
I'll give you a massage.

360
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:10,145
It's okay.

361
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:11,865
Oh, right. Butler Zhang.

362
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:13,465
Can I ask you something?

363
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:16,705
Do you know what Zhimo likes to eat?

364
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:17,824
Why are you asking this?

365
00:21:18,024 --> 00:21:18,985
I want to give him a treat.

366
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:20,865
A treat?

367
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:23,104
But he's not in the capital.

368
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:25,264
He's not here?

369
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:32,304
My Lord.

370
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,425
Princess Roujia

371
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,504
headed to Yongding County,
the disaster-stricken area in Huaizhou.

372
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:38,104
Head to Yongding, then.

373
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,625
Everyone will get a share.

374
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:45,784
Take this.

375
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:46,824
Carry everything to the yard.

376
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:47,625
Thank you, Your Highness.

377
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:48,385
It's for you.

378
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:49,145
Thank you, Your Highness.

379
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:50,584
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Take this.

380
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:51,905
Thank you, Your Highness.

381
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:54,665
Thank you, Your Highness.

382
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:55,744
I want some, too.

383
00:21:55,744 --> 00:21:56,304
Please have it.

384
00:21:56,304 --> 00:21:57,425
It's yours.

385
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:58,625
Thank you, Your Highness.

386
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,945
No need to rush. Everyone will have it.

387
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:01,665
Thank you, Your Highness.

388
00:22:08,104 --> 00:22:08,865
Hold it properly.

389
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:10,264
Don't drop it.

390
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:18,635
(Jishan Hall)

391
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,185
All folks of Huaizhou,

392
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:25,905
(Public Display of Donation)
First Prince led us to Huaizhou

393
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:28,064
under the mission of disaster relief.

394
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:29,824
Unexpectedly,

395
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:31,858
First Prince didn't anticipate

396
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:34,824
the severity of the disaster here.

397
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:38,264
Official relief alone
wouldn't be enough.

398
00:22:40,784 --> 00:22:41,744
Fortunately,

399
00:22:43,304 --> 00:22:45,064
our local merchants

400
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:47,104
have chipped in generously

401
00:22:47,504 --> 00:22:49,945
and sent aid to the people

402
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:51,104
to protect everyone

403
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:52,385
throughout this disaster.

404
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,145
Our merchants of Huaizhou

405
00:22:54,145 --> 00:22:55,945
are indeed great philanthropists.

406
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,497
Therefore, I'm going

407
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:00,905
to display the list

408
00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:02,064
of merchants' contributions.

409
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,225
On behalf of the First Prince, I express
my gratitude for the generous donation.

410
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:08,905
Good.

411
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:10,824
Look.

412
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:12,225
The donation is small.

413
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:21,304
How shameless these local despots are!

414
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:24,504
How dare they act so audaciously

415
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,185
when they coughed up so little grains
to the government!

416
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:28,145
This is out of line!

417
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,905
They disrespect the imperial court!

418
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:32,024
They deceive the people!

419
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:34,064
Let's go and confront them!

420
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:36,544
Let's go! Everyone!

421
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:39,465
Let's go!

422
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:47,985
Little boy.

423
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:49,425
Don't worry.

424
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:51,905
The government won't let
the people go hungry.

425
00:23:53,024 --> 00:23:53,465
Excuse me.

426
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:54,185
Give me the flatbread.

427
00:23:55,985 --> 00:23:56,504
Here you go.

428
00:23:56,824 --> 00:23:58,064
Take this flatbread.

429
00:23:58,465 --> 00:23:59,425
Thank you.

430
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:00,304
You should head home.

431
00:24:01,304 --> 00:24:01,985
Go ahead.

432
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:11,705
Your Highness.

433
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:15,905
They ask for trouble themselves.

434
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,784
I shall see

435
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:19,905
how long they can hold on.

436
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:29,260
(Mu's Residence)

437
00:24:43,344 --> 00:24:43,985
Who was it?

438
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:44,945
Who is this outrageous?

439
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:46,385
We're coming at you.

440
00:24:46,544 --> 00:24:48,784
The richest merchant in Jiangnan
merely donated chicken feed.

441
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:50,905
You have no conscience at all!

442
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:52,705
What do the rich eat
when their meat is running out?

443
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:54,225
They eat the relief grain
that belongs to the people.

444
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:55,304
Beat this rat to a pulp!

445
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:57,024
Beat him!

446
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:58,465
Beat him!

447
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,665
Beat him!

448
00:25:03,024 --> 00:25:04,024
Close the gates.

449
00:25:09,504 --> 00:25:10,544
What on earth is going on?

450
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:12,024
Old Master, bad news!

451
00:25:12,145 --> 00:25:13,385
First Prince

452
00:25:13,385 --> 00:25:15,385
displayed our donation details.

453
00:25:15,385 --> 00:25:16,385
And it ignites the people's outrage.

454
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:19,544
We're not the only ones
who offered little donations.

455
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:21,104
Why are they blocking
in front of my residence?

456
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,385
The people's rage is overwhelmed.

457
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:25,504
We're not the only household
they're blocking.

458
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:34,024
To think that First Prince
and Mu Zhuohua

459
00:25:34,024 --> 00:25:35,304
undermine those merchants.

460
00:25:36,225 --> 00:25:37,425
They actually expose the names

461
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:38,744
of those who offer paltry donations,

462
00:25:38,985 --> 00:25:39,865
giving them no quarter.

463
00:25:40,145 --> 00:25:41,705
It's a considerable growth.

464
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:45,344
True, First Prince has changed a lot.

465
00:25:52,024 --> 00:25:52,985
Right, let's go.

466
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:54,185
My Lord.

467
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:56,824
Don't we have to inform First Prince
about our arrival?

468
00:25:58,504 --> 00:25:59,344
No need.

469
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:02,945
We came here in secret.

470
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:06,024
No need to meddle in their action.

471
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:09,705
Now Roujia
isn't in the relay station now.

472
00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:12,504
What about Xue Xiaotang?

473
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:15,865
He must be around Jishan Hall.

474
00:26:18,985 --> 00:26:19,625
Zhijian.

475
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:21,945
I need you to do something for me.

476
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,535
(Yunlou Inn)

477
00:26:38,824 --> 00:26:39,784
It's Lord Ding.

478
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:48,264
(This can't be.)

479
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:51,024
(He wouldn't come to Jiangnan.)

480
00:26:51,824 --> 00:26:53,104
(It's an illusion.)

481
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,465
(Forget it.)

482
00:26:55,024 --> 00:26:56,385
(I have something important
to deal with tomorrow.)

483
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:57,784
(Stop overthinking.)

484
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:02,425
Old Master.

485
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,905
As of now, our stores on Jinyang Street
have been closed for days.

486
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:06,584
This can't go on.

487
00:27:06,744 --> 00:27:08,024
We're facing the same problem.

488
00:27:08,264 --> 00:27:09,465
Plus, some kids

489
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:11,625
are singing rhymes
insulting the Mu family.

490
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:12,905
Everyone points the finger at us

491
00:27:13,344 --> 00:27:14,625
when we go out,

492
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:16,425
let alone run the business.

493
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,784
It'll become worse.

494
00:27:19,185 --> 00:27:20,064
What should we do now?

495
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:22,385
All you do is complain to me.

496
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:24,705
Come up with a solution, will you?

497
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:26,665
Expel them.

498
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,625
Only if you want
our business to close down.

499
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,584
Then... Just ignore them?

500
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:33,784
We can't let this continue, after all.

501
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:36,465
Our reputation will be tarnished

502
00:27:36,744 --> 00:27:37,784
in Yongding County

503
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:39,385
and even the entire Huaizhou.

504
00:27:41,264 --> 00:27:41,945
Old Master.

505
00:27:42,665 --> 00:27:43,425
What again?

506
00:27:44,104 --> 00:27:46,064
Old Master, a scholar is outside.

507
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,225
He claims to have a solution

508
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:48,665
to the Mu family's current difficulty.

509
00:27:57,264 --> 00:27:57,985
Invite him in now.

510
00:27:58,744 --> 00:27:59,465
Open the gate.

511
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:01,504
Please, sir.

512
00:28:06,104 --> 00:28:06,465
Please.

513
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:24,824
I'm Mu Zhuohua from Yanzhou.

514
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:27,425
I came from the same clan as you,
Old Master Mu.

515
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:31,185
I followed the First Prince
and Princess Roujia here

516
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:32,385
a few days ago.

517
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:35,824
Mu Zhuohua.

518
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:38,225
You have quite a nerve
to bring up our clan.

519
00:28:38,824 --> 00:28:40,145
I wouldn't have gotten
chewed out so badly

520
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:41,744
if it weren't for you.

521
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:44,385
Old Master Mu.

522
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:46,625
You made your donation,

523
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:48,544
and we announced this to the public.

524
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:51,625
I wonder what we've done wrong

525
00:28:52,784 --> 00:28:53,985
in this.

526
00:28:56,425 --> 00:28:58,385
Do you serve the imperial court now,
Official Mu?

527
00:28:58,824 --> 00:28:59,425
Yes, I do.

528
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:01,744
I'm the administrator
of the Ministry of Rites.

529
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:03,865
A primary sixth-rank official.

530
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:10,344
Greetings, Official Mu.

531
00:29:21,985 --> 00:29:22,744
Old Master Mu.

532
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:25,744
The reason why I didn't visit
other merchants

533
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,425
because I'm aware

534
00:29:28,905 --> 00:29:32,264
that you're sensible and righteous.

535
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:35,865
Hence, I'm willing to come here

536
00:29:36,264 --> 00:29:38,225
along with my solution.

537
00:29:40,705 --> 00:29:41,985
Official Mu.

538
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:44,425
May I know what your solution is?

539
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:48,744
Open your granary to the public.

540
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:58,544
No way. I will never do that!

541
00:30:01,544 --> 00:30:02,225
Old Master Mu.

542
00:30:02,905 --> 00:30:05,625
Now is the pivotal moment.

543
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,824
Do you want to remain
as the wealthiest man in Jiangnan,

544
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:12,665
who's exalted by the people,

545
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,304
or to take sides

546
00:30:14,425 --> 00:30:16,504
with other merchants

547
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,344
and get tossed

548
00:30:18,544 --> 00:30:19,744
into infamy?

549
00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:22,824
Merchants always go
for the biggest interests.

550
00:30:23,945 --> 00:30:25,945
Which path is the right one to go with?

551
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,064
Old Master Mu,

552
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:29,064
can't you tell?

553
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:33,264
But...

554
00:30:34,905 --> 00:30:36,344
- But...
- Old Master.

555
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:38,784
But it's imperative

556
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:40,385
to be the first to act

557
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:42,625
to obtain the best result ever.

558
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:47,665
How so?

559
00:30:49,985 --> 00:30:52,465
If you're not willing
to be the first one to act,

560
00:30:52,744 --> 00:30:54,504
sooner or later,

561
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:55,544
someone will open their granary
to the public

562
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,465
as they can't stand the public outrage.

563
00:30:57,744 --> 00:30:58,824
By that time,

564
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,665
everyone will sing praises of them

565
00:31:00,744 --> 00:31:02,705
for being the first welldoer,

566
00:31:03,024 --> 00:31:05,385
while the other merchants who act later

567
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:07,465
will be pegged as following suit.

568
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:09,544
Old Master Mu.

569
00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:11,665
I've analyzed the current situation

570
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,584
very clearly to you.

571
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:17,104
If you still refuse to open the granary,

572
00:31:17,905 --> 00:31:18,705
I will visit

573
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:21,705
another merchant.

574
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:23,185
Please stay, Official Mu.

575
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:28,304
You have a good point, Official Mu.

576
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,030
There are so many merchants in Huaizhou,

577
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:36,385
and not everyone
can commit to the same goal.

578
00:31:36,385 --> 00:31:39,264
Thus, someone has to stand out.

579
00:31:42,824 --> 00:31:43,544
I'll do it.

580
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:46,064
Thank you, Old Master Mu.

581
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:48,145
You're welcome.

582
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:49,425
I shall take my leave, then.

583
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:00,665
Darling.

584
00:32:01,225 --> 00:32:03,665
Don't you think this Official Mu

585
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:05,465
seems familiar?

586
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:12,744
Why can't our family

587
00:32:12,744 --> 00:32:14,344
have a witty person like her?

588
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:15,824
(You have so many concubines)

589
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:16,824
(and children.)

590
00:32:16,824 --> 00:32:17,784
(But you never care about them.)

591
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:19,304
You're not blessed with such a gift.

592
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:20,264
You!

593
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:20,905
(In the end,)

594
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,625
(you couldn't even recognize
your own daughter.)

595
00:32:34,225 --> 00:32:36,145
We've resolved
the most pressing problem.

596
00:32:36,465 --> 00:32:38,104
Her Highness must be glad.

597
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:41,705
The Mu family takes the lead
in distributing grain supplies.

598
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:42,945
The other merchants

599
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:44,385
can't get other excuses, then.

600
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,064
That's right.

601
00:32:56,744 --> 00:33:02,264
Great!

602
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:08,705
Jinghong.

603
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:11,544
Please deliver the provision to Jiao

604
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:12,665
in Jishan Hall.

605
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:13,425
Yes, Your Highness.

606
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,851
(Jishan Hall)

607
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:29,824
With one person standing up,
others will follow suit.

608
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:33,705
This is an expedient method.

609
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:35,705
My Lord.

610
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:37,385
Are you worried about her?

611
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,824
I'm just talking about the matter itself.

612
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:46,425
All right. Next, please.

613
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:49,225
Is Xue Xiaotang here?

614
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:52,225
He'll show up
as long as Roujia is here.

615
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,544
Xue Xiaotang comes from Jingzhou.

616
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:56,584
He's an orphan

617
00:33:57,705 --> 00:33:59,504
and has no friends or relatives
in Southern Chen.

618
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:02,304
He ascended from a commoner

619
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:03,705
to the Grand General of the Nation.

620
00:34:03,705 --> 00:34:04,824
Surely, he has his own way.

621
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,665
He's good at hiding

622
00:34:06,665 --> 00:34:07,784
and face disguise skills.

623
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:09,985
It won't be easy

624
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:11,144
to identify him in a crowd.

625
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:17,785
General Xue,
you're really good at hiding.

626
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:22,425
I found you.

627
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,435
(Shang Shou)

628
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:54,184
Old geezer.

629
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:57,104
You have quite a mood to fish here

630
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:59,544
when you have one foot in the grave.

631
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:06,504
If you drink the dirty water here,

632
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:08,905
you'll go into the grave before me.

633
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,184
By any chance,

634
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:19,785
are you Tutor Shang of the academy
in the east of the town?

635
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:25,385
It seems that I'm quite famous.

636
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:28,544
Previously, the water level declined,

637
00:35:29,345 --> 00:35:32,985
and the locusts laid eggs
along the bank.

638
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:34,785
If you were to drink the water here,

639
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:36,385
I'm afraid

640
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:38,945
your stomach will be filled
with eggs tonight.

641
00:35:39,024 --> 00:35:41,825
You may suffer from vomiting and diarrhea
till you're dead.

642
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:46,624
Please help me, sir.

643
00:35:49,144 --> 00:35:49,825
All right.

644
00:35:50,624 --> 00:35:51,624
I tell you what.

645
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:54,385
After you go back,

646
00:35:56,745 --> 00:36:00,985
filter the river water with fine sand

647
00:36:01,345 --> 00:36:02,504
to remove dirt.

648
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:05,305
Then boil the water

649
00:36:05,584 --> 00:36:06,865
with charcoal.

650
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:08,265
It's safe to drink, then.

651
00:36:11,064 --> 00:36:13,104
Thank you for saving my life,
Tutor Shang.

652
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,460
(Liquor)

653
00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:33,584
Qi.

654
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:35,865
It's been a long while, old geezer.

655
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:38,664
Have a taste.

656
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:50,504
How does it taste?

657
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:51,465
Fine brew.

658
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,425
Of course.

659
00:36:53,425 --> 00:36:54,664
I'd been searching

660
00:36:54,704 --> 00:36:57,064
throughout all liquor stores in Huaizhou

661
00:36:57,144 --> 00:36:59,465
and got this small jar
of peach blossom brew.

662
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:01,945
I need more than

663
00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:03,985
this little jar.

664
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:06,024
I can only wet my whistle with it.

665
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:11,985
Sir.

666
00:37:13,923 --> 00:37:14,704
What are you doing?

667
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:18,785
Please pardon me.

668
00:37:19,385 --> 00:37:21,184
I've been away for years.

669
00:37:21,945 --> 00:37:23,465
Fortunately, you're safe and healthy.

670
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:25,425
Cut that out.

671
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,530
I came here to apologize

672
00:37:27,785 --> 00:37:29,224
because I didn't visit you

673
00:37:29,298 --> 00:37:30,818
right after I came here.

674
00:37:31,144 --> 00:37:32,785
I was dealing with disaster relief.

675
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:35,465
Had you come straight to me,

676
00:37:35,584 --> 00:37:37,465
I would've thrown you out.

677
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,345
Do you believe me?

678
00:37:38,504 --> 00:37:39,064
I do.

679
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:57,144
That's nothing to look at.

680
00:37:57,785 --> 00:37:59,144
I forgot to throw them away.

681
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:00,104
Sir.

682
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:01,624
I didn't know

683
00:38:02,425 --> 00:38:04,224
you still kept my handwriting

684
00:38:04,945 --> 00:38:05,865
and essays I wrote

685
00:38:07,425 --> 00:38:08,425
when I was little.

686
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:11,504
I told you I forgot to get rid of them.

687
00:38:12,504 --> 00:38:14,144
Come on and sit.

688
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:16,504
Right away.

689
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:18,825
Later, I'll write some more for you

690
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,480
so that you can have it as a keepsake.

691
00:38:23,624 --> 00:38:24,465
Come over and sit.

692
00:38:27,345 --> 00:38:28,385
You must have been tired

693
00:38:29,144 --> 00:38:30,184
since coming here.

694
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:34,745
While I was away these years,

695
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,305
why do you have so much grizzle hair?

696
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:40,465
Don't make a fuss about it.

697
00:38:40,664 --> 00:38:41,865
I'm old now.

698
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:42,624
Sit.

699
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:45,385
Listen here.

700
00:38:46,144 --> 00:38:47,704
You're old now,

701
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:50,265
and the town is in chaos.

702
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:52,184
Please stay at home

703
00:38:52,265 --> 00:38:53,144
and don't wander around.

704
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:53,785
All right?

705
00:38:54,104 --> 00:38:55,184
You're talking to your teacher.

706
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:56,544
Mind your language.

707
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,544
Well, listen.

708
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:02,704
I know this place is comfy,

709
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:05,624
but I can't find peace here.

710
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:08,184
Instead, I feel peaceful

711
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:10,745
in the chaos outside.

712
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,825
After all,
it's because of my incompetence.

713
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:18,825
Don't say that.

714
00:39:19,184 --> 00:39:20,745
You were doing a kind deed just now.

715
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:24,657
That's all I can do.

716
00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:27,224
But you're different.

717
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,024
This disaster relief effort

718
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,785
might seem successful,

719
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:34,144
and you managed to get the merchants
to donate grain supplies.

720
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:35,865
However, have you thought

721
00:39:36,104 --> 00:39:38,265
about where the official grains went?

722
00:39:39,664 --> 00:39:40,425
I did.

723
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:41,584
I did think about it.

724
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:45,064
That's why I'm here
to seek your enlightenment.

725
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,865
I feel that there are some complexities

726
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:49,958
behind this.

727
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:52,785
I'll tell you this.

728
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:55,985
When the locusts showed up initially,

729
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,184
they could've nipped
the disaster in the bud.

730
00:39:58,624 --> 00:40:00,704
However, Zhuang Wenfeng led the people

731
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:02,307
to pay homage to the God of Locusts,

732
00:40:02,825 --> 00:40:04,785
leaving the disaster unbridled

733
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:05,865
to rampage the entire town.

734
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:08,224
Zhuang Wenfeng?
