=The Legend of Zhuohua=

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,885
=Episode 1=

19
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:48,010
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,685
(Mu's Residence)

21
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,010
Young Lady, do you want
to bring along all the scrolls?

22
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,131
Yes, put them here.

23
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:18,571
Why does the bridal sedan chair
enter from the side door?

24
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,731
She's only a concubine.

25
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,731
The Mu family is indeed
the wealthiest in Jiangnan.

26
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,451
Old Master Mu has already taken in
over a dozen concubines.

27
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:24,331
And now, he's marrying one more.

28
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,011
Young Lady, First Madam and the rest
are coming this way.

29
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:34,411
Hurry up. Let's go and take a look.

30
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,930
Coming.

31
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:39,611
(First Madam of the Mu family)
I heard that she looks gorgeous.

32
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:41,090
(The legitimate wife)
Why would Old Master marry an ugly one?

33
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,810
(Mu Ba, the eighth daughter)
Peach blossoms in graceful brilliance.

34
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,250
(Fifth Madam)

35
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,851
(The concubine of the Mu family)
The maiden is asked for her hand.

36
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,611
Look at Mu Qi.

37
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:55,851
Is she really aiming for Zhuangyuan?
[*the scholar who has the highest score]

38
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,451
She's soon becoming
the wife of the county magistrate.

39
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:00,291
Why bother studying all this stuff?

40
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,731
Are you not paying your respect to me?

41
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:07,810
The ceremony is about to start.

42
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:08,970
Why are you concerned

43
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,611
about whether Qi will
continue her studies or get married?

44
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:13,051
Peach blossoms bloom

45
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,851
with lush green leaves.

46
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,611
The maiden is asked for her hand

47
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,490
to build a harmonious family.

48
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:19,770
- Peach blossoms bloom...
- Young Lady.

49
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,490
Young Lady, stop reading.

50
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,851
They've gone.

51
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:24,411
Luckily, Old Master always
holds a grandeur wedding

52
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:25,571
whenever he marries a concubine.

53
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,731
And we can make good use of this chance.

54
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:27,731
All right, let's go.

55
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:32,611
Careful. Watch your step.

56
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:39,331
Bride bows to husbandry livestock.

57
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:41,530
May the livestock thrive.

58
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:45,770
Bride bows to the wellspring.

59
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,291
May the offspring flourish.

60
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,650
On this fortunate day,

61
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:54,490
a new concubine is taken in

62
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:56,291
before the witness of the deity.

63
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:56,891
(Tablet of Kitchen God)

64
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:57,970
(Tablet of Kitchen God)
Please bring forth the God of Stove.

65
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,131
Bride, bow.

66
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,411
You came last to this residence.

67
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:07,171
You should listen to us from now on.

68
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,250
I'm the seventeenth concubine.
You must respect me.

69
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:12,611
Let's go.

70
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:46,531
You may cross your arms and drink.

71
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,971
Unveil.

72
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,531
(Mu Rong, Head of the Mu family)
I shall unveil

73
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:56,971
(Mu Rong, Head of the Mu family)

74
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:58,651
(Mu Rong, Head of the Mu family)
my twentieth...

75
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,211
twentieth...

76
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,291
It's the eighteenth.

77
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,651
Oh, right. The eighteenth.

78
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,171
I shall unveil

79
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:09,851
my eighteenth sweetheart.

80
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:20,635
(Mu Zhuohua, Mu Qi,
the seventh daughter)

81
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:23,635
(Mu's Residence)

82
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:26,091
(Guo Juli, Mu Zhuohua's maidservant)

83
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:27,810
(Guo Juli, Mu Zhuohua's maidservant)
Young Lady, we should be on our way now.

84
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:31,971
Let's go.

85
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,531
Young Lady.

86
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:45,211
Why are you still reading
in the carriage?

87
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,051
It's bumpy.

88
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:48,851
Women would end up getting married

89
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:50,250
if they don't study well.

90
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:53,531
Young Lady, aren't all women
meant to get married?

91
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,731
Old Master has already married
eighteen concubines.

92
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,450
Well,

93
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:00,171
mortal hearts always grow fond
of young and dainty faces.

94
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,890
It'll be a wonderful scene

95
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:04,250
if the house is filled
with delicate beauties.

96
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,771
Isn't it too many

97
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:07,370
in our residence?

98
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,890
Well, the more, the merrier.

99
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:11,091
True, though.

100
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:13,570
County Magistrate Zhuang
still wants to marry you

101
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:14,810
when he has already had
so many concubines.

102
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:18,091
Strangely, both Old Master
and First Madam

103
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:19,490
reckon that this marriage
is beyond your station.

104
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,731
If a man indulges in love,

105
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:22,771
he can still break free from it.

106
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,490
But if a woman indulges in love,

107
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:25,971
she'll be trapped forever.

108
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:28,130
Young Lady, what does it mean?

109
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,130
It means

110
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,370
once a woman engages in marriage,

111
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:34,411
her entire life is doomed.

112
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:37,611
What if the man's only
loyal to his wife?

113
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:41,731
My father even vowed to my mother

114
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:45,130
that he would never marry other women.

115
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:49,531
But if you don't get married,
you'll have to stand on your own feet.

116
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,450
As long as I could earn my place
in the examination,

117
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:54,890
no one can boss me around.

118
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:56,771
I'll be the county magistrate myself,

119
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:58,490
instead of a magistrate's wife.

120
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,810
Only five days

121
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,690
before my wedding to Mu Qi.

122
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,570
(Zhuang Wenfeng, County Magistrate
of Yongding, Huaizhou)

123
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,771
(Butler Zhou, Butler of Zhou's Residence)
But she runs off before the wedding.

124
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,690
What does she take me for?

125
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:10,130
Mu Qi would never escape my grasp.

126
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:11,930
Go after her.

127
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,051
Yes!

128
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,985
(Huaizhou)

129
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,585
(Capital)

130
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:29,570
Towering city walls
stretches into infinity.

131
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,651
Outside the woods,
there's a shoal surrounded by water.

132
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,010
Juli.

133
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,171
We'll reach the capital

134
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:37,851
after passing through the forest ahead.

135
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:38,731
Sure thing.

136
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:00,260
(Mingde Gate)

137
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,851
- How magnificent.
- This is truly the great capital.

138
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,611
That's right, Young Lady.

139
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,890
Look over there.

140
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,851
How lively.

141
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,330
There are many delicious food too.

142
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,851
Lord Ding has returned to the capital.

143
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,771
Look at the grandeur.

144
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,291
Look, Juli.

145
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:40,450
That's Lord Ding's carriage.

146
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,011
Is he Lord Ding

147
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:44,771
who petitioned for the reopening
of women's examination candidacy?

148
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,810
Rumors have it

149
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:48,210
that he's wise as a fox,

150
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:49,491
as proud as a wolf,

151
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:50,850
and as cruel as a tiger.

152
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:51,930
He's a nefarious demon

153
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,491
who can silence a bawling child
in Northern Liang.

154
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,651
He's truly amazing.

155
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,330
Eight years ago,

156
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:00,610
Lord Ding led the 30,000 soldiers
of the Cangwu Army

157
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:03,570
to defeat the 10,000 soldiers
of Northern Liang in Yan City.

158
00:09:04,371 --> 00:09:06,690
And this war was also the dark turn

159
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,171
of Northern Liang

160
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,171
as the Southern Chen
has risen to be on par with them.

161
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:15,291
How did he manage that?

162
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,531
Tutor Shang didn't go into
detail on this, though.

163
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,930
I will ask Lord Ding about this personally

164
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,291
if I get to know him in the future.

165
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:23,850
All right.

166
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:31,690
Lord Ding's Residence is right ahead.
Let's get off the horse.

167
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:34,371
Hurry up.

168
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:36,651
Oh, right. You haven't eaten yet.

169
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,730
Here. Take a bite.

170
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:43,051
Give me the rein.

171
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,771
Hyah!

172
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:48,330
Hyah!

173
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,371
Young Lady, we're moving towards
the demon's troop.

174
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:53,051
Hyah!

175
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:57,771
(I must take this risk.)

176
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:58,450
Hyah!

177
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,930
Mother!

178
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,450
(Zhimo, Lord Ding's guard)

179
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,291
(Zhimo, Lord Ding's guard)
Mother!

180
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,491
(Zhimo, Lord Ding's guard)
Wait for me, Mother! I'm to blame!

181
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,251
Hyah!

182
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:14,410
(Lord Ding's Residence)

183
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:16,690
Hyah!

184
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:26,891
What do we do now?

185
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,131
Come on. Keep on searching.

186
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,210
Come on.

187
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:47,371
Young Lady, you gave me a good scare.

188
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:49,771
You were actually running toward
the demon's troop just now.

189
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:50,891
You're tempting your fate.

190
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,251
I guess Lord Ding's men

191
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,051
wouldn't simply kill.

192
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,251
But the hand at the window

193
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,371
doesn't seem to be Lord Ding's.

194
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,730
The hand looked smooth and flawless.

195
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,810
It's nothing like

196
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,171
the hand of a battle-hardened warrior.

197
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,810
I smell a rat here.

198
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,690
Young Lady!

199
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,090
You have such keen eyes.

200
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:18,131
Think about this.
After the war in Yan City,

201
00:11:18,371 --> 00:11:20,090
both Northern Liang and Southern Chen

202
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:22,531
still struggles in the tug of war,

203
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,771
even though we've turned the tide.

204
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:25,930
In fact,

205
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:27,651
it's because Lord Ding
experienced a fatal defeat

206
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:29,131
in the war of Juma River

207
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,051
and the Cangwu Army suffered
heavy casualties.

208
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,850
Since then,

209
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:35,531
Lord Ding has been
keeping in low profile.

210
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:39,610
However, his return
is on the crowd's radar this time.

211
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:43,330
I think there must be more to it

212
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:45,411
than meets the eye.

213
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,491
By the way, Young Lady,

214
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,690
how long can we hide here?

215
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,090
County Magistrate Zhuang's men
have spotted us here.

216
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,690
Lord Ding has given me an idea.

217
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,450
We need more than one place to hide.

218
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:06,450
(Lord Ding's Residence)

219
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,171
Gosh. You shouldn't have done that.

220
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,730
It was just a little girl

221
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,771
who rushed toward her ailing mother.

222
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,171
Why did you draw your sword?

223
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,371
Luckily, I stopped you in time.

224
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:19,330
Aren't you afraid
of attracting the city guards

225
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,131
after you kill her?

226
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,011
(Butler Zhang,
Butler of Lord Ding's Residence)

227
00:12:23,011 --> 00:12:25,251
His Lordship has delayed his return.

228
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:26,610
I had to pretend to be him

229
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:28,330
and sit on the carriage for so long.

230
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,011
My body is sore.

231
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,171
I need to get some rest.

232
00:12:35,335 --> 00:12:36,485
(Someone)

233
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:37,810
(has)

234
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,385
(to be in the study.)

235
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:04,771
My Lord.

236
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,251
(Zhijian, Lord Ding's guard)
You don't have to come here personally.

237
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:07,891
(Zhijian, Lord Ding's guard)

238
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:09,810
(Zhijian, Lord Ding's guard)
Besides, Zhimo and Butler Zhang

239
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,850
had to put on a show pretending
that you've returned to the capital.

240
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:14,810
I don't want things
to become complicated.

241
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,171
Yes.

242
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,171
My Lord, I didn't expect this place

243
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:33,090
to have a peach blossom forest.

244
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:34,491
We've been searching for so many years.

245
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,330
Never had we thought
it would be in the capital.

246
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,410
(Cangwu)

247
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:35,131
(Liu Yan, Lord Ding of Southern Chen)

248
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:36,330
(Tomb of Late Father, Yuan Chengming)
Yuan Chengming.

249
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,970
Finally, we found you.

250
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,531
You have nowhere to hide now.

251
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:41,531
I'm going to dig your grave now.

252
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,011
Let's see

253
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,610
if you're dead or hiding somewhere else.

254
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:49,771
My Lord. In the war of Juma River,

255
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:51,690
30,000 armies perished in Ci City.

256
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,771
Yuan Chengming is a traitor.

257
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,850
He failed your trust

258
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,371
and disappointed the 30,000 heroes
of the Cangwu Army.

259
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:01,210
Yet to this day,

260
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:04,532
I don't believe he'd betray us.

261
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,291
My Lord.

262
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:16,651
Yuan Chengming betrayed us!

263
00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:19,531
We're being ambushed.

264
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:32,285
(By daughter Yun Xiangyue)

265
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:35,651
Yun Xiangyue?

266
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:44,891
Send someone to search through
the islet in the middle of the lake.

267
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,570
Also, exhume his body for investigation

268
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:49,411
and look into Yun Xiangyue,

269
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,970
who erected this tombstone
under the name of his daughter.

270
00:15:52,531 --> 00:15:53,131
Yes.

271
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,970
I must bring the truth back then

272
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:57,251
to light.

273
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,411
(Xiaoqin Pleasure House)

274
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:02,011
Walk slowly.

275
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,570
Are you drunk, Mr. Qin?

276
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,771
No, I didn't drink much.

277
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:07,011
I'll be waiting for you here.
Please come again.

278
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:08,411
Sure, I'll come again.

279
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,570
All right. Take care.

280
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,371
Please see him off.

281
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,810
(Flower Alley)
People considered fancy ladies undesirable

282
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,251
and don't want to come here

283
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,171
scaring of their names tainted.

284
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:20,210
However,

285
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,970
my mother came from here

286
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,371
and I feel rather familiar

287
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,610
with this place.

288
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:27,850
Young Lady, don't be sad.

289
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:30,531
If it weren't for Third Madam,

290
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:32,690
we wouldn't have had a place to hide.

291
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,051
She's still protecting us

292
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:35,730
even though she has left.

293
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,371
I'm sure Butler Zhou and the rest

294
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:41,531
wouldn't know

295
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,171
we'd settle in here.

296
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:46,891
It's a good hiding place.

297
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,531
But we won't have much money left

298
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,450
after paying for the rental
for half a year.

299
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,930
We'll make it through somehow.

300
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,810
I'll figure something out.

301
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:57,970
Don't worry.

302
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,935
(Madam Lu, the landlady)

303
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,410
You're looking for a house, right?

304
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,291
Yes.

305
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:11,051
This street is called Flower Alley.

306
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,090
Over here, some sell flowers.

307
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,731
And over there,

308
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,610
they sell flowers too.

309
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,370
But it's different flowers.

310
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,635
(Xiaoqin Pleasure House)

311
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:25,931
Why don't we go inside first?

312
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:26,850
Sure.

313
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,931
Come on in.

314
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,170
This is a good place.

315
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,090
But you ought to be careful
when you go out.

316
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,931
Thank you for telling us.

317
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,850
To be honest, I came here

318
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,610
to sit for the metropolitan examination.

319
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,531
I won't cause you any trouble.

320
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,771
I didn't expect you

321
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:43,850
to be a provincial graduate,
young girl.

322
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,491
My mother passed away when I was little.

323
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,771
So, my father has tutored me
for a few years.

324
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,491
Still, you're a well-educated lady.

325
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,291
Not to mention the reopening
of women's examination candidacy lately,

326
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,330
even during the reign
of Empress Yuanguang,

327
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,971
when women's examination candidacy
was at its peak,

328
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:57,971
female provincial graduates
were rarely seen.

329
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,291
After all, female education
is a challenging endeavor.

330
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:04,570
If you encounter any problems,

331
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,570
seek my help.

332
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,650
My surname is Lu.
I live at the entrance of this alley.

333
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,090
Thank you so much.

334
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,330
I really appreciate that, Madam Lu.

335
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:10,850
You're welcome.

336
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:11,370
Come on.

337
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,251
Let's go in.

338
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:13,251
Sure.

339
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:13,691
Let's go.

340
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,011
Come in and have a look.

341
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,531
Please look around.

342
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,890
This is a good place to stay.

343
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,491
It's just that the house is decrepit

344
00:18:21,971 --> 00:18:22,771
and has been standing empty
for quite some time.

345
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:23,491
It's all right.

346
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,531
One moment. I'll light the candle.

347
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:26,330
Thank you.

348
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,650
Let's take a look around here.

349
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:31,971
Girls,

350
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:33,451
come over here.

351
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:34,130
This way.

352
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:39,410
Madam Lu.

353
00:18:39,971 --> 00:18:42,330
Why are there so many scrolls?

354
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:43,410
To be honest,

355
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,370
the former tenant was an idle poet

356
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,890
who visited Xiaoqin Pleasure House
every day.

357
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,890
All fancy ladies like his poems.

358
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,011
And these are scrolls left by him.

359
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,130
Where is the poet now?

360
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:56,890
He's dead.

361
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,330
He's dead?

362
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:00,610
Died in failure and depression.

363
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:02,451
This is why this house

364
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:03,931
is rented at a low price.

365
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:08,370
Young Lady.

366
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,451
Girls, if you dislike this house...

367
00:19:12,011 --> 00:19:13,090
No, not at all.

368
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,771
Madam Lu, we're fine with this.

369
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:15,691
Good to know that.

370
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,170
Tomorrow, I'll send someone
to clean everything up.

371
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:18,170
I'll get rid of

372
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,810
these scrolls too.

373
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:21,170
No.

374
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,051
Please leave them here, Madam Lu.

375
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:26,650
I want to read them.

376
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,570
Well, you can have them.

377
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:31,011
You're quite amusing, girl.

378
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:32,850
What an open-minded.

379
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,691
No wonder you have the guts to come
for the exam with just a maid beside you.

380
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:36,491
By the way,

381
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:38,170
I found that your hands were cold

382
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,370
when I touched them just now.

383
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,130
Also, the white of your eyes

384
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,130
is tinged yellow.

385
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,451
Do you always feel numb

386
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,610
in your limbs?

387
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,850
And do you find
that you're afraid of cold

388
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:52,410
and you can't sleep well at night?

389
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,370
Exactly. How did you know about that?

390
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:55,931
Are you a physician too?

391
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:57,691
One of my family members
works as a physician

392
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,251
and I've learned something
since I was little.

393
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:00,531
That's why I have some knowledge.

394
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,971
You have qi and blood deficiency.

395
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:05,291
This is a common sickness for women.

396
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:07,610
Juli, give me the sachet.

397
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,610
I want the sachet.

398
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,011
Here.

399
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:12,610
Madam Lu.

400
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,090
I made this scented sachet
with some herbs.

401
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:16,451
You can keep this.

402
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:17,691
Maybe it'll be helpful for you.

403
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:19,090
This is a precious gift.

404
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,491
I can't accept this.

405
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,491
It's fine.

406
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,130
We still stick with the rental
we negotiated before, right?

407
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,370
I'm fine with the rental.

408
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,531
Please keep this sachet. Don't worry.

409
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,211
Well, I'll take it, then.

410
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:34,170
You may settle down here.

411
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:35,410
I won't disturb you any longer.

412
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:35,931
Sure.

413
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:46,051
Young Lady.

414
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,011
Third Madam told you

415
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,731
to keep your skill from others.

416
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,451
There is still some time

417
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,850
before the metropolitan examination,

418
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:57,610
and the cost of the writing supplies

419
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,771
would be high.

420
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,971
Not only that, food expenses
in the capital

421
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,850
is heftier than other places,

422
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:05,890
so we must make money

423
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,731
to feed ourselves.

424
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,090
Rest assured, Young Lady.

425
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,170
You have me,

426
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,691
you won't get hungry.

427
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,810
Silly girl.

428
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:14,650
I don't want you to get hungry.

429
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,771
All right, go and clean up

430
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,610
this place.

431
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,291
I'm going to take a good look

432
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,771
at the poems.

433
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:23,850
Go ahead.

434
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:25,291
All right.

435
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:36,885
(Memorial Tablet of Late Mother,
Gu Yixiao)

436
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:47,931
Young Lady.

437
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:49,771
I have great strength.

438
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,330
I should've carved this for you.

439
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,850
This is for my dearest mother.

440
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,850
I must do this myself.

441
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,460
(Memorial Tablet of Late Mother,
Gu Yixiao)

442
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:08,931
Mother.

443
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,771
My effort all these years
turns out worthwhile.

444
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,051
Your daughter

445
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:15,971
has become a provincial graduate.

446
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,850
Soon, I'll ascend
as a metropolitan graduate too.

447
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,330
Don't worry.

448
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:25,531
I'll surely make something of myself

449
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,011
and earn an imperial mandate.

450
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,570
Once I settle down in the capital,

451
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,771
I'll search for your home

452
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,011
and you can

453
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,291
rest in peace in your home.

454
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:41,291
Third Madam.

455
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,011
Please bless Young Lady for her success

456
00:22:43,491 --> 00:22:45,771
and bless us with food too.

457
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:55,706
(Song Yun, a musician courtesan
in Xiaoqin Pleasure House)

458
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,890
Can I help you?

459
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,650
Madam Lu told me

460
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:03,410
there's a physician here.

461
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:07,650
Yes, I'm.

462
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:09,491
I...

463
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:14,931
Please come in.

464
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:25,451
Please lie down.
I'm going to check on you.

465
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:26,771
You...

466
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:30,051
Aren't you curious about me?

467
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:33,610
I guess

468
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,251
you live across the street.

469
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,170
Aren't you afraid

470
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,410
that I'll sully your place?

471
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,291
To me,

472
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:49,850
all patients are the same.

473
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:52,211
Please lie down.

474
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,410
Juli.

475
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:54,170
Give it to me.

476
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:56,731
Please lie down.

477
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:00,890
(Lord Ding's Residence)

478
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,850
His Lordship has caught a cold
while traveling on the water

479
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:03,771
amidst the cold weather.

480
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,771
He's been coughing.

481
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,850
When will Imperial Physician Zhao
come over?

482
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,410
No idea.

483
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,211
Zhimo is at it again, My Lord.

484
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,610
He barely responds

485
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,170
and only shows his book to others.

486
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:15,971
Had I known it'd turn out like this,

487
00:24:16,051 --> 00:24:17,251
I would've come to the capital first.

488
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,570
Since Zhimo didn't bring this up,

489
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,771
it's not something serious.

490
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,090
Just let him be.

491
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,251
You're biased toward him.

492
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,330
Your Highness.

493
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,211
Greetings, Your Highness.

494
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,011
Uncle.

495
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,291
Why didn't you give a response?

496
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:42,251
Oh?

497
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:45,931
Should I go to His Majesty tomorrow

498
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,451
and tell him the First Prince
picks on a sick man?

499
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:50,850
(Liu Chen, First Prince of Southern Chen)
It's not that, Uncle.

500
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,650
(Liu Chen,
First Prince of Southern Chen)

501
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,491
(Liu Chen, First Prince of Southern Chen)
I came here to pay you a visit.

502
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,771
You're badly hurt

503
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:08,051
by the abortion medicine

504
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:09,531
and lack enough rest for recovery.

505
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,370
The bleeding has continued
for more than a month, right?

506
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,650
Haven't you seen a physician even once?

507
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,850
Careful.

508
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,291
No physician out there

509
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,291
will treat me.

510
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,890
I'm merely

511
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:30,491
an old and unattractive prostitute

512
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:34,570
who got pregnant.

513
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:37,011
Is there no one here
to take care of you?

514
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:41,410
Madams are busy
with the Selection of the Courtesan

515
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:44,410
instead of looking after old ones like us.

516
00:25:50,011 --> 00:25:52,051
When I saw Zhimo alone here,

517
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:55,410
I knew you'd gone somewhere else.

518
00:25:58,768 --> 00:26:01,048
Does His Majesty blame me

519
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,330
for not offering my greetings
to him in the palace?

520
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,330
Father said you must be tired
from the long journey.

521
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:08,691
You may come to the palace

522
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:09,650
once you have enough rest.

523
00:26:12,731 --> 00:26:13,610
I brought gifts

524
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,610
for you, Second Prince, and Third Prince

525
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,691
when I come back.

526
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:18,850
That won't do.

527
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,130
I want two gifts, then.

528
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,971
You can pick anything you like

529
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,451
from my storehouse.

530
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,251
Thank you, Uncle.

531
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:32,451
By the way,

532
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:36,211
are you feeling better?

533
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,650
Still the same.

534
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,691
Imperial Physician Zhao's been searching
for medicine for you.

535
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:45,211
I believe you can be healed

536
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:46,531
very soon.

537
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,051
You should've

538
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,211
come back earlier today.

539
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:53,491
Did you go somewhere else

540
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:54,691
to search for new clues again?

541
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,410
Five years ago,

542
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,090
Father eradicated all those involved.

543
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:00,570
Uncle, do you still suspect

544
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,931
someone else was behind it?

545
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,771
My Lord.

546
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:06,451
He Xin sent you something.

547
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,090
Look.

548
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:10,570
Clues started coming in
once we found something.

549
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:12,451
Come on in.

550
00:27:14,771 --> 00:27:15,491
My Lord.

551
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,610
The tomb of Yuan Chengming
we found earlier

552
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:20,931
was newly built.

553
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:22,771
But his remain wasn't found

554
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:23,931
anywhere in the peach blossom forest.

555
00:27:24,451 --> 00:27:26,731
But He Xin sent us an update.

556
00:27:33,935 --> 00:27:35,011
(Tiantong Mountain, Zhuozhou)

557
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:35,691
They found

558
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:37,011
Yuan Chengming's trace
at Tiantong Mountain in Zhuozhou

559
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,850
after the war of Juma River.

560
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,251
And they also traced down Yun Xiangyue.

561
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,931
She's Yuan Xiyue,
the daughter of Yuan Chengming.

562
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:45,731
After falling from grace
and entering a brothel,

563
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,850
she changed her name to Yun Xiangyue.

564
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:48,731
As of now, she's the prominent courtesan
in Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

565
00:28:00,731 --> 00:28:01,491
Here's your prescription.

566
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,731
Thank you.

567
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,410
You need to buy the herbs yourself.

568
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:08,130
I, Song Yun, will repay

569
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:11,090
the favor you extended to me today.

570
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,251
Juli.

571
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:25,810
Young Lady, we made some money.

572
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:29,650
But is this silver genuine?

573
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:34,731
She reminds me of my parents.

574
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:38,130
I used to hate my father
all these years.

575
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:39,650
But after meeting

576
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:41,691
Miss Song Yun,

577
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:44,251
out of no reason,

578
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,531
I started to ponder

579
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,971
what dire situation

580
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:50,610
my mother might face

581
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,291
and how she would live on

582
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,051
if she hadn't married my father.

583
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,211
She would've starved.

584
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,211
She would've been left in a dark corner

585
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:06,170
as she grew old.

586
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,610
My mother came from a noble origin

587
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,931
and was forced to serve at the brothel.

588
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:12,491
However,

589
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,370
no flowers would want

590
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:17,051
to be mired down.

591
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,011
I believe many flowers

592
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:22,491
wish to grow into trees.

593
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,410
Sadly, time keeps flowing,

594
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:32,251
out with the old, in with the new.

595
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:36,570
Juli.

596
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,650
We mustn't be just flowers.

597
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:40,090
We should be like trees,

598
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:43,211
tall and sturdy,

599
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,051
standing still against cold

600
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,531
and blustery.

601
00:29:47,971 --> 00:29:49,931
Young Lady, trees are ugly.

602
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:50,650
That won't do.

603
00:29:51,051 --> 00:29:52,370
You have a dainty look.

604
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:53,610
It's a waste if you can't be a flower.

605
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:54,931
That's not what I want.

606
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,610
Per state laws,

607
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:58,451
married women

608
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,011
aren't allowed
to become officials in the court.

609
00:30:00,451 --> 00:30:02,610
So, I'm not going

610
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,810
to marry anyone.

611
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:06,850
You're not marrying anyone?

612
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,370
That's not appropriate, though.

613
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,531
The poet read this too?

614
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:15,610
(Physiognomy Arts)

615
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,251
Young Lady, I've seen this before.

616
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,570
Fortune tellers on the street

617
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,850
display this drawing at their stores.

618
00:30:22,251 --> 00:30:23,890
We feed ourselves
by offering medical treatments.

619
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:26,850
Probably the poet lived on
this physiognomy art.

620
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:30,051
(Brings harm to husbands)
Look at this.

621
00:30:33,051 --> 00:30:34,051
Brings harm to husbands?

622
00:30:35,385 --> 00:30:37,051
(An Anthology of Ancient Poems)

623
00:30:37,051 --> 00:30:37,810
My Lord.

624
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:40,011
The Selection of the Courtesan
is strict with the participants.

625
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:41,291
Not only do they require invitations,

626
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,251
but participants also have to pay
for gold flowers.

627
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:46,251
I suggest that we climb
over the walls and go in.

628
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:49,291
Given your identity, walking in
through the main entrance is not decent.

629
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,451
Climb over the walls?

630
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,051
Do you think it's a decent way?

631
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,531
My Lord.

632
00:30:58,051 --> 00:30:59,090
I didn't mean that.

633
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:04,485
(Airhead)

634
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:13,130
When will the bright moon appear?

635
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:17,090
I hold my glass aside and ask.

636
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,211
Young Lady.

637
00:31:19,531 --> 00:31:21,170
Though you can't write good poems,

638
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:22,971
you're good at reciting poems.

639
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:24,810
Well, just eat the flatbread.

640
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,130
Look, so many beautiful lanterns
over there.

641
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:29,291
Let's go there and take a look.

642
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:30,931
How beautiful.

643
00:31:31,531 --> 00:31:32,650
I'll buy you one

644
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,890
when I have money.

645
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:35,211
Physician Mu.

646
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:38,850
Physician Mu.

647
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,771
I'm on my way to your place.

648
00:31:42,211 --> 00:31:43,330
Could you please

649
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:45,011
come to the Xiaoqin Pleasure House
with me?

650
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,251
Xiaoqin Pleasure House?

651
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:50,090
I'm sorry

652
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,211
to make this unpleasant request.

653
00:31:52,731 --> 00:31:54,771
But please help me.

654
00:31:57,931 --> 00:31:59,090
Okay.

655
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,491
You can't go, Young Lady.

656
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:06,650
I'm worried about you.

657
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,971
I must go there with you.

658
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,570
Don't worry. I'll be very careful.

659
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:10,931
Wait for me at home.

660
00:32:11,211 --> 00:32:12,410
Young Lady, I must go...

661
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,890
Don't move. Stay put.

662
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,610
Young Lady.

663
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,531
Isn't this an ominous mole
that brings harm to your husband?

664
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:26,211
Xiaoqin Pleasure House
is a complicated place.

665
00:32:26,451 --> 00:32:28,011
It may help to shield off rotten luck.

666
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,850
Stand still and wait for me here.

667
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:34,330
You must take care of yourself.

668
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:40,810
(Xiaoqin Pleasure House)

669
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,971
Mister, please come in.

of Xiaoqin Pleasure House)

(Suyi, Yun Xiangyue's maidservant)

Young Lady.

674
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,810
Why don't we wait until next year?

675
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,731
If I miss out on this,

676
00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:40,491
how can I marry into
an affluent and influential family

677
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:42,090
to find myself a rock

678
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,051
to rely on safely?

679
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,090
Suyi.

680
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:50,691
I'm running out of time.

681
00:33:57,691 --> 00:33:58,330
Please.

682
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,051
Sure.

683
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:00,051
Miss Yun.

684
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:02,251
This is Physician Mu.

This is Miss Yun.

Thank you for coming.

00:34:07,531 --> 00:34:08,851
I feel indebted to you.

688
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:10,250
You flatter me.

689
00:34:12,971 --> 00:34:15,090
Take care. Please come again.

Can I have a look
at your invitation card?

Please.

00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,170
Miss.

697
00:34:40,051 --> 00:34:42,730
Acupuncture therapy
can't heal your sickness.

698
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:44,331
Your sickness will relapse

699
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,451
if you get cold

700
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:47,610
on the stage later.

I don't mean to pry,

702
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,451
but the courtesan selection
is held annually.

703
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:55,051
But you're weak...

704
00:34:55,811 --> 00:34:57,250
Yes, the selection is held annually,

705
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:00,250
but this is my sole opportunity

706
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,411
to get chosen.

707
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,811
Bravo!

708
00:35:22,301 --> 00:35:23,051
Bravo!

709
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:54,891
Her dancing is stunning, isn't it?

710
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,170
Yes, it's stunning.

711
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,650
Bravo!

00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,610
Good!

00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,331
Good!

Graceful.

718
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:37,971
Feng Shuangshuang should be
the top courtesan of the year.

Yun Xiangyue hasn't performed yet.

720
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,090
She's the newest prominent courtesan
this year.

721
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:43,051
Really?

Excellent!

(Young Mu Zhuohua)
Qi, stop dancing.

734
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,491
You should study now.

735
00:38:00,051 --> 00:38:02,331
Mother, is dancing not good?

736
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:03,770
You dance too.

737
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,411
Why must I study?

738
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,130
(Gu Yixiao, Mu Zhuohua's mother)
Nothing's wrong with dancing.

739
00:38:07,811 --> 00:38:09,650
(Gu Yixiao, Mu Zhuohua's mother)
However, through studies,

740
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:12,130
you'll be sensible
and capable of telling right from wrong.

741
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:13,210
By that time,

742
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,891
you can distinguish whether dancing
is good or not.

743
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:16,931
Not just listen to me.

744
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:18,331
Understood?

745
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:24,811
Miss Song.

746
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,730
Does Miss Yun

747
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,371
truly love dancing?

748
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:30,770
To be frank,

749
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,690
when one steps into
this house of ill repute,

750
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:36,531
they'll start loathing dancing,

751
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,451
even if they used to enjoy it.

752
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,891
But Yun is different.

753
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,090
After she came here,

754
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:45,811
she was reticent.

755
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:47,931
In less than three months,

756
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:50,250
she has already mastered
all songs and dances

757
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:52,650
and become a prominent courtesan
before long.

758
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:56,051
Why must she work so hard?

759
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:57,610
I wonder too.

760
00:39:20,051 --> 00:39:22,531
Bravo!

761
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:33,491
Yun Xiangyue!

762
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:39,969
The top courtesan last year

763
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,971
was worth more than 1,600 gold flowers.

764
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,170
We shall wait and see.

765
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:45,531
Perhaps Yun Xiangyue is more valuable.

766
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:46,411
Gentlemen.

767
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,210
Offer your gold flowers to the beauty

768
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:50,290
for an amorous and long night.

769
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:53,770
I wonder who will bring home
this delicate beauty.

770
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,811
I'll go for 2,000 gold flowers.

771
00:39:57,411 --> 00:39:58,451
Wow, 2,000.

772
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,811
2,500 gold flowers.

773
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:10,451
3,000 gold flowers.

774
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,610
3,000?

775
00:40:15,051 --> 00:40:16,051
3,500.

776
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,931
Are they splurging a fortune

777
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,851
just for Yun Xiangyue?

778
00:40:28,411 --> 00:40:29,250
As expected of men.

779
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,451
I'll go for 4,000. She's mine.

780
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,811
No way, 4,000?

781
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:41,130
4,500 gold flowers.

782
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,170
Congratulations, mister.

783
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:49,331
You won her with 4,500 gold flowers.

784
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:53,570
Congratulations to Yun Xiangyue on
becoming the new top courtesan of the year.

785
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,971
What a silly moneybag.

786
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,811
He spent so much money.

787
00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:05,051
(Tsk-tsk, men.)

788
00:41:05,491 --> 00:41:07,170
(It's useless even though he looks good
from the back.)

789
00:41:08,331 --> 00:41:09,451
(I'm better off going back to study.)

790
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:11,770
I'm leaving.

791
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,011
Physician Mu.

792
00:41:15,411 --> 00:41:16,170
I...

793
00:41:16,971 --> 00:41:18,411
Is there anything I can help you with?

794
00:41:20,451 --> 00:41:22,570
Can I ask you for a favor?

795
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:24,051
Well... many of my friends
in the backyard

796
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:26,290
have been feeling very sick.

797
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,570
Physician Mu.

798
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,051
If you have time now,

799
00:41:29,451 --> 00:41:30,170
could you please...

800
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,491
Yes, sure.

801
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,331
Please show me the way.

802
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,371
Thank you so much.

803
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,690
Please accept a bow from me.

804
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:37,051
No, please.

805
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:37,931
Let's go, Miss Song.

806
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:38,531
Come on.

807
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:26,451
I... I'm a physician.

808
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:27,170
Please don't kill me.
