00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 15=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:52,566
My Lord, is the iron hook

21
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:54,485
attached to the mute slave's left arm

22
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:56,405
similar to the hawk claw hook?

23
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,526
I have sent Zhijian to look into it.

24
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:02,605
Seeing that he has yet to return,

25
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:04,965
I'm assuming
that the mute slave got away.

26
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:06,045
What?

27
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,925
Yemu Jing brought him here,

28
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:10,925
and now he has disappeared.

29
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:12,765
Why isn't Yemu Jing
doing anything about it?

30
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:16,446
Could it be

31
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:20,126
that Yemu Jing let him go on purpose?

32
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:22,126
Yemu Jing

33
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:23,726
is indeed a snide one.

34
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:25,846
I know that he came here

35
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,246
with a hidden agenda.

36
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:29,686
I'll be on tenterhook

37
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:31,605
if he does nothing and sits by.

38
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:35,566
My Lord, will you attend the feast?

39
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:38,446
Yes, I'm going.

40
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,805
But you shouldn't drink heavily

41
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,205
given your injury.

42
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:47,446
My Lord.

43
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:50,805
I said I'd bring the supplies to you.

44
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:53,686
I made this hangover cure.

45
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:55,765
You should eat this beforehand.

46
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:38,045
Lord Ding.

47
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:42,846
We must have a blast
with fine brew tonight.

48
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,126
I will drink with you, Prince Yemu.

49
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:48,645
Take your time, Your Highness.

50
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:52,485
I'm very much looking forward
to drinking with you all tonight.

51
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,045
Prince Yemu,
you're our guest from afar.

52
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:04,446
Here are my three shots.

53
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,166
I must do you the honor.

54
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:26,965
(Has he fully recovered?)

55
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:29,566
(Yuanluo Flower's poison
can't be detoxified, anyhow.)

56
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:31,886
(He must be pretending.)

57
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:40,765
My Lord, you can hold your liquor.

58
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:42,725
Zhen.

59
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:47,046
Quick, raise a toast to Lord Ding.

60
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:49,205
Your Lordship.

61
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:50,806
I've always admired you.

62
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:52,765
So, I bought the great brew
from Northern Liang.

63
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:54,525
Please have a taste.

64
00:04:55,806 --> 00:04:56,525
Your Highness.

65
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,325
My duty is to entertain you.

66
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:01,246
Since you're in a merry mood,

67
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:03,285
allow me to raise my glass to you.

68
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:05,405
A mere commoner.

69
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:07,525
You don't deserve
to raise a toast to me.

70
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:09,965
Your Highness, this is your first time
coming here.

71
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:11,886
I guess you have some misunderstanding

72
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,046
about the language of Southern Chen.

73
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:16,366
People come first,

74
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:17,725
and next the society,

75
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:18,926
the ruler is beneath all.

76
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,126
You aren't even a ruler.

77
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:22,645
Why wouldn't I deserve
to raise a toast to you

78
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:23,845
as the nation's people?

79
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:24,765
Enough said.

80
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:27,845
Well,

81
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:32,085
I'd like to savor

82
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:33,725

83
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:55,686
Lord Ding.

84
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:58,886
Bottoms up.

85
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:07,126

92

to give her a ride home.

187
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:43,765
And yet she bolted home last night.

188
00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:08,623
(Mu's Residence)

189
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:20,486
My Lord.

190
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:27,445
What are you doing here?

191
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,966
Nothing. It's nothing.

192
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:54,606
Did you not sleep well last night?

193
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:59,886
The dark circles under your eyes
are apparent.

194
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:03,246
Are they really apparent?

195
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:14,765
The task

196
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:16,525
must have worn you out.

197
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:19,086
Anyway, you did a great job.

198
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:29,285
My Lord.

199
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:32,606
Are my dark circles
the only thing you want to tell me

200
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:35,925
after staring at my face
for quite a while?

201
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:38,565
Why?

202
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,326
Am I not allowed to stare at you?

203
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:44,486
No, I didn't mean that.

204
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:47,366
Never mind.

205
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:57,685
Last night...

206
00:14:59,126 --> 00:14:59,846
Last night?

207
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:04,165
What's wrong with last night?

208
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:08,886
Last night...

209
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:12,606
were you

210
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:13,886
fine?

211
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:17,805
I was drunk.

212
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:20,765
I don't remember what happened.

213
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:31,366
You forgot it.

214
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:33,925
It's good, though.

215
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:37,645
Forgot? What did you say?

216
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:41,326
I couldn't sleep well last night.

217
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:44,006
My head is foggy today,
and I've forgotten things.

218
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:51,726
You can take one day off.

219
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:54,726
Thank you, My Lord.

220
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:56,966
It's getting late.

221
00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:58,045
You should attend the morning assembly.

222
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:00,846
I need to report to my duty as well.

223
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:02,326
I shall take my leave.

224
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:38,006
I'll beat you to death, beggar.

225
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:45,246
You...

226
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:46,846
Let's go.

227
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:14,645
You're injured.

228
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:19,366
Don't be afraid.

229
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:22,165
I'll take you to Jishan Hall

230
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:23,806
for treatment.

231
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:29,993
(Jishan Hall)

232
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:55,165
That's the drawing
of Her Highness' fiance.

233
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:58,366
Her Highness is upset
whenever she sees it,

234
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:00,725
but she never takes it down.

235
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:13,445
Don't just stand there.

236
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:14,685
Come and sit.

237
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:16,766
(Xue Xiaotang, General of Agile Cavalry
of Southern Chen)

238
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:17,846
Are you done drawing, Your Highness?

239
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:19,846
Your look

240
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:22,205
has long been on my mind.

241
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:47,245
What's wrong with you?

242
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:53,566
Do you have any difficulties?

243
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:56,046
Maybe I can help you.

244
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,485
Are you all right?

245
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:15,566
What's wrong?

246
00:19:21,485 --> 00:19:22,165
Your Highness.

247
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:23,566
Your Highness?

248
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:25,005
Are you all right?

249
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:28,405
Yes.

250
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:30,925
(He looks very similar to General Xue.)

251
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:32,965
I'm all right.

252
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:10,438
(Mu's Residence)

253
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:17,005
Is she

254
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:19,685
avoiding me?

255
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,358
(Country thrives through governing.)
[*"Thrive" is "Yan" in Mandarin.]

256
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,366
We have mantou here.

257
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:24,005
Mr. Zhang.

258
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:25,326
I want six mantou.

259
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:27,645
Here's the money.

260
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:28,205
Here you go.

261
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:31,366
Have a nice day.

262
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:32,205
Thank you.

263
00:21:32,205 --> 00:21:33,005
(Mu's Residence)

264
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:33,685
Juli.

265
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:35,405
Zhimo.

266
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:38,086
This is for you.

267
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:38,846
For me?

268
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:41,005
What good food do we have this time?

269
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:42,126
Ham hock.

270
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:44,485
How do you know I like ham hock?

271
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:46,126
Is there anything you don't like?

272
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:48,645
Nope.

273
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:52,405
Food gives me the energy to work,

274
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:53,566
and yummy food makes me happy.

275
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:00,405
Eat up. I'll get going.

276
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:00,965
Okay.

277
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:02,685
Hold on.

278
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:05,806
Zhimo. I have a question.

279
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:09,685
Can you read this character?

280
00:22:12,126 --> 00:22:13,126
His Lordship's name.

281
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,645
Why did Young Lady write his name?

282
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,709
(Ciming Hall)

283
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:24,205
Northern Liang diplomatic corps
has arrived in the capital.

284
00:22:24,405 --> 00:22:25,685
Given Lord Ding's character,

285
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:27,205
he will surely act

286
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:29,965
to seek the thread from Yemu Jing

287
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:31,725
for what happened back then.

288
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:33,205
If so,

289
00:22:33,925 --> 00:22:35,685
we must distract Lord Ding.

290
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:37,806
He shouldn't have had much spare time.

291
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:40,766
You'll handle this.

292
00:22:41,165 --> 00:22:42,846
Yes, I know what to do.

293
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:50,645
Sir.

294
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,526
(Xiaoqin Pleasure House)
You're here, sir.

295
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:55,126
Mister.

296
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:56,526
I'll give you a toast too.

297
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:05,286
Who are you?

298
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:08,165
Mister.

299
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:09,886
She will perform a dance for you.

300
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:31,886
Who are you?

301
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:37,965
It's you.

302
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:47,245
(Wende Hall)

303
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:47,965
Your Majesty.

304
00:23:48,776 --> 00:23:50,415
For the enduring peace

305
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:52,245
between Northern Liang
and Southern Chen,

306
00:23:52,526 --> 00:23:55,405
we expect a marriage alliance
with Princess Roujia.

307
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,445
Pardon?

308
00:23:56,526 --> 00:23:58,245
He's asking for Princess Roujia
to marry into Northern Liang?

309
00:23:58,846 --> 00:23:59,326
But...

310
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:01,645
Your Majesty.

311
00:24:02,725 --> 00:24:03,766
This is a request of great interest.

312
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:06,566
By forging a marriage alliance
between the two nations,

313
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,205
(Zhou Cishan)
we put an end to warfare.

314
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:10,925
(Minister of War of Southern Chen)
Nothing can be better than this.

315
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:15,965
I beg to differ, Official Zhou.

316
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,326
Princess Roujia is the eldest daughter
of His Majesty,

317
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:19,326
and she's of noble origin.

318
00:24:19,405 --> 00:24:20,685
How could Her Highness
marry into a foreign nation?

319
00:24:20,846 --> 00:24:22,725
(Sun Ru, Minister of Works)
This is ridiculous.

320
00:24:25,645 --> 00:24:27,925
What outcome
of the terms Northern Liang stated

321
00:24:28,326 --> 00:24:30,046
in the letter of credence will bring?

322
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:32,925
Have you ever thought about this,
Prince Yemu?

323
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:39,086
What outcome do you prefer,
Your Majesty?

324
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:43,251
Lord Ding is in charge
of the peace negotiation this time.

325
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:46,566
His reply represents mine.

326
00:24:48,806 --> 00:24:50,886
Given that response,

327
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:53,205
you disagree?

328
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:55,126
We're here for the peace negotiation.

329
00:24:55,405 --> 00:24:56,766
Negotiating is our purpose.

330
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:00,925
Why are you so anxious, Prince Yemu?

331
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:04,766
Prince Yemu.

332
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,485
You should've started
a peaceful negotiation with me.

333
00:25:09,445 --> 00:25:11,086
Your request is somewhat ridiculous.

334
00:25:11,725 --> 00:25:13,725
Trading the marriage alliance
with Princess Roujia

335
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:16,165
for future peace?

336
00:25:17,286 --> 00:25:20,326
We, Southern Chen, might as well

337
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,405
wage another war against Northern Liang.

338
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,580
(Wende Hall)

339
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:40,405
Look how anxious you are
about Princess Roujia.

340
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:42,886
I'll make her mine.

341
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:53,846
Uncle.

342
00:25:54,606 --> 00:25:56,606
He's outrageous.

343
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,005
If we didn't lose to them

344
00:25:59,165 --> 00:26:00,766
in such a humiliating defeat
in the war at Juma River,

345
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:04,645
we wouldn't have been
on an equal footing

346
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:06,405
with them now.

347
00:26:07,326 --> 00:26:08,326
There must be a reason

348
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:11,086
for what happened just now.

349
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:21,925
I know

350
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:24,205
this is unfair to you.

351
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:27,165
However, Northern Liang
is brutal, and war is ruthless.

352
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:28,846
If you don't marry into there,

353
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:31,846
millions of our people will suffer.

354
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,126
I understand what you meant,

355
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,566
Grandmother.

356
00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:37,645
You're the Princess.

357
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:39,766
You should consider the big picture.

358
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:43,685
Though your father didn't give
his response in the imperial court,

359
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:46,766
he shares the same thought as mine.

360
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:50,886
Don't worry, Grandmother.

361
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:55,366
If I alone am enough
to trade for a peaceful world,

362
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:57,205
I'm willing to go.

363
00:26:57,886 --> 00:26:59,005
I always know

364
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:01,205
you're a sensible child.

365
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:13,685
Your Highness.

366
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:15,806
I thought you were supposed
to rest today.

367
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:17,286
What brings you here?

368
00:27:17,286 --> 00:27:18,405
Which princess were you greeting?

369
00:27:22,645 --> 00:27:23,766
Greetings, Princess Jing'an.

370
00:27:28,165 --> 00:27:28,965
Your Highness.

371
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:30,725
I'm here for you.

372
00:27:31,725 --> 00:27:32,685
You came just in time.

373
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:35,205
We can accompany Princess Jing'an.

374
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:40,965
I'm all right.

375
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,005
Where's my brother?

376
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:46,965
Prince Yemu said

377
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,566
Southern Chen is hesitant

378
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:49,485
about a mere marriage alliance.

379
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:50,685
He's going to reason with them.

380
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:52,046
He's right.

381
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:54,965
My brother has tactical
and martial prowess.

382
00:27:55,086 --> 00:27:56,886
He's the real man
representing Northern Liang.

383
00:27:58,005 --> 00:27:59,126
He lacks nothing.

384
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,405
Shouldn't a real man

385
00:28:02,485 --> 00:28:04,245
possess bravery, intelligence,

386
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:06,165
and respect others' wishes,

387
00:28:06,606 --> 00:28:07,846
instead of coercing them?

388
00:28:08,126 --> 00:28:08,925
Say that again.

389
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:12,326
I didn't refer it to anyone.

390
00:28:12,806 --> 00:28:15,005
I said it because most men
in Southern Chen

391
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:16,086
are like this.

392
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:18,925
Princess Jing'an,

393
00:28:19,245 --> 00:28:20,326
why do you look

394
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:21,725
upset?

395
00:28:31,046 --> 00:28:32,445
My bracelet is on the ground.

396
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,526
Maybe you should pick it up for me,

397
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:36,925
Envoy.

398
00:28:47,846 --> 00:28:50,286
The land of Southern Chen
is dirty, though.

399
00:28:51,485 --> 00:28:53,685
My boots are tainted with dirt.

400
00:28:54,205 --> 00:28:55,846
Please clean my boots,

401
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:58,165
Envoy.

402
00:29:05,086 --> 00:29:06,005
Princess Yemu.

403
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:09,445
Though she's not a high-ranked official,

404
00:29:10,286 --> 00:29:11,685
you shouldn't humiliate her like this.

405
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:27,405
It's dirty.

406
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:32,286
I don't want it anymore.

407
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,286
Princess Yemu.

408
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:42,165
Do you think

409
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:45,846
you and the bracelet
have something in common?

410
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:48,366
What?

411
00:29:50,366 --> 00:29:52,165
Both of you seem glamorous
on the outside,

412
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:54,405
but you're forced to do something
against your will.

413
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:56,245
You will be given out as a gift

414
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:58,566
when you hold values.

415
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:00,685
When you're no longer deemed necessary,

416
00:30:01,245 --> 00:30:02,846
you'll be abandoned.

417
00:30:03,645 --> 00:30:04,965
I can't help but wonder about this.

418
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:06,566
Do you think

419
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,165
it has a heart?

420
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:10,286
If it does,

421
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:12,126
does it suffer inside?

422
00:30:13,126 --> 00:30:14,126
Is it really willing

423
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:16,046
to please someone it doesn't like

424
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:18,086
or doesn't understand?

425
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:21,165
(How sharp-tongued.)

426
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:26,405
(Yemu Jing hasn't gained any advantage)

427
00:30:26,606 --> 00:30:28,086
(ever since the diplomatic corps
came here.)

428
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:29,685
(Why would he lose his patience)

429
00:30:30,566 --> 00:30:32,445
(and start picking on the officials?)

430
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:33,925
(Besides, his men
are busy with the boxes.)

431
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:35,806
Your Highness.

432
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:37,326
Something came up.

433
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:39,718
I can't keep you company today.

434
00:30:41,238 --> 00:30:43,158
I'm very glad that you came.

435
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:44,445
Go ahead.

436
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:46,165
I want to make you happier.

437
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:48,846
I shall take my leave.

438
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:04,645
I'm in for the challenge.

439
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:06,766
If I win,

440
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:09,086
you will not marry my sister.

441
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:12,046
Sure.

442
00:31:13,126 --> 00:31:14,886
I've been itching
to have a match with you,

443
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:16,685
Your Highness.

444
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:23,046
Your Highness.

445
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:25,485
You haven't recovered yet.

446
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:26,766
Please don't be reckless.

447
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:30,685
I'd rather lose my life

448
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:33,566
than let my sister
marry into a foreign nation.

449
00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:39,126
Your leg is injured, Your Highness.

450
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:40,086
Let me do this.

451
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:41,886
But you...

452
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:43,126
This is trivial.

453
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:44,126
No need to waste your effort,
Your Highness.

454
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:45,366
I'll do this for you.

455
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:47,606
Very well.

456
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:49,766
Anyone will do. I don't care.

457
00:31:57,005 --> 00:31:57,645
Your Highness.

458
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:00,766
Prince Yemu wants
to challenge the peace negotiators

459
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:02,205
to an archery match,

460
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,685
as he claims that the men
of Southern Chen are weak

461
00:32:05,046 --> 00:32:07,326
and he's the only man who deserves you.

462
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,925
Hence, Official Shen
took up the challenge.

463
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:15,690
Excellent!

464
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:25,286
Well-played!

465
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,366
Well done!

466
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:31,606
Your Highness.

467
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:34,205
My brother is more excellent

468
00:32:34,405 --> 00:32:35,326
than the men here, right?

469
00:32:39,445 --> 00:32:41,405
Mr. Shen, it's your turn.

470
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,405
He seems to have some nerves.

471
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:56,126
But he better not assume

472
00:32:57,046 --> 00:32:58,566
he could win against my brother.

473
00:33:19,725 --> 00:33:21,205
How dare you study behind my back!

474
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:23,005
How dare you!

475
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:24,846
(Mrs. Shen, Shen Jinghong's mother)
You're born to be a hunter,

476
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:26,086
not a scholar.

477
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:26,606
(Mrs. Shen, Shen Jinghong's mother)

478
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:28,005
Practice your archery skill!

479
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:18,726
Is he trying so hard

480
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:20,206
because of you?

481
00:35:01,445 --> 00:35:03,246
Prince Yemu,
thank you for your concession.

482
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:09,646
Both of us hit the mark
on all three shots.

483
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,166
You didn't win the game

484
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:15,166
with such petty skills.

485
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:18,206
Just now, you said

486
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:20,445
that Prince Yemu gave you a concession.

487
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,726
So, it's a tie.

488
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:23,686
Right?

489
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:24,806
Yes!

490
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:27,085
You're not playing fair!

491
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:29,286
Petty tricks.

492
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:36,405
Let's head back.

493
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:01,806
Be careful of sharp weapons.

494
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:03,085
Are you all right, Princess Jing'an?

495
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:04,326
I...

496
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:06,125
I'm all right.

497
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:18,326
Your Highness.

498
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:23,525
I'm the Princess of Southern Chen.

499
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:25,646
If my marriage

500
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:27,766
could trade for peace at the border,

501
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:30,445
even if it's only a few years

502
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:32,965
for the borderland soldiers

503
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,605
to gather their strength,

504
00:36:36,045 --> 00:36:37,005
it's worth it.

505
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:40,085
Official Shen.

506
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:42,246
No need to worry about it.

507
00:36:44,925 --> 00:36:46,286
I beg to differ, Your Highness.

508
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,525
What did I get wrong?

509
00:36:49,246 --> 00:36:50,565
I disagree

510
00:36:51,206 --> 00:36:53,206
a person's sacrifice
can save the entire nation.

511
00:36:54,605 --> 00:36:55,485
Besides,

512
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,161
the peace is at the cost of a woman.

513
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:01,352
This is a humiliation for the men.

514
00:37:03,517 --> 00:37:04,958
This is the destiny of a princess.

515
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:08,925
I've enjoyed offerings from the nation.

516
00:37:10,085 --> 00:37:11,846
So I must repay the people.

517
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:12,726
If we have to sacrifice a princess

518
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:14,525
to reclaim peace,

519
00:37:15,605 --> 00:37:17,085
what's the use of the imperial court?

520
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:20,286
Anyone can sacrifice themselves
for the nation.

521
00:37:20,565 --> 00:37:21,686
Why can't a princess do this?

522
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:24,886
Because...

523
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:27,965
it's the same

524
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:31,445
and also different.

525
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:34,085

Why are you on duty at this hour,
Official Mu?

545
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:47,206
I have something to deal with.

546
00:38:47,646 --> 00:38:48,326
I'll get going.

547
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,206
Must I really go to His Lordship?

548
00:39:05,005 --> 00:39:05,646
No.

549
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:07,366
For the sake of Her Highness,

550
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:09,286
I must talk to him.

551
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,206
Official Mu, why are you standing there?

552
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:14,485
Are you here for His Lordship?

553
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:16,125
Yes, I want to meet His Lordship.

554
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:17,726
I have something to report.

555
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:35,806
Greetings, My Lord.

556
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:39,125
I'm surprised to see you here.

557
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:46,445
What brings you here today?

00:39:47,005 --> 00:39:48,886
I thought you'd been avoiding me
all this time.

559
00:39:50,246 --> 00:39:51,445
(I'm helpless, after all.)

560
00:39:51,846 --> 00:39:53,085
(How can I be overwhelmed by this man?)

561
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:54,766
(This is ridiculous.)

562
00:40:02,886 --> 00:40:05,085
Why are you in a trance?

563
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:08,206
I...

564
00:40:08,646 --> 00:40:10,525
I didn't avoid you, My Lord.

565
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,366
If I do,

566
00:40:12,726 --> 00:40:14,605
I wouldn't be here now.

567
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,485
You always have excuses.

568
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:19,846
Shoot it.

569
00:40:20,326 --> 00:40:21,525
Why do you want to see me?

570
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:23,045
My Lord.

571
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:26,166
I heard about the marriage alliance
of Princess Roujia.

572
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:27,605
It's been keeping me awake at night.

573
00:40:30,445 --> 00:40:32,286
Will you sleep better by coming to me?

574
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,246
That will be worse.

575
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:41,525
My Lord.

576
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,445
I have something to report.

577
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:45,965
(I realized)

578
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:47,565
(that Northern Liang diplomatic corps
didn't come here well-prepared.)

579
00:40:47,806 --> 00:40:48,886
(Instead, they're eager to leave.)

580
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:55,286
I see.

581
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:59,326
It matches the intelligence

582
00:40:59,326 --> 00:41:00,405
we received some days ago.

583
00:41:02,806 --> 00:41:03,525
Let's go.

584
00:41:05,806 --> 00:41:06,686
Where are we going?

585
00:41:07,806 --> 00:41:09,565
Since we've figured
something's wrong with them,

586
00:41:10,246 --> 00:41:12,125
we're going to negotiate with Yemu Jing.
