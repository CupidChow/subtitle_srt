=The Legend of Zhuohua=

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 14=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,110
My Lord, the food
at your residence is delicious.

21
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,950
My Lord, why aren't you eating?

22
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,620
I have eaten at the Ministry of Rites.

23
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,670
The communal meal there

24
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,780
can't taste better
than the food at home.

25
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,060
My Lord, you know my background.

26
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,590
My last name is Mu,

27
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,780
but I am not considered
part of the Mu family.

28
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,940
In that family,

29
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,500
no one cares about me.

30
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,150
I don't care about them either.

31
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,820
Juli is the only family I have.

32
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,870
You're good at reading the room.

33
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,910
If you wished to please
your father and his wife,

34
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,190
I'm sure your life at home
wouldn't be so tough.

35
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,100
My Lord, you were born
into the imperial family.

36
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,430
Don't you get it?

37
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,150
Being liked by someone superior

38
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,100
may not necessarily be a good thing.

39
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,150
If I were liked by my father,

40
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,660
I would be ostracized

41
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,590
and envied by my stepmothers and sisters.

42
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,270
But if I were liked
by my stepmothers and sisters,

43
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,540
they would pester me.

44
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,910
I wouldn't be able
to get any moments of peace

45
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,780
to properly study.

46
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,540
To be liked by irrelevant people

47
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,940
is meaningless

48
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,910
to me.

49
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,340
My Lord.

50
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,990
Did I say something wrong?

51
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,060
What about me taking a liking to you?

52
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,940
Am I irrelevant?

53
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,150
My Lord, you are sensible.

54
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,060
Stop making fun of me.

55
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,310
Liar.

56
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,310
My Lord, you have my utmost loyalty.

57
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,660
I dare not deceive you.

58
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,270
Is there only loyalty?

59
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,750
I remember

60
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,060
that you

61
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,540
adore me.

62
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,710
Well...

63
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,430
Indeed. I adore you.

64
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,940
But there are many kinds of adoration.

65
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,740
Which one is yours?

66
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,390
Obviously,
the kind with undying loyalty.

67
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,780
"Undying loyalty"?

68
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,180
Then if I get married one day,

69
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,540
wouldn't you be heartbroken?

70
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,180
My Lord.

71
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,150
Has your illness been cured?

72
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,470
What illness?

73
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,340
It's nothing.

74
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,740
My Lord, as long as you are happy,

75
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,740
my feelings don't matter.

76
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,150
Hurry to the study
if you are done eating.

77
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,030
I barely took a few bites.

78
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,780
Thank you, My Lord.

79
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,340
Aren't you having any?

80
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,390
Young Lady, what are you thinking about?

81
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,220
You seem out of it.

82
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,300
Juli.

83
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,470
I think His Lordship
was acting a little strange today.

84
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,950
What happened?

85
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,420
He seemed preoccupied.

86
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,300
Was he trying to hint

87
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,340
that I should treat his illness?

88
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,150
That could be the reason.

89
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,660
I guess men are usually

90
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,270
too embarrassed to say such things.

91
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,910
After this hectic period,

92
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,590
I am going to find ways

93
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,590
to treat this illness.

94
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,780
Greetings, Your Highness.

95
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,910
You're here.

96
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,100
Playing pitch-pot, Your Highness?

97
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,180
Yes.

98
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,470
Sadly, I am not very good at it.

99
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,220
I remember you are good at archery.

100
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,830
How about giving it a shot

101
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,390
so that I get to learn from you?

102
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,660
I shall make a humble attempt, then.

103
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,740
As expected, you're great.

104
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,270
I come from a family of hunters.

105
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
I learned a few tricks
since my father taught me

106
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,540
when I was young.

107
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,180
Your words just put many generals
to shame.

108
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,860
I'm flattered.

109
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,470
You don't have to
teach the children today.

110
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,980
Is there something important

111
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,180
for your sudden visit?

112
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,710
I actually came
to ask for a leave of absence.

113
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,030
The Northern Liang diplomatic corps
will visit soon.

114
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,510
Thanks to the First Prince,
I have joined

115
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,980
the reception team.

116
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,540
But the children's classes
must not be held up.

117
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,150
So I was hoping
that you could find a substitute tutor.

118
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,710
That's a good thing
for the nation and the people.

119
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,150
Chen truly thinks highly of you.

120
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,390
Feel free to do your duty.

121
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,100
I will make arrangements
for the children's classes.

122
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,780
What are your thoughts

123
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,340
on the Northern Liang
diplomatic corps' sudden visit?

124
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,030
It's not a friendly visit.

125
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,630
There's a hidden agenda.

126
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,230
My Lord.

127
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,990
There aren't many mistakes
in this time's dictation, right?

128
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,660
You have a good memory.

129
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,460
Only one word is wrong.

130
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:44,990
That's for sure.

131
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,870
After all, I work for you.

132
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,110
I must be skilled in something.

133
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,940
You've passed the test.

134
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,150
Thank you, My Lord.

135
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,350
We waited from dawn until noon.

136
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,630
What is the Northern Liang
diplomatic corps up to?

137
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,350
Exactly.

138
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,420
I have hosted a reception many times

139
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,630
but never waited so long before.

140
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,940
Observer Mu.

141
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,700
Shen.

142
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,230
It is so scorching today.

143
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,300
You are so delicate as a woman.

144
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,420
Why don't you take a rest
under the pergola?

145
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,540
Everyone is standing here,
so I should too.

146
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,940
Moreover,

147
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,270
welcoming the Northern Liang
diplomatic corps

148
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,780
concerns our nation's prestige.

149
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,270
I dare not be lax.

150
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,030
You make a good point.

151
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,780
Looks like I was being narrow-minded.

152
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,180
Absolutely not.

153
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,110
You were just concerned about me.

154
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,030
Report!
Northern Liang emissaries have arrived!

155
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,060
(Mingde Gate)

156
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,180
(Northern Liang)

157
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,580
(Mingde Gate)

158
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,060
(Yemu Jing,
Third Prince of Northern Liang)

159
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,540
Welcome, Your Highness.

160
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,230
It must have been a tiring journey.

161
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,150
(Capital)
His Majesty has prepared a feast

162
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,300
in the palace to welcome your arrival.

163
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,780
Please come with us
to enter the capital.

164
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,420
I wish to do so.

165
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,460
But the gate is too small.

166
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,660
My imperial tents won't fit through.

167
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,420
There is even a woman?

168
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,350
I am Mu Zhuohua, the political observer
of the Ministry of Rites.

169
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,660
I am also a member
of the reception team.

170
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,460
Greetings, Your Highness.

171
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,540
Are the men in Southern Chen
that incompetent?

172
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,270
I can't believe
you let a woman be an official.

173
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,230
I am Shen Jinghong, the administrator
of the Ministry of Revenue.

174
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,350
Since you come from afar,

175
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,420
you must be unfamiliar with my nation.

176
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,060
His Majesty's political
and military achievements

177
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,230
benefit the whole nation.

178
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,630
For men

179
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,700
and women alike.

180
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,870
Therefore,

181
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,180
belittling women is out of the question,

182
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,580
let alone

183
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,460
treating women as slaves.

184
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,390
So it is not uncommon
for women to be an official

185
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,180
in our imperial court.

186
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,150
Precisely.

187
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,780
Men and women
are equal in Southern Chen.

188
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,180
Your Highness,
you don't know about Southern Chen

189
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,510
just as we don't know
about Northern Liang.

190
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,270
Here in Southern Chen,
we are a peaceful nation.

191
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,540
There is no burglary or theft.

192
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,510
It is my first time seeing people
bringing along their houses

193
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,510
while traveling.

194
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,510
It's not like we are snails.

195
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,390
How dare you!

196
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,350
How dare a lowly official

197
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,820
not show any respect?

198
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,870
Is this how the Southern Chen
respects someone superior?

199
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,180
Respect comes from the heart.

200
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,230
The most superior people

201
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,910
would not feel disrespected

202
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,180
even if they dine and sleep in the open.

203
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,030
But those who are inferior

204
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,700
would not appear noble
even if His Majesty

205
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,580
welcomes them personally.

206
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
Watch your tongue.

207
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,780
Mu Zhuohua.

208
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,870
You impressed me.

209
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,780
It would be my honor.

210
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,390
This way, Your Highness.

211
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,780
How dare a lowly official

212
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,460
humiliate me in public like that

213
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,390
by using my background against me?

214
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,750
How dare she!

215
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,390
Your Highness.

216
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,990
A eunuch is here with a decree.

217
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,560
(Mute slave,
bodyguard of the diplomatic corps)

218
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,270
Your Highness.

219
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,870
Please bow to accept
the imperial decree.

220
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,460
"Prince Yemu,

221
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,870
since you have traveled
a long and arduous journey

222
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,230
to make it here,

223
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,780
I have specially prepared
a banquet in the palace

224
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,270
to welcome the emissaries.

225
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,870
I grant you

226
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,060
my permission."

227
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,350
Thank you, Your Majesty.

228
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,350
Your Highness.

229
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,060
By the law of Southern Chen,

230
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,270
weapons are forbidden
during an audience with His Majesty.

231
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
I would like to ask
for your cooperation.

232
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,270
What's the matter?

233
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,150
Is there something wrong

234
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,390
with the hand of my mute slave?

235
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,750
I am Yemu Jing from Northern Liang.

236
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,420
Greetings, Your Majesty.

237
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,910
At ease.

238
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,460
It must have been
an arduous journey to come here.

239
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,110
Thank you for your concern,
Your Majesty.

240
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,780
Master Huiming was a highly virtuous
senior monk of Northern Liang.

241
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,910
It is our honor to present this Sarira

242
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,270
to Your Majesty.

243
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,630
I dare not complain.

244
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,750
Southern Chen is truly lucky

245
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,580
to receive this treasure.

246
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,180
Take a seat.

247
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

248
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,740
Prince Yemu.

249
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,260
Welcome to my nation.

250
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,460
You've got quite the nerve.

251
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,660
Do you think it was your place

252
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,310
as a low-ranking observer to speak
at the city gate earlier today?

253
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,020
My Lord.

254
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,830
Subjects must defend their ruler.

255
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,940
He insulted the people of Southern Chen.

256
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,910
I spoke up to defend my nation

257
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,980
and showed patriotism.

258
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,310
You should be praising me, My Lord.

259
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,660
Yemu Jing

260
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,700
is atrocious.

261
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,740
Aren't you afraid of offending him?

262
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,580
He is in the lands of Southern Chen.

263
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,910
What can he do to me?

264
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,150
Furthermore,

265
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,350
I have you to protect me.

266
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,310
Am I right?

267
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,220
Then you must stay close to me.

268
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,940
Don't fall behind

269
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,830
in case he wants revenge.

270
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,390
Yes, My Lord.

271
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,020
Your Majesty.

272
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,830
To show our intentions to form a lasting
friendly relationship with Southern Chen,

273
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,590
I have specially prepared
a valuable gift.

274
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,740
Your Majesty.

275
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,500
This is my younger sister, Yemu Zhen.

276
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,110
She is 20 years old

277
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,420
and the most beautiful woman
in Northern Liang.

278
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:50,710
(Yemu Zhen, Princess of Northern Liang)

279
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,870
A honey trap.

280
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,630
What a disgrace.

281
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,180
Chen.

282
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,830
Your Majesty.

283
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,630
This is a sincere gift
from Northern Liang.

284
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,390
I hope you will accept it

285
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,220
and treat my sister well.

286
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,220
I appreciate the thought.

287
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,830
It's just that Princess Yemu
is still so young.

288
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,830
I feel sorry

289
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,150
that she has to be
so far away from home.

290
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,790
Here's the thing, Your Majesty.

291
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,150
Northern Liang
will never take back a gift.

292
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,630
Otherwise, we would deem it
as disrespect.

293
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,980
If you are afraid
of mistreating my sister,

294
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,150
you can betroth her
to an imperial family member

295
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,870
who is of marriageable age.

296
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,260
I heard that Lord Ding

297
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,940
is still not married.

298
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,660
(This cunning fox of Northern Liang)

299
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,630
(is truly disgusting.)

300
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,660
I did not expect

301
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,870
such a huge difference
between the customs

302
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,870
of Northern Liang and Southern Chen.

303
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,310
I can't believe you would present

304
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,830
a woman as a gift.

305
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,350
Since this is a sincere gift
from Northern Liang,

306
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,500
it would be rude of us to decline.

307
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,980
We will definitely treat her well.

308
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,420
Your Majesty.

309
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,460
I would like to ask you to take
Yemu Zhen in as your goddaughter.

310
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,590
Lord Ding.

311
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,590
That is a good idea.

312
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,220
Princess Yemu
is a princess in Northern Liang.

313
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,320
She will still be a princess here
in Southern Chen.

314
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,550
She will not be mistreated.

315
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,110
His Majesty and the Empress will also

316
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,830
get her a good teacher

317
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,020
to teach her the etiquette
and culture of Southern Chen

318
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,870
to refine her overall qualities.

319
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,460
That will also

320
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,420
do justice to her title
as the most beautiful woman in the world.

321
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,220
Father.

322
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,180
I think Princess Yemu and I
will get along.

323
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,260
How about letting her stay with me?

324
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,830
Not only can I take care
of her daily necessities,

325
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,630
but I can also
show her around the capital.

326
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,790
Good.

327
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,460
I approve.

328
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,500
In that case,

329
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,940
I shall thank you, Your Majesty.

330
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,500
Lord Ding.

331
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,180
You and I are considered
old acquaintances.

332
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,110
I brought lots of good wine
from Northern Liang with me.

333
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,550
I would like to catch up with you.

334
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,700
Do I have the honor of doing so?

335
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,940
You are my guest.

336
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,790
I should be the host.

337
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,110
Northern Liang is good
at martial arts and hunting.

338
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,350
How about you joining me
at the hunting ground?

339
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,020
That would also make
your emissaries feel at home.

340
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,070
What do you think?

341
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,220
Lord Ding.

342
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,790
You shall entertain Prince Yemu
on my behalf tomorrow

343
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,260
as the host.

344
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,070
I will comply, Your Majesty.

345
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

346
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,590
My Lord.

347
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,590
That's a beautiful woman.

348
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,110
Don't you think it is a pity?

349
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,020
Why?

350
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,740
Are you feeling sorry for me?

351
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,220
You said that you adored me.

352
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,550
Was it all a lie?

353
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,390
I obviously believe

354
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,020
that you are not someone superficial.

355
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,260
You won't be easily tempted by beauty.

356
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,630
I want to be with you

357
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,550

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,460
You invited Yemu Jing instead.

371
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,660
Do you have something else in mind?

372
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,550
What do you think it is?

373
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,590
I think

374
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,260
the ultimate goal of Northern Liang

375
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,910
is to prepare for war.

376
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,070
They still dare not act rashly.

377
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,460
That is because they know

378
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,790
that you are guarding Southern Chen.

379
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,420
That is why I think they visited

380
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,630
to find out

381
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,150
if you are healthy enough

382
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,350
to lead the army.

383
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,660
You are right.

384
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,420
He thinks Southern Chen
and Eastern Xia formed an alliance

385
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,180
to fight against Northern Liang.

386
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,630
That's why he risked
coming to Southern Chen

387
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,910
under strained circumstances
while fighting to be appointed

388
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,420
as the Crown Prince.

389
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,550
He wants to find out my real condition.

390
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,790
But, My Lord, if Yemu Jing

391
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,310
learns that he has been tricked,

392
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,180
would he be furious?

393
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,150
Since he has fallen into my trap,

394
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,220
I will make sure he is under my thumb.

395
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,350
My Lord.

396
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,550
You have such great foresight.

397
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,460
But your health...

398
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,180
I am unable to go with you,

399
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,260
but I will prepare
enough supplies for you.

400
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,070
Supplies?

401
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,220
I will make sure they are delivered

402
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,180
before you set off tomorrow.

403
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,910
All right.

404
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,700
In that case,

405
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,020
bring those supplies personally

406
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,500
and follow me tomorrow.

407
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,220
I'm coming with you?

408
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,660
My Lord,
we have arrived at Zhuque Street.

409
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,590
That's settled, then.

410
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,020
I will go with you tomorrow.

411
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,910
Please request

412
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,830
a leave of absence
with His Majesty for me.

413
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,830
I should get going.

414
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,590
My Lord.

415
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,910
Where is Chen?

416
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,590
My Lord.

417
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,700
The Northern Liang emissaries
are hunting in the woods.

418
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,940
First Prince is laying out
the tents for resting.

419
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:21,870
All right.

420
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,700
Yes.

421
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,500
I didn't expect
His Highness to arrive first

422
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,390
and have everything settled.

423
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,020
Chen dislikes people from Northern Liang,

424
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,940
but he has treated
the Northern Liang diplomatic corps

425
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,790
with great hospitality

426
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,590
as the host.

427
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,870
He has improved a lot.

428
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,740
Where is Mu Zhuohua?

429
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,260
She said she felt sick
from the bumpy journey.

430
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,180
So she went to the riverside
to freshen up.

431
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,420
My Lord.

432
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,390
That's the way to the riverside.

433
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:08,830
My Lord!

434
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,220
Going to Mu Zhuohua again.

435
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,390
Lord Ding.

436
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,390
Yemu Zhen is seriously such a bother.

437
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,110
Your Highness.

438
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,500
That's a romantic affair between them.

439
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,390
You should just stay out of it.

440
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,110
A romantic affair, you say?

441
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,630
I don't think so.

442
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,790
It is clearly an affair
between two nations.

443
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,260
You were willing
to use women as leverage,

444
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,910
but Southern Chen
was unwilling to accept it.

445
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,350
My Lord.

446
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,310
Stay still.

447
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,460
Your Highness.

448
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,070
Now isn't a good time.

449
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,630
Don't read too much into it.

450
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,660
Look at your disheveled appearance.

451
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,590
It will taint the prestige
of Southern Chen officials.

452
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,180
Then why did you

453
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,420
do something like this yourself?

454
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,630
It is called...

455
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,260
Showing respect to those with talent.

456
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,420
Who is that?

457
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,740
You are now the goddaughter
of His Majesty.

458
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,110
So you should address Lord Ding
as your uncle.

459
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,980
You are sensible.

460
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,460
I'm sure you know what it means
to excuse yourself.

461
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,260
You...

462
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,260
Speaking of which,

463
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,700
is Northern Liang about to lose?

464
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,550
Well, My Lord.

465
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,110
My Lord.

466
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,700
She has left.

467
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,500
I see. The falling flowers
yearn for love,

468
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,020
but the heartless brook ripples on.

469
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,110
You are good at playing hooky.

470
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,150
I like the rippling waters.

471
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,260
My Lord.

472
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,700
It was a slip of the tongue.

473
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,940
His Highness said civil officials

474
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,420
didn't have to remain at our posts

475
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,180
as long as we don't wander off.

476
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,740
It's alright.

477
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,630
My Lord.

478
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,630
Is there any progress?

479
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,350
Hawk claw hook?

480
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,390
I remember that the wounds
on Deputy General Yuan

481
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,830
were caused by it.

482
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,660
The casting technique of it
is from Northern Liang.

483
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,020
You showed intentions
to make peace with Eastern Xia.

484
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,700
But it was actually
to lure Northern Liang out.

485
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,740
You intend

486
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,150
to find the owner
of this hawk claw hook.

487
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,700
Getting an answer

488
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,310
will not be easy.

489
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,310
My Lord.

490
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,590
I can give you some suggestions.

491
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,630
Prince Yemu.

492
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,980
You win some battles, and you lose some.

493
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,870
You can't be a sore loser, can you?

494
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,580
Lord Ding.

495
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,790
I have won every battle in recent years.

496
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,420
How can I be a sore loser?

497
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,350
Instead,

498
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,310
I wonder if your skills have regressed.

499
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,190
Prince Yemu.

500
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,140
If you want to find the answer,

501
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:41,190
how about trying it yourself?

502
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,020
We have a banquet today.

503
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,620
I think we'd better compete over wine.

504
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,830
Lord Ding.

505
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,910
Jing.

506
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,060
Why do you look like a mess?

507
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,020
The banquet will begin soon.

508
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,870
Your Highness,
how about returning to your tent

509
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,270
to freshen up?

510
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,140
After all, you represent Northern Liang.

511
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,830
Your Highness, are you alright?

512
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:24,980
I'm fine.

513
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,190
It's said in the secret letter

514
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,580
that Liu Yan hasn't practiced
martial arts for years.

515
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,720
Possibly due to the poison residue
of the Yuanluo Flower.

516
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,790
But based on his vigor earlier,

517
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,750
he doesn't look weak at all.

518
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,460
Then does he still
have poison in him or not?

519
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,350
We will find out at the banquet.

520
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,020
If he really suffered internal injuries,

521
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,270
I doubt

522
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,670
he would keep drinking
with a straight face.

523
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,500
Regardless,

524
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,350
I cannot rest assured
with none of my people

525
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,750
around Liu Yan.

526
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,060
But Lord Ding
is unresponsive like a rock.

527
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,310
Even with my aggressive approach,

528
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,230
he never took a glance at me.

529
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,980
But he treats
that female official differently.

530
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,190
I saw it with my own eyes.

531
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,310
Jing.

532
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,980
What should I do?

533
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,460
If the soft approach doesn't work,

534
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,830
we will just use force.

535
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,750
I have released that mute slave.

536
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,710
I will see

537
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,940
if this sheep

538
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,230
can make the wolves

539
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,100
tear each other apart.

540
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,750
Uncle.

541
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,350
I know you are trying
to intimidate Yemu Jing

542
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,140
so that he won't act rashly.

543
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,230
But his wine

544
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,670
is clearly a trap.

545
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,230
Why would you invite him to drink?

546
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,710
Worry about yourself first.

547
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,310
Yemu Jing is very cunning.

548
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,420
Do you really want
to have petty fights with him?

549
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,020
Well, he got on my nerves.

550
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,270
My Lord. Your Highness.

551
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,420
Mu Zhuohua?

552
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,140
What are you doing here?

553
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,020
I...

554
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,980
I called her over to treat your wound.

555
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,060
Uncle.

556
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,420
I'm perfectly fine. Look.

557
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,060
Cut it out.

558
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,230
Go ahead.

559
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,350
Yes, My Lord.

560
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,390
But, Uncle...

561
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,710
Your Highness.

562
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,940
Physicians treat patients the same
regardless of gender.

563
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,140
Moreover,

564
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,670
I have already treated your wound
last time.

565
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,270
Be gentle.

566
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,230
How can a girl

567
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,750
be so rough?

568
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,870
Do you want me to proceed?

569
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,870
Such a bother.

570
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,540
How are you going to get married?

571
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,980
Your Highness.

572
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,540
You may talk less

573
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,940
while I treat your wound

574
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,540
so as not to waste your energy.

575
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,230
Yemu Jing

576
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,140
has spines on every inch of his body.

577
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,190
He is basically
a reincarnation of a hedgehog.

578
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,620
My Lord.

579
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,870
The wound on His Highness did reopen,

580
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,580
but it is not that serious.

581
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,500
I have changed the wound dressing.

582
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,620
All right. I am fine.

583
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,580
You may leave.

584
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,190
I have important things
to discuss with my uncle.

585
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,270
Your Highness, Yemu Jing

586
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,620
must be up to no good.

587
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,540
I think you'd better check.

588
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,500
How big of a wave can he make?

589
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,750
He was defeated by me.

590
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,540
Chen.

591
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,230
You are in charge of the banquet.

592
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,540
You should carry it through.

593
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,420
Uncle.

594
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,790
Are you kicking me out?

595
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,350
Focus on the big picture.

596
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,870
Why are you still here?

597
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,750
I have something
to discuss with His Lordship.

598
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,670
My Lord, is the iron hook

599
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,660
attached to the mute slave's left arm

600
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,580
similar to the hawk claw hook?

601
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,620
I have sent Zhijian to look into it.

602
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,670
Seeing that he has yet to return,

603
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,100
I'm assuming
that the mute slave got away.

604
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,190
