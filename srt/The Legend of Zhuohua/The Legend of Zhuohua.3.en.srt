=The Legend of Zhuohua=

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 3=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,910
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:55,435
Young Lady, how is it?

21
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:56,914
It's fine. Don't worry.

22
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:28,315
My Lord, I...

23
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,475
I haven't done an autopsy before.

24
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:32,834
What?

25
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:34,434
Why are you afraid of a dead body

26
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:35,714
when you had the guts
to one-up His Lordship?

27
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:45,434
Be careful.

28
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:47,554
The blood on the body is poisonous.

29
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:49,994
Thank you for your kind reminder.

30
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:41,834
I thought you wanted to eat.
Why don't you take it?

31
00:03:54,154 --> 00:03:55,394
What poison did she get?

32
00:03:58,795 --> 00:03:59,554
My Lord.

33
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:02,075
I need more references
before making a judgment.

34
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:05,714
My Lord, could you please describe

35
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:08,594
the symptoms of Yun Xiangyue
before and after the poison took effect?

36
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:11,075
At first,

37
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:13,274
she was normal.

38
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:16,515
About ten minutes later,

39
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:19,955
she spit up blood, fell, and died.

40
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:21,515
Besides,

41
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:24,714
her body was bleeding.

42
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:28,315
Have you touched her last night?

43
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:29,714
I held her

44
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:31,515
when she collapsed.

45
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:33,115
My Lord.

46
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:35,354
May I take your pulse?

47
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:47,435
Last night,

48
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:51,354
I noticed something weird
about your pulse.

49
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:54,995
Two different energies
intertwine inside you.

50
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:56,955
Strangely,

51
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:59,354
your qi and blood surged in your body,

52
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:02,195
and the pulse was unstable.

53
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:05,154
My Lord.

54
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:07,435
Could you tell me

55
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,115
about your past sickness?

56
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:11,555
His Lordship was poisoned
by Yuanluo before.

57
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:15,075
Yuanluo Flower?

58
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:18,354
Do you know this flower?

59
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,794
I read about it before.

60
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:23,714
This is Yuanluo Flower.

61
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:27,315
It's the most poisonous flower
in the world.

62
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:28,995
(Yuanluo Flower)

63
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,714
(grows in the deep abyss where toxic bugs
and venomous snakes gather.)

64
00:05:33,154 --> 00:05:34,594
Once afflicted by this poison,

65
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:35,714
one's blood will coagulate

66
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,154
within three days.

67
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:39,354
When the poison penetrates the bones,

68
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:40,875
the victim will die in seven days.

69
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:43,875
Precisely.

70
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:47,034
But you survived

71
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:49,594
this poison.

72
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:52,794
I remember that this poisonous flower

73
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:54,435
has no antidote.

74
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:56,875
Bone-scraping treatment.

75
00:05:57,515 --> 00:05:58,394
Have you heard about it before?

76
00:05:59,394 --> 00:06:00,515
Bone-scraping treatment?

77
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:04,154
It's as excruciating
as Yuanluo Flower's torment.

78
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:10,034
What about the other energy
in your body?

79
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:11,635
It's Snow Dust Pill.

80
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:12,955
Snow Dust Pill?

81
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,315
It's new to me.

82
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:21,635
Snow Dust Pills
can detoxify all kinds of poison.

83
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:23,234
His Lordship

84
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:24,834
took the last pill.

85
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:31,555
If so, the two intertwining energies
inside your body

86
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:34,034
should be Snow Dust Pill
and Yuanluo Flower.

87
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:36,875
But another energy

88
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,635
seeped into your body last night,

89
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:41,195
ruining the harmony
of both poison and antidote.

90
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,394
I had many doubts,

91
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:48,354
but now I started figuring them out.

92
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:42,955
The poison was soaked in her clothes?

93
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:44,635
Yes.

94
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:47,115
The poison seeped into her veins
through her garment.

95
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:49,195
However, this is not a poison.

96
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:52,555
It's a potion named Revival Powder.

97
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:54,474
Revival Powder?

98
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:02,474
Revival Powder is the most
efficient supplementary medicine.

99
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:05,234
A tint of it at the nose
can take effect.

100
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:06,834
Due to its powerful function,

101
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:09,195
ordinary men will experience
an energy surge inside their bodies.

102
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:11,555
While women have too slender veins

103
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:12,714
to cater to the energy surge,

104
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:14,515
and they will die after the veins burst.

105
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:18,875
Since you can tell it's Revival Powder,

106
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,635
do you know its origin?

107
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:26,635
Ingredients of Revival Powder

108
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:27,794
are precious,

109
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:30,875
especially the main ingredient,
Immortal Fruits.

110
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:34,114
It bears only ten fruits per year.

111
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,594
Besides, its concoction process
is demanding,

112
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:39,634
and the chance of failure
is more than half.

113
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:42,795
I'm afraid the place
that can afford the hefty expenses

114
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:44,155
can only be...

115
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:45,754
Are you suggesting

116
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:48,195
it comes from
the Imperial Academy of Medicine?

117
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:51,395
I daren't make any wild guesses.

118
00:08:51,594 --> 00:08:52,594
You won't be punished. Go on.

119
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:57,714
I reckon

120
00:08:58,114 --> 00:09:00,714
the perpetrator is discreet.

121
00:09:01,714 --> 00:09:02,634
On top of that,

122
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:07,395
this person knows
about your sickness well.

123
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:10,315
As this person predicted
that the Snow Dust Pill

124
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:13,155
would dissolve the ordinary poison
inside you.

125
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:16,315
I found that something is off too.

126
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:19,155
I'm curious

127
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:22,435
about why Miss Yun put on
the maidservant's clothes.

128
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:26,994
And the murderer of Miss Yun

129
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,195
wouldn't have foreseen this

130
00:09:29,474 --> 00:09:31,754
and applied the poison
to the maidservant's clothes in advance.

131
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:33,955
Thus, I suspect

132
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:35,234
that the murderer

133
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:37,675
has bribed her maidservant beforehand.

134
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:40,555
My Lord, you should
interrogate the maidservant.

135
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:43,795
She was killed last night.

136
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:52,315
She was killed?

137
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:57,195
My Lord, I'm clean and innocent.

138
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:58,474
I was involved in this accidentally.

139
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:00,915
If I were to harm you,

140
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,795
I should've left you there last night

141
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:05,395
to avoid trouble...

142
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:06,994
No.

143
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:09,874
I didn't mean your matter is trouble.

144
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:13,155
It's a great pleasure to serve you,
My Lord.

145
00:10:13,474 --> 00:10:14,474
However, I...

146
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,035
I don't want to be killed.

147
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:19,275
Zhijian.

148
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:22,275
Have Zhimo escort them back.

149
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:23,754
Yes.

150
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:34,874
My Lord.

151
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,634
He Xin has looked into

152
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,275
Mu Zhuohua's background

153
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:39,275
when the accident happened last night.

154
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:41,594
Read it to me.

155
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,075
Mu Zhuohua, born in Huaizhou.

156
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:51,234
The seventh daughter
of the wealthiest man in Jiangnan.

157
00:10:51,354 --> 00:10:52,195
Her real name is Mu Qi.

158
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:55,275
How bold she is.

159
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:56,474
She changed her name and birth origin.

160
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:01,754
Her father, Mu Rong, has many wives

161
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,754
and children.

162
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:05,714
Her mother, Gu Yixiao, was a prostitute.

163
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:07,874
She was the third among the wife
and the concubines

164
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:08,834
and died at a young age.

165
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:13,514
Given her family and background,

166
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:17,834
no wonder she has no concern

167
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,035
about staying in Flower Alley.

168
00:11:27,714 --> 00:11:28,395
Juli.

169
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:31,075
Actually, I ran into Lord Ding

170
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:32,675
in Xiaoqin Pleasure House last night.

171
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:35,114
Hold on.

172
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:39,714
Come with me.

173
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:41,834
Here writes

174
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:43,874
that she's known as a "bookworm"
in the residence

175
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:44,994
and has no specialty.

176
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:46,955
She never left Jiangnan
over the past two decades.

177
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:48,834
This is her first time in the capital.

178
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:52,395
A few days ago, Mu Rong

179
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:53,994
just married his eighteenth concubine.

180
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:57,155
She managed to study

181
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:58,474
and acquire medical skills

182
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,514
growing up in this kind of family.

183
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:04,395
She's truly exceptional.

184
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:06,474
Young Lady,

185
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:07,955
you did such a great thing last night.

186
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:10,195
It's not something great.

187
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:11,675
I begin to worry...

188
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:14,354
I'm worried that our life

189
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:16,714
will be troublesome from now on.

190
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:20,634
Do you mean

191
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:23,354
we're on Lord Ding's radar now?

192
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:24,675
That's right.

193
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:30,474
That night, I had no choice
but to play dumb before him.

194
00:12:30,754 --> 00:12:31,874
Because he was able to take my life

195
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:34,075
even though he was poisoned.

196
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:35,275
Therefore,

197
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:37,915
I did everything I could
to save his life,

198
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:39,834
hoping that he could show me some mercy

199
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,795
and not kill his savior.

200
00:12:42,514 --> 00:12:44,754
But why did you help him earlier today?

201
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:46,994
Yun Xiangyue is dead.

202
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:49,035
I could only turn myself in,

203
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:50,714
instead of exposing him.

204
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:51,795
That's why

205
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:53,714
I must perform my skills before him

206
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:54,714
to show my loyalty.

207
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:56,915
Because playing dumb wouldn't help much.

208
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:58,754
I had to make myself
more valuable to him.

209
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:00,795
Young Lady.

210
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:02,675
Are we safe now?

211
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:05,594
As long as Lord Ding reckons

212
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:07,395
that I was involved in this involuntarily,

213
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:09,514
I think we're safe

214
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,234
for the time being.

215
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:14,075
Under the alias of Mu Zhuohua,

216
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:17,195
Mu Qi ranked 25th
in the provincial examination.

217
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:20,155
Gosh, she's actually
a provincial graduate.

218
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:23,915
The 25th is a mediocre rank.

219
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:26,754
Given her competency,

220
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:29,195
she should've reached higher ranks.

221
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:32,315
But she chose to stay in low profile.

222
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:34,994
My Lord.

223
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,555
This woman is scheming indeed.

224
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:38,514
But we have no idea

225
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:39,834
if her plot is to protect herself

226
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:41,474
or to be exploited
by the one behind her.

227
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:44,435
This is still a mystery to us.

228
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:47,435
Do you remember

229
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:51,035
what I told you when we first came here?

230
00:13:51,594 --> 00:13:54,795
I always think that Lord Ding
is a strange character.

231
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:57,315
Back then,

232
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:58,915
Tutor Shang said to me

233
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:02,435
that Lord Ding's meritorious reputation
had surpassed the Emperor.

234
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,354
If not for the fatal defeat
five years ago,

235
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:07,435
most officials

236
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,634
would've held Lord Ding in higher regard
than the Emperor.

237
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:12,354
Guess what.

238
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:13,834
The Emperor

239
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:15,315
has been in poor health.

240
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,874
He has three sons.

241
00:14:17,994 --> 00:14:19,195
But the three princes are in bad odor
with each other.

242
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:20,994
Hence, Lord Ding

243
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:24,114
must act prudently
and stay in a low profile

244
00:14:24,234 --> 00:14:25,075
to protect himself.

245
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,195
But I'm confused

246
00:14:27,594 --> 00:14:31,155
why he returned to the capital
in a high-profile manner.

247
00:14:32,514 --> 00:14:33,795
What was the show for?

248
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:37,514
But her words do make sense.

249
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:40,714
Which one?

250
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:42,514
She said the perpetrator

251
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:44,155
must know your sickness very well.

252
00:14:45,195 --> 00:14:46,994
There are not many

253
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:48,915
who know your condition well.

254
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,234
We haven't found the truth.

255
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:54,315
I know what to do.

256
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:57,594
Have Imperial Physician Zhao investigate

257
00:14:57,754 --> 00:14:59,555
the Revival Powder

258
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:01,035
Mu Zhuohua mentioned.

259
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,874
Leave no stone unturned.

260
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:05,874
Do it quietly.

261
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:09,195
Besides,

262
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:13,795
have Zhimo keep a close eye
on Mu Zhuohua.

263
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:14,834
Yes.

264
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:20,460
(Lord Ding's Residence)

265
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:23,474
Chop-chop.

266
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:24,555
Do your work well.

267
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:25,435
Sure.

268
00:15:26,555 --> 00:15:27,195
Coming.

269
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:30,514
Today is the Imperial Birthday.

270
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:33,315
Everyone will be celebrating
the Emperor's birthday.

271
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:35,315
Each year after the banquet ends,

272
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:36,435
His Majesty will grace

273
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,395
Lord Ding's Residence
and have a drink with Lord Ding.

274
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:40,195
Go. Keep a close eye on that.

275
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,555
Two of you.

276
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:45,955
Stop being clumsy.

277
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:49,354
Do you want me to do this for you?

278
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:51,874
Do your work well.

279
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:52,994
Yes.

280
00:15:58,195 --> 00:15:59,435
What a merry day.

281
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:01,874
Sadly,

282
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,234
there's no lady owner
to deal with the affairs.

283
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:07,955
An old man like me
has to bear this burden.

284
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:11,754
Do a good job.

285
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:29,514
Good!

286
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:32,195
Good!

287
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:34,754
Bravo!

288
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:41,075
Good!

289
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:44,754
Great!

290
00:16:45,275 --> 00:16:47,795
Wonderful!

291
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:52,514
Well,

292
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:54,114
I don't regret encountering Lord Ding

293
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:55,275
and having this interaction with him.

294
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:56,634
I'll likely gain a good promotion chance

295
00:16:56,634 --> 00:16:57,994
if he acknowledges my talent.

296
00:16:58,594 --> 00:16:59,315
Young Lady.

297
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:01,874
Don't you think Lord Ding is stingy?

298
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,474
You're his savior.

299
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:04,714
And yet he didn't pay you
for the treatment.

300
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:05,915
Bite your tongue.

301
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,875
The paltry sum of his treatment charges
isn't what we aim for.

302
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:10,355
What do we aim for, then?

303
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:11,794
His good-looking face?

304
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,074
Guo Juli, you're bold enough.

305
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:16,355
How could you assume

306
00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:17,514
that I'm after his good-looking face?

307
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:19,794
In that case,

308
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:21,034
what do you aim for?

309
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,034
I tell you what,

310
00:17:22,395 --> 00:17:24,554
if Butler Zhou catches us

311
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:26,474
one day,

312
00:17:26,474 --> 00:17:28,714
I hope Lord Ding will give us a hand.

313
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:31,195
You're right, Young Lady.

314
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:32,595
But you ought to be careful
in this place.

315
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:35,355
No worries, this place is close
to the palace.

316
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:36,754
Look right in front of you.

317
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:37,994
That's the gate tower.

318
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:40,474
He doesn't have the guts to act
in front of everyone.

319
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,835
His Majesty ascends the gate tower!

320
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:43,435
Young Lady.

321
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:44,595
Look.

322
00:17:45,994 --> 00:17:47,155
Lord Ding is up there too.

323
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:48,155
Let's go to the front.

324
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:51,435
His Majesty ascends the gate tower!

325
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:59,355
Your Majesty!

326
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:05,514
Your Majesty!

327
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:11,960
(Liu Ju, Emperor of Southern Chen)

328
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:16,935
(Empress Xu of Southern Chen.
Dowager Empress Zhou of Southern Chen)

329
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,785
(Liu Yu, Second Prince of Southern Chen.
Liu Jin, Third Prince of Southern Chen)

330
00:18:23,514 --> 00:18:25,314
Your Majesty!

331
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,195
(Only the royalty)

332
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:32,754
(knows about my sickness.)

333
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:34,754
Yan.

334
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:37,955
Whenever I see my people
and nation are in peace,

335
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:39,234
I always feel glad

336
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:41,835
that you're still by my side.

337
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,714
Your Majesty.

338
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:45,794
This is your blessing

339
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:47,395
as well as all of the nation.

340
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:49,714
Without me,

341
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,514
there will be someone here

342
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:53,234
to fulfill your dream.

343
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:55,074
No, Yan.

344
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:58,635
You shouldn't always deny your credit.

345
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,994
I just made a request to you,

346
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:06,675
and you agreed

347
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:09,195
to reopen the female imperial exams.

348
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:13,675
I didn't deny this reward
from you, though.

349
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:18,635
Your Majesty.

350
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:21,675
Are you thinking about Roujia?

351
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:27,514
I always feel bad for Jiao.

352
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:29,835
She lost her mother at a very young age,

353
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:32,595
and I couldn't look after her.

354
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:34,915
When she came back to the capital

355
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,474
and met her true love,

356
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,915
again, she lost him.

357
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,034
The capital is a sad place for her.

358
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:49,994
Since she left for Jiangnan,

359
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:51,915
I haven't seen my dear daughter

360
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:54,474
for five years long.

361
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:01,875
Roujia is an unbending child.

362
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:06,234
Despite her deep-rooted sorrow
these years,

363
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:08,714
she still keeps herself together.

364
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:12,115
I know.

365
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,274
Jishan Hall, which she has been running,
has branched out nationwide,

366
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:16,875
and people celebrate her kind deeds.

367
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,314
Holy Maiden is back!

368
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:22,395
Holy Maiden!

369
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,474
Holy Maiden!

370
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,875
Holy Maiden!

371
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:42,314
Father.

372
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:46,115
I'm back.

373
00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:47,994
I'm glad that you're back.

374
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:54,794
(Princess Roujia, Liu Jiao,
Princess of Southern Chen)

375
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:56,355
You're cruel, my girl.

376
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:59,195
I've been waiting for you.

377
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:01,794
Finally, you're home.

378
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:02,955
Grandmother.

379
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:04,675
I'm back.

380
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:11,955
Greetings, Mother.

381
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:14,635
Greetings, Uncle.

382
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:17,155
Young Lady.

383
00:21:17,514 --> 00:21:19,875
Why does everyone call her Holy Maiden?

384
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,234
She's Princess Roujia.

385
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,074
The favorite daughter of His Majesty.

386
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:25,355
Five years ago,

387
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,714
when His Lordship suffered
a fatal defeat in the Juma River,

388
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:30,115
a man sacrificed in the battle too.

389
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:32,155
That was Princess's fiance,

390
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:33,435
General Xue Xiaotang.

391
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,195
Aren't they separated forever?

392
00:21:36,915 --> 00:21:38,355
After General Xue's death,

393
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:40,994
Dowager Empress wanted to choose
a new husband for the Princess.

394
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:44,554
However, Her Highness insisted
on being in mourning for General Xue

395
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:46,435
and turned down all marriage requests.

396
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:48,195
After returning to Jiangnan,

397
00:21:48,195 --> 00:21:49,875
she reinstated the operation
of Jishan Hall

398
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:51,395
and has been helping the needy

399
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:52,754
and impoverished families.

400
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,554
When I was in Huaizhou,

401
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:56,835
I met her once.

402
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,435
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

403
00:22:06,955 --> 00:22:08,314
Old Master Mu, I came here

404
00:22:08,314 --> 00:22:11,195
to offer my gratitude to you
on behalf of Jishan Hall.

405
00:22:12,994 --> 00:22:14,635
You're so benevolent and kind

406
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:16,355
(Young Princess Roujia)
to offer financial relief for the flood.

407
00:22:16,355 --> 00:22:17,355
I can help out too.

408
00:22:17,355 --> 00:22:18,335
(Young Princess Roujia)

409
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:23,115
You sure do.

410
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:24,635
It's good to have aspirations.

411
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:26,314
Let's help the refugees.

412
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:28,355
We welcome another pair of hands.

413
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:36,395
Finally, our family
got to reunite today.

414
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:37,875
Jiao.

415
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:40,875
We should raise the glass to Heaven
as appreciation.

416
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:42,274
Yes, Father.

417
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:56,395
May the nation nestle in peace
and boast with talents aid.

418
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:25,595
With the dark sky and the yellow soil,
the universe was born in chaos.

419
00:23:26,754 --> 00:23:28,355
Young Lady, I saw Tanghulu over there.

420
00:23:28,355 --> 00:23:29,314
I want to get one for myself.

421
00:23:29,435 --> 00:23:30,314
Don't go too far.

422
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:44,155
Miss Seventh.

423
00:23:46,915 --> 00:23:49,395
It was quite an effort to find you.

424
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,435
Please help me!

425
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,754
Robbery!

426
00:23:59,074 --> 00:23:59,794
What are you up to?

427
00:24:00,195 --> 00:24:02,195
Robbing a woman in public?
Do you want to go against the law?

428
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:03,155
Robbing a woman in public?

429
00:24:03,754 --> 00:24:04,355
Folks.

430
00:24:04,635 --> 00:24:05,395
Folks, please.

431
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:06,554
Please listen to me.

432
00:24:07,274 --> 00:24:09,034
She's going to be the concubine
of my master,

433
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,155
but she ran off before the wedding.

434
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:11,875
So, I have to bring her back

435
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,395
and teach her a lesson.

436
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:14,554
You should go home.

437
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:16,794
Nonsense!

438
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:18,195
Young Lady isn't betrothed to anyone.

439
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,835
She has nothing to do with you.

440
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:20,675
Miss Seventh.

441
00:24:20,915 --> 00:24:22,274
The Mu family has already accepted
betrothal from us,

442
00:24:22,274 --> 00:24:23,675
and yet they renege on this marriage.

443
00:24:23,955 --> 00:24:25,714
If we were to report this to the yamen,

444
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:26,754
you don't stand a chance of winning.

445
00:24:28,074 --> 00:24:28,794
Everyone.

446
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,915
This is the engagement letter
of Miss Mu Qi.

447
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:33,074
Today, I...

448
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:35,274
Run!

449
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:36,595
Come on.

450
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:38,635
She ran away.

451
00:24:39,635 --> 00:24:40,274
Go after her.

452
00:24:41,635 --> 00:24:43,155
Useless bunch.

453
00:24:50,675 --> 00:24:51,034
Quick.

454
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:05,034
Excuse me, please.

455
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:09,754
Scram!

456
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:11,435
You're not allowed to meet Uncle alone.

457
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:13,355
Jin.

458
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:14,955
You need to be polite
to our elder brother.

459
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:16,754
Chen.

460
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:20,435
Please keep your manner in check too.

461
00:25:20,714 --> 00:25:21,794
Shut your mouth.

462
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:38,314
You will get a reward
with correct answers.

463
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:39,955
It's the Princess. Let's go.

464
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:42,875
What five-letter word
can be read the same

465
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,635
upside down or right side up?

466
00:25:46,435 --> 00:25:47,355
Swims.

467
00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:49,595
Well done.

468
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:52,034
Miss, listen to the question carefully.

469
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:54,274
I'm tall when I'm young

470
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:56,155
and short when I'm old.

471
00:25:56,314 --> 00:25:57,355
What am I?

472
00:25:57,835 --> 00:25:58,514
A candle.

473
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:01,115
You're smart, miss.

474
00:26:05,034 --> 00:26:07,034
Which eye cannot see?

475
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,474
It's a metaphor.

476
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:11,314
Eye of a needle.

477
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,115
What comes down and goes up repeatedly?

478
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:16,554
It's a certain weather.

479
00:26:18,955 --> 00:26:19,595
Rain.

480
00:26:22,234 --> 00:26:23,635
What color

481
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:25,034
do you eat?

482
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:27,274
What color do I eat?

483
00:26:28,915 --> 00:26:29,595
Orange.

484
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:32,955
Good job, miss.

485
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:34,355
Give me a moment.

486
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:36,595
Where have they gone?

487
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:37,635
Search over there.

488
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:45,595
How sly.

489
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:48,994
Who are you talking about?

490
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,074
I wonder if I have the pleasure

491
00:26:57,314 --> 00:26:59,915
of having a taste of Shiduanxiang Tea
in your residence.

492
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:05,195
These are your rewards
for answering the lantern riddles.

493
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:05,994
Here you go.

494
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:08,514
Please pick one.

495
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,514
All right.

496
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:14,314
Thank you.

497
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:14,994
Welcome.

498
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:18,355
Where are they?

499
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:19,395
Go over there.

500
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:23,994
You're smart, miss.

501
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:29,474
No, Your Highness is indeed talented.

502
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:31,155
Do you know me?

503
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:33,635
Though you were high up
on the city tower,

504
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:36,074
no one could ever forget
after seeing you.

505
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:37,635
Not only that,

506
00:27:37,754 --> 00:27:39,074
you've enlightened me

507
00:27:39,554 --> 00:27:40,994
when I was little.

508
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:43,195
How fated we are.

509
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:44,994
Was it in Jiangnan?

510
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:46,514
Your Highness.

511
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,794
Do you remember that?

512
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:50,595
No.

513
00:27:51,395 --> 00:27:52,794
Your accent

514
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:55,274
sounds like folks
from Huaizhou, Jiangnan.

515
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:57,835
I...

516
00:27:58,274 --> 00:27:59,314
I'm from Yanzhou, actually.

517
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:01,034
Well, my mistake.

518
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:11,074
Miss Mu Qi

519
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:13,314
is talking to Princess Roujia now.

520
00:28:20,274 --> 00:28:20,994
Let's leave.

521
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:23,714
We'll find another way.

522
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:35,274
Miss.

523
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:37,675
Am I standing here long enough

524
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:39,754
to solve your problem?

525
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:43,155
Your Highness,

526
00:28:44,675 --> 00:28:47,595
you figured that out?

527
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:50,794
I did. But it's fine.

528
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:52,714
If I could help you

529
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,835
by just standing here,

530
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:55,875
I'm more than glad to do it.

531
00:28:57,955 --> 00:28:59,835
Do you have any problems

532
00:28:59,835 --> 00:29:00,915
that need my help too?

533
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:03,274
Your Highness, you're so kind.

534
00:29:03,794 --> 00:29:06,234
No wonder everyone sings praise of you.

535
00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:09,754
You still helped me

536
00:29:10,435 --> 00:29:12,034
even though you knew
I was taking advantage of you.

537
00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:16,074
Everyone has their own difficulties.

538
00:29:16,595 --> 00:29:17,635
I don't think
you were taking advantage of me.

539
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:21,435
I've made up my mind now.

540
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:24,514
I must pass
all the imperial examinations

541
00:29:24,635 --> 00:29:25,915
and become an official in the court.

542
00:29:26,395 --> 00:29:28,595
I'll forge my way out to success

543
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:29,635
and never give up.

544
00:29:31,195 --> 00:29:32,195
Oh,

545
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:34,234
you're a provincial graduate.

546
00:29:36,714 --> 00:29:37,595
Impressive.

547
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:40,794
Tomorrow is the literary gathering
in Wenzheng Parlor.

548
00:29:40,955 --> 00:29:41,915
Will you attend it?

549
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:43,115
Literary gathering?

550
00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:45,675
No.

551
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:48,234
If you're going to sit
for the metropolitan examination,

552
00:29:48,514 --> 00:29:49,754
how could you not
go to Wenzheng Parlor?

553
00:29:52,314 --> 00:29:53,234
I...

554
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,554
I'm in trouble now,

555
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:57,155
and I can't go anywhere as I wish.

556
00:30:01,314 --> 00:30:02,994
Since the reopening
of female imperial exams,

557
00:30:03,355 --> 00:30:05,514
female provincial graduates
have been rarely seen.

558
00:30:05,835 --> 00:30:07,155
We are both women.

559
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:08,875
This is the only thing I could do

560
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,675
for a female provincial graduate

561
00:30:10,835 --> 00:30:11,915
I just met.

562
00:30:12,915 --> 00:30:15,034
Tomorrow, you may go to Wenzheng Parlor.

563
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:16,514
Use my name as your reference.

564
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:18,675
Someone will take you in.

565
00:30:20,155 --> 00:30:21,115
Thank you, Your Highness.

566
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:23,875
Are you all right now?

567
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,675
Yes, I'm all right.

568
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:27,195
Please take care, Your Highness.

569
00:30:36,155 --> 00:30:36,875
Young Lady.

570
00:30:37,155 --> 00:30:39,034
Her Highness wanted
to help you just now.

571
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:40,274
Why did you turn down her kindness?

572
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:43,034
Juli.

573
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:45,554
I'm a person with a conscience.

574
00:30:45,955 --> 00:30:47,074
Her Highness is a kind lady.

575
00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:49,274
How could I take advantage of her again?

576
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:52,074
Are we going to Wenzheng Parlor?

577
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:54,234
Wenzheng Parlor?

578
00:30:55,034 --> 00:30:55,635
Of course.

579
00:31:08,595 --> 00:31:09,355
Your Majesty.

580
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:11,115
I'll have the last shot.

581
00:31:11,355 --> 00:31:12,955
The imperial physician said
you can't drink so much.

582
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:15,635
You're not any better.

583
00:31:16,754 --> 00:31:17,514
Your Majesty.

584
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:23,595
Fine, I'll listen to you.

585
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:31,234
Jiao has invited a skilled physician
from Jiangnan,

586
00:31:31,595 --> 00:31:33,554
known as the Great Healer of Jiangnan.

587
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:35,675
She's so thoughtful.

588
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:38,355
She's always concerned
about my sickness.

589
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:41,474
And you, you always tend
to hide your true thoughts from others.

590
00:31:48,395 --> 00:31:49,474
Don't overthink.

591
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:53,155
My sickness has nothing to do with you.

592
00:31:54,794 --> 00:31:56,234
You're my closest brother.

593
00:31:56,635 --> 00:31:57,474
I'd never let you die

594
00:31:57,955 --> 00:31:59,714
without doing anything.

595
00:32:01,115 --> 00:32:02,395
If I could trade my death

596
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:05,635
for your healthy and long life

597
00:32:06,835 --> 00:32:08,794
and the peaceful nation,

598
00:32:09,675 --> 00:32:11,034
I'm willing to die.

599
00:32:11,155 --> 00:32:11,994
Ridiculous.

600
00:32:12,554 --> 00:32:13,595
Don't say ominous things.

601
00:32:16,714 --> 00:32:18,274
You must live on well.

602
00:32:19,074 --> 00:32:20,595
I need you.

603
00:32:24,955 --> 00:32:26,034
I understand.

604
00:32:30,474 --> 00:32:31,554
Lord Ding took away

605
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:32,915
the body of Yun Xiangyue.

606
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:34,034
Regarding Yuan Chengming,

607
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:35,474
they seem to have found something.

608
00:32:38,754 --> 00:32:42,195
Can't he idle his life away comfortably?

609
00:32:42,955 --> 00:32:45,034
Why did he get his hand dirty instead?

610
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:47,195
It's been five years.

611
00:32:48,195 --> 00:32:50,514
He did find something now.

612
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:54,234
He managed to dodge the attack
from Yun Xiangyue.

613
00:32:56,314 --> 00:32:57,554
This time,

614
00:32:59,554 --> 00:33:01,675
he won't be so lucky.

615
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:04,195
Yes.

616
00:33:30,395 --> 00:33:31,074
My Lord.

617
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:32,754
The letter...

618
00:33:40,514 --> 00:33:41,115
My Lord.

619
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:43,115
Should we let Butler Zhou

620
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:44,595
take Mu Zhuohua away?

621
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:46,314
She knows something
about Revival Powder.

622
00:33:46,835 --> 00:33:48,034
She can't leave the capital.

623
00:33:48,474 --> 00:33:49,395
If so,

624
00:33:50,034 --> 00:33:51,115
should we release Butler Zhou?

625
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:52,835
I still need him too.

626
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:57,155
Mu Zhuohua is going
to Wenzheng Parlor tomorrow.

627
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:02,115
What are the odds?

628
00:34:03,435 --> 00:34:04,155
Well,

629
00:34:05,274 --> 00:34:06,234
that just hits the spot.

630
00:34:16,285 --> 00:34:19,710
(Tiger)

631
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:25,910
(Wenzheng Parlor)

632
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,875
Literary prowess reigns supreme.

633
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,554
Share your thoughts on history's gleam.

634
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,900
(Wenzheng Parlor)

635
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,114
Wenzheng Parlor.

636
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:37,315
Juli, which character do you recognize?

637
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,275
It reminds me of Wenyun Restaurant
in Huaizhou.

638
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,034
Their sour fish is the best.

639
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:42,315
What a foodie.

640
00:34:42,554 --> 00:34:43,275
Let's go in.

641
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:56,875
Young Lady, it's crowded here.

642
00:34:57,594 --> 00:34:58,154
Let's go.

643
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:01,435
In Wenzheng Parlor, they value talents

644
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:02,395
over status.

645
00:35:02,755 --> 00:35:03,875
This place is swarmed
with talented people from everywhere

646
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,474
before and after
the metropolitan examination.

647
00:35:05,955 --> 00:35:08,154
Everyone tries to make a name
for themselves

648
00:35:08,154 --> 00:35:09,355
in the capital

649
00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:11,154
to gain favor from the dignitaries.

650
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:15,194
The imperial examination highly regards
candidates' performance in the exam.

651
00:35:15,395 --> 00:35:16,235
However,

652
00:35:16,235 --> 00:35:18,395
their fame of talent
is of great help too.

653
00:35:20,315 --> 00:35:20,915
Look.

654
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:27,114
Yong Lady, what's he doing?

655
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:28,634
The question will be revealed soon.

656
00:35:30,715 --> 00:35:32,594
There is a wine jar over there.

657
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:33,994
That's the question jar.

658
00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:35,915
The owner of Wenzheng Parlor

659
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:38,435
invited the most renowned
literary figures in the capital

660
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:39,514
to anonymously provide questions

661
00:35:40,034 --> 00:35:42,154
and they're placed inside this jar.

662
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:43,795
Every day at this hour,

663
00:35:44,114 --> 00:35:46,435
a question will be drawn from the jar

664
00:35:46,715 --> 00:35:48,315
for the debate.

665
00:35:48,634 --> 00:35:49,355
The winner

666
00:35:49,554 --> 00:35:52,114
can write their name
on the literary examination list.

667
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:52,835
Look up there.

668
00:35:52,955 --> 00:35:56,034
Sheng Jinghong, 5 strokes.

669
00:35:57,034 --> 00:35:57,955
It means

670
00:35:58,554 --> 00:35:59,795
he has won five rounds.

671
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:02,275
Five rounds aren't many, though.

672
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,594
Just one more round than the second.

673
00:36:05,074 --> 00:36:05,795
But

674
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:08,034
he just reached here six days ago.

675
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:08,955
What?

676
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:10,915
He's on a winning streak?

677
00:36:11,594 --> 00:36:12,034
Exactly.

678
00:36:12,955 --> 00:36:15,034
Ranging from poetry to principles
of philosophy and political strategies.

679
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:15,755
He's on a winning streak?

680
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:16,594
He never lost a round.

681
00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:17,634
- He's amazing.
- Rightfully so.

682
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,594
I guess

683
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:20,634
(Sheng Jinghong)
he'll top the rank this year.

684
00:36:28,514 --> 00:36:30,715
Raising tigers is a threat?

685
00:36:30,715 --> 00:36:33,275
I have no idea at all.

686
00:36:34,474 --> 00:36:35,034
Let's go.

687
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:38,674
Go ahead.

688
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:39,194
Excuse me.

689
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:42,674
I'd like to ask if Princess Roujia
reserved a table here.

690
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:43,955
Please tell me your surname.

691
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:45,554
Mu.

692
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:47,275
Oh, that's right.

693
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:49,835
Princess Roujia sent the message over
this morning.

694
00:36:50,114 --> 00:36:51,315
But most of the chambers
are taken earlier

695
00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:52,795
since the metropolitan examination
is around the corner.

696
00:36:53,034 --> 00:36:54,074
The storekeeper

697
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:55,154
has reserved a table
on the second balcony.

698
00:36:55,835 --> 00:36:57,395
That's good enough.

699
00:36:58,034 --> 00:36:59,634
Ms. Mu, please come with me.

700
00:37:00,355 --> 00:37:01,154
- This way.
- Let's go.

701
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:03,594
They've got everything ready. Great.

702
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:05,835
This way.

703
00:37:06,275 --> 00:37:08,235
- Ms. Mu, this is your table.
- Thank you.

704
00:37:08,235 --> 00:37:08,674
Sure.

705
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,760
(Raising Tigers Is a Threat)

706
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:22,194
Young Lady.

707
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:28,355
Young Lady.

708
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:29,835
Princess Roujia

709
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:31,554
is so reliable.

710
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:33,074
Certainly.

711
00:37:33,074 --> 00:37:35,275
That's why many people revere her.

712
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:36,275
There's zero negative word of mouth

713
00:37:36,474 --> 00:37:37,955
about her in this country.

714
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:42,154
By the way, Young Lady,

715
00:37:42,435 --> 00:37:44,194
you mentioned
gaining fame of talent here.

716
00:37:44,235 --> 00:37:45,435
Why are we sitting here?

717
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:47,355
You see,

718
00:37:48,154 --> 00:37:49,594
this question

719
00:37:50,194 --> 00:37:51,835
is a dangerous one.

720
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:55,674
Why is raising a tiger

721
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:57,114
dangerous?

722
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,994
That's the point, the tiger.

723
00:38:10,114 --> 00:38:10,915
Uncle.

724
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:13,315
Why did you put yourself
as the topic of the debate?

725
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:15,514
Why not?

726
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:17,875
Any problem with that?

727
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:21,634
I don't like people calling you a tiger.

728
00:38:23,154 --> 00:38:24,114
What should they call me, then?

729
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:25,514
A dog?

730
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,395
No, that won't do.

731
00:38:31,114 --> 00:38:33,315
A mighty tiger sounds much better.

732
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:36,554
But

733
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,114
those who peg you as a tiger,

734
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,315
why are they so eager to start
the internal royal strife?

735
00:38:45,915 --> 00:38:47,194
Can't we

736
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:48,915
have a common and harmonious

737
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:49,955
family relationship?

738
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:54,114
She said the perpetrator

739
00:38:54,315 --> 00:38:55,634
must be very familiar
with your sickness.

740
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,795
There are not many

741
00:38:59,514 --> 00:39:00,395
who know your condition well.

742
00:39:01,315 --> 00:39:02,034
It's hard.

743
00:39:02,355 --> 00:39:03,114
How so?

744
00:39:04,154 --> 00:39:05,755
I treat you wholeheartedly, Uncle.

745
00:39:05,835 --> 00:39:07,435
Have you forgotten
about your two brothers?

746
00:39:10,554 --> 00:39:12,634
Let's hear what others say about this.

747
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:13,915
All right.

748
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:18,034
Raising tigers is a threat.

749
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:21,915
The point is,

750
00:39:22,435 --> 00:39:24,674
who raises the tiger?

751
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:28,275
His Majesty

752
00:39:29,355 --> 00:39:30,674
or the three princes?

753
00:39:32,355 --> 00:39:33,474
This question seems simple,

754
00:39:34,114 --> 00:39:35,235
but with a profound meaning behind it.

755
00:39:35,835 --> 00:39:39,235
In fact, it's a test for the people.

756
00:39:40,474 --> 00:39:41,235
Young Lady.

757
00:39:41,514 --> 00:39:43,395
What has it got to do

758
00:39:43,395 --> 00:39:44,355
with His Majesty and the three princes?

759
00:39:45,755 --> 00:39:47,435
Because this tiger

760
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:50,395
is referring to Lord Ding, obviously.

761
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:52,755
That nefarious demon?

762
00:39:54,315 --> 00:39:55,674
He's a nefarious demon
to Northern Liang

763
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:57,674
and the god of war to the Southern Chen.

764
00:39:58,395 --> 00:39:59,835
Be that as it may,

765
00:40:00,634 --> 00:40:01,915
some might think

766
00:40:02,154 --> 00:40:04,275
his meritorious reputation
has surpassed the Emperor.

767
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:08,875
Lord Ding is scary.

768
00:40:09,835 --> 00:40:10,634
He's like a tiger.

769
00:40:11,315 --> 00:40:12,674
And worst, a giant tiger.
