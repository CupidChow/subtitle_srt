(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 36=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,129
Quit peeking!

21
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:00,769
Ow!

22
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,049
Serve you right!

23
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:03,290
Look at Prince Regent!

24
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:04,329
I'm telling you!

25
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:05,650
If I hadn't married you,

26
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,450
I could have been an official.

27
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:09,170
Right. Right.

28
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:09,929
Yes, you are right.

29
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,890
Go back and cook!

30
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,609
Do you hear me?

31
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:13,410
Yes. Yes.

32
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,570
Stop right there.

33
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:24,850
I can cook for you, too.

34
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,730
After seeing your dumplings,

35
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,410
I highly doubt you can cook.

36
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,049
Come.

37
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,410
Look at the festive curtains

38
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:49,130
and the red lanterns.

39
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:52,089
You were busy for the past few days

40
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:53,690
to set them up?

41
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,730
Why, Official Mu?

42
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,369
Do you want to get married?

43
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:03,929
Me? No!

44
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:06,489
I just thought that this empty courtyard

45
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:07,890
could use some decoration.

46
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,250
But Juli

47
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,609
made it look this festive.

48
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,209
I like it.

49
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:16,850
Festivity means happiness.

50
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,929
It's a nice view.

51
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:30,970
Is this

52
00:03:31,529 --> 00:03:32,369
for me?

53
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,929
Think of it as a betrothal token.

54
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:39,489
It might look a bit crude, though.

55
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,049
I like it.

56
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,130
You're wearing it now?

57
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,769
No!

58
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,970
It's not elegant enough

59
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,250
for a man of your status.

60
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,049
I don't mind it.

61
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:58,929
I do.

62
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:00,410
Everyone knows

63
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,209
our relationship now.

64
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:03,890
It's embarrassing

65
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,850
to let everyone see

66
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,970
how bad my handicraft is.

67
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,289
Yummy!

68
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,010
Have a drumstick,

69
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,930
Zhimo.

70
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,209
You didn't eat at all.

71
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,089
This prawn is good, too.

72
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,089
Have some.

73
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,890
It's all good food here.

74
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:44,849
Why aren't you eating?

75
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,329
Maybe he doesn't want to dirty his robe.

76
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,890
Is it that expensive?

77
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,010
Yes.

78
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:53,930
Why don't you frame it and worship it?

79
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,409
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

80
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:01,649
Young Lady once wanted to sew
His Lordship a robe.

81
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,690
But she is so bad at sewing

82
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,649
that a bolt of fabric

83
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:05,490
was turned

84
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,729
into a piece of cloth.

85
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,329
In the end, she settled with a purse.

86
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,329
Eat up.

87
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:17,010
Zhijian, why aren't you eating?

88
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,690
I am.

89
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:22,729
These ducks look succulent.
I shall roast them.

90
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,849
No! These are the betrothal ducks
Young Lady gives to His Lordship.

91
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:26,010
You can't roast them!

92
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,490
Calm down.

93
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,769
Get back here!

94
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:32,529
Get back here!

95
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,769
If I knew you meant to marry me,

96
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,690
I wouldn't have been this humble
in front of others.

97
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:01,529
Why, Lord Ding?

98
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,010
Do you regret it now?

99
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,169
You know my heart belongs to you.

100
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,450
Why would I regret it?

101
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:19,490
When did it happen?

102
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,010
I am caught unaware.

103
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,409
Now,

104
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:35,409
everyone in the capital knows
we're together.

105
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,849
Is that not enough?

106
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,849

His Majesty?

145
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,330
(Wende Hall)
Greetings, Your Majesty.

146
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:57,409
Rise.

147
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,809
How may I help you, Your Majesty?

148
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:07,090
I summoned you in regard

149
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:10,090
to certain queries I have

150
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,890
concerning the Ministry of Revenue.

151
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:19,850
Your Majesty,

152
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,289
is there a problem with the ledger?

153
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:27,569
Take a seat.

154
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:30,890
I dare not.

155
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:32,569
We'll speak when you're seated.

159
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:06,090
Why hasn't Official Mu come back?

160
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,850
She was summoned by His Majesty

161
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,210
and has not returned.

162
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:13,769
She hasn't returned yet?

163
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,890
Yes.

164
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:16,210
It's been four hours now.

165
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,649
Your Majesty,

166
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:40,330
it is getting late.

167
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:43,289
Do you still have queries

168
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,250
regarding...

169
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,649
Yes, it is late.

170
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,210
It's time to eat.

171
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,449
Thank you so much, Official Mu.

172
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,569
Why don't you have dinner here
before leaving?

173
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,449
Official Mu will have dinner with me.

174
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:02,649
Tell the Imperial Kitchen

175
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,569
to prepare more Huaizhou specialties.

176
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,409
Noted.

177
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,169
Your Majesty,

178
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,250
I'm afraid this is inappropriate.

179
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,529
How so?

180
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,649
I am hungry.

181
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,210
After dinner,

182
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:17,929
we can continue the discussion.

183
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:19,610
But I...

184
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,370
Your Majesty,

185
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,850
Prince Regent demands an audience.

186
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:23,250
Prince Regent?

187
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,130
Tell him I'm occupied.

188
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,049
I will see him later.

189
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

190
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:45,449
My Lord,

191
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:47,250
are you here to pick me up?

192
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,049
I heard

193
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:52,890
that His Majesty kept you in Wende Hall
for four hours.

194
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,130
He had some queries

195
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,169
about the ledger.

196
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:02,330
You are not jealous, are you?

197
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:05,970
Of course not.

198
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,210
However,

199
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,210
isn't it unfair to make you work
till late?

200
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:16,090
His Majesty saw
that it was around dinnertime,

201
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,010
so he asked me to stay for dinner.

202
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,769
You're uncharacteristically petty today.

203
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,890
Isn't it our job

204
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,929
as ministers

205
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:26,449
to help His Majesty?

206
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,370
"Petty"?

207
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:33,929
How am I petty?

208
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,809
You are jealous.

209
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,289
Just admit it.

210
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,569
They say a hero is often undone
by a belle.

211
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,330
Even

212
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:01,730
a man of integrity like my uncle

213
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,890
is no exception.

214
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,409
The seed has been sowed.

215
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,210
We can only wait

216
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,769
till

217
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,529
His Majesty and my uncle become enemies.

218
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:14,929
Wise strategy, Your Highness.

219
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:22,449
You wish to speak?

220
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:25,929
Your Highness,

221
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:29,370
it has been days
since Official Shen's last visit.

222
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,569
Indeed.

00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,529
Are you still mad?

225
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:24,210
There, there.

226
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,769
Don't be mad now.

227
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,649
Jinghong.

228
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,569
I might have a family,

229
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,289
but I am not the favorite.

and yet, he turned you down.

281
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:03,489
Your Highness?

282
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,890
Unlike others, I still have use

283
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:09,449
of Shen Jinghong.

284
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,969
What makes Official Shen so special?

285
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:17,169
Indeed. What's so special about him?

286
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:26,370
(Xuanzheng Hall)

287
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,449
Minister of Personnel

288
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:30,290
is an important position.

289
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,209
Uncle, your remark

290
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,649
might be too judgmental.

291
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,810
Your Majesty,

292
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:38,929
while Shen Jinghong is a director
in the Ministry of Personnel,

293
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,409
his experience and capability

294
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,209
do not suffice to fit
the role of a minister.

295
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,969
I believe

296
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,810
the Vice Minister of Rites

297
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,890
is a better candidate

298
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:51,489
than Official Shen

299
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:55,249
due to his stable personality
and vast experience.

300
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,610
Lu Yao is a veteran,

301
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,810
but he is advanced in age.

302
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,890
He might not have the stamina
for the role.

303
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,649
Besides, the older generation

304
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,449
is often set in their ways.

305
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,530
We need new blood and new ideas.

306
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:14,050
Your Majesty, even a fine steed

307
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:16,290
will need a guide
to tell it where to gallop.

308
00:19:16,729 --> 00:19:19,050
Official Shen is indeed promising,

309
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:21,810
but his young age

310
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:23,850
means that he lacks patience.

311
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,249
He needs more polishing

312
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,330
to assume the role.

313
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:29,969
Besides,

314
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,489
I heard that Official Shen frequents

315
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,729
the Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

316
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,810
An indulgent individual

317
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,850
cannot be a wise minister.

318
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,850
Don't worry, Your Highness.

319
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:46,810
Official Shen will surely be

320
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,850
the Minister of Personnel.

321
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:51,890
No.

322
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,689
I want all of you
to back Prince Regent's suggestion

323
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:56,969
and support Vice Minister Lu.

324
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,249
Your Highness.

325
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,249
Why?

326
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,890
I want His Majesty to see

327
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:10,050
the true color of Prince Regent.

328
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:12,290
To protect him.

329
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,050
Your Majesty,

330
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,929
I agree with Prince Regent.

331
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,009
Vice Minister Lu

332
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:27,729
is a better candidate
than Official Shen.

333
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:32,969
I concur.

334
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:35,009
None can deny Official Shen's talent.

335
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:36,810
But he is too young

336
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:38,810
to lead.

337
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,890
I concur.

338
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,449
If that is your collective wish,

339
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:59,649
we shall proceed
as Prince Regent suggested.

340
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,130
Wise choice, Your Majesty.

341
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:08,209
Prince Regent, you lost your composure
in the imperial court.

342
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:10,570
Your salary will be withheld
for three years.

343
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,130
May this serve as your warning.

344
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,409
Your Majesty,

345
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,850
may I know when I misbehave?

346
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,009
When I say you
committed contempt of court,

347
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:21,929
you committed it.

348
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,009
Adjourn.

349
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,050
Court adjourned.

350
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,570
(Jishan Hall)

351
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,729
He was chastised

352
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,689
in front of everyone?

353
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:07,729
Yes,

354
00:22:07,969 --> 00:22:10,050
according to the messenger.

355
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:14,489
First, His Majesty made him kneel
before the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

356
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:16,209
Then, he chastised him in public.

357
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:18,969
His Majesty is trying to shun Lord Ding.

358
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:23,050
I knew it.

359
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:25,810
His Majesty is quick-tempered.

360
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:27,770
He doesn't have what it takes
to be a ruler.

361
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:30,969
But Uncle didn't see through that.

362
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,290
He only has himself to blame.

363
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,770
It won't change a thing anyway.

364
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,729
It is obvious that His Majesty
is fond of Mu Zhuohua.

365
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,409
Unless Prince Regent is willing
to give her away,

366
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:44,050
otherwise, His Majesty
and Prince Regent are bound to fight.

367
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,850
That's why they say

368
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:48,530
a hero is often undone by a belle.

369
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:53,169
Well, Your Highness,

370
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,370
if I may speak frankly...

371
00:22:55,969 --> 00:22:56,969
Go ahead.

372
00:22:57,969 --> 00:23:00,610
Princess Jing'an has been trying
to see Official Shen.

373
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,770
Official Shen has turned her down
many times,

374
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,850
but she won't give up.

375
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:08,449
Where is he nowadays?

376
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,249
Speak.

377
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:18,370
Official Shen is often seen drinking

378
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:21,729
in Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

379
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,169
He stays there until late.

380
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,218
(Xiaoqin Pleasure House)

381
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:29,169
Official Shen.

382
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:31,130
The chamber that you want

383
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,689
has been taken.

384
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:33,009
And the new courtesan...

385
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:33,969
Why hasn't he arrived?

386
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,290
Yes, Your Highness.

387
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,409
Someone took her, too.

388
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:39,050
Perhaps I can show you
to another chamber?

389
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,009
Let me check.

390
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,850
Oh, we've been waiting for you!

391
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:45,969
Come.

392
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:48,249
Your Highness.

393
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,169
He is the smartest of us all.

394
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,370
He outwits all of us.

395
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,290
Now, now. You will hurt me deeply

396
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:58,290
if you toss me away for him.

397
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,009
Stop talking nonsense.

398
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:03,449
This is Official Shen, a director
in the Ministry of Personnel.

399
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:07,929
Try this, Your Highness.

400
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,689
Shouldn't you feed me?

401
00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:17,009
That face of yours

402
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:18,610
shouldn't be kept here.

403
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:21,570
Why don't you stay in my residence

404
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,090
so that I can pamper you properly?

405
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:28,290
Thank you so much, Your Highness.

406
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:33,969
Come, Your Highness.

407
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:35,610
Drink up.

408
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,570
You're in a good mood today,
Your Highness.

409
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,169
I think I shouldn't

410
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,090
spoil it.

411
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:53,290
Official Shen?

412
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:55,610
Official Shen, hear me out.

413
00:24:57,489 --> 00:24:58,449
Official Shen.

414
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,890
Official Shen.

415
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,929
I'll get you another chamber.

416
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:02,449
All right, Official Shen?

417
00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:03,890
Your Highness, forget about him.

418
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:05,169
Let's have fun.

419
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:05,929
Bugger off.

420
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:08,290
Your Highness, drink with me.

421
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:09,810
I said, bugger off!

422
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:12,570
Let's go.

423
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:27,032
(Shen's Residence)

424
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,090
Southern Chen's liquor is no fun.

425
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,130
Try Northern Liang's.

426
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:37,489
It hits much harder.

427
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,929
Perfect for sorrows.

428
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,689
Why are you here?

429
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,050
I'm here to drink with you.

430
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,689
Drinking alone is boring.

431
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,689
I'll let you know

432
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:50,249
that I

433
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,169
have a high tolerance for alcohol.

434
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:04,009
Ew! You call this liquor?

435
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,050
What is this?

436
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,009
Water?

437
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:07,770
It doesn't have any taste.

438
00:26:08,449 --> 00:26:10,290
But it hits late and hard.

439
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,489
You can certainly hold your liquor!

440
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,370
To love is painful.

441
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,209
To be denied is also painful.

442
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:13,290
I want her love,

443
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:16,489
but she told me that she had long
forsaken love.

444
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:26,330
Little does she know

445
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:32,530
that I can love no one anymore.

446
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,570
I know.

447
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:45,770
But women in Northern Liang
are a stubborn lot.

448
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,929
Once we fall in love with someone,

449
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,290
we fight for it.

450
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,610
Even if our hearts
might be shattered in the end,

451
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,449
it's better than a life of regret.

452
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,929
You know, I quite envy

453
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:16,290
Official Mu and Prince Regent.

454
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,409
They could profess their mutual love

455
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,649
in front of everyone.

456
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:23,850
I respect that.

457
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,370
I know why you're drinking alone.

458
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,330
Hear me out.

459
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,050
Roujia

460
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,770
might look

461
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:32,929
innocent and harmless,

462
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,209
but deep down,

463
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:37,489
she's ruthless.

464
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,610
If I were you,

465
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:42,209
I would stay very, very
far away from her.

466
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:45,330
You're drunk.

467
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,290
No, I'm not.

468
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:52,649
During the war at Juma River,

469
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:57,890
30,000 soldiers from Southern Chen

470
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,370
died there.

471
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,249
Prince Regent almost lost his life, too.

472
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,290
She killed them.

473
00:30:06,649 --> 00:30:08,209
Roujia did.

474
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:19,649
What?

475
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:22,130
Ask Jing if you want.

476
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,729
She

477
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:25,969
colluded with my third brother

478
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:28,729
and killed those men.

479
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:31,370
So stay away from her!

480
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:35,169
She did it.

481
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,090
You didn't hear this from me.

482
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:44,009
Bye.

483
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:04,814
(A bright moon, a mesmerizing beauty.
Her alluring figure, how do I forget her?)

484
00:32:16,744 --> 00:32:18,130
(Wende Hall)

485
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,130
Proceed as suggested in the memorandum.

486
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,929
If those noble families

487
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,050
still wish to hinder

488
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,929
the implementation
of the Talent Appreciation System,

489
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:30,530
let the Court of Judicial Review

490
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,249
speak with them.

491
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,130
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

492
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:37,209
Official Mu,

493
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,090
you may go now.

494
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:42,009
By your leave.

495
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,649
Jinghong.

496
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,290
Even if it's wrong,

497
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,249
will you vie for someone who's taken?

498
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,209
You ask the wrong person here,
Your Majesty.

499
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,449
I'm afraid I'm also

500
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,209
in the same dilemma.

501
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:16,770
Shen.

502
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,850
You look exhausted.

503
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:25,969
I am fine.

504
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,449
You should

505
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,449
take care of yourself.

506
00:33:34,662 --> 00:33:36,929
(Wende Hall)

507
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:40,249
Southern Chen and Northern Liang
have forged an amicable bond.

508
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:41,649
We have put down arms.

509
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:43,610
Why is conscription still necessary?

510
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,009
It is but another redundant expenditure

511
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:47,969
on our treasury.

512
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:49,449
I

513
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:51,290
do not approve the funding.

514
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:54,810
Your Majesty, I beg to differ.

515
00:33:55,449 --> 00:33:57,489
Northern Liang is known
for their ambition.

516
00:33:57,689 --> 00:34:01,409
A momentary peace doesn't mean
we can put our guard down.

517
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,850
We shall be prepared
for all eventualities.

518
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,890
As the ruler,

519
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,770
you should look at the bigger picture

520
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,810
and plan for the future.

521
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,409
Are you lecturing me
on how to rule my nation?

522
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,690
Of course not.

523
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,290
But I have fought
against Northern Liang for years.

524
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,009
I daresay none here

525
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,370
knows their duplicitous nature
more than I do.

526
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,409
Conscription
and increasing the military budget

527
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,609
are our priorities now.

528
00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:35,210
I fought in war before, too.

529
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,009
And I have killed
some Northern Liang scums.

530
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,330
I know very well

531
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,250
how cunning they can be.

532
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,850
But peace has been restored now.

533
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:47,890
I want to focus on societal welfare.

534
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:50,370
Your Majesty,

535
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,529
charitable policies are welcome,

536
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,770
but the Ministry of Revenue
can handle them.

537
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,489
This does not clash with my suggestion.

538
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,170
I firmly believe that we should retain

539
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,409
the current military policies.

540
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,569
Besides,

541
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:07,850
conscription is a tradition
in Southern Chen.

542
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:13,089
Are you trying to defy

543
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,370
our ancestors' wishes?

544
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:17,049
Uncle, are you accusing me

545
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,650
of forgetting my ancestral teachings?

546
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:21,969
Of course not.

547
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:24,089
But you implied it!

548
00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:34,449
Since you love quoting our ancestors,

549
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,409
head back

550
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,210
and copy the imperial genealogy chart

551
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,529
a thousand times.

552
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,089
Before that,

553
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,569
you are not allowed to attend the court.

554
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,770
If that is your wish, Your Majesty,

555
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:51,170
I shall comply.

556
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:56,730
However, please think about my advice.

557
00:35:58,609 --> 00:35:59,370
Uncle.

558
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,929
You are dismissed.

559
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,210
By your leave.
