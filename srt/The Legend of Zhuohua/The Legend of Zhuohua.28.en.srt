=The Legend of Zhuohua=

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 28=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,310
(Lord Ding's Residence)

21
00:02:19,585 --> 00:02:21,466
Uncle, are you here
to pass judgment on me?

22
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:24,186
Is it going to be decapitation

23
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:26,506
or death by a thousand cuts?

24
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,626
The reason I put you under house arrest

25
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:36,746
instead of throwing you into the dungeon

26
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:39,906
is to prevent anyone

27
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:42,026
from resorting to torture
on both of you.

28
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:46,585
It seems

29
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:48,466
both of you

30
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:51,786
haven't taken good care
of yourselves either.

31
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:58,026
Since you've decided to be biased,

32
00:02:58,306 --> 00:02:59,705
why pretend to be virtuous here?

33
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:03,105
Yu has already said
he didn't forge the imperial edict.

34
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:04,825
Yet, you insist on putting the blame

35
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:05,585
on him.

36
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:08,066
Second Prince.

37
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:12,026
Deep inside, you know

38
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:16,226
that the heir favored by your father

39
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:19,585
had never been you.

40
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,145
You were

41
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:25,786
just resentful.

42
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:30,265
If Father had truly decided early on,

43
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,545
why didn't he name his heir before?

44
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:37,946
First Prince has a sincere heart.

45
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:41,346
He may possess
the virtues of a nobleman.

46
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:43,265
But he tends to be impulsive.

47
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,226
It's a major flaw for a ruler.

48
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:49,825
Your father

49
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:52,906
took his time naming an heir

50
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:55,066
because

51
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:58,066
he wanted to give him
more time to mature.

52
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:02,906
As for you,

53
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:06,346
you lack gratitude and compassion.

54
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,626
If you were to ascend the throne,

55
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:13,545
would you spare First Prince

56
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:15,506
and let him live?

57
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:19,145
Also,

58
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:22,385
you shouldn't disregard sibling bonds

59
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:25,426
for your own ambitions.

60
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:30,106
You even used your younger brother
from the same mother

61
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:32,585
to your advantage.

62
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:36,426
All this while,

63
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:38,705
you've been trying

64
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:39,825
to stir conflicts

65
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:41,585
between First Prince and Third Prince

66
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:44,345
so that his impulsive behavior

67
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:47,225
would make your courteous
and humble demeanor stand out.

68
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:48,746
And this is what

69
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:52,626
your father didn't want to see the most.

70
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:58,666
What does this have to do with Yu?

71
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,465
I did all these willingly.

72
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:18,585
Uncle,

73
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,905
you say I lack compassion and gratitude.

74
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:24,385
But when did Liu Chen

75
00:05:24,785 --> 00:05:26,585
treat us as siblings?

76
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:30,106
You and Father

77
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:32,585
only cared about Liu Chen

78
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:33,946
and tolerated him in every way!

79
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:36,465
But what about me?

80
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:39,546
No matter how hard I tried,

81
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:42,426
I could never gain your approval.

82
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,905
So I could only fight for it myself.

83
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:52,265
Had you shown even a bit of care for me,

84
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:56,106
it wouldn't have come to this.

85
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,145
I

86
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:09,225
didn't fulfill my duty as an uncle.

87
00:06:14,145 --> 00:06:15,506
I have

88
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:18,946
let both of you down.

89
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:25,946
After this,

90
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,345
both of you shall return to your fiefs

91
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:34,666
and live in peace.

92
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:46,666
Ju,

93
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:51,106
I...

94
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:57,986
can't fulfill what you entrusted to me.

95
00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:07,145
My Lord.

96
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:19,426
Imperial Physician Zhao,

97
00:07:20,426 --> 00:07:21,585
how is His Lordship?

98
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:26,265
My Lord,

99
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:28,746
I am incompetent.

100
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:30,866
Just tell me.

101
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:35,426
Your pulse indicates
you're at the end of your strength

102
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:38,225
with no hope of recovery.

103
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:40,986
That's impossible.

104
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:42,506
Imperial Physician Zhao,

105
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:43,866
you must have diagnosed it wrong.

106
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:45,546
Please check His Lordship again.

107
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:49,345
I wish I had diagnosed it wrong.

108
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:53,746
Please don't make it difficult
for Imperial Physician Zhao.

109
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:56,265
My Lord,
Official Mu requests an audience.

110
00:07:59,066 --> 00:07:59,666
That's right.

111
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:01,265
We can ask Official Mu
to check on His Lordship.

112
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:02,626
She's Fu Shengru's granddaughter.

113
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:03,585
Perhaps she has some solution.

114
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:04,746
Come back here.

115
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:09,825
She must never know

116
00:08:11,106 --> 00:08:12,746
about this.

117
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:13,946
But, My Lord...

118
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:15,345
That's enough.

119
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:18,506
You can leave now.

120
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:21,426
Remember

121
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:25,145
not to let her know.

122
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:27,345
Yes, My Lord.

123
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:28,905
Yes, My Lord.

124
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:29,905
Yes, My Lord.

125
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:36,786
(My Lord,)

126
00:08:37,505 --> 00:08:38,505
how are you feeling now?

127
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:40,105
I'm fine.

128
00:08:43,906 --> 00:08:44,745
Are you sure?

129
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:46,946
Yes.

130
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,505
Why?

131
00:08:50,585 --> 00:08:51,946
Are you hoping for something
to be wrong with me?

132
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:53,745
Nonsense.

133
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,345
Of course not.

134
00:09:10,786 --> 00:09:12,306
Why are you looking at me like that?

135
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:14,585
Is it

136
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:16,505
because I look too attractive?

137
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:19,186
Attractive, indeed.

138
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:33,625
It's already late.

139
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:38,186
You have to attend
the morning assembly tomorrow.

140
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:40,865
Go back and rest early.

141
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:43,026
My Lord,

142
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,225
I want to stay with you a bit longer.

143
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,026
No need.

144
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,985
I also want to rest.

145
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:54,386
Go home.

146
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,266
My Lord,

147
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:18,266
rest well.

148
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:20,825
I'll leave first.

149
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:23,865
Just go home.

150
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:58,465
(Why be greedy?)

151
00:10:59,105 --> 00:10:59,985
(Leaving)

152
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,105
(is the best choice.)

153
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:02,760
(Land Deed)

154
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:07,985
(Grantor, Liu Yan)

155
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:08,745
My Lord,

156
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:12,146
are you really leaving?

157
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:16,745
You're taking Zhijian
and Zhimo with you.

158
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:17,505
Why...

159
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,546
Why aren't you taking me?

160
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:21,705
Please take me with you.

161
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:22,745
Even if...

162
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,026
Let me keep you company
for a little longer.

163
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:32,666
Mr. Zhang,

164
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:37,146
I've always considered you as my elder.

165
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,026
Over the years,

166
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,831
you've been managing everything
at Lord Ding's Residence.

167
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,745
I had originally planned

168
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:49,745
to take care of you until old age.

169
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:52,825
It's just a pity

170
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:55,666
that my days are numbered.

171
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:03,666
This residence in the suburbs

172
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:06,546
may not be huge.

173
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,026
But it's comfortable.

174
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:11,066
Those servants

175
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:13,426
have all been carefully selected.

176
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:17,105
With them looking after you
in the future,

177
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,705
I'll be at ease.

178
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:20,666
My Lord,

179
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:24,105
you were clearly getting better.

180
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:26,471
Why did it relapse?

181
00:13:27,585 --> 00:13:28,825
You've worked hard for the country

182
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:30,585
and the people.

183
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:32,946
You haven't done anything dishonest.

184
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:35,546
How could Heaven be this cruel?

185
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,625
Is everything packed?

186
00:13:54,705 --> 00:13:56,225
After the late Emperor's body

187
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:57,865
is laid to rest in the imperial tomb,

188
00:13:57,865 --> 00:13:58,946
we will depart.

189
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:01,306
My Lord,

190
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:05,345
are you really not planning
to tell Official Mu?

191
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,266
With her intelligence,

192
00:14:09,786 --> 00:14:10,666
she will eventually find out.

193
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:13,186
When that happens,
she will still be sad.

194
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,585
As your subordinates, we've witnessed

195
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,266
how you've been supporting each other
along the way.

196
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:22,585
She isn't someone
who can't handle hardships.

197
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:26,465
Isn't it better to have her company

198
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:29,345
on your final journey?

199
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,946
It's better

200
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,505
this way.

201
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,546
I'll go and get her now.

202
00:14:35,745 --> 00:14:36,505
Come back here.

203
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:40,225
But, My Lord...

204
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,066
It's better to hate someone

205
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:58,105
than to miss someone.

206
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:03,786
Chen has just ascended the throne.

207
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,786
Various factions in the capital are
having subtle shifts in power dynamics.

208
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:13,266
They're lying low for now

209
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:17,105
because I am still intimidating.

210
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,225
If I were to die in the capital,

211
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:23,705
the city would likely plunge into chaos.

212
00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:26,026
At that time,

213
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:28,786
Chen's path would be difficult as well.

214
00:15:29,906 --> 00:15:30,825
So,

215
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,306
it's better to keep this matter hidden

216
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:38,585
and buy more time for Chen.

217
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:46,465
I've already transferred all my assets

218
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:48,585
to Zhuohua's name.

219
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:52,786
When the time is right,

220
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:55,306
give her this letter.

221
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:12,386
My Lord,

222
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,186
Official Mu is waiting for you
in the study.

223
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:17,546
She has come several times.

224
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:18,946
But she didn't get to meet you.

225
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:20,666
Do you want to...

226
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:22,225
see her?

227
00:16:27,577 --> 00:16:33,110

00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:40,835

239
00:18:04,426 --> 00:18:05,106
Zhijian,

240
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:07,025
has His Lordship returned?

241
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,426
His Lordship has been busy
with official matters lately.

242
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:13,146
It's already this late.

243
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:14,586
He probably won't be back.

244
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,106
I haven't seen him in a long time.

245
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:24,505
Even in the Department of State Affairs,

246
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,386
I can never find him.

247
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,010
(Ciming Hall)

248
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:47,186
Grandmother,

249
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:50,346
I'm here to take care of you again.

250
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:56,666
She's already paralyzed.

251
00:18:57,225 --> 00:18:58,146
But still so sharp-tongued.

252
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:01,106
Your Highness, calm down.

253
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:02,745
Now,

254
00:19:03,065 --> 00:19:05,426
she's just a crazy old woman.

255
00:19:05,785 --> 00:19:07,305
She's not worth dirtying your hands.

256
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:11,545
I have many ways

257
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:14,106
to make her wish she could just die.

258
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:20,826
You're always considerate of me.

259
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:23,106
I'm truly grateful.

260
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:29,545
Your mother and I went way back.

261
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:32,785
Back then, I promised her

262
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,225
to take care of you.

263
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:37,785
Everything I do for you

264
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:39,705
is done willingly.

265
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:42,826
Your Highness, no need to mind it.

266
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,866
Your Highness,
is something troubling you?

267
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,106
You're not aware of this.

268
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:57,906
About falsifying the imperial edict,

269
00:19:58,946 --> 00:20:00,785
it has never been kept hidden
from Uncle's knowledge.

270
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:04,305
From what I know,

271
00:20:04,906 --> 00:20:06,505
he's already investigating it.

272
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:09,386
If this matter is exposed,

273
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:11,225
I fear

274
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,505
it could result
in irreversible disaster.

275
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,946
If I'm no longer here,

276
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:29,426
I'll entrust Jishan Hall to you.

277
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:44,906
Your Highness, don't worry.

278
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:49,346
This matter will not implicate you
in any way.

279
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:06,225
Farewell, Your Highness.

280
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:31,866
(When Ju was alive,)

281
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:34,305
he wished for a simple burial

282
00:21:35,705 --> 00:21:37,186
without a tomb.

283
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:39,426
He would like to make the mountain
his resting place.

284
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:44,866
Hope he will like these green hills.

285
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,666
The Chief Eunuch took his own life
this morning.

286
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,346
He left behind a letter,

287
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:53,065
wanting to accompany Father.

288
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:55,985
Such a loyal bond
between a master and a servant.

289
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,265
I've ordered someone

290
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:01,392
to build a new grave

291
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:03,106
near Father's mausoleum.

292
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:05,946
So he can remain by Father's side.

293
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:10,505
You can say
this fulfills his final wish.

294
00:22:15,386 --> 00:22:16,025
Uncle,

295
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,745
are you unwell?

296
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:23,906
Just a bit tired, that's all.

297
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:31,745
You've been working hard lately, Uncle.

298
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:35,866
Chen,

299
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:39,666
now that you've ascended the throne,

300
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:42,946
there's a decision
I want to share with you.

301
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:50,866
(My Lord,)

302
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:52,666
I finally found you

303
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:54,186
after searching for so long.

304
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,785
I've been worried sick

305
00:22:57,186 --> 00:22:58,505
for not being able to see you.

306
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,866
I've been busy
with national matters lately.

307
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:04,305
I'm sorry to have made you worry.

308
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:06,025
Are you listening to yourself?

309
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:07,426
I'm your physician, after all.

310
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:08,906
Who should I worry if not you?

311
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:10,426
So,

312
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:12,146
you must follow the physician's advice.

313
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:13,505
Even if you're busy,

314
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,305
you must take care of your health.

315
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:16,386
Understood?

316
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:23,545
You should take care of your health.

317
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:28,946
When it comes to dealing
with official matters,

318
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:31,465
I'm not the only one
who skips sleep and meals.

319
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:35,545
You must take better care of yourself
in the future.

320
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:39,025
Of course.

321
00:23:39,225 --> 00:23:40,346
I'm a physician.

322
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:41,785
How could I not know the importance
of maintaining good health?

323
00:23:43,426 --> 00:23:44,146
My Lord,

324
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:47,225
why are you suddenly telling me this?

325
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,225
No reason.

326
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:56,866
I'm just worried you're too eager
for progress.

327
00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:00,545
If your health deteriorates,

328
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,346
you won't be able to achieve anything.

329
00:24:05,785 --> 00:24:06,946
That makes sense.

330
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,826
I should cherish my life more.

331
00:24:10,386 --> 00:24:11,946
But striving for progress
is important too.

332
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:13,545
If I don't strive,

333
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:16,065
I'll become a stagnant figure
in the court.

334
00:24:17,465 --> 00:24:18,745
I'm not stopping you from striving.

335
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:22,025
Striving is good.

336
00:24:22,866 --> 00:24:23,826
But remember

337
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:26,305
not to be too brash.

338
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:29,265
Yes, My Lord.

339
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:33,025
My Lord,

340
00:24:33,785 --> 00:24:37,386
you seem rather unusual today.

341
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,946
Zhimo, did you strike it rich?

342
00:24:56,346 --> 00:24:58,065
Where did you find
so many delicious treats?

343
00:24:58,305 --> 00:24:59,505
How long will it take
to finish all of this?

344
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:01,426
Oh, right.

345
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,025
Young Lady likes this.

346
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:04,186
I'll keep it for her.

347
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:06,626
I like this one.

348
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:08,346
Zhimo,

349
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:10,346
you should have all of this.

350
00:25:11,065 --> 00:25:11,866
You like them too.

351
00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:13,866
So you keep them.

352
00:25:14,265 --> 00:25:15,586
I do like them.

353
00:25:15,826 --> 00:25:17,065
But I'm not picky.

354
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:18,465
So you can have them all.

355
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,265
By the way, Young Lady said

356
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,666
this is called gaining favor
with a token of kindness.

357
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:25,065
They are all yours.

358
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,065
You can keep them.

359
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:32,666
Then,

360
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:35,025
we can keep them here.

361
00:25:35,186 --> 00:25:37,265
When you come next time,
we can enjoy them together.

362
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:39,265
Sure.

363
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:13,186
(His Lordship is still not here yet.)

364
00:26:14,346 --> 00:26:16,465
His Majesty has arrived.

365
00:26:25,826 --> 00:26:32,601
(Mingde Gate)

366
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:09,265
End of the court session.

367
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:23,985
Lord Ding plans to travel
to different countries.

368
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:25,386
Why...

369
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:27,025
Why did Lord Ding

370
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,186
suddenly come up with such an idea?

371
00:27:29,545 --> 00:27:30,386
I couldn't figure it out either.

372
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:44,106
Greetings, Your Majesty.

373
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:46,186
You may drop the formalities.

374
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:47,705
Official Mu,

375
00:27:48,985 --> 00:27:49,985
what brings you here?

376
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:51,146
Your Majesty,

377
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,305
when did Lord Ding start
to have such a thought?

378
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:57,065
I've never heard him mention it before.

379
00:28:03,946 --> 00:28:04,745
Actually,

380
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,106
it's not exactly about
traveling to other countries.

381
00:28:09,346 --> 00:28:10,146
Then what is it?

382
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:14,426
Uncle simply feels

383
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:16,545
he has been working hard
for too many years.

384
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:19,146
Chen,

385
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:24,265
I've done what I wanted to do.

386
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:26,386
After this,

387
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,705
I want to leave the court

388
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:30,826
and get proper rest for a while.

389
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:32,465
But, Uncle,

390
00:28:32,505 --> 00:28:33,025
I...

391
00:28:33,265 --> 00:28:34,065
Chen,

392
00:28:35,586 --> 00:28:36,985
with the recent Chief Eunuch's demise,

393
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:41,186
there might be some changes
both within and outside the court.

394
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:42,745
At that time,

395
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:45,505
you must stay calm

396
00:28:46,186 --> 00:28:47,186
and not be hasty.

397
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:55,225
I shall remember your words.

398
00:28:58,025 --> 00:28:58,946
But, Uncle,

399
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,305
can't you stay?

400
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:04,225
I'm exhausted.

401
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:10,545
I've given the necessary instructions.

402
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:13,946
I believe

403
00:29:16,946 --> 00:29:18,305
you will do very well.

404
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:27,386
I shall take my leave.

405
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:34,906
Young Lady.

406
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:37,545
Young Lady,

407
00:29:37,785 --> 00:29:39,505
someone threw a letter

408
00:29:39,505 --> 00:29:40,465
into our courtyard.

409
00:29:52,146 --> 00:29:52,906
(Zhuohua,)

410
00:29:53,465 --> 00:29:55,785
(the matters of love
have been deeply troubling)

411
00:29:56,346 --> 00:29:58,225
(and leaving one emotionally drained.)

412
00:29:58,745 --> 00:29:59,745
(After bidding farewell,)

413
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:01,146
(I hope you'll take care of yourself.)

414
00:30:02,146 --> 00:30:03,386
(When we meet again,)

415
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:04,866
(we'll be mere strangers.)

416
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:11,906
(Also,)

417
00:30:12,465 --> 00:30:13,626
(everything I've accumulated
in my life)

418
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:16,866
(is left at your grandfather's
old residence.)

419
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:20,225
(Now, I entrust them to you.)

420
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:21,906

My Lord,

439
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:35,505
it's about what you asked me before.

440
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:37,826
I know my choice now.

(If you like me too,)

00:31:57,785 --> 00:31:58,906
then let me stay by your side.

If you don't marry anyone,

447
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:04,545
I won't marry anyone either.

Let's accompany each other

can you...

452
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:19,505
Can you really do that?

453
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:22,065

My Lord,

478
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:21,866
instead of reminiscing by the peonies,

479
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:23,585
why not invite Official Mu over?

480
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:25,065
Even if you're unwell,

481
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:26,906
her presence might improve your mood.

482
00:34:30,786 --> 00:34:31,985
Say no more.

483
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,545
I'm already as good as dead.

484
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:41,746
It's just

485
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:44,706
because I long
for that bright ray of sunshine

486
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:47,545
that I wanted to keep her by my side.

487
00:34:49,985 --> 00:34:51,226
You all think

488
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:53,625
I've been protecting her all along.

489
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:56,105
In reality,

490
00:34:58,145 --> 00:34:59,946
I need her even more.

491
00:35:02,585 --> 00:35:05,465
Now, I have no way to change my fate.

492
00:35:06,465 --> 00:35:07,665
So I don't want to burden her.

493
00:35:09,545 --> 00:35:13,185
She deserves a better future.

494
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:18,185
Is there really no other solution?

495
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,025
Matters of life and death

496
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:26,426
are beyond human control.

497
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:51,786
Young Lady,

498
00:35:53,145 --> 00:35:54,585
please have some congee.

499
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:56,866
You haven't had a proper meal in days.

500
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:00,706
Young Lady,

501
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:06,826
I used to think Lord Ding

502
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:07,786
was a good person.

503
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:09,266
But now,

504
00:36:09,706 --> 00:36:11,306
he's just like Old Master Mu.

505
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,500
He talked about retiring
to a peaceful life before.

506
00:36:13,746 --> 00:36:15,545
But he's just fickle.

507
00:36:16,545 --> 00:36:17,266
Young Lady,

508
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:18,625
I'm sure

509
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:19,625
he's hiding somewhere,

510
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:20,706
laughing at us.

511
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,306
We mustn't let him look down on us.

512
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:32,386
Uncle's favorite place?

513
00:36:33,545 --> 00:36:34,786
I hope Your Majesty can tell me.

514
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:45,145
Uncle doesn't have any favorite place.

515
00:36:47,226 --> 00:36:50,145
Father suffered persistent illnesses
when he was alive.

516
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:53,426
He often reminisced about the time
when he was the Crown Prince.

517
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,505
He and Uncle rode horses
to Yuezhou overnight

518
00:36:58,505 --> 00:37:00,585
to enjoy the green bamboo groves.

519
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,625
Whenever Father mentioned it,

520
00:37:03,426 --> 00:37:05,025
Uncle also remembered it fondly.

521
00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:08,105
Your Majesty,

522
00:37:09,065 --> 00:37:09,946
I wish

523
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,786
to take some days off.

524
00:37:13,946 --> 00:37:15,105
I hope Your Majesty grants permission.

525
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,545
Are you planning to go to Yuezhou?

526
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:29,266
Uncle has served the country
for many years.

527
00:37:29,826 --> 00:37:32,025
He simply desires a few days of peace.

528
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:33,746
Why do you insist on bringing him back?

529
00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:40,145
Lord Ding owes me something.

530
00:37:41,065 --> 00:37:44,346
I intend to collect it back.

531
00:37:44,545 --> 00:37:45,306
What does he owe you?

532
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:46,786
I can repay you on behalf of him.

533
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:07,266
Young Lady.

534
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:09,226
Young Lady,

535
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,426
what does Lord Ding owe you

536
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,025
that even His Majesty can't repay it?

537
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:16,105
It's my feelings, of course.

538
00:38:17,226 --> 00:38:18,706
He thinks he can cast me away
by leaving a letter

539
00:38:18,706 --> 00:38:19,545
that doesn't make any sense.

540
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:21,226
I must

541
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:23,386
settle the score with him.
