=The Legend of Zhuohua=

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 27=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:50,385
(In the span of five years,)

21
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:52,784
(Map of Southern Chen)
(Jishan Hall slowly expanded)

22
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:54,665
(Capital)
(throughout Southern Chen.)

23
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,745
I saved more people

24
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,585
and gained more prestige.

25
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:04,864
My information network

26
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:07,545
had gradually grown as well.

27
00:02:08,865 --> 00:02:09,905
(Jishan Hall also helped me)

28
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:11,705
(collect information on Yun Xiangyue.)

29
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:15,944
(Her father was Yuan Chengming)

30
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:17,905
(Yuan Chengming's daughter, Yun Xiyue,)
(of the war at Juma River.)

31
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:18,735
(is the prominent courtesan
of Xiaoqin Pleasure House, Yun Xiangyue.)

32
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:20,664
(That's when I knew)

33
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:24,104
(that it was time for me
to return to the capital.)

34
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:28,865
(I built an empty tomb for Yuan Chengming
on purpose)

35
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:32,344
(Tomb of Yuan Chengming)
(and stated it was by Yun Xiangyue.)

36
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:35,824
(The purpose was to make Uncle)

37
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,705
switch his target to Yun Xiangyue.

38
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:41,064
Then,

39
00:02:41,824 --> 00:02:43,025
I made Peilan

40
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,305
reveal the news to you
that Uncle had found

41
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,664
Yun Xiangyue.

42
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:52,104
Lord Ding has found out
that Yun Xiangyue

43
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:53,784
is the daughter of Yuan Chengming.

44
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:56,544
(After all, you are
the Dowager Empress who is superior,)

45
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:57,944
while I

46
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:00,745
am just a princess without power.

47
00:03:01,624 --> 00:03:03,425
How can I possibly beat you?

48
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:05,824
That was why

49
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:09,064
I had to make good use of Uncle,

50
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,944
(Laiyuan Relay Station)
(who is a powerful knife,)

51
00:03:12,145 --> 00:03:13,745
(and reap the benefits.)

52
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:16,224
(I didn't expect Uncle)

53
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:19,585
(to give up on the Revival Powder,
which was a great clue.)

54
00:03:20,265 --> 00:03:21,664
(He chose the hard way instead)

55
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:24,384
(by finding
the Northern Liang's hawk claw hook.)

56
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:27,824
(I couldn't let him
investigate any further.)

57
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,265
After all, Uncle is very capable.

58
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:31,865
Soon,

59
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:33,664
he would have found out

60
00:03:34,185 --> 00:03:37,185
that I was the one who leaked
information about Northern Liang's spy

61
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,425
to Xue Xiaotang.

62
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:45,265
Sir, I'd like to
make a toast to you as well.

63
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:54,064
Who are you?

64
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:03,465
It's you.

65
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:06,705
(In order to divert Uncle's attention,)

66
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:09,865
(I had to strike a deal with Yemu Jing)

67
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:12,344
(and make him request)

68
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:15,624
a marriage alliance
between me and Northern Liang.

69
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:19,625
And you, Grandmother,

70
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:21,825
would certainly abandon me

71
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:23,585
to make sure Northern Liang
wouldn't act rashly.

72
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:25,505
You would take the chance

73
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,385
to talk me into forming the alliance.

74
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,940
I obviously had to agree to it.

75
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:32,424
This way,

76
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,585
I could divert Uncle's attention

77
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:37,344
and gain a good reputation.

78
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,784
After all,
in the eyes of the common folks,

79
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:41,505
I was walking into the tiger's den

80
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:44,465
by going to Northern Liang
for Southern Chen.

81
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:46,705
How can a dispute between nations

82
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:49,385
be resolved by a marriage alliance?

83
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:51,905
As imperial subjects,

84
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:54,424
if all you see is the comfort before you

85
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,505
and you don't improve yourself,

86
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,705
how can you stand tall
in the imperial court?

87
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:02,825
I knew Uncle would never agree

88
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:04,025
to such a preposterous thing.

89
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,304
But Father

90
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:11,705
did not even say a word.

91
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:16,184
Just like the time my mother died.

92
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:19,505
He didn't say a word either.

93
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:27,585
As expected,
you can never rely on kinship.

94
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:32,424
It doesn't matter when.

95
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:36,065
You can only rely on yourself.

96
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:42,505
(I had already)

97
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,145
(thought of a way out for myself.)

98
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:45,025
Your Highness.

99
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:47,465
(Zhuohua and I are always close.)

100
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:50,505
(Once she knew
about the marriage alliance,)

101
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:52,025
(she would certainly come to me.)

102
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:56,184
(When she saw the Northern Liang people
packing up,)

103
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:59,864
(she would tell Uncle about it.)

104
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:03,385
And once Uncle looked into it further,

105
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:07,945
he would learn that the King
of Northern Liang was seriously ill.

106
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,184
Therefore,

107
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,705
he would force Yemu Jing

108
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:14,744
to reduce his terms for the peace talk.

109
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,304
And the marriage alliance

110
00:06:17,784 --> 00:06:19,744
would eventually fall through.

111
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:27,104
(Luckily, Xue Xiaotang was fortunate.)

112
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:29,344
(The moment I saw him,)

113
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:31,905
(I knew it was him.)

114
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:36,385
(I let him see the portrait on purpose.)

115
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:37,984
(As expected,)

116
00:06:38,784 --> 00:06:41,825
(he remained faithful to me.)

117
00:06:42,385 --> 00:06:45,184
(But he was probably afraid
to reveal himself)

118
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,905
(due to feeling inferior.)

119
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,385
Besides, you and Uncle

120
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:51,304
are influential in the capital.

121
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:54,505
I doubt he would dare
expose himself carelessly.

122
00:06:54,905 --> 00:06:55,984
But that won't do.

123
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:59,265
He was my important witness.

124
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,265
Grandmother.

125
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:09,344
You are my enemy,

126
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,664
but also a good assistant to my revenge.

127
00:07:14,385 --> 00:07:16,945
Once you learned
that Xue Xiaotang wasn't dead,

128
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:18,984
you sent people from the Zhou family

129
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:20,424
to Jiangnan to kill him.

130
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:23,265
I went along with the plan

131
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:25,864
and used myself
to lure Xue Xiaotang out.

132
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:27,984
Unfortunately,

133
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:30,505
he was pushed off the cliff

134
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:32,585
by your men.

135
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:36,304
Luckily,

136
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:38,424
he did not die.

137
00:07:41,065 --> 00:07:42,705
He was saved by Uncle.

138
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:46,984
When Zhuohua asked me
for the Snow Dust Pill,

139
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:49,544
saying it was to save a friend

140
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:52,184
and that it would be
a pleasant surprise,

141
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:54,544
I figured out

142
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:56,344
that it was Xue Xiaotang.

143
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,784
So I gave her the Snow Dust Pill.

144
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,744
Once Xue Xiaotang wakes up,

145
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,625
Uncle would bring him to the palace

146
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:07,465
to confront you.

147
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:11,424
Xue Xiaotang was so in love with me,

148
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,304
so he would certainly expose your crimes

149
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:17,864
and help me get my revenge.

150
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:21,145
When the time comes,

151
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:23,304
I would lure Father over.

152
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:27,224
And this matter
would turn into a big deal.

153
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:35,745
The only thing I did not expect

154
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:38,664
was that Father

155
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,105
would return to the palace late at night

156
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,824
just to ease the tension
between you and Uncle

157
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:46,505
and suddenly died.

158
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:51,985
You caused Father to die.

159
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,184
(Ciming Hall)

160
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:01,225
Guards!

161
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,464
Summon the imperial physician!

162
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:26,145
Young Lady is skilled in medicine.

163
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:28,025
I'm sure His Lordship will be alright.

164
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:42,464
My Lord.

165
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:44,105
You have come to.

166
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:47,745
Here. Drink this medicine first.

167
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:19,824
My Lord.

168
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:22,424
How are you feeling?

169
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:25,345
I feel much better now.

170
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:35,664
I know you are blaming yourself.

171
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:39,505
But who would've known

172
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:44,145
that His Majesty would use
such a drastic way

173
00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:47,505
to stop your dispute
with Dowager Empress Zhou.

174
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:51,385
Still...

175
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:56,424
His Majesty...

176
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:01,865
By the way, My Lord,

177
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:06,025
previously, Zhijian and the Falcon Squad

178
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:08,784
had been watching Xue Xiaotang.

179
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:11,265
But in the end...

180
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:15,704
They ended up finding his body

181
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:17,304
in the moat.

182
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:19,664
It was a fatal stab

183
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,385
in the heart.

184
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:23,225
Zhijian and the rest think

185
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,064
that Xue Xiaotang attempted to escape

186
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:28,985
but got killed
by Dowager Empress Zhou's men.

187
00:11:39,385 --> 00:11:40,265
Don't worry.

188
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:44,544
I will be alright.

189
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:48,824
There are more important things

190
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:51,145
to do.

191
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:55,424
I'm not going to crumble now.

192
00:11:57,865 --> 00:11:58,584
My Lord.

193
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:01,865
I will always be by your side.

194
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:29,464
Congratulations

195
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:31,745
on avenging your mother, Your Highness.

196
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:37,385
Thanks for your help.

197
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,064
Without you,

198
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,620
I wouldn't be who I am today.

199
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:50,664
Isn't this

200
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:53,505
the gifted Scholar Shen
from our academy who was the top scorer?

201
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:55,544
Why have you ended up

202
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,145
being more miserable than a beggar?

203
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,025
Why are you so eager to leave?

204
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:06,184
If you get on your knees
and kowtow to me,

205
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:07,505
I'll cover your greeting gift

206
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,824
for the teacher in the future.

207
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:10,025
Move aside.

208
00:13:10,385 --> 00:13:11,064
Beat him!

209
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:13,304
Get him!

210
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:14,664
Beat him.

211
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:15,944
Give him a good beating.

212
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,625
Learn your lesson.

213
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:20,424
Let's go.

214
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:33,424
Do you

215
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:36,184
want revenge?

216
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,184
These days, aristocratic families
are unbridled and oppressive.

217
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:51,304
They climb the ladder thanks to
the foundation laid by their ancestors.

218
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:54,184
But when it comes to real competence,

219
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:56,304
they have got none.

220
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,544
You are absolutely right.

221
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,265
Those from noble families are used

222
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:04,265
to gaining without toil.

223
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:07,025
So they become a blight
in the imperial court.

224
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:08,664
If you don't get rid of them,

225
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:10,865
they will eventually
ruin the court's foundation.

226
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,225
You are absolutely right.

227
00:14:14,544 --> 00:14:16,664
Are you willing to set
the right direction for the people

228
00:14:16,745 --> 00:14:17,824
and create a disciplined

229
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:19,944
and orderly era with me?

230
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:25,505
Yes, Your Highness.

231
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:27,505
That's great.

232
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,265
Then you must study hard.

233
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:31,985
To those from common families,

234
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:33,985
the imperial exam is the only chance.

235
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:36,385
You don't know how powerful
these noble families can be.

236
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:38,784
If you want to compete with them,

237
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,064
you have to rise to a higher position.

238
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:51,265
You've been studying day and night.

239
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,145
Are you still not done?

240
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:53,985
No. Not yet.

241
00:14:56,184 --> 00:14:56,944
This guy doesn't care

242
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,865
about what's going on outside.

243
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:01,424
I bet he doesn't know
about the big news in the capital.

244
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:04,424
Do you mean the marriage
that His Majesty arranged

245
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:05,265
for Princess Roujia?

246
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:06,745
That's right.

247
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:15,304
What did you just say?

248
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:19,865
His Majesty arranged a marriage
for the Princess.

249
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:22,664
What's the matter with him?

250
00:15:22,944 --> 00:15:23,824
Who knows?

251
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:26,664
Tell me.

252
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:28,745
Who is this lucky and talented man

253
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:30,784
who gets to marry
a goddess like the Princess?

254
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:32,145
Let me think.

255
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:35,304
I heard it was a general
named Xue Xiaotang.

256
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:36,145
General Xue?

259
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:41,824
He died in battle.

260
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:42,584
Exactly.

261
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:44,944
I pity our princess.

262
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,225
It's the prime of her life,
but she's widowed.

263
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:49,064
That's right.

264
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:50,345
I feel so bad for Her Highness.

Thank you, Your Highness.

281
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:26,024
To rope in Xue Xiaotang back then,

282
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,664
Dowager Empress offered me
to him as leverage.

283
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:33,744
I have never loved Xue Xiaotang.

284
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,305
But I didn't have much power
at the time.

285
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:40,065
I had no choice but to gladly accept it.

286
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:45,065
Otherwise, she would use that
as an excuse to punish me.

287
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:48,184
From an early age, I know

288
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:50,625
that you cannot pin your hopes

289
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:53,664
on anyone in this world.

290
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:55,625
You can only rely on yourself.

291
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,944
You can trust me, Your Highness.

292
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:03,944
I will be yours in every life.

293
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:05,905
No.

294
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:08,145
You cannot be mine.

295
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:14,424
Chen is the eldest son of the Empress.

296
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:17,545
He also has support
from Dowager Empress and Lord Ding.

297
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:21,065
Taking the throne from him
isn't something

298
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:23,105
that can be done overnight.

299
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:25,664
We must plan it out.

300
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:28,664
He is determined in his pursuits.

301
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:30,825
He likes enthusiastic

302
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:32,704
and like-minded people
who are outstanding.

303
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:37,504
Before this, you had become
well-known across the capital

304
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:39,305
and gained his trust.

305
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:41,905
I want you

306
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,785
to stay by his side

307
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:46,065
and work with me.

308
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:52,984
Once we have succeeded,

309
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:55,145
you will become the Prime Minister

310
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:57,264
who answers to no one but me.

311
00:18:58,545 --> 00:18:59,704
I promise you.

312
00:19:01,785 --> 00:19:02,625
But, Your Highness,

313
00:19:04,424 --> 00:19:05,585
Liu Chen can give me

314
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:08,184
this first-rank position as well.

315
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,145
Are you planning to betray me?

316
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:15,424
No.

317
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:17,984
I, Shen Jinghong,

318
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:21,184
will never betray you.

319
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:24,464
It's just that what I desire

320
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:29,105
is not to have that high position.

321
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,744
Then what is it that you want?

322
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:37,024
What I want

323
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,785
is your heart.

324
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:50,184
Shen Jinghong.

325
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,625
I don't have a heart.

326
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:56,785
You will.

327
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,825
If you don't have feelings,

328
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:08,385
you won't be tormented by it.

329
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:18,664
Speaking of which,

330
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:21,545
it is time for my younger brothers
to return

331
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:24,504
from the temporary imperial residence.

332
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:34,825
(You had been imitating)

333
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:36,264
(the late Emperor's handwriting.)

334
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:38,224
(It has come in handy now.)

335
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:03,764
(Succession to the throne)

336
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:11,984
Greetings, Your Highness.

337
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:13,024
What are you doing?

338
00:21:13,585 --> 00:21:14,825
I can't afford to accept your bow.

339
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,184
Not at all, Your Highness.

340
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:20,905
Not only am I from
the same hometown as your mother,

341
00:21:21,785 --> 00:21:24,224
but she also saved my life.

342
00:21:24,504 --> 00:21:25,545
So I should bow to you.

343
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,424
Rest assured, Your Highness.

344
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,345
You can consider it done.

345
00:21:34,785 --> 00:21:35,984
Thank you, sir.

346
00:22:23,905 --> 00:22:26,024
The former emperor had passed.

347
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:28,504
News has spread throughout the capital.

348
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:30,825
Even the three princes have returned

349
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:32,424
from the temporary imperial residence.

350
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:35,105
But why is Lord Ding

351
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:37,545
still not here?

352
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:38,424
Exactly.

353
00:22:39,385 --> 00:22:42,785
Is His Lordship having other ideas

354
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:44,825
since the three princes are still young?

355
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:48,664
Lord Ding is loyal
to the Emperor and the nation.

356
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,264
How can you make
such speculations about His Lordship?

357
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,905
Official Wei, are we announcing

358
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:58,865
the testamentary edict or not?

359
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,065
Exactly.

360
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:03,704
Official Wei,
if Lord Ding doesn't show up,

361
00:23:04,065 --> 00:23:04,984
are we supposed

362
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,984
to keep waiting?

363
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,825
The late Emperor's testamentary edict
concerns the successor of the throne.

364
00:23:12,305 --> 00:23:14,000
(Official Wei of Sothern Chen)
Lord Ding is the only lord

365
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,504
(Official Wei of Sothern Chen)
of Southern Chen.

366
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,105
So the edict

367
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:21,385
can only be announced when he is here.

368
00:23:29,545 --> 00:23:31,105
Lord Ding has arrived!

369
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:46,224
Greetings, Your Lordship.

370
00:23:56,065 --> 00:23:58,825
Announcement of the testamentary edict.

371
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,424
The late Emperor's testamentary edict.

372
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:27,385
"I humbly inherited the throne.

373
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:31,545
Offered the jade tablet
to the nine Imperial Temples.

374
00:24:32,464 --> 00:24:35,585
Faced the nation as the new emperor.

375
00:24:36,305 --> 00:24:38,464
Second Prince, Liu Yu,

376
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:40,504
is upright, talented,

377
00:24:41,424 --> 00:24:43,065
and intelligent.

378
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:47,264
I believe he will do well
upon inheriting the line of work

379
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:49,585
of the Liu family.

380
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,345
Prepare the ceremony
and succeed the throne

381
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,224
before my coffin."

382
00:24:55,865 --> 00:24:57,545
I shall obey.

383
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,224
How can that be?

384
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:16,744
This isn't right.
It must be a forged edict.

385
00:25:17,264 --> 00:25:18,024
Official Zhou.

386
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:20,294
The edict was taken out
from the memorial tablet

387
00:25:20,294 --> 00:25:21,464
at the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

388
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:23,944
It was revealed in front of everyone
after being checked

389
00:25:24,145 --> 00:25:26,625
by all the officials
and the six ministers.

390
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:31,865
Even if you want
to lie through your teeth,

391
00:25:32,385 --> 00:25:34,785
at least make up a better excuse.

392
00:25:36,305 --> 00:25:37,984
It was no secret
where the testamentary edict

393
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:39,424
was stored.

394
00:25:40,024 --> 00:25:41,464
It is not unlikely that someone

395
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:43,184
could have secretly replaced it!

396
00:25:43,184 --> 00:25:44,865
You are being unreasonable!

397
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,664
It is clearly stated
in the testamentary edict

398
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:50,424
that Second Prince
will inherit the throne.

399
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:55,785
When the late Emperor wrote the edict,

400
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:57,464
I was present.

401
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:01,704
The content of this edict is different.

402
00:26:03,305 --> 00:26:06,504
I suspect
that it has been tampered with.

403
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:20,024
Lord Ding.

404
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,905
This testamentary edict
has no traces of forgery.

405
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:29,385
The late Emperor
wrote two testamentary edicts.

406
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,704
The other copy
was personally kept by him.

407
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:36,984
You may compare and verify

408
00:26:37,704 --> 00:26:39,424
the two edicts.

409
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:40,504
But the late Emperor

410
00:26:41,305 --> 00:26:42,264
suddenly passed away.

411
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:44,664
Who knows

412
00:26:45,385 --> 00:26:46,585
where the testamentary edict is?

413
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:49,905
I know where it is.

414
00:26:57,145 --> 00:26:58,145
I'm sure you know

415
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:00,744
that I prefer Chen.

416
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,065
But he hasn't faced enough difficulties,

417
00:27:03,744 --> 00:27:05,065
so I am still worried about him.

418
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:08,625
I always think that I can still hang on
for a few more years.

419
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:10,944
When he is more mature,

420
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:14,065
I will hand the nation to him.

421
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:16,625
But I also fear there's not enough time.

422
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:19,744
Your Majesty.

423
00:27:26,984 --> 00:27:27,664
Yan.

424
00:27:29,385 --> 00:27:30,704
Please look after my three sons

425
00:27:31,504 --> 00:27:33,105
in the future.

426
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:39,424
Yes, Your Majesty.

427
00:27:41,305 --> 00:27:42,704
There are two testamentary edicts.

428
00:27:43,024 --> 00:27:45,664
One copy is behind the memorial tablet
at the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

429
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:47,184
The other copy

430
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:50,704
is kept in the secret compartment
in my chambers.

431
00:27:57,785 --> 00:28:00,617
(Wende Hall)

432
00:28:16,504 --> 00:28:17,345
Official Wei.

433
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:19,984
If you may.

434
00:28:20,704 --> 00:28:22,744
"I humbly

435
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:25,105
inherited the grand responsibility
of my ancestors.

436
00:28:26,184 --> 00:28:27,785
Day and night, I acted with caution,

437
00:28:28,385 --> 00:28:31,664
fearing that I would fail
the late Emperor.

438
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:33,944
Life and death
are the normal cycles of nature.

439
00:28:34,224 --> 00:28:36,625
No one has ever escaped from it.

440
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:39,305
Fortunately, I have a successor

441
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,664
whom the people of the nation
can depend on.

442
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:43,545
I have no regrets.

443
00:28:44,424 --> 00:28:46,424
First Prince, Liu Chen,

444
00:28:46,984 --> 00:28:48,345
is firm, intelligent,

445
00:28:48,585 --> 00:28:49,744
and familiar with national affairs.

446
00:28:50,385 --> 00:28:52,424
I believe he is able
to protect the throne,

447
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:54,264
be in favor of the people,

448
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,184
and keep the nation safe and in order.

449
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:58,744
May officials in charge
prepare the ceremony.

450
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:03,224
The throne shall be succeeded
before my coffin."

451
00:29:07,105 --> 00:29:07,785
That can't be.

452
00:29:08,264 --> 00:29:10,184
No, this can't be true!

453
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:14,744
Liu Yu.

454
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:16,785
How dare you

455
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:19,024
swap the testamentary edict!

456
00:29:19,184 --> 00:29:19,905
No!

457
00:29:19,984 --> 00:29:21,184
I didn't do that!

458
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:22,704
This is slandering!

459
00:29:23,024 --> 00:29:23,984
Yu would never

460
00:29:23,984 --> 00:29:25,585
commit such a treacherous act.

461
00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:27,704
Throughout history,

462
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:31,145
many people have used unscrupulous means

463
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,825
to get the throne.

464
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:39,385
Lord Ding.

465
00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:42,305
You claim that this testamentary edict
is the real one.

466
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,460
But the edict taken from
the Imperial Ancestral Temple

467
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:47,105
indeed contains the handwriting
of the late Emperor.

468
00:29:47,825 --> 00:29:49,224
That is why I think

469
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,825
that this testamentary edict
might be the fake one here.

470
00:30:00,664 --> 00:30:01,385
That's enough.

471
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:03,905
Enough with the commotion.

472
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:05,464
What an embarrassing sight.

473
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:08,585
Are you eager to see the capital
fall into chaos?

474
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,105
Uncle.

475
00:30:12,504 --> 00:30:13,585
I disagree.

476
00:30:14,184 --> 00:30:15,424
It concerns the Southern Chen's heir.

477
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,464
Failing to get an explanation for this

478
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:20,145
will lead to the capital
falling into chaos.

479
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,305
What is there to explain?

480
00:30:23,944 --> 00:30:25,744
Do you think Uncle would lie?

481
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,865
Uncle has always favored you.

482
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:32,024
Who knows if he would...

483
00:30:32,024 --> 00:30:32,704
Shut it!

484
00:30:33,905 --> 00:30:35,264
Don't you slander Uncle.

485
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,984
If I could forge this copy
of the testamentary edict,

486
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:47,825
then I would have forged the one
at the Imperial Ancestral Temple as well.

487
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,865
Are you trying to say

488
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:52,664
that Second Prince secretly forged
and swapped the edict?

489
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:55,545
If you accuse His Highness

490
00:30:55,905 --> 00:30:57,545
without proof,

491
00:30:57,825 --> 00:31:00,184
don't you fear
getting criticized by the people?

492
00:31:00,664 --> 00:31:02,264
I never said

493
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,990
that it was Second Prince's doing.

494
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:06,825
Uncle.

495
00:31:07,385 --> 00:31:09,264
His name was written
on the forged edict.

496
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:11,224
Who else could it be if not him?

497
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:13,905
It is the spy of Northern Liang.

498
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:18,224
This person only swapped
one copy of the edict on purpose,

499
00:31:18,865 --> 00:31:20,504
causing

500
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,391
two contradicting edicts.

501
00:31:23,224 --> 00:31:26,065
The goal was to cause
internal conflicts in Southern Chen.

502
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:28,024
Who will benefit the most

503
00:31:30,024 --> 00:31:31,345
from such a situation?

504
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:33,825
That would clearly be Northern Liang.

505
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:35,984
Today,

506
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,464
all you officials
were quarreling over this.

507
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,345
That's absolutely pedantic!

508
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:46,065
This is exactly what they wanted.

509
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:51,944
I was appointed
as Lord Ding by the late Emperor.

510
00:31:53,305 --> 00:31:55,704
It is my duty to stabilize the nation.

511
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:57,464
This morning,

512
00:31:57,865 --> 00:32:00,585
I have sent orders
to the Barracks of the Capital Region.

513
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:03,065
If any spies of Northern Liang
are discovered,

514
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:04,825
they will be killed on the spot.

515
00:32:06,984 --> 00:32:08,345
As for Second Prince,

516
00:32:09,825 --> 00:32:11,625
I trust your character.

517
00:32:13,585 --> 00:32:14,504
This was definitely

518
00:32:15,504 --> 00:32:17,585
the Northern Liang people's doing.

519
00:32:18,865 --> 00:32:19,704
However,

520
00:32:21,145 --> 00:32:23,504
until this matter is ascertained,

521
00:32:25,224 --> 00:32:26,145
it must not

522
00:32:27,184 --> 00:32:28,224
be leaked.

523
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:31,625
Therefore,
Second Prince and Third Prince

524
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:34,984
will have to stay at my residence
for a few days.

525
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:37,664
I will protect you myself.

526
00:32:38,585 --> 00:32:39,184
But, Uncle...

527
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:40,024
That's enough.

528
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:43,424
The nation cannot be without a ruler.

529
00:32:43,944 --> 00:32:45,585
I need the Ministry of Rites

530
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:47,065
to start preparing

531
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:49,184
for the enthronement
of the new emperor at once.

532
00:32:50,744 --> 00:32:51,545
As for

533
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:54,024
the forged edict,

534
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:57,224
I will personally investigate it.

535
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:10,504
If it weren't for Lord Ding today,

536
00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:12,744
judging by First Prince's character,

537
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:14,865
he would have gotten into

538
00:33:15,145 --> 00:33:17,905
a huge fight at the imperial court
with Second Prince.

539
00:33:19,785 --> 00:33:20,545
It's alright.

540
00:33:21,785 --> 00:33:22,744
I expected Uncle

541
00:33:22,744 --> 00:33:24,785
to be able to turn things around.

542
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:26,825
It's just that I initially thought

543
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,744
that once Chen ascended the throne,

544
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:30,464
he would get rid of this brother.

545
00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:31,704
When the time comes,

546
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:34,065
he would be blamed
for killing his own brother.

547
00:33:35,944 --> 00:33:38,305
I didn't expect Uncle to pass the buck

548
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,585
and put the blame

549
00:33:39,905 --> 00:33:41,385
on Northern Liang.

550
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:44,145
Looks like

551
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:47,424
he is trying to protect Yu and Jin.

552
00:33:48,825 --> 00:33:51,345
I'm afraid this plan
won't work for us anymore.

553
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:54,464
First Prince just ascended the throne.

554
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:58,145
Rattling his seat won't be difficult.

555
00:33:59,184 --> 00:34:00,944
The difficult one
is the person around him.

556
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,984
Uncle is indeed that shining star

557
00:34:07,984 --> 00:34:09,345
beside Chen.

558
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:13,385
If we can get rid of it,

559
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,385
then this land of the ruler

560
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:17,305
will be ours.

561
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:30,584
What does Ms. Mu usually like?

562
00:34:32,185 --> 00:34:32,825
Money.

563
00:35:03,104 --> 00:35:04,225
(A storm is coming.)

564
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:07,984
(Now isn't the time
to ponder over this.)

565
00:36:23,694 --> 00:36:28,974
(Liu Chen, New Emperor of Southern Chen)

566
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:38,424
Greet the Emperor!

567
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:57,305
Long live, Your Majesty!

568
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:05,544
You may rise.

569
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:07,584
Thank you, Your Majesty.

570
00:37:10,407 --> 00:37:13,589
(Wende Hall)

571
00:37:27,385 --> 00:37:29,385
I, Liu Yan,
have come to greet Your Majesty.

572
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:31,305
Uncle, no need to stand on ceremony.

573
00:37:35,144 --> 00:37:35,825
Your Majesty.

574
00:37:36,905 --> 00:37:39,944
You are now the ruler of Southern Chen.

575
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:42,024
Some rites cannot be exempted.

576
00:37:42,865 --> 00:37:43,504
Uncle.

577
00:37:44,104 --> 00:37:45,544
Are you drawing a line with me now?

578
00:37:48,504 --> 00:37:49,265
Chen.

579
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:53,984
You have to learn how to be an emperor.

580
00:37:59,385 --> 00:38:00,104
Uncle.

581
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:02,144
I understand.

582
00:38:03,785 --> 00:38:04,624
But in private,

583
00:38:05,305 --> 00:38:06,424
you are still my uncle.

584
00:38:07,825 --> 00:38:09,705
Uncle, come and sit.

585
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:24,785
The Court of Judicial Review

586
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:27,024
has investigated
the forged edict for days.

587
00:38:28,144 --> 00:38:30,504
They haven't found anything.

588
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:32,745
There's nothing to investigate.

589
00:38:32,984 --> 00:38:34,665
I'm sure it was Liu Yu's doing.

590
00:38:36,825 --> 00:38:38,464
The nerve of him!

591
00:38:38,905 --> 00:38:40,104
You mustn't let him off the hook.

592
00:38:40,825 --> 00:38:42,104
The late Emperor

593
00:38:42,544 --> 00:38:44,665
valued kinship the most.

594
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:48,185
He hoped that you and your brothers
could be on good terms.

595
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:50,984
Don't make him turn in his grave.

596
00:38:55,024 --> 00:38:55,624
Uncle.

597
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,064
How should we punish them?

598
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:08,745
We'll wait until the time is right.

599
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:10,385
Then send them to their fiefs,

600
00:39:10,825 --> 00:39:11,825
away from the capital.

601
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,225
In case those with ill intentions
haven't given up

602
00:39:14,905 --> 00:39:15,905
on harming the nation.
