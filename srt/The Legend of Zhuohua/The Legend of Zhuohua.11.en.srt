(Xiaoqin Pleasure House)

21
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,025
Everyone.

22
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:55,105
I think Ms. Mu dare not come.

23
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,864
Yes.

24
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:58,625
How would a mere woman

25
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:00,064
have the guts to come here?

26
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:00,985
Exactly.

27
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:03,905
She seemed to be
so confident the other day.

28
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:06,144
Turns out she's such a coward.

29
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:10,785
What if she comes here?

30
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:12,505
Just as well.

31
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:17,225
A female Tanhua visits the brothel.

32
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:20,345
Bravo.

33
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:24,065
Though people come here
to seek pleasure,

34
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:25,545
some patrons are with literary prowess.

35
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,864
Hence, this place turns out
to be elegant.

36
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:29,985
Precisely, Mr. Sun.

37
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,665
You're indeed the descendant
of the Sun clan of Jiangzuo.

38
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,105
You're upright.

39
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:35,985
Rightfully so.

40
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:37,945
We were just kidding.

41
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:39,424
Yes, it was a joke.

42
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:41,385
My apologies.

43
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:43,225
I'm late.

44
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:45,945
Sun.

45
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:47,065
Ms. Mu.

46
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:47,704
Come on.

47
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:51,464
Let's have a drink.

48
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:54,345
You're late, Mr. Shen.

49
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:55,825
You must take three shots.

50
00:02:56,704 --> 00:02:58,345
That's right. You're too late.

51
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,225
Come on here. Take a seat.

52
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:02,304
Ms. Mu.

53
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:03,825
Let's go.

54
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:04,105
Sure.

55
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:05,065
Come on, Mr. Shen.

56
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:06,505
Take your seat.

57
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:11,184
I'm sorry for being late.

58
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:12,225
I'll take a shot first.

59
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:16,424
Sir.

60
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:21,144
Ms. Mu caught a cold today.

61
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:23,385
I'll drink this for her.

62
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:29,713
Mr. Shen, you cherish her so much.

63
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:31,424
That's right.

64
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:32,545
Yes.

65
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,785
You sure are.

66
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,704
Well, let's have another shot.

67
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:37,904
Sure.

68
00:03:38,945 --> 00:03:39,985
Fill the cup.

69
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:40,904
- Fill the cup.
- OK.

70
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:47,505
Nice liquor.

71
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:48,704
Everyone.

72
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:50,304
Please have more, sirs.

73
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,065
Here.

74
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:52,545
Sure. Please drink.

75
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:54,024
Let's drink.

76
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:58,545
- Everyone.
- Shen, let's drink.

77
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,265
Shen, drink together.

78
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:09,505
Great.

79
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:12,464
That's the way it should be.

80
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:13,505
Fill it up, sir.

81
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:14,624
Here.

82
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:16,225
Official Shen, please drink.

83
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:17,545
Everyone, please excuse me.

84
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:17,905
Sure.

85
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:18,345
Go ahead.

86
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:21,345
Let's drink.

87
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:21,905
Please.

88
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:23,585
Sir, here's to you.

89
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,824
Sir, Shen. Let's drink.

90
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:26,585
Nice.

91
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:28,105
Sure. Let's drink.

92
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:29,665
Fill the glass up. Let's drink.

93
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:34,424
Nice liquor.

94
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:35,225
Exactly.

95
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:36,145
Nice liquor.

96
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:36,785
Fill the cup.

97
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:37,864
Fill the cup.

98
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:39,504
Shen.

99
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:40,225
Sorry to interrupt.

100
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:46,424
The owner just received
a new poetry anthology

101
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:48,864
and wanted to talk with Tanhua Mu.

102
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:51,624
So, please excuse us.

103
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:52,705
Let's go.

104
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:54,624
Poetry anthology?

105
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:55,944
A poetry anthology? Shen.

106
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:57,145
Let's go together.

107
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:57,705
The owner got a poetry anthology.

108
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:58,465
Hold on.

109
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:00,424
We gather here

110
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:01,985
to celebrate for you all.

111
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,585
But you're leaving now.

112
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,465
What's the point of this gathering?

113
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:08,304
He's right.

114
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:09,545
You can't go. No.

115
00:05:09,624 --> 00:05:10,785
We haven't had enough fun tonight.

116
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:11,944
If so, I'll stay,

117
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:14,345
and let's have a few more rounds.
What do you say?

118
00:05:14,424 --> 00:05:14,905
Good.

119
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:16,585
Both of them must stay.

120
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,465
Good. That's right.

121
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,345
We should go now.

122
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:24,025
She...

123
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:25,545
- We haven't had enough fun.
- Why?

124
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:26,624
Ms. Mu has left.

125
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:29,424
Are you not willing to drink with me?

126
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:40,384
Please have some tea, My Lord.

127
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:45,345
Taste it.

128
00:05:46,064 --> 00:05:48,145
This is your favorite Junshan Yinzhen.

129
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:50,665
I remember you didn't like this
because it has a bitter taste.

130
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:53,705
But your taste changed
after joining the army.

131
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:13,504
It's my fault.

132
00:06:14,465 --> 00:06:15,944
I shouldn't have brought it up.

133
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,264
Your Majesty.

134
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:23,545
Something has already happened

135
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,225
even if you didn't bring it up.

136
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:28,744
We only get to find the meaning
of being alive

137
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:31,384
by facing constant pain.

138
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:35,665
All right.

139
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:40,264
I have something to tell you.

140
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:55,504
After the war at Juma River,

141
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:57,944
Northern Liang is angling for a chance

142
00:06:58,424 --> 00:07:00,264
through testing or provoking us

143
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,465
and harassing border dwellers.

144
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:04,304
I'd like to lure Northern Liang out

145
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,665
under the disguise
of the peace negotiation with Eastern Xia.

146
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:11,905
So that we can forge an alliance
with them

147
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,905
to alleviate the situation
at the border.

148
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:16,585
All right.

149
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:18,665
I give you my permission.

150
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:21,304
Thank you, Your Majesty.

151
00:07:29,424 --> 00:07:30,025
Here.

152
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:32,264
Zhuohua, have the soup.

153
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,585
Thank you, Miss Song.

154
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:41,304
Are you not drunk?

155
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:45,264
Not really. I'm just a bit giddy.

156
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:49,824
This is my first battle
after becoming an official.

157
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:51,705
I won't back off.

158
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:53,744
They look down on me.

159
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:55,345
So, I must prove myself.

160
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,345
These old geezers

161
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,184
wanted to torment me.

162
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:02,905
But I won't jump into their trap.

163
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:04,944
Thank you

164
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:06,504
for saving me in time.

165
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:09,985
No need to say thank you to me.

166
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:11,864
You're so kind, Miss Song.

167
00:08:19,824 --> 00:08:20,585
Zhuohua.

168
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,225
Do you have a crush on someone?

169
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:27,744
Miss Song.

170
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:30,184
I want to be an official

171
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:31,504
and I have many things to do.

172
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:34,384
I dare not to have a crush on anyone.

173
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:35,664
Seriously?

174
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:39,065
Mr. Shen is very attentive to you.

175
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,024
He's a famous figure in the capital

176
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:44,185
and pays much attention to you.

177
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:46,624
Miss Song, there is nothing like that.

178
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:49,425
I have to rely on myself on this road.

179
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:50,784
I can't depend on others.

180
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:52,425
If that's what you think,

181
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:54,305
you'll surely succeed.

182
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:55,624
Thank you, Miss Song.

183
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:56,465
Enjoy the soup.

184
00:08:56,664 --> 00:08:58,504
I need to go to the front.

185
00:08:58,744 --> 00:08:59,465
Go ahead.

186
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:20,305
Shen.

187
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:22,225
Did you come here to avoid drinking too?

188
00:09:22,465 --> 00:09:23,784
You are drunk. I'm worried about you.

189
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:24,864
So, I came to look for you.

190
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:26,904
Thank you so much, Shen. Let's leave.

191
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:29,425
Wait.

192
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:37,544
Mr. Shen.

193
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,544
Ms. Mu, you're here too.

194
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:45,105
You...

195
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:53,624
You two...

196
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:55,864
Make it quick.

197
00:09:56,624 --> 00:09:58,305
I'll cover you up.

198
00:10:03,945 --> 00:10:04,784
He...

199
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,425
Did he misunderstand something?

200
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:09,465
Just let him be.

201
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:10,185
It's fine.

202
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:11,185
No, it can't be.

203
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:12,664
Shen, could you please

204
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:13,945
explain it to him?

205
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:16,904
You have too many admirers.

206
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,945
I don't want to be cornered.

207
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:19,904
All right.

208
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:26,105
Official Song.

209
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:30,585
Mr. Shen.

210
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:34,305
Just now, I ran into Ms. Mu
by accident.

211
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:35,664
Please don't misunderstand us.

212
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:37,904
I see.

213
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,425
Don't worry, Mr. Shen.

214
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:44,144
I won't tell anyone.

215
00:10:45,664 --> 00:10:47,945
Official Mu adores

216
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:49,664
Official Shen.

217
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,425
She did that to him
in Xiaoqin Pleasure House, you know?

218
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,624
What did she do?

219
00:10:53,624 --> 00:10:54,065
What happened?

220
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:57,465
Ladies.

221
00:10:57,465 --> 00:10:58,825
I was told

222
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,544
that Official Mu and Official Shen
had a secret meeting.

223
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:01,225
Really?

224
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:04,664
Have you heard that Official Mu
and Official Shen met in secret?

225
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,985
Yes, someone caught them dating.

226
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:11,105
Have you heard the news?

227
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:11,985
What's it?

228
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,225
Official Mu and Official Shen

229
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:14,425
were secretly meeting
in Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

230
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:15,784
Did you hear that?

231
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:16,825
Seriously?

232
00:11:25,544 --> 00:11:27,345
Your Highness,
have you heard about that?

233
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:29,105
Official Shen was secretly dating

234
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:30,705
Mu Zhuohua
in the Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

235
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:36,065
Both of them
have their own aspiration to stick to

236
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:39,544
and they went to great lengths
to be an official.

237
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,585
They won't let the love relationship
get in their way

238
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:44,384
to affect the future.

239
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:46,105
Your Highness...

240
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:49,185
The flower in the vase

241
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:51,425
can't be as free
as giant trees out there.

242
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:55,384
Don't jump to conclusions
without solid evidence.

243
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:01,264
Have you heard the news, My Lord?

244
00:12:02,144 --> 00:12:02,904
What news?

245
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:05,585
A rumor

246
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:07,185
about a talented couple.

247
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:12,904
A talented couple? How so?

248
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:17,664
The rumor resolves around
the Zhuangyuan and the Tanhua.

249
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:19,825
That's why it's called
a talented couple.

250
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:24,105
My Lord.

251
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:26,825
Mu Zhuohua is so dishonest.

252
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:28,945
She just lied that she admired you,

253
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:31,305
and now she's tight with Shen Jinghong.

254
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,264
She's fickle.

255
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:39,465
According to the law of Southern Chen,

256
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:42,664
women must stand down from their position
after getting married.

257
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:44,784
She insists on becoming an official,

258
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:46,904
why would she fall in love with someone

259
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:48,544
and ruin her career?

260
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:51,504
I...

261
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:54,105
I'm upset because it's unfair to you.

262
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:59,425
If that's true,

263
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:01,945
it's good for her

264
00:13:02,544 --> 00:13:04,345
to get rid of the trouble too.

265
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:08,024
You're so considerate.

266
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:19,504
By the way,

267
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:22,105
spread the word
that Eastern Xia and Southern Chen

268
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,664
are going to negotiate for peace
these days.

269
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:25,904
Yes, My Lord.

270
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:27,504
My Lord.

271
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:29,425
This is brilliant
to lure the target out in this way.

272
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:32,185
It's time to break the spirit
of Northern Liang.

273
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,065
You may go.

274
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:37,585
Yes.

275
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:01,264
According to the intelligence
from the Falcon Squad,

276
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:03,664
this hawk claw hook
comes from Northern Liang.

277
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:06,465
It seems that His Lordship wants
to get to the bottom

278
00:14:06,465 --> 00:14:07,305
of the past truth.

279
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,384
If he's going to approach Eastern Xia
for peace negotiations,

280
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:13,904
Northern Liang
will definitely meddle in this.

281
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:16,744
Hmm.

282
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:21,825
His Lordship

283
00:14:21,864 --> 00:14:24,544
suddenly interrupts
the affairs of the Ministry of Rites,

284
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:27,705
and this will no doubt disrupt the plan
of the hidden mastermind.

285
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:31,305
Who do you think will act first,

286
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:33,065
Northern Liang or the hidden mastermind?

287
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:38,664
Can you speak human?

288
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:39,744
Say something useful

289
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:40,904
other than just "hmm".

290
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:42,544
Hmm.

291
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:45,585
Talk to the hand.

292
00:14:56,935 --> 00:14:59,864
(Hanlin Academy)

293
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:01,144
Interesting.

294
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:14,784
Excuse me,

295
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:16,384
may I have this meal?

296
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:17,904
You're late. Nothing is left for you.

297
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:21,185
But there's one more here.

298
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:22,705
Not for you.

299
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:24,945
Not for me?

300
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:26,825
What's going on here?

301
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:29,744
Official Shen,
you haven't eaten anything

302
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:30,664
after returning from the mission, right?

303
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:35,345
Please have this.

304
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:37,024
But...

305
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:40,784
Let me take a look

306
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:42,264
at what good food we have here.

307
00:15:49,744 --> 00:15:52,065
Our prodigious talent

308
00:15:52,264 --> 00:15:54,185
has extremely different dishes.

309
00:15:54,345 --> 00:15:55,024
Sun.

310
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:57,105
Why is our food so different?

311
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:01,264
You can have it.

312
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:09,705
Let me tell you this.

313
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:10,985
In the entire capital,

314
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:12,705
all girls and women

315
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:13,904
ranging from eighteen to eighty

316
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:15,345
admire our Shen...

317
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:16,105
Enough said.

318
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:17,624
You're shy.

319
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:18,384
However,

320
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:20,345
you took the advantage to approach

321
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:21,024
the ladies' choice first.

322
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:21,985
Isn't this infuriating?

323
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:22,864
Sun.

324
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:25,065
What do you mean by I took
the advantage to approach him?

325
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:26,144
Don't play dumb.

326
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,425
Jinghong gave his food to you just now.

327
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:29,664
Besides,

328
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:32,864
the lovey-dovey secret meeting

329
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:34,144
between you and Jinghong

330
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:35,225
has been written into a huaben.

331
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:36,504
It's now making the rounds
in the entire capital.

332
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:37,264
To be honest,

333
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:38,744
I bought one copy too.

334
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:42,585
Here, let me show you this.

335
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:47,425
"The Pretty Tanhua
Meets the Zhuangyuan at Night."

336
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:48,105
Exactly.

337
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:56,945
Sun. You know what,

338
00:16:56,945 --> 00:16:58,744
the story is so well written.

339
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:02,904
Ms. Mu, you sure have a big heart.

340
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:04,625
Well, stop teasing us.

341
00:17:04,784 --> 00:17:05,504
We'll eat this together.

342
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:06,425
- Sure thing.
- Happy now?

343
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:07,185
Give me a hand.

344
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:14,385
(Does Lord Ding know about this too?)

345
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:17,544
(I just confessed to him the day before,)

346
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:18,905
(and now this misunderstanding
has happened.)

347
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:21,104
(What should I do now?)

348
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,285
(Jishan Hall)

349
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:44,784
(I shouldn't have this expectation.)

350
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,665
(She never fell for me.)

351
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,824
(She wouldn't care about those rumors.)

352
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:55,185
Official Shen.

353
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:56,865
Are you here for Her Highness?

354
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:02,104
Your Highness.

355
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:04,824
Have you finished teaching the kids?

356
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,705
Yes, just finished it.

357
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:08,985
So I'm thinking

358
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:10,504
of bidding you farewell
when I see you here.

359
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:25,036
(Department of State Affairs)

360
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:28,905
(I must explain the rumor
to Lord Ding today.)

361
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,185
My Lord, Mu Zhuohua seeks your audience.

362
00:18:35,024 --> 00:18:35,985
What does she come here for?

363
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:39,985
Perhaps she wants to explain
why she seduced you...

364
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:45,584
Why she seduced Shen Jinghong.

365
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:49,544
I'm busy.

366
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:51,584
I don't have time for trivial matters.

367
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:53,865
Tell her to leave.

368
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:55,625
Yes.

369
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:04,865
Ms. Mu.

370
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,985
Lord Ding is preoccupied with work.

371
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:08,264
He wants you to go back.

372
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:11,865
Thank you.

373
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:28,784
Ms. Mu, why are you here again?

374
00:19:29,504 --> 00:19:32,504
I had some trouble
when I was compiling the documents

375
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:33,985
of Northern Liang.

376
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:36,744
Hence, I want to seek guidance
from Lord Ding.

377
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:38,584
Too bad.

378
00:19:39,064 --> 00:19:40,784
His Lordship has left for some business.

379
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:42,584
He has left?

380
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:46,024
Thank you.

381
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:51,744
He's not here again.

382
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:12,665
Let's go.

383
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:18,385
Young Lady, must we really do this?

384
00:20:19,104 --> 00:20:20,064
Yes, Juli.

385
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:22,425
Show your bird-catching skills
from your childhood.

386
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:24,104
One shot at it.

387
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:25,304
I'll try.

388
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:29,145
Here they are.

389
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:30,304
Come on. You can do it.

390
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:34,264
Hyah!

391
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:37,385
It didn't work.

392
00:20:37,665 --> 00:20:38,824
Let's try with a stone.

393
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:39,665
All right.

394
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:43,744
Here they are, Young Lady.

395
00:20:50,104 --> 00:20:50,665
It's a stone.

396
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:52,584
Protect His Lordship.

397
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,905
My Lord, the carriage is broken.

398
00:20:57,264 --> 00:20:58,344
Bull's eye, Young Lady.

399
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:04,744
No, don't do this.

400
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:05,625
It's a misunderstanding.

401
00:21:11,544 --> 00:21:12,425
It can't be fixed.

402
00:21:18,145 --> 00:21:18,905
My Lord.

403
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,264
How fortuitous. You're here too.

404
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:24,824
This is the only way
that leads from Lord Ding's Residence

405
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:25,784
to the palace.

406
00:21:29,064 --> 00:21:31,264
Something's wrong with your carriage.

407
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:32,865
Drop the act.

408
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:34,865
My Lord.

409
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:36,584
She did this.

410
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:39,385
How could it be? I...

411
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:40,104
I didn't...

412
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:41,425
My Lord, I...

413
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,264
Ms. Mu.

414
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:44,304
Do you have a lot of time on your hands?

415
00:21:45,824 --> 00:21:46,544
No.

416
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:49,425
We have many tasks at Hanlin Academy.

417
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:52,304
Zhijian.

418
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:55,024
Claim the repair fee from them.

419
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:56,304
Yes.

420
00:21:59,024 --> 00:22:00,385
My Lord, wait.

421
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:02,584
My Lord.

422
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:03,425
Ms. Mu.

423
00:22:04,264 --> 00:22:06,185
You keep coming to me and pestering me.

424
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:07,584
What exactly are you up to?

425
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:08,625
My Lord.

426
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,344
Have you heard any rumors recently?

427
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:14,225
I'm busy,

428
00:22:14,945 --> 00:22:16,665
and I don't have time
to care about your rumors.

429
00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:20,665
Please don't be angry, My Lord.

430
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:22,744
Someone fabricated that.

431
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:28,625
Why should I be angry?

432
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:33,744
My Lord, I must say,

433
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:35,625
this is somehow related to you.

434
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:39,905
My Lord, please don't be angry

435
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:41,705
and hear me out.

436
00:22:42,304 --> 00:22:43,344
A few days ago,

437
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:44,945
I had a gathering with my fellows

438
00:22:44,945 --> 00:22:46,504
in Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

439
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:47,945
At that time,

440
00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:49,225
I had a wound

441
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:50,185
on my neck.

442
00:22:50,665 --> 00:22:52,744
So, I was thinking to cover it up

443
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:53,905
with a robe.

444
00:22:54,544 --> 00:22:56,425
But I forgot about that

445
00:22:56,705 --> 00:22:58,344
and took the robe off

446
00:22:58,504 --> 00:22:59,784
after I got some drink.

447
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:01,905
Plus, I ran into Shen
when he left to avoid drinking.

448
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:03,705
Unfortunately,

449
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:05,544
our fellow at Hanlin Academy
caught us being together.

450
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:08,064
And worst,

451
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:09,264
he saw

452
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:11,064
the red mark on my neck.

453
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:12,784
He thought

454
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:15,945
Shen and I...

455
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:18,985
And everyone misunderstood us.

456
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,425
But, in fact, the red mark on my neck

457
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,024
was left by you.

458
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:28,824
I didn't defend myself

459
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:30,385
to maintain your reputation.

460
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,985
Yet you've been ignoring me.

461
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:34,544
I feel

462
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:35,865
very upset.

463
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:43,145
All right, got it.

464
00:23:46,824 --> 00:23:47,705
Got it?

465
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:51,225
I've explained so much.

466
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:52,905
Does he really understand?

467
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:58,304
His Lordship asks for you.

468
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,264
He actually wants to see me now.

469
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:08,584
What a weird woman.

470
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,584
She has such a bare-faced cheek.

471
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:13,584
Even a strong man
is afraid of a clingy woman.

472
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:14,824
Intriguing.

473
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:24,665
We're so fated, My Lord.

474
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,705
Is the carriage fixed already?

475
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:30,504
Yes.

476
00:25:36,264 --> 00:25:39,225
Did you do your work well today?

477
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:43,225
I reviewed the border's trading records
for the past three years.

478
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:45,064
Have you finished them?

479
00:25:46,104 --> 00:25:47,064
Yes, it was a tiring day

480
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,225
and I didn't even have time
to take a sip.

481
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:52,465
Tell me

482
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:55,185
the record on the 13th day
of the 9th month

483
00:25:55,185 --> 00:25:56,705
in the 12th year of Zhaoming.

484
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:01,824
The 13th day of the 9th month
in the 12th year of Zhaoming.

485
00:26:03,465 --> 00:26:04,304
I got it.

486
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:07,504
On this day,

487
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,145
the import
registered two hundred steel blades,

488
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,504
fifty cattle,

489
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:15,544
thirty horses,

490
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:18,865
while the export registered
five hundred dan of rice grains,

491
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,945
three hundred bolts of fabrics,

492
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:23,784
one hundred jin of tea leaves,

493
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:25,544
and thirty jin of salt.

494
00:26:26,264 --> 00:26:27,465
You actually memorized all?

495
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:29,705
I remember everything I read.

496
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:31,344
The thing is,

497
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,985
can you remember that?

498
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:38,185
You wouldn't know

499
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:39,264
even if I made up the whole thing.

500
00:26:56,504 --> 00:26:57,225
My Lord.

501
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:59,385
Yipin Bakery is on the corner
right ahead.

502
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:00,945
At this time,

503
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:02,865
there happens to be
fresh crispy pastry available.

504
00:27:03,945 --> 00:27:05,465
There is always a long line
outside the store.

505
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:08,705
But if your carriage were to go there,

506
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:10,104
it'd be a great honor for them.

507
00:27:10,185 --> 00:27:11,544
Naturally, we won't have to
wait in line.

508
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:17,544
You know what,

509
00:27:17,905 --> 00:27:20,225
their crispy pastry is delicious.

510
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,784
They chose the finest fillet

511
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:24,064
for chopping

512
00:27:24,145 --> 00:27:26,304
and marinating in their unique sauce.

513
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,185
Then, it's wrapped and deep-fried.

514
00:27:28,665 --> 00:27:29,905
The outer skin

515
00:27:29,905 --> 00:27:31,945
is made through special procedures.

516
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:33,344
When you bite it,

517
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:35,784
it unfolds into layers of crispy skins

518
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:38,625
and savory juices ooze out.

519
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,145
A blend of fragrance and mild spiciness

520
00:27:40,145 --> 00:27:41,344
together with the savory taste.

521
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,865
Zhimo, His Lordship is hungry.

522
00:27:50,104 --> 00:27:51,344
Let's go and buy the crispy pastry.

523
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:53,784
My Lord.

524
00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:55,584
Go ahead.

525
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:03,385
After you, My Lord.

526
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:21,665
You took big bites.

527
00:28:22,665 --> 00:28:24,625
My Lord, you were born in a noble origin

528
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,905
with many rules.

529
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:27,225
But it's best

530
00:28:27,344 --> 00:28:29,344
to take big bites
when we're eating this.

531
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:32,225
Have you ever followed the rules

532
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:34,145
when you're with me?

533
00:28:35,784 --> 00:28:37,905
Because you're generous to tolerate me,
My Lord.

534
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:40,504
That's why I act boldly, slightly.

535
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:47,264
Tastes good?

536
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:05,024
About Shen Jinghong and you,

537
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:07,784
you don't have to explain this to me.

538
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:08,824
But it's better

539
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:11,264
not to stand out.

540
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:13,344
That won't do, My Lord.

541
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,024
I must explain this to you.

542
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:15,865
Otherwise,

543
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:17,985
you might think I'm a deceitful person.

544
00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:26,584
I don't see why not.

545
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:30,544
But I know

546
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,185
you did this because you admire me.

547
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,465
It has nothing to do
with the path you choose.

548
00:29:37,504 --> 00:29:38,385
Maybe

549
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,064
you can get off and think it over.

550
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,544
Get off?

551
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:47,344
He actually drove me
out of the carriage.

552
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,285
(Zhixing College)

553
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:13,264
I, Mu Zhuohua,
the editor of Hanlin Academy,

554
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:14,865
offer my greetings, Your Highness.

555
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:39,225
Today,

556
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,344
we're going to learn

557
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:43,744
geography.

558
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:46,625
Ms. Mu, don't you need a scroll
during the lecture?

559
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:50,425
The content is all in my brain,

560
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:51,465
not on scrolls.

561
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:00,465
(It's Uncle's jade pendant.)

562
00:31:02,665 --> 00:31:04,104
How great of you.

563
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:05,824
Giving a lecture without teaching aid.

564
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,225
You must be smarter than Mr. Shen,
aren't you?

565
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:12,824
Indeed.

566
00:31:13,865 --> 00:31:16,344
At first, you were on a power trip
using the name of my uncle,

567
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:18,425
then, you curried favor
with Shen Jinghong

568
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:20,104
and got rumors spread about you and him.

569
00:31:21,905 --> 00:31:23,344
Nurturing the border enemy?

570
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:24,985
It's all nonsense.

571
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:29,385
We fought our way out to claim lands.

572
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:30,945
(He's cracking the whip)

573
00:31:30,945 --> 00:31:33,024
(on the first day of the lecture.)

574
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:35,024
(It's going to be hard times ahead.)

575
00:31:35,024 --> 00:31:35,905
Chen.

576
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:38,705
You should give Ms. Mu a chance.

577
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:41,145
Though she's young,

578
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:44,024
I believe she boasts genuine talent

579
00:31:44,465 --> 00:31:46,104
to pass the exam as a Tanhua.

580
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,504
Chen has always been arrogant.

581
00:31:49,104 --> 00:31:51,104
Only talents like Mr. Shen

582
00:31:51,385 --> 00:31:52,665
can impress him.

583
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:58,344
I appreciate true talents
and treat them with respect.

584
00:32:00,304 --> 00:32:01,665
Today, I shall see

585
00:32:02,544 --> 00:32:04,104
what genuine talent you've got.

586
00:32:08,304 --> 00:32:10,024
A map?

587
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:13,705
I drew this map.

588
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:17,865
Your Highness, each of you
will either rule the nation

589
00:32:18,344 --> 00:32:19,584
or station in a region.

590
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:22,385
Therefore, you need to know
about the regional geography.

591
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,744
As the old saying goes,

592
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:26,304
"Knowing everything about the universe
and the earth."

593
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,504
Geography is related
to people's livelihood and politics.

594
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:30,824
It's compulsory for you.

595
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:32,841
Do you know the geography
of Northern Liang

596
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:33,544
and Eastern Xia too?

597
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:35,705
People think

598
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:36,905
that both Northern Liang and Eastern Xia

599
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:40,625
are located in the wilderness, desert,
insect-infected wetlands, or swamps,

600
00:32:41,304 --> 00:32:42,665
which have no value.

601
00:32:43,225 --> 00:32:45,744
However, they're clueless
about the advantage of these locations.

602
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,985
If you're interested in knowing more,

603
00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:50,024
I can share it with you.

604
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:53,504
Northern Liang is rich
in iron ore mines.

605
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:55,425
They forged sharp steel blades

606
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:57,024
and gallant war steeds.

607
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:01,544
Northern Liang is the fallen enemy
of Southern Chen.

608
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:03,784
They are neither sharp nor gallant.

609
00:33:05,945 --> 00:33:06,865
Throughout history,

610
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,750
Southern Chen has waged wars
against Northern Liang

611
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,504
over a thousand times,

612
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:12,705
but we've never brought them down.

613
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:15,264
Superficially, they seem to be reckless.

614
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:18,344
But, in fact, they are devious.

615
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,145
They spared no effort to win a battle

616
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:22,985
to earn their right
to negotiate for peace.

617
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:25,304
You're right, Ms. Mu.

618
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:26,824
Chen.

619
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:29,344
Back then, Northern Liang exploited

620
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:31,584
your defeat in the war

621
00:33:31,985 --> 00:33:34,784
to haggle over terms
in the peace negotiation.

622
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,024
What did you say just now?

623
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,344
You merely live a high life
in the palace.

624
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:46,865
Do you know anything
about an actual war?

625
00:33:48,104 --> 00:33:50,145
If it weren't for the traitor
in the army,

626
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,705
Uncle and I would've razed
Northern Liang into the ground.

627
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:55,584
That matches what Ms. Mu said, though.

628
00:33:56,304 --> 00:33:57,584
Snide Northern Liang

629
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:01,544
could actually plant a spy
right under the nose of you and Uncle

630
00:34:02,264 --> 00:34:03,985
and blatantly blinded you both.

631
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:09,504
Who are you to mock us?

632
00:34:10,345 --> 00:34:12,024
All you do is hide in the palace.

633
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:14,465
Only Uncle and I

634
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:16,704
were fighting at the front line.

635
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:18,305
I could've fought at the front line too.

636
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:20,104
But I didn't have a chance.

637
00:34:20,385 --> 00:34:21,184
Chen.

638
00:34:22,425 --> 00:34:23,425
Speaking of martial skills,

639
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:25,865
I doubt that you can defeat me.

640
00:34:34,184 --> 00:34:34,825
Fine.

641
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:38,664
Let's have a spar today.

642
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,104
Whoever admits defeat first

643
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:43,504
is a coward.

644
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,305
First Prince.

645
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,745
Second Prince, please stop them.

646
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:02,544
Second Prince.

647
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:04,224
Maybe you should inform Lord Ding.

648
00:35:04,345 --> 00:35:06,664
They listen to Lord Ding.

649
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:15,305
First Prince.

650
00:35:16,305 --> 00:35:17,064
First Prince.

651
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,265
Third Prince, please stop.

652
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:21,865
Your Highness.

653
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:24,504
It's a geography lecture today,
no martial training.

654
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:27,144
His Majesty would be furious

655
00:35:27,144 --> 00:35:28,544
if he saw this.

656
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:33,584
Please stop, Your Highness.

657
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:34,544
Stop fighting.

658
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,064
Pretend that you go out
to find Lord Ding.

659
00:35:41,064 --> 00:35:41,785
Yes.

660
00:35:47,985 --> 00:35:48,704
Stop fighting.

661
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:53,865
Chen, Jin.

662
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:55,305
Why are you fighting here?

663
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:56,584
We're all brothers.

664
00:35:57,064 --> 00:35:58,624
Let's stop before hurting each other.

665
00:35:58,825 --> 00:35:59,905
Yu, don't worry.

666
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:01,865
I won't hurt Chen.

667
00:36:02,144 --> 00:36:03,624
Watch yourself around me instead.

668
00:36:06,704 --> 00:36:07,504
Your Highness.

669
00:36:07,704 --> 00:36:09,184
Lord Ding isn't
at the Court of Territorial Affairs.

670
00:36:09,385 --> 00:36:10,385
I left them a note.

671
00:36:10,465 --> 00:36:11,544
They will relay the message to Lord Ding

672
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,544
once he returns.

673
00:36:17,504 --> 00:36:18,305
Your Highness.

674
00:36:18,584 --> 00:36:19,385
Stop fighting.

675
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:23,985
Third Prince.

676
00:36:28,624 --> 00:36:30,624
Jin, listen to me.

677
00:36:30,664 --> 00:36:31,825
Chen has fought

678
00:36:31,825 --> 00:36:32,785
in real wars.

679
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:34,385
No need to feel ashamed
if you lost to him.

680
00:36:34,865 --> 00:36:36,224
How could I lose?

681
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:38,785
He just went for a few defeated wars.

682
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:41,865
I'm going to beat you
until you shut your mouth.

683
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:44,345
Yu.

684
00:36:45,624 --> 00:36:46,385
Yu.

685
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:47,385
Second Prince.

686
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:48,905
I'm going all out.

687
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:07,224
Your Highness, are you all right?

688
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:07,985
First Prince!

689
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:10,144
- Get the imperial physician now!
- First Prince.

690
00:37:10,425 --> 00:37:11,305
Are you all right, Your Highness?

691
00:37:12,345 --> 00:37:13,945
- Are you all right?
- Please let me check on your wound.

692
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:15,224
How dare you! Get off me!

693
00:37:16,144 --> 00:37:16,745
Yu.

694
00:37:17,745 --> 00:37:18,664
I didn't mean to hurt him.

695
00:37:18,664 --> 00:37:19,425
First Prince.

696
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,624
Your blood vessel is punctured.

697
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,024
It's urgent.

698
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,745
I know some healing skills.

699
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:26,785
Please allow me to perform acupuncture
to stop the bleeding.

700
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:28,865
No. What if you make a mistake?

701
00:37:29,184 --> 00:37:29,865
Where's the imperial physician?

702
00:37:30,305 --> 00:37:31,144
Why are you standing here?

703
00:37:31,144 --> 00:37:31,985
Go and bring
the imperial physician over.

704
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:32,544
Yes.

705
00:37:32,945 --> 00:37:33,504
First Prince.

706
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:35,224
Your wound needs
to be handled right now.

707
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:37,425
I swear with my life,

708
00:37:37,584 --> 00:37:38,704
I won't hurt you.

709
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,110
(Ciming Hall)

710
00:37:49,905 --> 00:37:51,664
Your Majesty, bad news!

711
00:37:52,024 --> 00:37:54,624
The First Prince and the Third Prince
fought in the Zhixing College.

712
00:37:54,704 --> 00:37:56,144
Peilan, get ready with the sedan chair.

713
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:57,865
I'm going to Zhixing College now.

714
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:06,224
First Prince, please bear with it.

715
00:38:42,104 --> 00:38:43,584
The bleeding stops.

716
00:38:49,905 --> 00:38:52,024
I owe you a favor.

717
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,064
Carry His Highness back
to his chamber now.

718
00:38:56,385 --> 00:38:57,144
Yes.

719
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:04,785
Third Prince, please let me
check on your wound.

720
00:39:04,785 --> 00:39:05,865
No... No need.

721
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:06,825
It's just skin trauma.

722
00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:16,865
Yu.

723
00:39:18,504 --> 00:39:19,785
I lost it.

724
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:21,745
Luckily, she knows about healing skills.

725
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:23,825
Yes.

726
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:25,905
Unexpectedly, she's skilled.

727
00:39:27,224 --> 00:39:28,945
I guess Chen's leg

728
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:30,745
is saved.

729
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:33,425
Yes, it's saved.

730
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:36,825
Here comes Her Majesty.

731
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:48,305
Greetings, Grandmother.

732
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:49,584
Chen.

733
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:50,945
Don't worry, Grandmother.

734
00:39:51,385 --> 00:39:52,584
I'm all right now.

735
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:55,224
What are you waiting for?

736
00:39:55,224 --> 00:39:56,825
Go and check on him.

737
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:57,704
Yes.

738
00:40:11,184 --> 00:40:11,945
Your Majesty.

739
00:40:12,504 --> 00:40:13,905
His Highness
has a punctured blood vessel.

740
00:40:14,104 --> 00:40:15,905
Fortunately, the bleeding stops.

741
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:18,024
Otherwise, he'd be
in critical condition.

742
00:40:18,504 --> 00:40:21,024
Bodhisattva bless me. Amitabha.

743
00:40:21,305 --> 00:40:22,265
To my surprise,

744
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:24,184
you're the real deal.

745
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:33,144
You're Mu Zhuohua?

746
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,144
I, Mu Zhuohua,
the editor of Hanlin Academy,

747
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:38,104
offer my greetings, Your Majesty.

748
00:40:38,265 --> 00:40:38,985
Insolent!

749
00:40:41,544 --> 00:40:42,265
Grandmother.

750
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:43,664
Chen.

751
00:40:44,064 --> 00:40:45,144
Worry not and sit back.

752
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:47,704
I'll handle this for you.

753
00:40:48,104 --> 00:40:48,785
Grandmother.

754
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:50,664
It has nothing to do with Ms. Mu.

755
00:40:51,465 --> 00:40:52,504
Liu Jin

756
00:40:53,104 --> 00:40:53,905
insulted me just now.

757
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:55,785
I was too angry,

758
00:40:56,544 --> 00:40:57,504
so I fought him.

759
00:40:58,064 --> 00:40:59,305
No, I didn't, Grandmother.

760
00:40:59,664 --> 00:41:00,945
He provoked me first.

761
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,024
You're injured too?

762
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,265
Go and check on the Third Prince.

763
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:06,144
Yes.

764
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:17,704
Your Majesty.

765
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:19,265
His Highness has skin trauma.

766
00:41:19,465 --> 00:41:20,345
He's all right.

767
00:41:20,985 --> 00:41:21,985
Mu Zhuohua.

768
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:25,704
