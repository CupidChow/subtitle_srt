=The Legend of Zhuohua=

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 22=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,690
Lord Ding's flute playing

21
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,050
was once renowned in the capital.

22
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,449
How about performing

23
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,009
a duet with Yunyun?

24
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:01,610
I believe the music
will be pleasing to the ear.

25
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,890
If Your Lordship
didn't bring your flute,

26
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,650
I can offer this Lingxi flute as a gift.

27
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:17,444
As they say,
a treasured sword for a hero.

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,400
This Lingxi flute will not be a waste

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,479
if it's in your hands.

30
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,370
Today is the Tongxin Festival.

31
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,490
Miss Sun has been infatuated
with Lord Ding for many years.

32
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,810
For her to give him this flute
at this moment,

33
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:32,169
I'm afraid she's trying
to establish a connection.

34
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,849
Miss Sun is the daughter
of the wealthiest family in the capital.

35
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,410
She almost became the Consort Ding
in the past.

36
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,930
You could say they're rekindling
their relationship.

37
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,009
Miss Sun unexpectedly
has genuine feelings for Lord Ding.

38
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,970
Their social statuses
are also compatible.

39
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,530
You're right.

40
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,009
I believe they will get married soon.

41
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,049
They're both gifted and attractive,
it's bound to work.

42
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,729
They're a match made in Heaven.

43
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:10,930
Zhijian,

44
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,729
fetch my flute.

45
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,060
(Duyou)

46
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,090
Everything relies on fate.

47
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,729
As for this Lingxi flute,
I'm not meant to own it.

48
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,889
I only love the one in my hand.

49
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,690
No amount of wealth can compare

50
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:44,729
to what my heart desires.

51
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,235
(Duyou)

52
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:19,730
Sitting alone languidly
in the bamboo groove,

53
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,930
plucking the strings while singing.

54
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:00,769
Your Majesty,

55
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,050
I couldn't help

56
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,409
but play a tune

57
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:05,730
when I saw this flute.

58
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:08,610
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

59
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,290
It's all right.

60
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:14,690
Your skill has become even more refined.

61
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,050
Your Majesty.

62
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:41,170
While in Jiangzuo, I heard

63
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:43,089
this year's Tanhua, Mu Zhuohua,

64
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,009
is an exceptionally talented lady

65
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:47,769
and she's good at writing poetry.

66
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,649
I wonder if we're fortunate enough

67
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:53,009
to appreciate
one of Tanhua Mu's great works today.

68
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:07,449
What could Miss Sun's intention be?

69
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:08,730
Don't worry.

70
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:11,250
Since Miss Mu is a Tanhua,

71
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,730
her skills in poetry and literature
must be remarkable.

72
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:14,889
Makes sense.

73
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:16,089
Uncle,

74
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,449
could Miss Sun have been deceived?

75
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,850
Mu Zhuohua may excel
in various areas of learning.

76
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,889
But only her poetry

77
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:29,209
is truly unbearable.

78
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:30,370
Deceived?

79
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,370
That's unlikely.

80
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:38,850
Grandmother,

81
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,409
I invited Official Mu
as a distinguished guest.

82
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:47,009
She has been busy
with state affairs lately

83
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,209
and hardly has any leisure.

84
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:50,250
Coincidentally, you wanted
to celebrate Tongxin Festival

85
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,690
with a feast.

86
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,250
So I intended to use this as an excuse

87
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,569
for her to come here for some leisure.

88
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,050
How could we burden her
with scholarly matters?

89
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:01,930
It's not as serious as you've put it.

90
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:03,889
It's only putting a poem together.

91
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,649
How is this a scholarly matter?

92
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,610
His Majesty often praises her talents

93
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,370
in front of me.

94
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,089
Writing a poem quickly and effortlessly

95
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:17,089
must be a piece of cake for her.

96
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,690
What do you think, Ms. Mu?

97
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:24,449
I...

98
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,649
Since Your Majesty has requested,

99
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,889
how could I dare to decline?

100
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,130
Currently, the lotus flowers
are in full bloom.

101
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,649
I'll use the lotus as the theme then.

102
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:12,130
"Standing in the clear lotus pond,

103
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,449
grace that surpasses all.

104
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,529
If you ask what possessions I have,

105
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,370
they are the lotus seeds
and lotus roots."

106
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:40,490
Is this the poem of the current Tanhua?

107
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,730
Am I too lacking

108
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:43,889
to understand it?

109
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:47,809
Is this some kind
of new school of thought?

110
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:49,289
Do you understand it?

111
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:50,289
No, I don't.

112
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,409
That poem sounds odd.

113
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:54,850
Forgive me for my lack of talent.

114
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,769
My poems have always been like this.

115
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:00,570
It's different from what I had expected.

116
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:05,850
Accessible and easy to understand.

117
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,970
Common yet elegant.

118
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:13,730
It's very close to daily life.

119
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,370
Uncle, you're right.

120
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,610
A poem with only four lines.

121
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,450
Ms. Mu, you're truly quick-witted.

122
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,409
So that's how it's interpreted.

123
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,090
It's actually not bad.

124
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,450
Does His Lordship enjoy sloppy poetry?

125
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:04,929
Zhuohua,

126
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:06,929
I'm truly sorry about that.

127
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,610
I invited you so you could relax.

128
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,610
But I ended up causing you trouble.

129
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,649
Your Highness, please don't say that.

130
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:15,289
My skill in composing poetry

131
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:16,409
is really lacking.

132
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:18,370
What's there to hide?

133
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,169
No one is perfect, right?

134
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:22,929
It's precisely
because of this missing piece

135
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,210
that makes it human.

136
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,210
Your way of thinking is quite unique.

137
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,490
Yet, it makes sense.

138
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,169
Even the full moon has its waxing

139
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:33,649
and waning phases.

140
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:34,809
That's what keeps it interesting.

141
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,009
Your Highness, watch the steps.

142
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,529
Miss Sun.

143
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,210
How long do you plan
on following me around?

144
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,769
My Lord, forgive me

145
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,730
for bothering you.

146
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,330
It's just...

147
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,169
It's just that I've admired you
for seven years.

148
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:58,490
I couldn't help my feelings...

149
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,330
Miss Sun.

150
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,610
Not all seeds can sprout

151
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:05,649
and not all flowering plants bear fruit.

152
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,730
Miss Sun from the Sun family
is indeed elegant and talented.

153
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,330
She and Uncle are also well-matched
in terms of their backgrounds.

154
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,649
What's rare

155
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,970
is her sincere devotion to Uncle.

156
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,330
Mr. Shen,

157
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,169
I heard on the Tongxin Festival

158
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,250
that young men and women
from Southern Chen exchange gifts.

159
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:40,090
So did you come
to Princess's Residence today

160
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,289
to give me a gift?

161
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,529
Princess Jing'an,

162
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,169
I have already made it clear.

163
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,210
I came today to seek an audience
with Princess Roujia.

164
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,769
You really don't know
how to take a joke.

165
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,169
But it's all right.

166
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,769
Giving you one is the same.

167
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:57,809
Your Highness,
you might have misunderstood.

168
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,210
In Southern Chen,

169
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,809
I am not allowed to accept gifts.

170
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,169
Not allowed to accept gifts?
Not even on Tongxin Festival?

171
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:06,730
You're quite dull, aren't you?

172
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,130
Your Highness,
would you like some snacks?

173
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,370
Greetings, Your Highness.

174
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,330
I've prepared a gift for you today.

175
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:25,610
I hope you can accept it.

176
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:31,689
It's all right.

177
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:43,850
Princess Jing'an,

178
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,169
Princess Roujia and Official Shen
have important matters to discuss.

179
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:49,723
Shall I have someone send you back?

180
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:05,330
This gift holds

181
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,370
special significance for you.

182
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:09,570
Don't you want to open it
and take a look?

183
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:33,570
I can't believe you actually...

184
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:36,649
As long as Your Highness likes it.

185
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:41,730
Well,

186
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,289
I shall take my leave.

187
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:47,370
Official Shen.

188
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,850
It's been a while
since we last played weiqi together.

189
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,689
Perhaps

190
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:01,049
we could play one round?

191
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:04,610
Sure.

192
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,490
Look.

193
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:09,649
What do you think?

194
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,130
I've chosen a good gift, haven't I?

195
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,850
It's a signature dish from Yipin Bakery.

196
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,570
I waited in line
for a long time to get it.

197
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,330
Let me see yours.

198
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:23,929
Did you spy on what I bought?

199
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:36,450
His Lordship gave you a day off

200
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,610
to celebrate the festival.

201
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:38,689
Yet, you came here

202
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,769
to give her a pork knuckle as a gift.

203
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,529
You two are even eating together.

204
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,490
Young Lady said
food is the people's top priority.

205
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,610
What's wrong with eating?

206
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:54,330
I think it's good.

207
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:58,809
All right, then.

208
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,529
In any case, lovers' festivals

209
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:03,570
aren't my cup of tea.

210
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,570
It doesn't matter what you eat.

211
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,850
Your happiness is all that matters.

212
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,169
You can keep on eating.

213
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,130
I'll just watch.

214
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,649
Go on.

215
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:14,889
Eat up.

216
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,370
Great.

217
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,529
Today has been quite fruitful.

218
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:41,409
When have I ever not given you money?

219
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,450
Not at all.

220
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,090
My Lord, my livelihood depends on you.

221
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:53,889
My Lord,

222
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,409
we found him.

223
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,450
Come with me.

224
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,289
My Lord.

225
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,370
Today is Imperial Physician Zhao's
rest day.

226
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,090
This is Imperial Physician Lu.

227
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,529
Official Mu.

228
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:17,809
(Imperial Physician Lu of Southern Chen)

229
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,850
(Imperial Physician Lu of Southern Chen)
General Xue fell off a cliff.

230
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,649
His meridians are all damaged

231
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,769
and his blood circulation is blocked.

232
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,730
That's why he remains unconscious.

233
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,409
Imperial Physician Lu,

234
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,929
do you have a way to save him?

235
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,929
To bring him back from near-death,

236
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:34,889
only the Snow Dust Pill
can make that happen.

237
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,169
But there's no more Snow Dust Pill.

238
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:48,049
I heard you also possess
exceptional acupuncture skills.

239
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,450
It's only for something minor.

240
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,850
I just administered acupuncture
a moment ago

241
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:59,130
and managed to hold onto
General Xue's last breath.

242
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:01,769
For the current plan,

243
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,610
Official Mu and I
will take turns applying acupuncture

244
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:07,649
to get rid of blood stasis.

245
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,290
At least it will have some effect.

246
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,729
Then I'll leave it to both of you.

247
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,130
All right.

248
00:17:25,889 --> 00:17:26,689
What?

249
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,249
You're saying Miss Sun
went to the printing house

250
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,249
to buy my selected poems?

251
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,489
What's so appealing
about my selected poems?

252
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,290
I don't know.

253
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,610
Mr. Xu, the bookstore owner,
said the same thing.

254
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,530
He said that too?

255
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,169
How could he insult me like this?

256
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,969
But, Young Lady,

257
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,689
isn't that the truth?

258
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:46,689
Well, that's true.

259
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,729
Then what did Miss Sun say?

260
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,130
She said she just wants
to buy your selected poems

261
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,729
to study them.

262
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:55,130
Study?

263
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,010
Young Lady,

264
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,449
is there something wrong

265
00:17:57,449 --> 00:17:58,770
with Miss Sun's judgment?

266
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,010
How about this?

267
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:04,850
Juli,

268
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,850
as for the money,

269
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,530
we definitely can't let others
profit from it.

270
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,249
Go back and tell Mr. Xu this.

271
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:10,370
Tell him

272
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,570
that I will personally compile
the selected poems

273
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:14,130
and won't have any help.

274
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,689
We'll then freely earn the money

275
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,330
from him and Miss Sun.

276
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,110
(Sun's Residence)

277
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:33,090
Yunyun,

278
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,330
when did you become so studious?

279
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,010
You sure are improving yourself.

280
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:39,290
Yunqian,

281
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:40,249
come here.

282
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,729
Help me understand
the meaning of these poetry lines.

283
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:44,770
Sure.

284
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:53,810
Isn't this written by Ms. Mu?

285
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,889
Ms. Mu's handwriting is quite nice.

286
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,090
It's good for making it

287
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,969
a calligraphy model.

288
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,889
I'm not copying her handwriting.

289
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,290
I want to learn something
from her poetry.

290
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:10,729
You want to learn her style of writing?

291
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:13,249
Help me take a look.

292
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:16,889
All right.

293
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,449
"Pairs of magpies and turtledoves,

294
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:21,770
I am in Xizhou.

295
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,290
Where is the elegance and charm?

296
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,409
It's all like a dream."

297
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,249
This playful poetry by Ms. Mu

298
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,729
is becoming more interesting.

299
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:33,570
Look at this.

300
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:38,570
"None of my business."
[*an acrostic]

301
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:43,210
(None of My Business)

302
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,969
She'll give you a hard time

303
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:52,969
for teasing her like this.

304
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,249
I'm an official of the Ministry of Revenue
who works from dawn till dusk.

305
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,850
I have no dealings

306
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:01,330
with a noble lady like her.

307
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:03,330
She won't have a chance to mess with me.

308
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,729
Mother,

309
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,169
I met His Lordship first.

310
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:38,130
Don't worry.

311
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,409
I've dealt with those who kidnapped you.

312
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:42,649
I'll have someone send you home.

313
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,249
My daughter traveled all this way

314
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,649
so she can become Consort Ding,

315
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,130
not to be mistreated.

316
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:53,850
(Mrs. Sun, wife of Sun Ru)

317
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,810
(Mrs. Sun, wife of Sun Ru)
So what if Mu Zhuohua

318
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:56,530
(Mrs. Sun, wife of Sun Ru)
is the Ministry of Revenue's director?

319
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,810
She's still a country bumpkin.

320
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,889
I'll enter the palace to meet
with Dowager Empress

321
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,169
and request her intervention.

322
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,530
Mother,

323
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:06,370
Dowager Empress

324
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,610
has done a lot for me.

325
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,249
How could I

326
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:10,929
possibly burden her further?

327
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:13,370
So you mean...

328
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,449
Mother,

329
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,850
this is between Mu Zhuohua and me.

330
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,649
I've received education
from esteemed teachers since young.

331
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,530
Regarding intellectual skills,
I won't be inferior to her.

332
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:25,889
I intend to compete with her head-on.

333
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,240
(Ministry of Revenue)

334
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,689
Official Li.

335
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:31,770
Thank you.

336
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:40,010
Greetings, Lord Ding.

337
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,050
Ms. Mu, you're also here.

338
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:46,489
That's not her.

339
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,050
I'm Yunyun
from the Sun family of Jiangzuo.

340
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,689
In the future, I'll be observing affairs
at the Ministry of Revenue.

341
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:04,050
I respectfully seek advice
on matters of court,

342
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:05,200
(Official Song of the Ministry of Revenue)
and I hope you won't hesitate

343
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,169
(Official Song of the Ministry of Revenue)
to offer guidance.

344
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,810
Sun family of Jiangzuo?

345
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:13,969
I wonder what your connection
to Minister Sun is.

346
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,729
He's my father.

347
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:20,689
So you're Minister Sun's daughter?

348
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,850
So this is the one

349
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,770
who has admired Lord Ding for years?

350
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,290
She has fulfilled her wish then?

351
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,050
Truly elegant and dignified as rumored.

352
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,610
Indeed.

353
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:46,249
A perfect match

354
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,489
for Lord Ding.

355
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:49,689
Exactly.

356
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:50,929
Here, have some tea.

357
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:53,489
Official Li.

358
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:55,729
Good morning, gentlemen.

359
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,169
Good morning, Ms. Mu.

360
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,169
Ms. Mu, good morning.

361
00:22:59,249 --> 00:22:59,889
Ms. Mu,

362
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:03,929
that's Observer Sun, who just joined
the Ministry of Revenue.

363
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,649
Let's continue enjoying our tea.

364
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:18,330
Sun Yunyun, why are you here?

365
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:20,130
Mu,

366
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:23,370
you've finally come.
I've been waiting for you.

367
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,330
I suppose you arrived earlier.

368
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,209
It's because I had the fortune

369
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,209
to be traveling alongside Lord Ding.

370
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,090
Mu, have you had breakfast?

371
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,810
If not,

372
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:40,209
I have some here.

373
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:44,810
It's the pastries
His Lordship offered earlier.

374
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:47,810
No, thanks.

375
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,969
Observer Sun, you can enjoy them.

376
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,530
My Lord,

377
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,610
I personally made these pastries.

378
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,810
Would you like to try them?

379
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:26,090
Why are you laughing?

380
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,850
Did I say something wrong?

381
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:29,770
As a newcomer,

382
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,889
you can point it out to me.

383
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:35,290
It's nothing.

384
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,010
Something amusing

385
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,929
came to mind, that's all.

386
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:44,850
Do you find me foolish?

387
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,889
And you're unwilling to enlighten me?

388
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:49,370
Observer Sun, you're not foolish.

389
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,530
But too clever for your own good.

390
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,649
Why do you say so?

391
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:58,370
I don't understand.

392
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,449
It's nothing.

393
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:01,530
You'll understand in due time.

394
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,050
Please excuse me.

395
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:11,530
Is Ms. Mu not happy about this?

396
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,570
After all, she has been
the only female official here.

397
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,969
Now, there's another noble lady here.

398
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:18,969
That's impossible.

399
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,449
Ms. Mu is someone
who looks at the big picture.

400
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,409
She's not that narrow-minded.

401
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:30,050
I guess

402
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:31,969
the family you're born into
plays a crucial role in life.

403
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,649
I agree with you.

404
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:36,449
That's the Sun family of Jiangzuo.

405
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,530
Haven't you heard?

406
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,409
When the Zhous of the north
and the Suns of the south

407
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:40,889
are no longer in their place,

408
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,330
the world might even change.

409
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,850
This poem...

410
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,249
This poem is truly marvelous!

411
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,810
It's unique

412
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,169
and self-contained.

413
00:25:58,249 --> 00:26:00,290
Observer Sun, who are you praising

414
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:01,889
so highly?

415
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,729
This is Mu's poem.

416
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:08,770
Every word and phrase is original
and not overused.

417
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:11,729
Unlike me, with limited knowledge,

418
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,409
I can only follow the rhyme

419
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:14,689
and use a few allusions

420
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:16,770
to write some verses about what happens
in the ladies' chambers.

421
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:19,209
Unlike Mu, who is incredibly talented

422
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,810
and even has a collection of poems.

423
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,249
Observer Sun, your taste is...

424
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:29,330
It's certainly unconventional.

425
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:34,729
Ordinary people

426
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,729
can't appreciate Mu's poetry.

427
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,649
I wondered why that eunuch

428
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,489
was so persistent in pestering me.

429
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:50,209
He claimed an admirer was willing
to pay a high price for poems.

430
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,050
It turns out

431
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:55,209
it was you
who secretly admired my talent.

432
00:26:58,689 --> 00:26:59,409
Observer Sun,

433
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:01,649
you could've just come directly to me.

434
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,530
Why let someone else profit
from the increase in price?

435
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:11,209
I originally planned
to seek guidance from Mu.

436
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:14,810
But you're busy with official duties.

437
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:17,090
You were also rushing
even during lunch hour.

438
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:20,130
How can you find time
to fulfill my small wish?

439
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,489
You're right.

440
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,770
But since you're humbly
seeking guidance,

441
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:30,889
I can't disappoint you.

442
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,169
Observer Sun,

443
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,409
do you understand the chapter

444
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,570
I just explained?

445
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:47,409
Yes, I do.

446
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:51,330
Good. Then explain it to me.

447
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:54,850
What about explaining the second chapter?

448
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:01,409
"Admiring myself
in the water's reflection,

449
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,290
yet wondering who will receive
these plucked flowers.

450
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:05,610
Spring..."

451
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,130
Observer Sun,

452
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,090
have you memorized the second chapter?

453
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:30,969
Do you remember it?

454
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:41,610
Mu,

455
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,889
you see, it's getting late.

456
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,249
How about we call it a day?

457
00:28:47,489 --> 00:28:48,130
Very well.

458
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:50,050
We'll continue tomorrow.

459
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:53,090
Mu,

460
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:56,570
I heard that,
during the Floral Poetry Gathering,

461
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,209
your peony poem

462
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:00,929
was led by a wide margin,

463
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,889
displaying remarkable elegance.

464
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,409
Many even thought

465
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,889
it was composed by Lord Ding.

466
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:05,969
Is that true?

467
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,530
Yes.

468
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,169
Not only did Lord Ding not blame me,

469
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:15,370
but he also praised my poetic talent

470
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,969
and my excellent poem.

471
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,929
Afterward, he had a long conversation
with me through the night

472
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:23,249
and even offered to finance

473
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,729
my poetry collection.

474
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,130
Absolute nonsense!

475
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:43,729
Observer Sun,

476
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:45,889
everyone has left.

477
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,889
Aren't you tired

478
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:49,409
of pretending?

479
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,929
Mu, you've misunderstood.

480
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:55,810
I heard

481
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,889
that His Lordship greatly appreciates
your talent.

482
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,209
That's why I'm eager to learn from you.

483
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:04,449
I may be His Lordship's
childhood sweetheart.

484
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,169
But we were separated for many years.

485
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,050
I don't know
if his preferences have changed.

486
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,090
But

487
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,249
Lord Ding is known
for his deep emotional commitment.

488
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,249
Whether it's people or objects,

489
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,090
he likes to keep them close.

490
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,610
Like his Mingguang Armor,

491
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:21,770
the one he wore
on his first war expedition.

492
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:24,969
Even though His Majesty rewarded him
with a new one,

493
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:26,449
he still wears that old one.

494
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,449
Have you seen him dressed in armor,

495
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,130
leading the troops into battle?

496
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,249
I haven't seen him in an armor.

497
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,370
But I've seen him

498
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,090
without clothes.

499
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,449
Come on,
let me administer the acupuncture.

500
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,850
You're ridiculous!

501
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:03,729
Mu Zhuohua

502
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,330
surely says whatever she pleases.

503
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,010
She'll

504
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,409
tarnish Your Lordship's reputation
sooner or later.

505
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:14,689
This lady sure is troublesome.

506
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,850
Young Lady, you're back.

507
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,449
Young Lady, what's the matter?

508
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,050
Was it a tiring day?

509
00:31:32,969 --> 00:31:33,570
Not at all.

510
00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:35,370
That moneybag came.

511
00:31:36,449 --> 00:31:38,969
The way she tries to make others jealous

512
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,370
is hardly impressive.

513
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,290
I'm curious to see

514
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,169
what tricks she'll pull tomorrow.

515
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:02,010
I haven't seen him dressed in an armor,

516
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:04,169
but I've seen him

517
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,850
without clothes.

518
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,889
Mu Zhuohua,

519
00:32:28,889 --> 00:32:29,929
you've crossed the line.

520
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:35,096
(Ministry of Revenue)

521
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,489
Ms. Mu,

522
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,969
your document regarding Jiangnan
dues today.

523
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,689
Minister Xu has been asking for it
for a while now.

524
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:53,889
All right,
I'll definitely submit it today.

525
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,889
Fifty-five dan of grains.

526
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:13,889
Fifty...

527
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:22,610
Official Mu, let's have lunch together.

528
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,249
Sure. I love the food
from the Ministry of Revenue.

529
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:28,209
Let's go.

530
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:29,530
This way, please.

531
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:07,090
(Ministry of Revenue)
(Who messed with my document?)

532
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:09,010
What's the matter, Ms. Mu?

533
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,050
Official Li, look at this.

534
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:15,010
How did this happen?

535
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:15,649
What do we do?

536
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:17,410
Minister Xu is about to arrive.

537
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,090
I don't know

538
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,289
who could have done this.

539
00:34:20,729 --> 00:34:21,010
I...

540
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,729
Ms. Mu.

541
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:25,936
The document
regarding Ministry of Revenue's allocation

542
00:34:25,936 --> 00:34:26,970
for Jiangnan's grains and funds.

543
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:27,890
Have you finished sorting it out?

544
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:28,570
(Official Xu, Minister of Revenue of Southern Chen)

545
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,249
(Official Xu, Minister of Revenue of Southern Chen)
I need it now. Those from Wende Hall

546
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:32,209
(Official Xu, Minister of Revenue of Southern Chen)
are asking for it.

547
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:33,450
Minister Xu,

548
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:34,769
I...

549
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:36,769
I had gotten it all ready.

550
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:37,930
But I don't know

551
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,970
why it suddenly turned out like this.

552
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:41,890
Show it to me.

553
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:48,530
How could you modify the document

554
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,010
meant for His Majesty in such a manner?

555
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:51,570
You...

556
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:52,169
I...

557
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:53,289
Ms. Mu, you...

558
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:54,970
Minister Xu,

559
00:34:57,249 --> 00:34:59,890
I also prepared a copy of this document.

560
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,729
Please take a look
and see if it can be used.

561
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:13,410
This...

562
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:17,890
This...

563
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:23,649
Observer Sun,

564
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:26,570
how did you manage to do this?

565
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:29,329
When all of you were busy,

566
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,050
it was only natural for me to work hard

567
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,729
to keep up with your pace.

568
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:39,050
Are you upset
that I'm being meddlesome, Ms. Mu?

569
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:41,329
But I only wanted to help.

570
00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:43,890
Observer Sun,

571
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,130
do you know why Minister Xu

572
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:47,849
assigned me the task

573
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,050
of organizing Jiangnan's
relief funds and supplies?

574
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:53,410
Why?

575
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:58,570
Because I was there
during the disaster relief in Jiangnan.

576
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,689
In the entire Ministry of Revenue,

577
00:36:00,689 --> 00:36:02,209
only I know this matter best.

578
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,209
Others wouldn't be able
to draft such documents.

579
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:11,610
She's from the Sun family.

580
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,289
That's enough.

581
00:36:16,689 --> 00:36:19,249
Since we have a complete document,

582
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:23,289
I can go to the palace
to answer His Majesty.

583
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,289
Yes, of course.

584
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:36,010
We must thank Observer Sun
for her hard work

585
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,169
in assisting me.

586
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,530
I'll continue to do my best.

587
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:41,769
However, I also come from Jiangnan.

588
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:44,289
I do know something
about the situation there.

589
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,249
Is that so?

590
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,410
If so, do you know

591
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:49,729
how much farmland crops were lost

592
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,090
in the counties
affected by the disaster in Jiangnan?

593
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:00,249
I...

594
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:04,930
I only recently arrived here.

595
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,209
How strange.

596
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,890
I clearly placed

597
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,729
the household registration documents here.

598
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,050
Ms. Mu!

599
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,329
Ms. Mu, where are you?

600
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:55,649
Ms. Mu,

601
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:58,849
I can't find you anywhere.

602
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:00,649
You see.

603
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:04,450
Official Li has something
to discuss with you.

604
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,849
(Just stay inside for the night.)

605
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,329
(No one will be able to hear you)

606
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,249
(no matter what you do.)

607
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,849
(This is what you get
from trying to compete with me.)

608
00:38:26,729 --> 00:38:28,209
How did you get out?

609
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:29,890
How did I get out?

610
00:38:30,249 --> 00:38:31,410
Through the window, of course.

611
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,289
Don't you know

612
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:34,930
all the buildings in the Six Ministries

613
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,249
have doors and windows?

614
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:40,242
Do you think
it's your family's woodshed?

615
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:43,410
You little mischief-maker.

616
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:53,410
Why didn't I think of that?

617
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,090
How foolish of me.

618
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:05,689
(To get her out of His Lordship's sight,)

619
00:39:06,649 --> 00:39:08,130
(I need to put in more effort.)

620
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,610
(I should let her know)

621
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,890
(that her existence is meaningless)

622
00:39:11,169 --> 00:39:12,689
(with me around.)

623
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:26,809
Observer Sun,

624
00:39:27,689 --> 00:39:28,490
what are you up to this time?

625
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:30,450
Ms. Mu,

626
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:33,530
I'm here to apologize.

627
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,010
Observer Sun, please don't joke around.

628
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:38,169
Please put it down.

629
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:41,169
Ms. Mu, after you drink this cup of tea,

630
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:43,610
we'll stop quarreling from now on.
Is that all right?

631
00:39:56,169 --> 00:39:57,450
Let me drink this first.

632
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,369
Observer Sun, can you pour
another cup for Ms. Mu?

633
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:07,530
No need.

634
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,209
Thank you very much.

635
00:40:21,729 --> 00:40:22,490
Observer Fang.

636
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,490
Yes, Official Mu.

637
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,729
Have you seen Official Li?

638
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,209
He's in the toilet.

639
00:40:26,649 --> 00:40:28,809
I wonder if Official Li ate

640
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:30,090
something unclean.

641
00:40:30,249 --> 00:40:31,329
He's gone to the outhouse three times

642
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:32,610
in an hour.

643
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:35,010
I see.

644
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:45,809
Official Li.

645
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:01,970
Official Li,

646
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,610
could you take a look at my document?

647
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:05,610
Just do it as you suggested.

648
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:07,450
As you suggested, Ms. Mu.

649
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:11,890
Hold on.

650
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:15,530
Maybe our superiors...

651
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,169
Are you all right?

652
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,289
Observer Sun,

653
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:04,970
