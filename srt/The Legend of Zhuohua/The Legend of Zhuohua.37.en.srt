=The Legend of Zhuohua=

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 37=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:53,766
Your Highness.

21
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,846
You came to visit
the Dowager Empress again.

22
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:58,525
She keeps mentioning you.

23
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:02,846
Just now,

24
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:05,645
His Majesty and Prince Regent
had another row.

25
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:06,805
His Majesty was furious.

26
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:09,446
He had Prince Regent copy out
the genealogy a thousand times

27
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:11,405
before allowing his return
to the imperial court.

28
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,085
After all, His Majesty is the monarch.

29
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:17,286
Uncle has crossed the line.

30
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:19,245
Exactly.

31
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:20,926
Mind your step.

32
00:02:21,135 --> 00:02:27,935
(Ciming Hall)

33
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:35,886
Are you sure you want to go in,
Your Highness?

34
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:37,606
Of course.

35
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:04,365
I find that the servants here

36
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,326
can really take a hint.

37
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:10,766
You're free to come and go around here.

38
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:15,326
Concerning our relationship,

39
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:16,805
they won't stop me.

40
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:19,726
Why?

41
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:22,926
Do you want me to climb over the wall

42
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,446
like Yemu Zhen did?

43
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:30,286
I wonder how I've offended you.

44
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,046
You'd rather drink alone

45
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:34,766
and play weiqi

46
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:36,525
than meet me.

47
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:41,486
I've disgraced myself

48
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:44,365
for your sake.

49
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,125
Do you insist on giving me
the cold shoulder?

50
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:55,685
Why?

51
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,006
Just because I used Zhuohua,

52
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,685
you ice me out like this.

53
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:03,886
Does she hold more importance than I do

54
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:05,926
in your heart?

55
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:12,645
Do you really mean what you said?

56
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:16,046
I have a question.

57
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:19,846
On your road towards the throne,

58
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,365
to what extent will you do?

59
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,726
To slay the dragon,

60
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:29,805
I have to sacrifice some of my pawns.

61
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,565
Everything that has been done
is for the final result.

62
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:43,046
It's time to wrap up the game.

63
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:47,365
However, there's one more thing
we need to fight for.

64
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:50,685
I wonder if you're interested

65
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:53,765
in finishing this game with me.

66
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:55,486
You should know

67
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,286
that I'm always standing toe to toe
against those noble families.

68
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:02,325
I'm afraid you can't afford to lose help
from the Zhou family

69
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,086
in this game.

70
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:06,805
Therefore,

71
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:09,805
I'm not in for this.

72
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,286
Why do you care about
those noble families?

73
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:17,805
We do all this for our great endeavor.

74
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,286
When this is over,

75
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:21,406
I'll remove them one by one.

76
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:46,086
Sooner or later, you will know

77
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:49,565
I made the right choice.

78
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,046
(Official Zhou.)

79
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,166
Are you positive about what you said?

80
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:08,966
You said that once the plan succeeds,

81
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,486
the Talent Appreciation System
will be replaced

82
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,325
by the perpetual heritability.

83
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:15,805
Certainly.

84
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:22,086
Your Highness.

85
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:26,926
I understand that you don't have
complete trust in me now.

86
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:28,526
Today,

87
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,245
I'll give you all a gift.

88
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:34,646
Turn in these missives

89
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:38,125
during the morning assembly tomorrow.

90
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:42,726
The biggest obstacle
to your prosperous life

91
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:45,205
will then be crushed.

92
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:50,765
Is this feasible?

93
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:55,765
These may not be enough,
Your Highness.

94
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:01,846
Read this and see if it's enough,
Official Zhou.

95
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:07,046
On this day,

96
00:07:07,486 --> 00:07:09,926
the late Emperor passed away.

97
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:32,885
Why are you coughing again?

98
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:42,046
Perhaps it gets worse
after the row with His Majesty.

99
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:47,966
After all, His Majesty
is in a different position now.

100
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:50,646
He has his own perspective and concerns.

101
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,926
You should try another way
to talk to him.

102
00:07:58,046 --> 00:07:59,086
Besides,

103
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:01,125
he has been under great duress recently

104
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:03,005
and become grouchy.

105
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:04,885
That was why he quarreled roundly
with you.

106
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:16,365
However,

107
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:18,086
I think the punishment he gave
is a good one.

108
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:19,805
During these days,

109
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:22,606
you can copy the genealogy at home

110
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:24,005
and take a good rest.

111
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:24,526
You haven't rested

112
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:25,846
since returning

113
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:28,646
and your body doesn't recover well.

114
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:36,926
Zhuohua.

115
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:42,565
If one day I'm gone,

116
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,286
what will you do?

117
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:50,605
I'll find a young and handsome man

118
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:53,246
and take him to your tomb every day

119
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,406
to show you how lovable I am.

120
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:02,366
What a unique turn of mind

121
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:04,965
you have.

122
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:07,325
I shall see

123
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,926
who have the guts to visit my tomb

124
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:11,685
with you.

125
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:15,845
If you're worried
that I can't find a brave man,

126
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:18,205
you'd better stay well

127
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:20,485
and accompany me for a long time.

128
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,286
You still have a wonderful life ahead.

129
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:33,926
You must live on well

130
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:37,445
even without me.

131
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:41,845
Why are you saying all this to me
all of a sudden?

132
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:47,725
I just feel

133
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,166
that my body

134
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:53,126
is somewhat weak.

135
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,046
All the more reason you should

136
00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:59,006
take good care of your health.

137
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:02,685
I will.

138
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:09,406
(Xuanzheng Hall)

139
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:10,485
(My honored subordinates,)

140
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:11,965
if you have nothing else to report,

141
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,205
we should call it a day.

142
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:17,886
I have something to report,
Your Majesty.

143
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:21,286
I want to accuse Prince Regent
of amassing military power

144
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:22,766
and disrespecting the monarch.

145
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:24,766
Your Majesty.

146
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:26,605
I have something to report too.

147
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,526
I want to accuse Prince Regent
of launching carnage

148
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:32,605
and abducting lady folks.

149
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,126
I have something to report,
Your Majesty.

150
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:38,685
I want to accuse Prince Regent
of embezzling military funds.

151
00:10:39,526 --> 00:10:41,085
I have something to report,
Your Majesty.

152
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:43,246
I have something to report,
Your Majesty.

153
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,766
Something's looming over.

154
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,286
Did she bring an umbrella?

155
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:07,766
Amassed military power,

156
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:09,926
deployed army without permission,

157
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:12,126
launched carnage,

158
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:14,926
pillaged people and military funds,

159
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:17,246
defied the monarch,
and plotted a treason.

160
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:20,445
Prince Regent.

161
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:23,325
Very well done.

162
00:11:31,085 --> 00:11:31,766
Your Majesty.

163
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:34,965
The seven condemnations
are merely an allegation.

164
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,685
They presented the evidence,

165
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:38,205
however,
their accusations are conflicting

166
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:39,166
and flawed.

167
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:41,286
Please investigate this thoroughly,
Your Majesty.

168
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,006
Please uphold justice for Prince Regent.

169
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:46,926
I have something to report,
Your Majesty.

170
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:54,485
I'm presenting

171
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:57,565
the ingress record of the palace gate
on the day of the late Emperor's death.

172
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,406
Before the late Emperor's passing,

173
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:03,886
Prince Regent sought an audience
with the Grand Dowager Empress

174
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:06,406
and he deployed the army
without permission.

175
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:09,725
Afterward, someone falsified
the ingress record.

176
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:11,325
This is blatant proof

177
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:14,286
of Prince Regent's sinister intention.

178
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:17,725
I'm afraid the truth
behind the late Emperor's death

179
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:20,526
has something to do with him too.

180
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:22,526
I've spared no effort

181
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:24,565
to obtain this record.

182
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:28,406
Thanks to my nephew, the chief commander
of the imperial guards.

183
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:29,766
He is scrupulous enough

184
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,006
and is able to bring the truth to light.

185
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:36,406
Your Majesty, Prince Regent's action

186
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:37,445
is very likely to be treason.

187
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:39,406
Please punish him heavily, Your Majesty.

188
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:41,965
Please punish him heavily, Your Majesty.

189
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:45,325
Your Majesty, Prince Regent
is loyal to the country.

190
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:47,406
He'd never commit
to such a heinous conduct.

191
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:48,845
I suggest

192
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,166
we should find the person

193
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:52,366
who falsified the ingress record
of the palace gate.

194
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:54,646
I fear someone's sabotaging

195
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:57,006
because of their ulterior motive.

196
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,286
Official Mu.

197
00:12:59,485 --> 00:13:02,166
Everyone knows the relationship
between Prince Regent and you.

198
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:04,366
Needless to say, you defend him.

199
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:06,965
However,
we have the conclusive proof here.

200
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:10,126
Why would Prince Regent
falsify the ingress record

201
00:13:10,126 --> 00:13:12,046
if he had done nothing wrong?

202
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,166
And why is only his name removed

203
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,085
from the falsified record?

204
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:17,805
Your Majesty...

205
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:18,766
Enough!

206
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:23,565
Please simmer down, Your Majesty.

207
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:26,526
Prince Regent is sacrilegious

208
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:28,126
and shall not be forgiven.

209
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,445
Have the imperial guards imprison him

210
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:33,366
for interrogation.

211
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,605
Court adjourned.

212
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:37,725
Your Majesty!

213
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:39,085
Your Majesty!

214
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,845
Who let you in?

215
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:10,646
This is the Prince Regent's residence.

216
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:12,886
We know exactly where we are.

217
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,725
Under the imperial edict,

218
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:17,485
we're here to arrest the traitor,
Liu Yan.

219
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,205
Who do you call a traitor?

220
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:22,166
Prince Regent, for sure.

221
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:22,805
How dare you?

222
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:23,845
Stop.

223
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:32,926
Greetings, Prince Regent.

224
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:39,366
Prince Regent committed

225
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:40,445
a heinous crime.

226
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:42,046
Under the imperial edict,

227
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:44,725
we'll incarcerate you in the dungeon

228
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:46,006
until a verdict is delivered.

229
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:47,685
My Lord.

230
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:49,205
You can't go with them.

231
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:50,565
Your Lordship.

232
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:52,725
This is an imperial edict.

233
00:14:53,246 --> 00:14:55,366
Do you want to defy?

234
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,445
I'm afraid things
could turn ugly for you

235
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:00,886
if our hands are forced.

236
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:03,166
Since this is an imperial edict,

237
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:05,605
I'll obey it.

238
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:06,565
No, My Lord.

239
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:07,366
No, My Lord.

240
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:10,246
Please, Your Lordship.

241
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,085
My Lord.

242
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:24,325
Where's His Lordship?

243
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,226
He was taken
to the Court of Judicial Review

244
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:25,960
by the imperial guards.

245
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,085
I would've fought them

246
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:29,725
if His Lordship didn't stop me.

247
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:31,006
His Lordship was right.

248
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:32,166
At this pivotal moment,

249
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,565
we must remain composed.

250
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:35,565
But His Lordship is under arrest now.

251
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:37,526
This is a humiliation.

252
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:40,805
We must help His Lordship
clear his name.

253
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:03,646
Grandaunt.

254
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:06,166
Look.

255
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,886
Something is looming over

256
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,246
the Southern Chen, finally.

257
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:13,205
Jiao.

258
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:18,166
You can still turn back
before it's too late.

259
00:16:25,286 --> 00:16:27,006
Do you say this
because you care for me?

260
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:29,406
Why don't you give me
the Evil-erasing Sword?

261
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,605
With its help,

262
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:36,246
no one will be in my way.

263
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,526
It's fine.

264
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:04,005
Grandaunt.

265
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:09,285
You're my dearest family in this world.

266
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:12,326
I won't hurt you.

267
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:15,406
I'll have ways and means

268
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:18,445
to forge my way to the throne

269
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:21,806
even without the Evil-erasing Sword.

270
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:29,606
Your Majesty.

271
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:33,005
Each and every accusation
against Lord Ding

272
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,685
is supported by conclusive evidence.

273
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:36,126
In my humble opinion,

274
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:39,005
he should be stripped of his title
as the Prince Regent

275
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,806
and demoted to a commoner.

276
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:44,245
Your Majesty.

277
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,566
I disagree with Minister Zhou.

278
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,086
Lord Ding owned the military troops

279
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:51,886
and intended to rebel.

280
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:54,205
He must be punished severely

281
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:57,205
so as to convince the people.

282
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,326
I second that.

283
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,846
We second that.

284
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,886
Never let your guard down

285
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:10,245
till the last minute.

286
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:12,045
Precisely, Your Highness.

287
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:12,765
Rightfully so, Your Highness.

288
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,166
Send these
to the Court of Judicial Review

289
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:30,926
and see how Liu Yan will respond.

290
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:32,485
Yes.

291
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,606
Take them back.

292
00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:49,166
If His Majesty has already
made assumptions,

293
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:53,126
my defense is futile.

294
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:56,086
Your Majesty.

295
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:57,806
Prince Regent responded

296
00:18:58,525 --> 00:18:59,806
that his defense would be futile.

297
00:19:00,045 --> 00:19:00,806
It's better

298
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:02,685
to remain silent.

299
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,326
How insolent!

300
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,126
Does he still regard me

301
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:14,126
as the Emperor?

302
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,846
Who are you?

303
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:36,952
(Director of Ministry of Revenue)
I'm Mu Zhuohua

304
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:37,806
from the Ministry of Revenue.

305
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:39,086
Who do you come here for, Ms. Mu?

306
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:40,566
Prince Regent.

307
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:42,205
Do you have the imperial edict?

308
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:43,445
I...

309
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:47,406
According to His Majesty,

310
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:48,566
Prince Regent is a felon,

311
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:49,566
and no visit is allowed
without permission.

312
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:04,835
(Court of Judicial Review)

313
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:10,285
(Wende Hall)

314
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:11,245
- Chief Eunuch.
- Ms. Mu.

315
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:13,126
Chief Eunuch.

316
00:20:13,366 --> 00:20:15,166
Did His Majesty summon me?

317
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:18,366
Ms. Mu, please leave.

318
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:20,326
His Majesty has been preoccupied
with the state affairs

319
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:21,765
and couldn't sleep well at night.

320
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:23,285
He finally gets to have some rest now.

321
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:25,126
So, please leave.

322
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:56,646
Mu Zhuohua.

323
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,765
How dare you

324
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:03,326
frame my sister?

325
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:09,525
Your Majesty, I'm telling the truth.

326
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:11,646
You claim Princess Roujia

327
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:14,725
orchestrated a plot
against the Grand Dowager Empress,

328
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:16,566
slandered Prince Regent,

329
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:18,166
and intended to initiate a rebellion.

330
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:21,285
Prove your claim.

331
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:22,245
I...

332
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:25,045
If you don't have evidence,

333
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:29,926
how can I believe your words
without the support of proof?

334
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:58,485
Ms. Mu, you're talented

335
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:00,525
and your comments are on point.

336
00:22:01,926 --> 00:22:03,525
But you used the wrong way,

337
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:05,205
and you're too naive.

338
00:22:06,445 --> 00:22:07,685
No wonder His Majesty
doesn't believe you.

339
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:14,445
Official Shen, it seems

340
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,926
that you're going to stick
to your choice to the end.

341
00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:30,685
(Wenzheng Parlor)

342
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:32,326
("Because Liu Yan, the Prince Regent,)

343
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:34,126
disdained the natural law

344
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,525
and went against reason.

345
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:37,525
He killed the late Emperor
with a toxic liquor,

346
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:39,166
intending to usurp the throne.

347
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,765
His vicious sin

348
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:42,566
is beyond belief

349
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:44,725
and laid bare

350
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:46,086
to the public."

351
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:46,725
This...

352
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:49,606
Isn't Prince Regent revered
as a valiant general

353
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:51,445
for having fought
against the Northern Liang for years?

354
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:53,045
He should be a worthy general.

355
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:54,126
That's right.

356
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:58,045
His reputation
has surpassed the Emperor.

357
00:22:58,245 --> 00:22:58,886
That's why

358
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:01,005
the Emperor is less influential
than him.

359
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:03,245
Your Highness, the words are spread.

360
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:05,646
As the rumor makes the rounds,

361
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:07,646
it can kill him wherever it spreads.

362
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:11,806
Uncle.

363
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:14,566
You'll be down for the count.

364
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:16,806
I've been thinking about this.

365
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:18,086
As of now,

366
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:21,326
the Evil-erasing Sword,
possessed by Border Defender Princess,

367
00:23:21,886 --> 00:23:23,965
is the sole chance for His Lordship.

368
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:26,445
You plan to make use of that?

369
00:23:28,886 --> 00:23:29,965
But we know

370
00:23:30,406 --> 00:23:31,886
that Border Defender Princess

371
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:34,366
has been staying in the mansion
of Princess Roujia.

372
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:36,245
If Border Defender Princess

373
00:23:36,846 --> 00:23:38,725
doesn't leave the mansion,

374
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,166
our hands are tied.

375
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:44,606
True.

376
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:46,965
I have an idea

377
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,086
to discuss with you.

378
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:01,445
Let's go and check it out.

379
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:07,205
Where's he?

380
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:08,886
I saw a moving shadow.

381
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:10,285
I'll report this to Her Highness.

382
00:24:17,285 --> 00:24:19,126
Five carriages leave the mansion
simultaneously

383
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:21,045
and drive in different directions.

384
00:24:23,406 --> 00:24:25,126
What a brilliant camouflage.

385
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:28,366
I'm to blame.

386
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:30,285
Don't blame yourself.

387
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:32,406
The Princess's residence
is heavily guarded

388
00:24:32,646 --> 00:24:34,406
and there's no way we can break into it.

389
00:24:35,126 --> 00:24:37,606
That's why we make use
of her suspicious character

390
00:24:37,806 --> 00:24:39,646
so that she would move
both Border Defender Princess

391
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,566
and Evil-erasing Sword
to somewhere else.

392
00:24:44,445 --> 00:24:45,566
Jishan Hall.

393
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:48,485
(Your guess was right, Your Highness.)

394
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:52,725
Lord Ding is a fallen enemy now,
and he poses no threats to us anymore.

395
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:54,566
Official Zhou.

396
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:56,245
Are you satisfied with this already?

397
00:24:58,005 --> 00:24:59,285
Are you suggesting that...

398
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:04,126
Liu Chen has yet to determine
whether or not to kill Liu Yan.

399
00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:05,606
Besides,

400
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:08,366
someone is trying to save Liu Yan.

401
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,285
We mustn't let our guard down

402
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,725
till the last minute.

403
00:25:14,086 --> 00:25:15,566
Do you have any thoughts on this,
Your Highness?

404
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:19,445
Liu Yan has been kept away
from the army for five years.

405
00:25:20,406 --> 00:25:21,765
However, the remnants of the Cangwu Army

406
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:24,245
are still at his beck and call.

407
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:29,606
They're like a double-edged sword.

408
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:33,005
They can serve him and destroy him.

409
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:38,685
Let's charge into the capital

410
00:25:38,965 --> 00:25:40,205
to rescue His Lordship!

411
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:45,606
Let's charge into the capital

412
00:25:45,806 --> 00:25:47,245
to rescue His Lordship!

413
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:29,566
Charge into the capital
to rescue His Lordship!

414
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:30,435
(Capital)

415
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:41,848
Lord Ding is innocent!
Release Lord Ding!

416
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,698
They're besieging the city gate.

417
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,806
This is outrageous!

418
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:52,685
Your Majesty.

419
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:55,566
Apparently, they're starting a riot.

420
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:57,926
"Let's charge into the capital

421
00:26:58,846 --> 00:27:00,045
to rescue Liu Yan!"

422
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:02,485
Are they trying to rebel?

423
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,045
Your Majesty.

424
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,366
Please allow me to speak.

425
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:14,725
Go on.

426
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:24,126
Your Majesty.

427
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:25,846
With all due respect,

428
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,846
it's imperative
to pacify the rioting army

429
00:27:29,285 --> 00:27:30,926
to prevent more serious consequences

430
00:27:31,205 --> 00:27:32,846
instead of calling them to account.

431
00:27:34,765 --> 00:27:36,126
Do you have any suggestions,
Official Shen?

432
00:27:37,245 --> 00:27:38,086
Currently,

433
00:27:38,886 --> 00:27:39,685
only one person

434
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:41,245
can tackle the roots of the problem.

435
00:27:43,326 --> 00:27:44,005
Who?

436
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:46,285
Prince Regent.

437
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:28,326
You're truly exceptional, Your Lordship.

438
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:30,525
You remain collected

439
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:32,806
even though you're in the dungeon.

440
00:28:34,525 --> 00:28:35,366
Surprisingly,

441
00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:38,646
you're my first visitor,

442
00:28:38,965 --> 00:28:40,606
Official Shen.

443
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:42,725
Aren't you startled

444
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:44,765
or curious about this?

445
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,926
Judging by that tone,

446
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:53,725
it seems that you know something.

447
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:56,606
Surely, you jest.

448
00:29:01,646 --> 00:29:03,606
Official Shen, you came all the way here

449
00:29:03,846 --> 00:29:05,445
to visit me.

450
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,205
You did not come
for an idle talk, did you?

451
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:10,725
Please get straight

452
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:12,566
to the point.

453
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:14,926
The Cangwu Army
from the Barracks of the Capital Region

454
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:17,606
has gathered at the city gate

455
00:29:18,445 --> 00:29:19,806
and intends to break through it

456
00:29:20,245 --> 00:29:21,406
after learning of your imprisonment.

457
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:23,646
They want to charge into the capital
to rescue you.

458
00:29:26,485 --> 00:29:28,285
They wouldn't start this
without a reason.

459
00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:31,725
Someone must be helping to cook this up.

460
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:37,285
Official Shen.

461
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:39,485
Any ideas?

462
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:48,045
I implore you

463
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:50,566
to pacify the soldiers
and quell the brewing mutiny.

464
00:29:55,846 --> 00:29:56,525
Your Lordship.

465
00:29:57,366 --> 00:29:58,525
There's no time for delay.

466
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:00,326
If this keeps going on,

467
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:02,166
it will end up with a lose-lose.

468
00:30:03,086 --> 00:30:03,886
I suppose

469
00:30:04,646 --> 00:30:06,005
you wouldn't want that to happen, right?

470
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:13,886
Did His Majesty send you here?

471
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:16,326
Yes.

472
00:30:18,245 --> 00:30:20,285
Why doesn't he meet me in person?

473
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:32,445
Everyone hates me

474
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:34,725
and misunderstands me,

475
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:36,646
I don't care.

476
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:39,086
But I didn't expect

477
00:30:39,485 --> 00:30:42,366
that my nephew, whom I watched him grow,

478
00:30:45,086 --> 00:30:47,806
would become estranged from me.

479
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:53,765
Your Lordship.

480
00:31:08,606 --> 00:31:09,886
I, Liu Yan, the sinner,

481
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:12,525
accept the edict.

482
00:31:16,485 --> 00:31:24,045
Lord Ding is innocent!
Release Lord Ding!

483
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:28,646
Lord Ding is innocent!

484
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:32,285
Lord Ding is innocent!

485
00:31:32,445 --> 00:31:36,005
Lord Ding is innocent!

486
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:39,646
Lord Ding is innocent!

487
00:31:39,806 --> 00:31:43,606
Lord Ding is innocent!

488
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:48,086
Lord Ding is innocent!

489
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:52,886
Lord Ding is innocent!

490
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:56,725
Lord Ding is innocent!

491
00:31:56,846 --> 00:32:00,646
Lord Ding is innocent!

492
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:04,485
Lord Ding is innocent!

493
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:08,205
Lord Ding is innocent!

494
00:32:08,525 --> 00:32:09,735
(Capital)
Lord Ding is innocent!

495
00:32:09,765 --> 00:32:11,635
(Capital)

496
00:32:19,725 --> 00:32:20,806
Attention!

497
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:25,005
Sheathe your swords!

498
00:32:36,886 --> 00:32:38,326
What do you think you're doing?

499
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:42,485
Are you trying to suppress the Emperor

500
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,366
or start a rebellion?

501
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:49,485
Are you aware of your identity?

502
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:54,646
Are you invaders or traitors?

503
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:58,285
Do you know your duties?

504
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:00,965
To defend the capital

505
00:33:02,886 --> 00:33:04,126
or to start an internal strife?

506
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:21,566
I know

507
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:24,846
you want to save me.

508
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:30,126
But you're
the soldiers of Southern Chen,

509
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:33,005
not mine.

510
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:34,846
It's the people of Southern Chen

511
00:33:36,245 --> 00:33:37,566
who provide for you,

512
00:33:38,965 --> 00:33:39,926
not me.

513
00:33:41,965 --> 00:33:43,765
You should fight for the Southern Chen

514
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:45,485
and for the people.

515
00:33:46,965 --> 00:33:48,525
Not for me.

516
00:33:49,606 --> 00:33:51,406
And never break faith
with the imperial court for me!

517
00:33:53,685 --> 00:33:54,646
If you disband,

518
00:33:56,846 --> 00:33:58,525
the Northern Chen will suffer in chaos.

519
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:03,445
You're not the private army of Liu Yan.

520
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:06,806
You're the army of the Emperor

521
00:34:07,886 --> 00:34:09,525
and the Southern Chen.

522
00:34:10,645 --> 00:34:12,726
Bear this in mind!

523
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:31,206
As for me...

524
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:35,326
I'm not worth your sacrifice.

525
00:34:38,645 --> 00:34:39,726
I'm sinful,

526
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:42,366
and I should be executed.

527
00:34:44,645 --> 00:34:45,846
But now,

528
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:48,525
you've become sinful

529
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:51,005
as you defy the imperial edict.

530
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:53,926
Not only are you sinful,

531
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:56,686
but your families
will be impacted as well.

532
00:35:06,726 --> 00:35:07,445
If you

533
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:10,246
still appreciate me,

534
00:35:12,645 --> 00:35:14,005
please safeguard the nation

535
00:35:17,726 --> 00:35:19,726
for the sake of Southern Chen.

536
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,940
(Capital)

537
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,060
(Capital)

538
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:11,886
Is there anything else, Official Shen?

539
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:15,686
On behalf of the people
of Southern Chen,

540
00:36:16,286 --> 00:36:17,165
I appreciate your effort.

541
00:36:20,085 --> 00:36:21,085
Hearing this

542
00:36:23,286 --> 00:36:26,445
from a jackal

543
00:36:26,806 --> 00:36:28,206
is indeed ludicrous.

544
00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:33,485
Whether you believe it or not,

545
00:36:35,605 --> 00:36:37,485
I've always admired you.

546
00:36:37,766 --> 00:36:38,485
But

547
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:40,886
a mild policy

548
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,926
isn't effective for the nation currently.

549
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:46,645
Do the ruthless methods
by you and Roujia

550
00:36:47,766 --> 00:36:49,366
suit the nation better?

551
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:51,045
At least,

552
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:53,926
the power of the noble families
has been weakened.

553
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:56,806
Are you sure?

554
00:36:57,806 --> 00:37:01,806
Zhou Cishan still holds
the position of Minister of War,

555
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:05,406
and a bunch of officials
originate from the Zhou family

556
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:10,206
are doing well in the imperial court, no?

557
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:13,926
But she's different
from the late Emperor

558
00:37:15,045 --> 00:37:16,565
and His Majesty.

559
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:18,286
It's just

560
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:20,525
that we still need help
from Zhou Cishan.

561
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:22,645
She gave me her word.

562
00:37:22,965 --> 00:37:25,206
She will get rid of
those noble families eventually.

563
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:27,525
Official Shen,

564
00:37:29,406 --> 00:37:32,965
don't you find what you said hilarious?

565
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:35,045
We are doing the same thing.

566
00:37:35,406 --> 00:37:38,326
You see yourself as patient
and restrained when you do it.

567
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:40,246
But you see others mediocre and slow

568
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:42,686
when others do it.

569
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:48,686
What shakes your will?

570
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:52,286
Are you deluding yourself?

571
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:56,605
Is this vulnerable nation

572
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,326
what you want?

573
00:38:10,366 --> 00:38:12,085
Is it you can't answer this,

574
00:38:12,445 --> 00:38:13,886
or you daren't?

575
00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:21,565
(Wende Hall)

576
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,286
(Your Majesty.)

577
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:23,565
(Regarding the mutiny,)

578
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:25,326
Prince Regent has already

579
00:38:25,605 --> 00:38:26,485
put an end to it.

580
00:38:29,286 --> 00:38:30,165
Your Majesty.

581
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:31,926
In my humble opinion,

582
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:34,045
Prince Regent

583
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,165
should take the credit

584
00:38:36,686 --> 00:38:37,886
for quelling the mutiny.

585
00:38:43,326 --> 00:38:44,366
I second that.

586
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:45,485
Your Majesty.

587
00:38:46,246 --> 00:38:48,206
Prince Regent pacified the soldiers,

588
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,485
which shows his loyalty to you.

589
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,366
Prince Regent used
to fight for the nation

590
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:55,366
and are left with injuries.

591
00:38:56,326 --> 00:38:58,642
The dungeon
of the Court of Judicial Review

592
00:38:58,642 --> 00:38:59,565
is damp and cold.

593
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:01,246
I'm afraid it will worsen

594
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:04,565
his physical condition.

595
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:06,645
Your Majesty.

596
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:09,326
I realized Prince Regent
had a pale complexion

597
00:39:10,485 --> 00:39:12,525
when I visited him.

598
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:17,125
In that case,

599
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:20,406
let him...

600
00:39:20,686 --> 00:39:21,565
Your Majesty.

601
00:39:21,846 --> 00:39:23,085
Prince Regent

602
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:25,726
is the cause of the mutiny
in front of the city gate.

603
00:39:26,645 --> 00:39:27,965
All the soldiers obeyed him

604
00:39:28,045 --> 00:39:30,445
and stopped the riot

605
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:31,806
as soon as he came to the city tower.

606
00:39:32,525 --> 00:39:35,366
Isn't that solid proof

607
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:37,085
of his malicious influence?

608
00:39:39,366 --> 00:39:41,485
To the soldiers,

609
00:39:41,525 --> 00:39:42,886
they prefer Prince Regent over you,

610
00:39:43,045 --> 00:39:45,005
Your Majesty.

611
00:39:47,525 --> 00:39:48,605
How dare he?

612
00:39:49,605 --> 00:39:50,806
How dare he!

613
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:53,286
How bold of him!

614
00:39:54,565 --> 00:39:55,406
Your Majesty.

615
00:39:56,366 --> 00:40:00,005
Official Zhou is misleading.

616
00:40:01,286 --> 00:40:02,445
He has been training the troops.

617
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:05,846
But who does the military serve?

618
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:06,965
Answer me!

619
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:13,965
Your Majesty.

620
00:40:15,406 --> 00:40:17,886
How will you deal with Prince Regent?

621
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:42,803
After all, he contributed to the country.

622
00:40:46,726 --> 00:40:47,846
Give him the poisonous liquor.

623
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:54,165
I'll grant him a quick death.

624
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,485
Your Majesty...

625
00:40:55,565 --> 00:40:58,766
This is a wise decision, Your Majesty.

626
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:14,645
Careful, it's hot.

627
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:15,286
All right.

628
00:41:21,886 --> 00:41:22,645
Chen.

629
00:41:31,085 --> 00:41:32,005
Get up.

630
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:41,645
Chen.

631
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:43,886
You look terrible.

632
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,366
Are you feeling unwell?

633
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:47,926
Don't worry, Mother.

634
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:49,445
I'm all right.

635
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:54,165
I came here for your congee.

636
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:56,766
Sure, you can have it.

637
00:41:56,886 --> 00:41:58,366
I'll prepare it for you now.

638
00:42:11,926 --> 00:42:13,045
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

639
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:17,005
Jiao.

640
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:20,085
Just now, I...

641
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:23,125
I gave him the poisonous liquor.

642
00:42:25,366 --> 00:42:26,286
Who?

643
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:28,326
Uncle.

644
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:36,326
Your Majesty.

645
00:42:38,165 --> 00:42:39,246
Why did you do that?

646
00:42:40,645 --> 00:42:41,886
I didn't mean to.

647
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:44,926
But

648
00:42:47,286 --> 00:42:48,726
I had no choice.

649
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:00,605
Jiao, you...

650
00:43:03,005 --> 00:43:04,326
After all, he's our uncle.

651
00:43:06,645 --> 00:43:08,206
I'd like to bid him the last farewell.

652
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:10,846
Please grant my wish, Your Majesty.

653
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:13,806
Go ahead.

654
00:43:16,605 --> 00:43:17,726
Please bid Uncle the last farewell

655
00:43:19,605 --> 00:43:20,846
