(Zhijian, leave for the Barracks
of the Capital Region at once.)

(Zhimo,)

(Wenzheng Parlor)
(you'll monitor Roujia's every move.)

23
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:35,394
Official Shen,

24
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:37,235
my wealth and life

25
00:02:37,795 --> 00:02:39,554
are all in your hands.

26
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:40,554
Don't worry.

27
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:42,114
When the deed is done,

28
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:44,355
you and your family will be safe.

29
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:45,355
Thank you, Official Shen.

30
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:54,355
As expected of the Imperial Seal.

31
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,114
It is indeed extraordinary.

32
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:06,355
It's all thanks to you.

33
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:39,955
I look forward to seeing you

34
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:42,394
don the dragon robe.

35
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:47,510
(Wenzheng Parlor)

36
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:58,075
Come in.

37
00:04:01,035 --> 00:04:01,755
Your Highness.

38
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:09,315
Official Shen is here, too.

39
00:04:17,794 --> 00:04:18,555
Official Zhou,

40
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:19,875
have a seat.

41
00:04:30,955 --> 00:04:32,955
Official Shen is a Zhuangyuan.

42
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,195
You are talented indeed.

43
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,075
The nursery rhyme you wrote is catchy

44
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:39,995
and well-written.

45
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:45,635
However,
for someone as promising as you,

46
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,914
the leader of the grassroots scholars,

47
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:52,474
to write such a pandering nursery rhyme,

48
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:53,875
isn't that a waste

49
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:57,034
of your talent?

50
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:04,555
What?

51
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,675
Just because I am a Zhuangyuan

52
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:08,234
and I am the leader
of the grassroots scholars,

53
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:09,755
I am not allowed
to write nursery rhymes?

54
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:12,875
Based on that logic,

55
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:15,115
you aren't even qualified

56
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,594
to step foot inside
this Wenzheng Parlor.

57
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:21,635
How dare you!

58
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:22,555
Enough.

59
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:28,675
Official Shen,

60
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,354
Official Zhou is reputable
and highly respected.

61
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:32,995
He is your senior.

62
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,435
Be polite.

63
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:46,555
Your Highness has spoken.

64
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:49,435
I will, of course, obey.

65
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,154
Liu Yan is dead.

66
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:05,555
The one sitting on the throne
does not have the hearts of the people.

67
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:08,435
It's only a matter of time
before all abandon him.

68
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:12,794
May I know
when Your Highness intends to act?

69
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:15,315
We need one more push.

70
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:16,995
Then…

71
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:18,315
But that will happen

72
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:20,354
tonight.

73
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:24,555
Go back and prepare.

74
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,274
Rest assured, Your Highness.

75
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:28,274
The imperial guards of the Zhou family
are all ready.

76
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,394
We only await your order.

77
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,914
You've developed quite a temper

78
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,354
lately.

79
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:20,594
Do you truly care
about how I feel?

80
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:26,875
This is only a temporary measure.

81
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:31,515
Zhou Cishan
and the Zhou family behind him

82
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:34,115
are merely pieces on the board.

83
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:42,075
I've never forgotten our aspiration.

84
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:44,594
When I am crowned,

85
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:48,195
I will eliminate all the noble families

86
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,234
and restore prosperity to Southern Chen.

87
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:25,995
You are beautiful indeed, Jing'an.

88
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:27,394
I can't help but feel adoration for you.

89
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:30,594
You entered

90
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,994
without even knocking.

91
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,435
Is this what you call manners?

92
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,474
Perhaps you've forgotten, Jing'an.

93
00:08:37,514 --> 00:08:38,714
This is my residence.

94
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:45,114
You're drunk. Why did you come here?

95
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,275
Then, guess.

96
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:52,354
Who did I drink with?

97
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:58,915
So you came to gloat.

98
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,714
But don't let it get to your head yet.

99
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:06,035
You might not have
Shen Jinghong's heart yet.

100
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:14,795
I carefully selected
these South Sea pearls

101
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:17,234
as a gift for you.

102
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:23,195
Why did you throw it away?

103
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:30,754
I genuinely wonder.

104
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:33,714
Are you so used to pretending?
Will you die if you stop pretending?

105
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:35,714
Why bother putting up the airs

106
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:37,795
of some noble holy maiden before me?

107
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:41,195
You're just a serpent under human skin.

108
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:43,634
I've seen through you.

109
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:46,075
Necklace? Gift?

110
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,514
I don't want it.

111
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:50,754
It will dirty my neck.

112
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:54,075
I think

113
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:57,195
that this unique necklace

114
00:09:58,795 --> 00:09:59,994
suits you well.

115
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:01,915
Don't you understand what I said?

116
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,234
The pearls are uniform in size,

117
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,275
lustrous,

118
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:10,594
and of excellent color.

119
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:13,795
But the most precious of all

120
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:17,315
is the thread used
to string these pearls.

121
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:20,634
It is made
from invulnerable gold thread.

122
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:22,315
It's worth a fortune.

123
00:10:25,315 --> 00:10:27,075
You think it will dirty your neck.

124
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,634
Now, that's unnecessary.

125
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:36,474
It will only strangle you.

126
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:04,955
You saw it.

127
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,714
Feeling sorry for her?

128
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:32,634
I just feel that it's a shame

129
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:36,634
about those precious South Sea pearls.

130
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:47,035
My hand hurts.

131
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:06,594
Let me bear all your pain and suffering

132
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,634
from now on.

133
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:19,714
Come in.

134
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:24,195
Official Mu.

135
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:27,754
There's an extra lantern

136
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:29,195
in front of the Xiaoqin Pleasure House.

137
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,955
This is a good idea, Official Zhou.

138
00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:38,915
It's better to consider it carefully
in the long run.

139
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:40,435
(Don't worry.)

140
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:42,075
(I will protect)

141
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,354
(what you wish to protect.)

142
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:52,010
(Xuanzheng Hall)

143
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:53,955
Your Majesty!

144
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:56,315
Something bad has happened!

145
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,155
Terrible news, Your Majesty!

146
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:04,955
In… In the moat,

147
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:06,754
they found…

148
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:08,675
What was found?

149
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:12,634
What did they find?

150
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:15,714
Princess Jing'an's body.

151
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:30,354
Who dared to do this?

152
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:33,275
Find the culprit!

153
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:35,474
Get to the bottom of this!

154
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:36,754
Go now!

155
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:37,594
Yes.

156
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:55,114
(Yemu Jing is coming.)

157
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,221
The South Sea pearl hairpin

158
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:16,994
Official Shen gave you is exquisite.

159
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:20,474
It complements your outfit so well.

160
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:36,474
Why would Yemu Jing lead
the Northern Liang Army

161
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:37,874
into the borders of Southern Chen?

162
00:16:38,555 --> 00:16:40,915
And he's doing it
in the name of avenging Yemu Zhen no less!

163
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:44,155
He has surrounded
the Barracks of the Capital Region.

164
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:46,874
How long has it been
since Yemu Zhen died?

165
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,201
Did the Northern Liang Army

166
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:51,474
fall from the sky?

167
00:16:58,155 --> 00:16:58,874
Well?

168
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:02,275
Are all of you mute? Answer me!

169
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:15,435
Zhou Cishan,

170
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,994
what use are you as the Minister of War?

171
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:20,474
The Northern Liang Army
has already reached the capital!

172
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,474
Are you blind?

173
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:24,314
Have your eyes gone blind?

174
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,195
Your Majesty,

175
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,514
I do not know.

176
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:35,155
You do not know?

177
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:36,675
What do you know, then?

178
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:57,274
Your Majesty, the only way
to stabilize the solution

179
00:17:57,355 --> 00:17:59,274
is to send respected generals

180
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:00,355
to the Barracks of the Capital Region

181
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:01,314
to control the situation

182
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:02,714
and order the Capital Governor

183
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:04,635
to search for the Northern Liang people
hiding in the capital

184
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,435
so as not to harm the innocent.

185
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,115
Send generals?

186
00:18:09,314 --> 00:18:10,274
Who?

187
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:14,234
Those from the Ministry of War

188
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:17,034
don't even know
how the Northern Liang Army

189
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:17,915
got in.

190
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:21,875
Useless.

191
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:25,675
A bunch of useless things!

192
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:29,994
Useless!

193
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:32,875
Bad news!

194
00:18:33,554 --> 00:18:34,274
Bad news!

195
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:35,395
Bad news!

196
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:37,875
This is bad, Your Majesty!

197
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:41,355
A large group of grassroots scholars
are gathered outside the palace.

198
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:44,435
They're all dressed in mourning clothes,

199
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:47,875
kneeling and shouting…

200
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:49,155
Tell me!

201
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:53,635
They're kneeling and shouting,

202
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:55,554
"An incompetent ruler is in power.

203
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:56,754
The Imperial Seal is lost.

204
00:18:57,155 --> 00:18:59,595
The state
is on the brink of destruction."

205
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,074
How dare they!

206
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,635
They've all turned against me!

207
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:25,435
The Imperial Seal is missing?

208
00:19:26,714 --> 00:19:27,915
The Imperial Seal

209
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:30,234
is the symbol of Southern Chen.

210
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:30,794
That's right.

211
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:32,355
How can it be misplaced?

212
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:39,395
Are you my subjects

213
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:41,675
or their subjects?

214
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,355
You are so easily shaken.

215
00:19:45,155 --> 00:19:45,915
What?

216
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,994
Do all of you intend to rebel?

217
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:52,635
Your Majesty,

218
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:55,074
the rumors are spreading.

219
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:58,280
Why not bring forth the Imperial Seal

220
00:19:58,314 --> 00:19:59,754
for us to see?

221
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:01,474
So that we may cease the rumors

222
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:04,435
and end the scholars' doubts.

223
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:11,595
Is that what you all think?

224
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:22,474
All right.

225
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:25,395
I will show all of you

226
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:30,714
that I am the rightful Emperor
of Southern Chen.

227
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:55,395
Go.

228
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,955
Bring me the Imperial Seal.

229
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:00,274
Your Majesty, this…

230
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:05,754
Your Majesty!

231
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:06,595
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

232
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:07,474
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

233
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:08,754
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

234
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:10,274
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

235
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,595
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

236
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:13,034
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

237
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:14,835
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

238
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:16,835
Your Majesty…

239
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:18,355
Your Majesty…

240
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:26,234
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

241
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:27,675
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

242
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:28,915
Your Majesty…

243
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:30,074
Your Majesty…

244
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:46,754
The Imperial Seal is lost.

245
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:51,155
Your Majesty,
for the sake of Southern Chen,

246
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,234
please abdicate the throne
in favor of the virtuous.

247
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:59,435
Your Majesty,
for the sake of Southern Chen,

248
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:01,554
please abdicate the throne
in favor of the virtuous.

249
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:03,355
Official Zhou.

250
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:06,155
In the midst of internal
and external troubles,

251
00:23:06,514 --> 00:23:08,274
not only do you not
ease His Majesty's burdens,

252
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:09,955
but instead,
you are forcing His Majesty to abdicate.

253
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:11,155
What are your intentions?

254
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:15,195
Do you really intend to rebel?

255
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:23,554
Official Mu,

256
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:27,274
how can you accuse me of so?

257
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:30,514
I am doing this
for the sake of Southern Chen.

258
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:32,514
The ruler is incompetent.

259
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,074
The people's grievances are resounding.

260
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:39,754
Even the Imperial Seal
is nowhere to be found.

261
00:23:40,115 --> 00:23:41,554
This is heaven's will!

262
00:23:45,395 --> 00:23:47,955
Official Mu,
have you forgotten about Prince Regent,

263
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:50,474
who died an unjust death in prison?

264
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:11,435
(Xuanzheng Hall)

265
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:06,514
What benefits did this fatuous
and self-indulgent ruler offer you

266
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:10,514
to make you betray the light
and turn to the dark side?

267
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:13,714
It seems like you're the one
who did that, Official Zhou.

268
00:25:14,635 --> 00:25:16,554
The Northern Liang Army
is upon the territory of Southern Chen.

269
00:25:16,835 --> 00:25:18,675
Yet, you are ignorant of everything
that is happening.

270
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:21,875
Is Yemu Jing

271
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:24,034
your new master?

272
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:26,395
Lies and slander!

273
00:25:26,835 --> 00:25:29,155
I am loyal to the country!

274
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,314
I would never collude
with the likes of Northern Liang!

275
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:49,355
A country cannot be without a ruler.

276
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,754
His Majesty is the direct descendant
of the Liu Clan.

277
00:25:52,754 --> 00:25:54,074
Yet, you are forcing him to abdicate
in front of the court.

278
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:57,355
Aren't you doing this
to make things easier for Yemu Jing?

279
00:25:57,435 --> 00:25:57,994
You…

280
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,955
I, too, am a direct descendant of Liu.

281
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:41,635
Jiao.

282
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:43,754
You…

283
00:26:45,635 --> 00:26:46,675
First Princess.

284
00:26:47,994 --> 00:26:50,314
You dared to steal the Imperial Seal?

285
00:26:50,314 --> 00:26:51,835
You killed Yemu Zhen?

286
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:53,274
You let the Northern Liang Army

287
00:26:53,835 --> 00:26:55,314
into the Barracks
of the Capital Region, right?

288
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:03,474
In order to fulfill your ambition,

289
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:07,955
you colluded with Northern Liang
and let the enemies in.

290
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:12,754
Zhuohua,

291
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:16,355
I appreciate your talent.

292
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:19,155
A wise bird chooses its tree to nest.

293
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:21,714
It's not too late for you to turn back

294
00:27:22,915 --> 00:27:23,915
from your misguided path.

295
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:28,074
Jiao…

296
00:27:29,754 --> 00:27:31,514
What Official Mu said is not true,

297
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:33,355
isn't it?

298
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,355
Please abdicate, Your Majesty.

299
00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:22,474
Princess Roujia is the eldest daughter
of the late Emperor.

300
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:24,474
She is loved and respected
by the people.

301
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:26,714
She is as wise and capable

302
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:30,355
as the late Empress Yuanguang.

303
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:35,675
I am willing to support
Princess Roujia as Empress,

304
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,474
to heed heaven's will
and assure the people.

305
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:44,314
Please abdicate, Your Majesty.

306
00:28:44,554 --> 00:28:46,635
Please abdicate the throne

307
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:49,835
to Princess Roujia, Your Majesty.

308
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:14,034
Zhuohua.

309
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:15,675
Look.

310
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,115
This is the Emperor you serve.

311
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:21,514
Look at how weak and pathetic he is.

312
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:23,794
He doesn't deserve to be a ruler.

313
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:29,514
You and I are both women.

314
00:29:30,115 --> 00:29:31,635
You should understand me.

315
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:34,395
Why do you refuse

316
00:29:34,915 --> 00:29:36,234
to side with me

317
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:38,155
and create a prosperous Southern Chen?

318
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:43,314
Your Highness,

319
00:29:44,754 --> 00:29:45,595
I've told you.

320
00:29:47,435 --> 00:29:48,915
You and I are not the same.

321
00:29:50,994 --> 00:29:53,474
My path may be laden with thorns now,

322
00:29:54,435 --> 00:29:55,395
but my future is destined

323
00:29:57,115 --> 00:29:58,635
to be bright.

324
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:01,395
But your path

325
00:30:03,754 --> 00:30:04,915
will only be shrouded in darkness.

326
00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:08,514
So stubborn.

327
00:30:19,074 --> 00:30:20,675
Please abdicate the throne

328
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:24,514
to Princess Roujia, Your Majesty.

329
00:30:47,395 --> 00:30:48,074
Chen.

330
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:50,234
The outcome has been decided.

331
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:53,074
Why covet a position
that doesn't belong to you?

332
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:56,274
If you know what's good for you,

333
00:30:57,395 --> 00:30:59,074
I will spare you

334
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:01,754
and let you live a carefree life
as a wealthy noble.

335
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:13,955
Jiao…

336
00:31:16,314 --> 00:31:17,714
Must you do this?

337
00:31:22,074 --> 00:31:23,675
Please abdicate, Your Majesty.

338
00:31:27,355 --> 00:31:29,355
Please abdicate, Your Majesty.

339
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:00,875
Prince Regent!

340
00:32:02,155 --> 00:32:02,994
It's Prince Regent!

341
00:32:03,115 --> 00:32:04,274
The Prince Regent is alive!

342
00:32:30,554 --> 00:32:32,554
Surrender, and you will live.

343
00:32:33,915 --> 00:32:35,115
Resist,

344
00:32:36,115 --> 00:32:37,155
and you will be shown no mercy!

345
00:34:06,955 --> 00:34:09,395
Prince Regent, you are blessed indeed.

346
00:34:10,554 --> 00:34:12,915
But you've managed to save your life.

347
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:15,474
Why did you come here to die?

348
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,955
Official Zhou, why are you doing this?

349
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:22,154
Your ancestors were all capable

350
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,395
and distinguished ministers whose names
will be remembered throughout history.

351
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:27,474
But you

352
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,074
will end up

353
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:33,594
an infamous and disloyal traitor
in history.

354
00:34:34,194 --> 00:34:35,915
How my name will go down in history

355
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,955
is not something

356
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:40,315
for you to be concerned about,
Prince Regent.

357
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:42,835
The outcome has been decided.

358
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:45,634
You will die with this fatuous
and self-indulgent ruler.

359
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:48,275
That's right.

360
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:52,034
The outcome has been decided.

361
00:34:53,315 --> 00:34:54,154
Zhou Cishan.

362
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:56,194
You are the Minister of War,

363
00:34:56,755 --> 00:34:59,074
but you will not be able
to use your treacherous heart

364
00:35:00,235 --> 00:35:02,715
to waver the loyalty
of our courageous troops.

365
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:06,315
You think the rebels got in so easily

366
00:35:06,634 --> 00:35:08,154
because of your strategy?

367
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,395
It was His Majesty and I who wanted

368
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:15,955
to lure you people out from the shadows.

369
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,395
The rebels you let in

370
00:35:19,275 --> 00:35:22,674
have all been suppressed
by the Cangwu Army.

371
00:35:23,235 --> 00:35:24,154
Impossible!

372
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:25,554
That is not possible!

373
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:26,835
Zhou Cishan.

374
00:35:28,315 --> 00:35:29,514
Are you still counting on

375
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:31,435
Yemu Jing's reinforcements?

376
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:35,315
Zhijian has already seized control
of the Barracks of the Capital Region.

377
00:35:37,154 --> 00:35:38,634
Yemu Jing is probably

378
00:35:40,674 --> 00:35:42,154
in a precarious situation himself.

379
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:46,795
The Imperial Seal has arrived.

380
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:01,915
Your Majesty,

381
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:03,915
there is no need to hide it from me.

382
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,955
I thought it was strange

383
00:36:07,435 --> 00:36:08,715
that you two were arguing so often.

384
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:13,955
You must've been working together

385
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:15,634
for a long time now.

386
00:36:16,235 --> 00:36:18,554
You deliberately created
a false impression of discord

387
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:20,634
so that Her Highness would think
that her plan of turning you two

388
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:22,275
against each other had succeeded.

389
00:36:22,634 --> 00:36:23,755
To obtain something,

390
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,034
you must first give something.

391
00:36:25,915 --> 00:36:27,154
Indeed, it is a wise strategy.

392
00:36:28,955 --> 00:36:30,355
This was His Lordship's idea, wasn't it?

393
00:36:32,715 --> 00:36:33,994
So you know everything.

394
00:36:37,755 --> 00:36:39,634
Uncle didn't mean
to keep you in the dark.

395
00:36:39,955 --> 00:36:40,674
He…

396
00:36:40,674 --> 00:36:41,435
Your Majesty.

397
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:42,915
Intentional or not,

398
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,355
I will settle this matter
with His Lordship at a later time.

399
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:48,154
But for now, our priority

400
00:36:48,634 --> 00:36:51,074
is to continue the act that you two

401
00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:52,315
have set up.

402
00:36:52,955 --> 00:36:55,915
Princess Roujia's prestige
is on the rise.

403
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:58,474
She is only one step away
from the throne,

404
00:36:58,915 --> 00:36:59,795
and that step

405
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:01,355
is legitimate authority.

406
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:04,034
In my humble opinion,

407
00:37:04,835 --> 00:37:06,034
Her Highness's next move will surely be

408
00:37:06,395 --> 00:37:08,594
to get her hands on the Imperial Seal.

409
00:37:13,755 --> 00:37:15,235
If she acquires the Imperial Seal,

410
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,154
then, at the very least, on the surface,
she has reason and legitimacy.

411
00:37:20,275 --> 00:37:21,395
She will act under the will of heaven.

412
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:25,355
It will complement her title

413
00:37:25,594 --> 00:37:26,994
as the reincarnation
of Empress Yuanguang.

414
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:32,114
Of course, we mustn't let her
obtain the real Imperial Seal.

415
00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:35,315
So what you're suggesting is to replace
the real seal with a fake?

416
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:38,235
Let her think that she has succeeded

417
00:37:39,235 --> 00:37:41,194
so that her ambitions
will be completely exposed.

418
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:42,355
Precisely.

419
00:37:43,235 --> 00:37:45,275
But this is a grave matter.

420
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:47,074
We will need Your Majesty's approval

421
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:48,474
before we proceed.

422
00:37:58,114 --> 00:37:58,875
Your Majesty,

423
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:00,395
this…

424
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:01,994
I ordered you to make the switch.

425
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:03,194
What have you got to fear?

426
00:38:04,755 --> 00:38:05,474
I…

427
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:06,955
Chief Eunuch,

428
00:38:07,235 --> 00:38:08,835
we're just switching the real
with a fake.

429
00:38:09,674 --> 00:38:10,634
Official Mu,

430
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:12,915
you make it sound so easy.

431
00:38:13,034 --> 00:38:15,275
This is the Imperial Seal!

432
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:16,514
Chief Eunuch,

433
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:17,835
if the seal is lost,

434
00:38:18,114 --> 00:38:19,715
then you, as the Chief Steward,

435
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,114
will not escape responsibility.

436
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:22,795
Losing the Imperial Seal

437
00:38:22,994 --> 00:38:25,395
surely is worse than
replacing it, right?

438
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:26,955
I…

439
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:29,835
Well, isn't that the case?

440
00:38:30,315 --> 00:38:32,955
That is true, but…

441
00:38:49,755 --> 00:38:50,514
Seize them.

442
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:27,154
Jiao,

443
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:29,875
give up.

444
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,875
Out of consideration
for our relationship,

445
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:37,514
I will definitely show you grace.

446
00:39:44,554 --> 00:39:45,395
It was you!

447
00:39:49,994 --> 00:39:51,634
You betrayed me!

448
00:39:58,235 --> 00:39:59,154
That Shen Jinghong.

449
00:39:59,994 --> 00:40:01,674
Since he doesn't know
what's good for him,

450
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:02,634
then don't blame me

451
00:40:03,955 --> 00:40:05,355
for disregarding our tie
as graduates of the same batch.

452
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:16,435
(Xiaoqin Pleasure House)

453
00:40:17,235 --> 00:40:18,755
Zhuohua, come in quickly.

454
00:40:33,795 --> 00:40:35,994
You had me lose Her Highness's spies

455
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:38,194
to come here and see you.

456
00:40:39,674 --> 00:40:40,955
Why?

457
00:40:41,674 --> 00:40:42,755
You're already here.

458
00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:46,235
Why are you asking knowingly?

459
00:40:48,435 --> 00:40:51,315
I know you have ambitions, Shen.

460
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:54,514
You wish for a clean court,

461
00:40:55,154 --> 00:40:56,194
a fresh environment,

462
00:40:56,795 --> 00:40:57,634
and assisting the wise ruler.

463
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:00,154
But is this the Southern Chen

464
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:02,755
you wish to see?

465
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:05,395
Or, rather,

466
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:09,435
when Her Highness takes over the crown,

467
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:12,194
will the court of that time

468
00:41:15,355 --> 00:41:17,474
become what you wish to see?

469
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:20,194
Is she still the princess

470
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:24,315
you've always wanted to follow?

471
00:41:27,915 --> 00:41:28,955
(What's the use of apologies?)

472
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,034
Will apologies do anything to help now?

473
00:42:16,355 --> 00:42:17,194
Mu Zhuohua.

474
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:34,035
(Xiaoqin Pleasure House)

475
00:42:55,715 --> 00:42:56,674
It was me.

476
00:43:22,315 --> 00:43:23,074
Your Highness.

477
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:26,715
Stop this.

478
00:43:28,395 --> 00:43:29,474
Stop?

479
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:33,474
Why should I?

480
00:43:35,835 --> 00:43:37,194
The incapable ruler is in power.

481
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:40,074
I am doing this
for the people of Southern Chen!

482
00:43:40,074 --> 00:43:41,594
I have done nothing wrong!

483
00:43:45,154 --> 00:43:46,074
It's you.

484
00:43:49,315 --> 00:43:50,194
It's you!

485
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:53,875
You're the ones
who are aiding and abetting tyranny!

486
00:43:58,955 --> 00:44:00,395
For the people?

487
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:08,315
Jiao,

488
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:10,395
you colluded with the Zhou family

489
00:44:10,755 --> 00:44:12,154
to fabricate seven severe crimes

490
00:44:13,315 --> 00:44:14,634
to falsely accuse Uncle.

491
00:44:17,235 --> 00:44:18,955
Is this what you mean by doing it

492
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:22,594
"for the people"?

493
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:32,315
Extorting, oppressing,

494
00:44:33,315 --> 00:44:34,435
and embezzling military funds,

495
00:44:35,554 --> 00:44:37,315
these are all crimes of the Zhou family.

496
00:44:38,835 --> 00:44:40,034
But you pinned all the blame

497
00:44:40,715 --> 00:44:42,315
on Uncle instead.

498
00:44:44,355 --> 00:44:46,594
You are most despicable.

499
00:44:52,395 --> 00:44:53,634
Mobilizing troops without authorization.

500
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:56,875
Those are all Uncle's personal guards.

501
00:44:57,315 --> 00:44:58,474
They are not part of the military.

502
00:45:00,194 --> 00:45:01,795
That accusation does not hold water.

503
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:04,034
Assembling one's personal army
and challenging authority.

504
00:45:05,154 --> 00:45:06,175
Uncle's military authority

505
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,955
was entrusted to him
by the late Emperor.

506
00:45:08,955 --> 00:45:10,114
You are questioning

507
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:13,395
the will of the late Emperor.

508
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:17,194
As for disrespecting the Emperor

509
00:45:18,074 --> 00:45:19,114
and treason,

510
00:45:20,114 --> 00:45:21,034
those are all part of the plan

511
00:45:21,474 --> 00:45:23,554
Uncle and I designed.

512
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,474
All to expose you

513
00:45:27,755 --> 00:45:29,594
of your crimes today.

514
00:45:32,835 --> 00:45:33,674
Jiao.

515
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:36,674
You framed the loyal and righteous

516
00:45:37,955 --> 00:45:39,074
and disregarded ethics.

517
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:42,554
Are you doing it for the people

518
00:45:43,715 --> 00:45:45,315
or for your own ambition?

519
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:50,915
Ambition?

520
00:45:53,915 --> 00:45:55,875
From the moment you were born,

521
00:45:56,955 --> 00:45:58,395
you've been noble and blessed.

522
00:46:00,315 --> 00:46:01,194
But what about me?

523
00:46:06,275 --> 00:46:08,074
For your prestigious mother,

524
00:46:08,835 --> 00:46:10,194
for the noble you,

525
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:13,315
should my mother deserve to die?

526
00:46:18,154 --> 00:46:20,154
Just because we had no power to rely on,

527
00:46:21,355 --> 00:46:22,074
should our lives

528
00:46:23,315 --> 00:46:25,915
be at your mercy like ants?

529
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:35,474
My foolish brother,

530
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,275
without your supreme power,

531
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:44,554
how can you have the audacity

532
00:46:46,114 --> 00:46:48,994
