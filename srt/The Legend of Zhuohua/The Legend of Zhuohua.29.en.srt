Liu Yan left the capital,

135
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,159
but this is a rare opportunity

136
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,720
to me.

137
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,200

Man.

143
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,759
I had a meeting
with Her Highness around 5 PM,

144
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,120
but she didn't show up.

145
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,120
I got a little worried,

146
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,159
so I came to check.

147
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,320
Her Highness did spend more time

148
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,799
at the grave today.

149
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,799
Perhaps something came up,

150
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,600
or it could be...

151
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,120
Your Highness.

152
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,080
Your Highness.

153
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,840
Put me down.

154
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,960
I can walk on my own.

155
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,999
If you insist on walking,

156
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,600
it will worsen your injury.

157
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,360
This medicine aids blood circulation.

158
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,600
Your ankle is pretty swollen.

159
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,279
You'd better apply this now.

160
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,840
Why do you carry medicine with you?

161
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,560
My father was a hunter.

162
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,279
I got influenced and it became a habit.

163
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,919
I had almost forgotten about that.

164
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,399
I hope you don't mind.

165
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,720
It might hurt a little.

166
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,200
Bear with it.

167
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,919
Come to think of it,

168
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,039
Liu Yan left the capital.

169
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,879
Zhuohua took a leave of absence.

170
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,120
Official Shen,
you mustn't miss this chance.

171
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,840
Understood.

172
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
It is perfect for the reform

173
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,799
of the Protected Appointments System.

174
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,720
You can first present Liu Chen

175
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,399
the flaws of
the Protected Appointments System

176
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,080
to draw his attention.

177
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,240
On top of that,

178
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,480
we need him at the front

179
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,279
to resist pressure from noble families.

180
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,279
Then

181
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,879
we can intensify
the conflict between them.

182
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,879
I almost forgot.

183
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,440
Liu Chen thinks so highly of you.

184
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,440
If you dedicate yourself to him,

185
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,360
perhaps

186
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,759
the people will see you
as a subject to a wise Emperor.

187
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,519
Your Highness.

188
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,039
I will only be your subject.

189
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,919
The people only like me
when I am looking

190
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,639
talented and glorious.

191
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,639
But only one person

192
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,240
reached out to me

193
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,480
when I was mired down.

194
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,639
The power of the noble families

195
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,799
has taken up half the imperial court.

196
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,879
They are now
the cancer of Southern Chen.

197
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,519
Abolishing
the Protected Appointments System

198
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
is the only way to bring peace
to Southern Chen again.

199
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,879
I will give you a list of names

200
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,720
who are our people.

201
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Find a way

202
00:15:58,879 --> 00:15:59,840
to assign them

203
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,279
to suitable positions one by one.

204
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:04,879
Only by doing so

205
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,799
can we be strong enough

206
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,399
to fight the noble families
in the imperial court.

207
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:13,720
Understood.

208
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,519
You must break to make.

209
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,639
The noble families are the cancer.

210
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,279
Time to get rid of them.

211
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,639
Come.

212
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,159
It's fine.

213
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,440
It's getting late.

214
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,679
Don't you want to go back?

215
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:42,919
I do.

216
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,399
It was you.

217
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,879
You have been taking care of me.

218
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,159
It wasn't me.

219
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,280
It was Juli.

220
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,479
You're lying.

221
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,840
What are you holding, then?

222
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,399
Isn't it for me?

223
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,479
Juli cooked this porridge for you.

224
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,320
Quickly have it while it's still warm.

225
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,879
After that, return to the capital.

226
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,560
Are you chasing me out?

227
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,520
Do you expect me to let you

228
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,639
neglect your duties without permission
by staying here?

229
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,280
Do you really hate

230
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,280
seeing me that much?

231
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:14,719
Isn't it obvious?

232
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,280
If you really hate seeing me,

233
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:24,000
why did you bring me inside?

234
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,439
Even if it was just a stray animal,

235
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,159
I wouldn't be able to bear
seeing them in the rain.

236
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,520
So to you,

237
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,199
I am no different from stray animals.

238
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,560
Were you nice to me

239
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,320

240
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,479

241
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,399

00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,800
My Lord.

368
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,879
My Lord.

369
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,520
His illness has worsened too severely.

370
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,000
Does that mean...

371
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:39,399
I checked his pulse just now.

372
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:40,600
We mustn't wait any longer.

373
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:42,080
In that case,

374
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:43,760
have you mastered

375
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,280
the Midnight-Noon Ebb-Flow Acupuncture?

376
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:47,280
Right now,

377
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,639
I am only a beginner at it.

378
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,600
But for the slim chance of a cure,

379
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,600
I don't have a choice.

380
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:25,199
- My Lord!
- My Lord.

381
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,120
My Lord.

382
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:29,479
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

383
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,399
Why?

384
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,600
How can it be?

385
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,726
I made no mistakes.

386
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,639
There is no guaranteed cure

387
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:44,439
in medicine.

388
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:45,719
Official Mu.

389
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,885
You have done everything you could.

390
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,159
But I...

391
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,840
Did you know?

392
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
To me,

393
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,479
your presence

394
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:47,360
is like the moon in the sky.

395
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,959
I can only look at it from afar.

396
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,360
I never thought

397
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:57,360
that one day,

398
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,679
the bright moon would shine on me

399
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,040
and my heart.

400
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,480
But, Liu Yan,

401
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,759
if

402
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,759
you die just like that,

403
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,480
perhaps

404
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,759
in my old age someday in the future,

405
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,319
I would remember you.

406
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,920
But at that time,

407
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:40,199
you will just

408
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,560
become an illusion

409
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,120
like a reflection of the moon.

410
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,359
No matter how happy we were,

411
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,920
you will just be a passer-by in my life.

412
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,920
Can you really accept that?

413
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,040
Isn't it funny?

414
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,400
Actually,

415
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,799
the one who can't accept it

416
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,080
is me.

417
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,120
So, please.

418
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,120
You must be all right.

419
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,359
Don't leave me behind.

420
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,120
My Lord.

421
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,359
You're awake.

422
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,040
I'm sorry.

423
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,040
I thought

424
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,440
you wouldn't feel so sad if I did that.

425
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,319
But

426
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,440
when I was standing

427
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,880
at the gates of Hell,

428
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,040
I realized

429
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:07,400
that all of this

430
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,000
only made things worse.

431
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:14,319
It only made you suffer even more.

432
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,000
And I

433
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,400
couldn't accept it either.

434
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,000
While I was half-awake,

435
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,880
I kept thinking.

436
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:53,480
Even if I die,

437
00:37:55,759 --> 00:37:58,880
I mustn't die
with this reluctance and regret.

438
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,199
Can you stop saying that word
in front of me?

439
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,920
Alright.

440
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,839
But...

441
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,880
Don't go. Alright?

442
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,199
You even chased me out.

443
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:27,839
You were really annoying.

444
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:30,679
Yes, I'm the most annoying guy.

445
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:34,199
I

446
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,880
am the most annoying guy in the world.

447
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,279
Imperial Physician Zhao.

448
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:52,000
It's cured.

449
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,960
It's cured.

450
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,359
The poisons of the Revival Powder
and the Yuanluo Flower

451
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,239
have all been eliminated.

452
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,639
Understood.

453
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,199
I'm going to see His Lordship.

454
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:07,719
Sure. Go ahead now.

455
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,239
This is great.

456
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,799
My Lord, you have been cured.

457
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:19,159
