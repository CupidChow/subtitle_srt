Have a hot cup of tea.

21
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,990
This tea is clean and refreshing,

22
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,790
and the flavor lingers on.

23
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:02,269
Just like the young man who just left.

24
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,870
Grandaunt, you flatter him.

25
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,190
He came late at night.

26
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,950
Who is he?

27
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:15,669
He's just a poor scholar

28
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,709
who's been helped by Jishan Hall,

29
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,429
and he came specifically today
to express his gratitude in person.

30
00:02:21,149 --> 00:02:22,669
He's from a poor background?

31
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,669
Which poor scholar can be

32
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:28,109
as talented as him?

33
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:35,869
I may be old and senile,

34
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:39,989
I still know

35
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:42,230
the famous Shen Jinghong.

36
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:50,230
Jiao,

37
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,429
don't blame me for nagging you.

38
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,869
Gather sweet blossoms while you may,

39
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,910
and not the twig devoid of flowers.

40
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,310
Grandaunt,

41
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:03,989
don't worry.

42
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,709
I know what I'm doing.

43
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:09,669
By the way, Grandaunt.

44
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,389
Why haven't I seen
the Evil-erasing Sword?

45
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:13,389
Where did you put it?

46
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,589
Why did you suddenly

47
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,989
bring the Evil-erasing Sword up?

48
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,230
I just don't understand it.

49
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,070
The Evil-erasing Sword was handed down
from Grandfather.

50
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:31,709
It's sharp,

51
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,310
it protects Southern Chen

52
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,350
and represents the supreme power
of the imperial family.

53
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,190
Grandaunt,

54
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:41,709
you've kept the sword for years

55
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,790
and never thought to unsheathe it?

56
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,549
The Evil-erasing Sword
is an important weapon of the country.

57
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:52,389
Although it's sharp,

58
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,510
it can only be used once.

59
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,989
I must be very careful

60
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,429
so as not to bring harm
to the people of Southern Chen.

61
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,910
Roujia,

62
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:06,310
you're a smart girl.

63
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:07,989
You should know

64
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:09,829
what to ask

65
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,389
and what not to ask.

66
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,750
Grandaunt,

67
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,430

70
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,909
are you sure

71
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,670
you don't want to help this time?

72
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,950
It's not that I don't want to,

73
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,670
it's that I can't.

74
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,070
No matter how much he's sinned,

75
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,229
he's still my father
who gave me life and raised me.

76
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:48,670
I really...

77
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,430
Yunqian,

78
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,709
you were born into a wealthy family

79
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,630
and raised with great privileges.

80
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,829
But have you ever thought

81
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,389
that those fine clothes and food

82
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,709
were really given to you
by the Sun family?

83
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,229
No.

84
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,110
It's obvious that millions of people

85
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,589
in Southern Chen

86
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,110
are providing for you.

87
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,229
You've been provided for so long.

88
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,149
Don't you really want

89
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,589
to think about them for once?

90
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,709
I know you better than anyone else.

91
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,709
I know you're big-hearted

92
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:40,510
and ambitious.

93
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:43,503
You'll make the right choice,

94
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,110
right?

95
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,269
If...

96
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,909
If I promise you

97
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,870
that I can keep
everyone in the Sun family safe,

98
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,630
will you help me

the biggest boss

is the Sun family of Jiangzuo.

141
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,349
Sun Ru used his power for personal gain

142
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,030
and exploited the food
for disaster relief,

143
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:33,349
which led to a loss of millions of taels
to the government

144

and starvation in Huaizhou.

145

should be punished for?

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,749
I think

156
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,150

171
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,070
I've found out

172
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,310
that Sun Ru not only
defrauded the national treasury

173
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,989
but also colluded with Northern Liang
to smuggle salt and tea.

All of this

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,030
is recorded in this ledger.

How dare you collude
with Northern Liang?

179
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:31,709
You're absolutely unforgivable!

180
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,430
I was thinking of sparing your life

181
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,070
because of the merits of your ancestors,

182
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:40,869
but I didn't expect

183
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:43,310
you to collude with the enemy
and commit treason!

184
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,109
Pass on my orders.

185
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,430
Sun Ru's crimes are so heinous

186
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:02,109
that he should be beheaded.

187
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,709
The men of the Sun family will be exiled

188
00:13:05,469 --> 00:13:06,550
while the women of the Sun family

189
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:09,469
will be deprived of their birthright.

190
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,509
Your Majesty,

191
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:12,070
Sun Ru is certainly guilty,

192
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:13,349
but Sun Yunqian...

193
00:13:13,469 --> 00:13:14,950
Sun Yunqian merited

194
00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:17,190
for reporting his father's misdeeds.

195
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,670
He's fully exonerated.

196
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:20,349
But...

197
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:21,270
I've made up my mind.

198
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:22,950
No further advice is necessary.

199
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:25,270
You're wise, Your Majesty.

200
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,229
You're wise, Your Majesty.

201
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,160
(Wenzheng Parlor)

202
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,070
Shen Jinghong!

203
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,070
What did you promise me?

204
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,790
You said you'd save
everyone in the Sun family.

205
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,869
What's the result?

206
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:36,709
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,190
Sorry?

208
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:43,589
Does an apology help?

209
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,709
I'm asking you, does an apology help?

210
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,790
I thought you were my confidant,

211
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,749
but you used me.

212
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,150
Fine.

213
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,989
I, Sun Yunqian,
have seen through you today.

214
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:32,749
My father was right.

215
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:36,509
I was stupid.

216
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,070
I was too naive.

217
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,190
I brought down the Sun family!

218
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,150
Jinghong.

219
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,070
No.

220
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,790
I should call you...

221
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,190
Official Shen.

222
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,950
You're a man of your word,

223
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:15,629
my foot!

224
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,830
Your Highness.

225
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,789
Now that the Sun family
has been crushed,

226
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:14,549
the Zhou family is the most powerful
in the imperial court.

227
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,910
Official Zhou,

228
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:18,350
I've kept my promise.

229
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:21,670
Can we join forces now?

230
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,630
Have you been waiting long?

231
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,110
In the imperial court today,

232
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,190
Zhou Cishan suddenly revealed

233
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,549
Sun Ru's collusion with Northern Liang
and the smuggling of salt and tea.

234
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,509
His Majesty was furious

235
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,789
and sentenced Sun Ru to be beheaded,

236
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:13,789
all the men of the Sun family
to be exiled

237
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,069
as slaves,

238
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,269
while the women
to be deprived of their birthright.

239
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:20,430
From now on,

240
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,989
there will be no more Suns
in the imperial court.

241
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,190
I have

242
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,150
heard about it.

243
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,709
When did this happen?

244
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,870
What?

245
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,190
When did you start working
with the Zhou family?

246
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,870
It's all over now.

247
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:51,229
What's the point of pursuing this?

248
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,150
The Sun family covered up bad deeds,

249
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:55,390
embezzled public funds,

250
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,877
defrauded the national treasury,
cheated both the authorities

251
00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:57,229
and the public,

252
00:18:57,229 --> 00:18:58,190
and robbed the people of their wealth.

253
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,630
There's solid evidence for all of this.

254
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,469
I didn't wrong anyone.

255
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,749
But I told you

256
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,350
that I promised Sun Yunqian

257
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:07,870
that I'd keep his family safe.

258
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:11,630
Wasn't that good friend of yours

259
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,110
exonerated?

260
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,309
Since you've made up your mind,

261
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:27,670
I have

262
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:29,830
nothing more to say.

263
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:41,309
Your Highness,

264
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,870
Official Shen seems to be very angry.

265
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,110
It's no bother.

266
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,110
Let him be.

267
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,590
(Xuanzheng Hall)

268
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,150
(Regarding
the Protected Appointments System,)

269
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,749
Official Shen and Official Mu,

270
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,069
what do you think about that?

271
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:46,870
Your Majesty,

272
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,229
I have something to report.

273
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,269
You're not in favor of abolishing
the Protected Appointments System,

274
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,789
but in favor of promoting
the Talent Appreciation System.

275
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:15,950
Your Majesty,

276
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,749
it is not for nothing that
the Protected Appointments System

277
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:20,430
has lasted for hundreds of years.

278
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:23,549
Descendants of most noble,
poetic, and scholarly families

279
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,150
are better in literature and martial arts
than grassroots scholars.

280
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,749
And they have made a lot of contributions
to the imperial court.

281
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:32,150
It would be a loss to the imperial court

282
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:33,469
to abolish

283
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,870
the Protected Appointments System.

284
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:37,069
Hence, in my opinion,

285
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:39,350
why don't we get rid of the bad
and keep the good,

286
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,830
and show some appreciation
for the talent?

287
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,749
Get rid of the bad and keep the good,

288
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,549
as well as show some appreciation
for the talent?

289
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,229
That's right.

290
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:00,549
An official of the Seventh-Rank
or above could appoint a son

291
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,069
to be a civil official
of the Third-Rank or above.

292
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,670
A military official
of the Second-Rank or above

293
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,830
may enroll a son
in the imperial academy.

294
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,590
You said in this report

295
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:14,054
that the quota
for the imperial examination

296
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:14,590
will be increased

297
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,830
after the Protected Appointments System
is brought under control?

298
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:20,029
That's right.

299
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,709
As long as the offspring of officials

300
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:24,069
passes the metropolitan examination,

301
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,549
he's bound to pass
the palace examination.

302
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,910
Be it the Imperial Examination System
or the Protected Appointments System,

303
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,469
the purpose is
to select talent for the country,

304
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,870
not to keep trash.

305
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,469
If one has no real talent,

306
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,789
then he should go home
before it's too late,

307
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:40,509
lest he bring harm to himself,

308
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,749
the country and the people.

309
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:02,029
(I've only read the first volume)

310
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,309
(of "Eradicating Corruption Proposal"
written by Mr. Shang)

311
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:06,430
(but I didn't know that
the second volume)

312
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:08,269
(is the most important one.)

313
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,590
(If it is hastily abolished,)

314
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,469
(we cannot be sure what will happen.)

315
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,029
(That's)

316
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,989
(the solution that works.)

317
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,029
(Although Mr. Shang was against
the Protected Appointments System,)

318
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,709
(he never wanted to abolish it
in one fell swoop.)

319
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,269
(As His Lordship said,)

320
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,989
(we should take a step-by-step approach
and work our way up.)

321
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,069
(Memorial Tablet of Respected Teacher,
Shang Shou)

322
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:44,870
Sir,

323
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:47,190
I almost went astray

324
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,029
when I wasn't in my senses.

325
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:52,509
Fortunately, you enlightened me

326
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,789
in the dark.

327
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,749
I'll follow in your footsteps

328
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:57,789
and not let you down.

329
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,910
You've finally made it through.

330
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,950
Tutor Shang would be very proud of you

331
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,590
in the heaven.

332
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,410
(Eradicating Corruption Proposal,
Part Two, by Shang Shou)

333
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:31,069
My heart was filled
with grief and indignation

334
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,509
when Mr. Shang died.

335
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:34,830
For a long time

336
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,590
I couldn't calm my mind
and think straight.

337
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,709
And I acted in a radical way.

338
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:46,029
Even when I fought with the Sun family

339
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:48,549
and had the upper hand,

340
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:51,150
I didn't feel happy.

341
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:54,269
On the contrary, I was rather depressed.

342
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:00,749
I have something to tell you.

343
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,830
He Xin investigated and found

344
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,749
that two groups of people

345
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,069
went to see Tutor Shang
when he was alive.

346
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:12,309
What?

347
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:15,830
The first group was sent
by the Sun family

348
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:18,469
to warn Tutor Shang

349
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,110
not to write any nonsense.

350
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,749
The second group

351
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,469
is the one who killed Tutor Shang.

352
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,069
So you're saying

353
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,430
it wasn't the Sun family
that killed Tutor Shang,

354
00:25:35,989 --> 00:25:37,269
but someone else.

355
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:48,709
Killing my teacher

356
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:51,390
is just a way to get me involved.

357
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:54,749
Only Princess Roujia

358
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:56,430
can be so shrewd

359
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,029
and knows me so well.

360
00:26:08,989 --> 00:26:09,830
Zhuohua,

361
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:13,069
they're trying to confuse you.

362
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:15,989
You mustn't fall into their trap.

363
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,350
They almost made it.

364
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,469
No,

365
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,069
they never had a chance of winning.

366
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,830
As Tutor Shang said in this essay,

367
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,430
the continuation
of the Protected Appointments System

368
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,830
can't be achieved in a single day.

369
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:40,509
So the abolition
of the Protected Appointments System

370
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,309
won't be done in a day either.

371
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,309
I've found a lot of new directions

372
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,950
in this essay by Tutor Shang.

373
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,269
My Lord,

374
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:54,269
are you willing to collaborate with me

375
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:57,229
to find a more secure method for reform?

376
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,150
Yes.

377
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:09,377

393

After long deliberation,

394
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:18,870
I think what Official Mu
has said is well-founded

395
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,430
and sensible,

396
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:24,309
and has taken into account
the situation of both noble

397
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,910
and low-class families.

398
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,549
It's a good idea

399
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,430
worth trying.

I do not deserve your praise.

Uncle.

409
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,590
Your Majesty.

410
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:07,509
I have something to add

411
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:09,309
on the matter of
the Protected Appointments System.

412
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:10,630
Uncle, please go ahead.

413
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:13,670
The protected appointments
of the noble families

414
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,590
is always a tumor

415
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,590
that must be eradicated.

416
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,469
The Talent Appreciation System

417
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:22,789
is just a stopgap measure
for the transition period.

418
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,709
You and I

419
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:27,350
share the same thoughts.

420
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,350
Your Highness.

421
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:48,190
Come in.

422
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,029
Today, in the imperial court,

423
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:03,870
Ms. Mu suddenly changed her mind

424
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,709
and proposed to get rid of the bad
and keep the good,

425
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,229
as well as implement
the Talent Appreciation System.

426
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,430
And His Majesty

427
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,549
immediately agreed to her new proposal.

428
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,200
(Never owned anything,
just follow your heart.)

429
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:23,830
Looks like you knew about it.

430
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:29,469
I didn't expect her
to take a different approach.

431
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,069
This way,

432
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,269
even though
the noble families are unhappy,

433
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,190
they won't act rashly.

434
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,590
And our plans

435
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,110
have come to naught.

436
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,029
Coming up with a plan
in such a short time

437
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,309
that people can't find fault with,

438
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,190
and convincing the proud
and impetuous Liu Chen,

439
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:00,830
she is really the person
who I've been looking out for.

440
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,069
She's really something.

441
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,029
Ms. Mu is very talented indeed.

442
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,709
This Talent Appreciation System
she proposed

443
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:11,309
will definitely

444
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:14,190
have some value in time,

445
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:15,390
but

446
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:17,709
it's too conservative

447
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,789
for Southern Chen at the moment.

448
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,309
And the influence of the noble families

449
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:23,989
will not be crushed

450
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,309
in no time.

451
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:27,950
If we don't get rid of them completely,

452
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:29,670
Southern Chen will be hopeless.

453
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,749
It's alright.

454
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:36,390
Our efforts

455
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:39,989
will not be in vain.

456
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:44,709
When grassroots scholars
become officials,

457
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:47,910
our power in the imperial court
will surely grow.

458
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:50,150
Besides,

459
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,670
Liu Chen's conflict
with the noble families

460
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,989
has only been suppressed
for the time being.

461
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,309
If there's the slightest fuss,

462
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,110
there'll be trouble again.

463
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:04,789
His Majesty has approved
the Talent Appreciation System,

464
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,069
which will be implemented in a few days,

465
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,390
you must be relieved now.

466
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:12,590
It's a long way to go
and there are many obstacles.

467
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:14,269
This is just the beginning.

468
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,430
We've just taken the first step.

469
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:18,950
There's still a long way to go.

470
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,910
You and I share a common vision.

471
00:32:22,989 --> 00:32:24,910
I advised His Majesty today

472
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:28,749
that the Protected Appointments System
must be eradicated.

473
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,309
Hopefully, in the near future,

474
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:34,469
the Talent Appreciation System
will only bring out the real talent.

475
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,469
From now on, regardless of gender,

476
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:38,549
regardless of status,

477
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:40,469
only the best will be chosen,

478
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:41,709
and only the talented will be appointed.

479
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:44,390
I hope for equality for all

480
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,549
in the country.

481
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,269
Even if we can't see that day,

482
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:53,350
it will come.

483
00:32:56,749 --> 00:32:57,749
No way.

484
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,069
You must live long enough

485
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,950
to see the arrival of that day.

486
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:07,309
But

487
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,749
some people don't want me to live long.

488
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,989
Then you must live a good life

489
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,229
to piss her off.

490
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,469
First, she forged
the testamentary edict.

491
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:20,150
Then, she spread the rumor
that I was going to my fiefdom.

492
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:22,910
And now,

493
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:23,963
she's stirring up conflict

494
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:25,590
between the noble families
and His Majesty.

495
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:28,269
Roujia

496
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:30,709
is wildly ambitious indeed.

497
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,190
Not only is she wildly ambitious,

498
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,910
but she's clearly
aiming for that position.

499
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,789
My brother

500
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,590
entrusted me with his children.

501
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,390
Now, it seems

502
00:33:47,469 --> 00:33:48,870
that I can't live up to that promise.

503
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:51,229
My Lord,

504
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,749
you've never done anything wrong
to anyone.

505
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:03,229
What's the matter?

506
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,630
I'm worried about Sun.

507
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:08,390
Sun Yunqian?

508
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,109
On the one hand, he's a righteous man,

509
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,790
and on the other,
he's thinking of his family.

510
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:17,270
That's why he decided to hand over

511
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,109
the evidence of the Sun family's crimes.

512
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,029
The Sun family deserved it,

513
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:25,469
but I'm afraid he can't get over it.

514
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:38,989
Does it hurt?

515
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,710
Your Highness, thank you for saving me

516
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,469
by getting me out of hell.

517
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,069
We've known each other for a long time,

518
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,029
how can I just stand by and do nothing?

519
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:59,989
Where are my mother and sister-in-law?

520
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,430
Your Highness,
do you know where they are?

521
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:04,509
The two of them

522
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:06,669
are doing hard labor.

523
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:08,910
Your Highness,

524
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:11,230
can you please save them both?

525
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,549
I begged many times
in front of His Majesty

526
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,230
to get you out.

527
00:35:17,669 --> 00:35:18,750
His Majesty

528
00:35:19,669 --> 00:35:22,029
won't have mercy
on your mother and sister-in-law.

529
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:26,750
How much longer will they both suffer?

530
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,310
We'll have to wait for His Majesty
to show mercy.

531
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:35,790
My mother is old.

532
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,109
My sister-in-law

533
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,830
has always been weak.

534
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,109
How can they stand doing hard labor?

535
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,629
I'm sure both of them
are worried about you too.

536
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:49,509
So you must pull yourself together.

537
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,430
The Sun family doesn't deserve
such a harsh punishment.

538
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,029
His Majesty would like to be lenient.

539
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:01,989
It wouldn't have been so bad

540
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:04,989
if someone hadn't tried
to make things worse.

541
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,149
It's Mu Zhuohua.

542
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,310
It's Mu Zhuohua, right?

543
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,989
If she hadn't kept targeting my father,

544
00:36:16,629 --> 00:36:18,149
how would the Sun family have...

545
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,669
I didn't expect that either.

546
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,189
I misjudged her.

547
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,870
I want to take revenge.

548
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:34,830
Now is not the time to do so.

549
00:36:36,189 --> 00:36:38,109
You mustn't do anything rash

550
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:40,750
that might get you into trouble.

551
00:37:03,669 --> 00:37:05,029
I, Sun Yunqian,

552
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:09,230
thought I could tell right from wrong,

553
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,792
and wanted to get away
from the despicable world

554
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:13,710
of the noble families,

555
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,509
but I just can't get away from it.

556
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:22,390
Talent is everywhere?

557
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,189
Disregard for worldly affairs?

558
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,509
They're just delusions.

559
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,350
I thought

560
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,469
I could protect my father

561
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,149
and keep him with my mother.

562
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,870
I thought I could keep
my younger sister safe

563
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,989
and my family happy.

564
00:37:48,629 --> 00:37:49,669
But in the end,

565
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,469
it's all for naught.

566
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,629
What a pity.

567
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,350
How ridiculous.

568
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,469
I, the unfilial son,

569
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,149
am here to apologize to you, Father.

570
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:35,549
I hope we won't meet again

571
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,230
in the next life.

572
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:28,589
No.

573
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:31,149
Yunqian.

574
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:35,310
I'll get the imperial physician now.

575
00:39:36,189 --> 00:39:36,989
You'll be fine.

576
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,669
No.

577
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,430
Don't leave me.

578
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:50,310
Don't leave me! Don't die!

579
00:39:56,509 --> 00:39:57,629
Yunqian!

580
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:08,790
Yunyun,

581
00:40:10,469 --> 00:40:11,350
I'm sorry for your loss.

582
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,549
Yunyun.

583
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:45,509
This letter was written
by your brother, wasn't it?

584
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:54,230
(I've been a slacker)

585
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,029
(all my life.)

586
00:40:56,189 --> 00:40:57,310
(And I've never been ambitious.)

587
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:58,950
(I've tried to get the best
out of everything,)

588
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,750
(but it's hard to achieve it.)

589
00:41:01,549 --> 00:41:02,950
(It's God's will that the Sun family)

590
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,989
(can't be brought to power.)

591
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:05,629
(Yunyun,)

592
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,509
(don't make the same mistake I did.)

593
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:09,069
(Don't hold grudges.)

594
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:11,950
You want me to not hold grudges?

595
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:14,589
How is that possible?

596
00:41:20,589 --> 00:41:24,029
I'll make Mu Zhuohua pay
for what she has done!

597
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:39,069
Sun Yunqian

598
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,509
committed suicide?

599
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,950
It's not your fault.

600
00:42:05,509 --> 00:42:06,950
Sun Yunqian wasn't wrong either.

601
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:11,189
But he died just like that.

602
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:16,109
It's Roujia

603
00:42:17,629 --> 00:42:18,790
who joined forces with the Zhou family

604
00:42:20,109 --> 00:42:21,549
and dealt a fatal blow
to the Sun family.

605
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:24,910
It's her again.

606
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:37,270
Don't worry.

607
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:40,270
I won't be driven by hatred.

608
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:42,750
And I won't repeat

609
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,910
the same mistake.
