(The is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,430
Seventh Sister...

21
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,109
Thank you.

22
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,230
You don't have to thank me.

23
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:09,590
You should be thankful

24
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:12,150
to yourself.

25
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,830
Despite the wrong path

26
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:18,830
or mistake you've had,

27
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:21,830
you managed to come this far.

28
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:24,069
You should thank yourself

29
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,229
for swallowing your pride

30
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,629
and making desperate efforts.

31
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,949
What's wrong?

32
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:02,669
I'm returning this to you.

33
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,430
This...

34
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,390
This is my mother's handkerchief.

35
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:43,789
Come in.

36
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,949
Zhuang Wenfeng
and Zhuang Zixian are dead.

37
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:53,669
They are dead?

38
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:57,949
They committed suicide.

39
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:01,069
They committed suicide. Seriously?

40
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:03,469
The Ministry of Justice
has already closed the case.

41
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:06,469
This is infuriating!

42
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:21,669
Tell me.

43
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,909
Did they really kill themselves?

44
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,349
Of course, they didn't.

45
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:32,349
But I'm afraid

46
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:34,869
we're done here.

47
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:36,270
Why?

48
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:39,469
It's just a simple corruption case.

49
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,789
Why can't we continue the investigation?

50
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,750
Are you sure it's simple?

51
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,669
You're saying this

52
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:50,950
because you've never thought

53
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,150
of the complexities hidden behind it.

54
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:03,030
Do you think it's unfair
about the Zhuangs' death?

55
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:05,229
Not at all.

56
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:06,950
Considering their sinful act,

57
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,869
they deserve more than
a public execution.

58
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,590
However,

59
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:12,070
their death

60
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,390
is likely to conceal another bigger sin.

61
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:35,109
My Lord.

62
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:00,630
A flower petal?

63
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,909
My Lord.

64
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,989
We've searched through

65
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:33,070
Zhuang Zixian's residence and abode.

66
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:35,309
Aside from excessive fortune

67
00:06:35,549 --> 00:06:36,830
that he didn't warrant,

68
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,030
none of the potential evidence

69
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,669
has been found yet.

70
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,510
Send someone to Jiangnan.

71
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,830
A trivial country magistrate
like Zhuang Wenfeng

72
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,309
was able to manipulate everything there.

73
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,309
There must be something traceable left.

74
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:55,190
Yes.

75
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,989
Ms. Mu, good morning.

76
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,750
Are you...

77
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,309
Are you Official Li, the vice minister?

78
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:42,909
Greetings, Official Li.

79
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:44,309
Morning.

80
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,390
Please go in.

81
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,190
(Ministry of Revenue)
(Ms. Mu, please come with me.)

82
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:51,150
Our fellows in the Ministry of Revenue

83
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,510
are friendly

84
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:55,429
as we have to associate
with other ministries.

85
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,950
Official Li, Ministry of Rites
do the same thing too?

86
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,750
(Official Li, Vice Minister of Revenue
of Southern Chen)

87
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,669
It's different.

88
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:00,349
(Official Li, Vice Minister of Revenue
of Southern Chen)

89
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,150
Ministry of Rites
deals with external matters.

90
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,469
They have to make sure
all protocols run correctly.

91
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:07,229
While the Ministry of Revenue
deals with internal matters,

92
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,830
we have to be good at people skills

93
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,229
and keep our manners in check.

94
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:11,390
That's the way

95
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,909
we can get everything done well.

96
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,150
Is there any ministry
with a bad temper?

97
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,190
Ministry of Personnel,

98
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,469
the head of the six ministries.

99
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,590
They strictly abide by rules.

100
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:21,510
Shen serves there.

101
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:23,549
The Ministry of Justice
has a bad temper too.

102
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,150
You see,

103
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,869
Ms. Mu,

104
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,349
the Ministry of Revenue
is the most easygoing one.

105
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,909
I'll work harder to serve the ministry.

106
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:33,870
Official Li.

107
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,829
Who's that?

108
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:40,350
That's Observer Fang.

109
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,750
He came in through connections.

110
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,030
His family desperately
sought help around

111
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,270
and has spent a great fortune
to pull strings.

112
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,630
Fortunately, he's diligent and serious.

113
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,110
He's way better

114
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,630
than other toffs.

115
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,750
You remind me of something.

116
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,589
You attended the same examination.

117
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,309
I suppose you've met him before.

118
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:04,390
The same examination?

119
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:07,110
That's great.

120
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,829
First Prince and Lord Ding

121
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:09,990
were siding with us.

122
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,390
I met him before.

123
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,390
Indeed,

124
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,429
he has changed a lot.

125
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,030
Official Li,

126
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,750
may I know where my desk is?

127
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,630
Ms. Mu, follow me.

128
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,189
Sure.

129
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,709
This way.

130
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:41,589
Official Mu.

131
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:44,589
Observer Fang.

132
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,189
Is there anything I can help you with?

133
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:48,909
Please don't say that.

134
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:50,549
I want to apologize to you.

135
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:52,589
Apologize?

136
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:54,069
Official Mu, you have genuine talents.

137
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,350
Since you've become an official,

138
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,429
you confronted the Northern Liang,

139
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:57,829
rescued the famine victims,

140
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:58,709
and investigated corrupt cases.

141
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,150
I'm

142
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:02,709
ashamed of myself.

143
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:04,549
You flatter me.

144
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:07,350
We never had a beef.

145
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:09,030
We have different stances,
and that's all.

146
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,350
You're generous, Official Mu.

147
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,789
I was arrogant
because of my wealthy family.

148
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:16,789
But when I saw

149
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,390
my father begging around

150
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,270
to get me employed,

151
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:21,589
I found myself useless.

152
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,069
No need to sell yourself short,
Observer Fang.

153
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:25,429
Official Li and Official Song

154
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:27,669
were praising you at noon.

155
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:28,949
We all thought

156
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:30,470
you would come for lunch.

157
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,510
It's my fault.

158
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,350
The ambitious cherishes short days,

159
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:38,030
while the sullen laments at long nights.

160
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,230
After all, I don't have

161
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,429
high expectations for myself.

162
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:44,470
You befriend Official Wen...

163
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:46,390
I befriended him

164
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,270
because of his personality.

165
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:51,350
Turns out he's a fickle social climber.

166
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:52,750
He started to keep his distance from me

167
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:53,750
when my family experienced a downfall.

168
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,669
Forget it.

169
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,750
Anyway, please look out for me, Ms. Mu.

170
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,110
Likewise.

171
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:10,429
I heard that Mu Zhuohua

172
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:12,990
was defending Liu Yan
before the Emperor

173
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,829
over his impeachment.

174
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,230
Yes.

175
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:21,589
She's now in favor with His Majesty.

176
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,870
I can predict that.

177
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:25,990
He has shielded off

178
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,470
those impeachments

179
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,789
on Liu Yan,

180
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,270
claiming that he issued
a secretive edict

181
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:36,750
to send Liu Yan to Chen's aid
in Jiangnan.

182
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,189
The Emperor

183
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:41,990
actually lied

184
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,150
for the sake of him.

185
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,709
What else do you know

186
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,030
about Liu Yan's movement in Jiangnan?

187
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,510
I don't, Your Majesty.

188
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,270
I used to think

189
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:56,789
it was a showmanship
between him and Mu Zhuohua.

190
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:58,870
Now it seems

191
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,390
they're truly in love with each other.

192
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,990
The Emperor halted me
to act against Yan.

193
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:10,429
And I won't do anything.

194
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:17,390
But I won't allow

195
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,150
things get too easy

196
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,390
for him.

197
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,589
(Invitation)

198
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:28,270
Juli.

199
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,030
Princess Roujia sent this over?

200
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:32,470
Yes.

201
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,549
Tongxin Festival is around the corner.

202
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,189
There'll be a banquet
held in the palace.

203
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:37,789
Miss Man said

204
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:39,350
Princess Roujia invited you over.

205
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,390
Tongxin Festival

206
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,589
is a folk custom in the capital.

207
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:46,429
Do they celebrate this grandly

208
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:48,350
in the palace too?

209
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,789
I've never heard of it.

210
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,270
But, Young Lady,
what's Tongxin Festival?

211
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:54,709
This is my first time hearing this.

212
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,069
"Hiding in a quiet place,

213
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,909
I tie a knot with my tresses and his."

214
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,270
It's a common tradition

215
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:03,549
between young men and ladies
in the capital.

216
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:05,990
At the end of the sixth month
and the beginning of the seventh month,

217
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,709
they exchange gifts.

218
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,630
And that's the Tongxin Festival.

219
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,350
Young Lady, will I get one from you?

220
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,709
My, Juli. The gift exchange

221
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,309
is between young men and ladies.

222
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,309
So, you're not giving me a gift.

223
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,589
You're only giving it to Lord Ding,
aren't you?

224
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,990
How so?

225
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,789
Because he saved you.

226
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,230
You should repay his kindness.

227
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:34,789
That makes sense.

228
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,189
I should prepare a gift for him.

229
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,589
Your Highness,
keep it in the same place?

230
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,870
You should blame me for misplacing it.

231
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,789
Get up.

232
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:56,230

Are you looking for a store
that sells flutes?

266
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,789
Yes, I didn't know

267
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:54,630
Lord Ding could play the flute.

268
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:57,630
Yeah, you didn't.

269
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,309
I brought you this message from Zhimo.

270
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:01,909
Well, I'll buy him the best flute.

271
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:02,829
Is that okay?

272
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,069
But can you afford that

273
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,470
with your meager salary?

274
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,030
Miss, have a look
at this patterned fabric.

275
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:10,670
It should be here.

But

282
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,470
do they sell expensive things here too?

283
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,069
I don't think

284
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:36,109
a flute can be costly.

180 guan.

288
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,149
This is the cheapest item we have here.

289
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:48,149
Sir, you might as well rob us.

290
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:48,910
Can't afford this?

291
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:51,389
You can buy a bamboo stick

292
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:52,470
and poke some holes.

293
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,510
It makes sound too.

294
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,030
Also, it's free.

295
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,069

296

Don't be ridiculous.

298

299

- I will have Duyou.
- I will have Duyou.

305
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:40,389

306

you can afford this at any price.

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,270

Young Lady.

321
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,789
It costs
several years' worth of your salary.

322
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,430
You can trade it with something else.

323
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,629
Don't even think about it.

324
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,230
Juli, he doesn't mean it that way.

325
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:43,109
Sir, I'll go with 1,000 guan.

326
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,470
Given your temperament,

327
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,629
you're not from a merchant family.

Sir,

329
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,510
you should close down the business

330
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:55,589
if you can't tell that.

331
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,190
Miss, you offered a high price,

332
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:01,190
and you're not from a merchant's family.

333
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,430
You must be from a prestigious origin.

334
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:06,629
But my apologies.

335
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,670
I won't sell it for even 10,000 guan.

336
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:11,149
But why?

337
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,670
Did I not make myself clear enough?

338
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,670
I won't sell it.

339
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:24,510
Have a nice day.

Miss.

341
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:32,869
I doubt if you can offer 100 guan.

342
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,510
Sir, didn't you say

343
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:38,309
we can trade it

344
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,789
with something else?

345
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:41,549
Yes, I did say that.

What do you want from me?

347
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,589
The most valuable thing you have.

348
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:50,149
The most valuable thing?

349
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,230
The most valuable thing you have

350
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,109
is none other than the jade pendant

351
00:20:57,109 --> 00:20:58,510
given by Lord Ding.

352
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,109
But it's broken.

353
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:06,309
Well, it was an emergency.

354
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:08,789
How about this, Young Lady?

355
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,990
We'll buy a knife for chopping bamboo.

356

357
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,589

358

what the most valuable item I have is.

359
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,549

Yes, it's me.

363
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:30,629
Besides, you just returned from
the disaster relief mission in Jiangnan.

364

Sir, you sure know a lot.

365

Not only me,

366
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,750
but the entire capital knows about that.

367

I come from Jiangnan.

368
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,910

Please don't say that.

372

Just sell Duyou to me.

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,549
Official Mu,

375
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,470
you can exchange this
with your calligraphy.

376
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,910
Sir.

377
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:11,990
What do you want me to write?

378
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,750
Anything except poetry.

379
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:15,190
I want poetry.

380
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,309
You want poetry?

381
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:22,990
Well, you made this request.

382
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,950
Official Mu.

383
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:43,910
Thank you so much.

384
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,270
Sir.

385
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:46,549
Please don't hang

386
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:48,190
my calligraphy.

387
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,789
We're leaving, then.

388
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:50,869
Thank you.

389
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:52,589
Thank you so much.

390
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,270
Let's go.

391
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:02,309
The poetry...

392
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:06,349
Nice writing.

393
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:12,510
Sir.

394
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,829
Please name any price you want.

395
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,309
I'm sorry,

396
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:19,789
but Duyou is sold.

397
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:24,149
(Duyou)
Sold?

398
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,829
To whom?

399
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:28,910
The other lady who wanted
to buy Duyou just now.

400
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,149
It's her?

401
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:34,149
How much did she offer?

402
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:43,670
"Duyou is an exquisite piece,

403
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:45,349
shan't be tainted by money.

404
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,190
Only wise people can discern its value,

405
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:48,710
not those foolish moneybags."

406
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:02,389
Juli.

407
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,869
Is everything ready?

408
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,389
Yes, there are many.

409
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,789
Let me see.

410
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,750
I know you look great in any clothes.

411
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,990
But I'm afraid other noble ladies
might outshine you

412
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:20,470
if you wear this.

413
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,549
Dowager Empress gathers

414
00:24:23,782 --> 00:24:24,943
so many noble ladies together
in the palace

415
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,670
during the Tongxin Festival.

416
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,230
That isn't for celebrating it.

417
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,910
Apparently, she wants to choose
a consort for First Prince.

418
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:32,869
Those noble ladies

419
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:34,670
are all vying for the only candidature.

420
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,389
I'm not joining them.

421
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,549
No, Young Lady.

422
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,270
You'd better not attend it.

423
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:42,869
The Dowager Empress is terrifying.

424
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:44,710
She could punish anyone she wants.

425
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,149
I mustn't turn down

426
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:49,270
the invitation from Princess.

427
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,470
Though the Dowager Empress
hosts this banquet,

428
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,190
she wouldn't punish me for no reason

429
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:56,750
if I behave myself properly

430
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,270
in front of the public.

431
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,190
Right?

432
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:02,470
True.

433
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:04,109
Prepare this more.

434
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:14,389
It's lively here.

435
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,789
The Tanhua is here too.

436
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,030
She's a new face.

437
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,950
Which clan is she from?

438
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:24,869
You mean her?
She's the latest Tanhua, Mu Zhuohua.

439
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,950
She's from

440
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,069
a rustic town.

441
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:29,589
Oh, it's her.

442
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:30,710
I know her.

443
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:33,589
I thought she was a female scholar
in her thirties,

444
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,030
but she's young.

445
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:38,950
First Prince seems to regard her highly.

446
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,270
She was once the princes' tutor.

447
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,670
However, for some reason,

448
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,149
she was removed from the position.

449
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:45,589
A few days ago,

450
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:47,069
she was promoted to director
in the Ministry of Revenue.

451
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:49,430
Does she come here

452
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:50,990
for that purpose too?

453
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:52,389
I don't think so.

454
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,910
I heard that she's dedicated
to her career.

455
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:56,710
According to the state law,

456
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,069
she has to stand down from the position

457
00:25:58,309 --> 00:25:59,510
once she gets married.

458
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:06,030
Here comes Dowager Empress.

459
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,549
(Her Majesty's gaze was fierce.)

460
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,750
(Is she going to punish me again?)

461
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,270
Greetings to Dowager Empress, Lord Ding,

462
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,789
First Prince, Second Prince,

463
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:16,990
Third Prince, and Princess Roujia.

464
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,069
I hold the Tongxin Festival here

465
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,990
as a cheerful celebration.

466
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:26,549
So, don't stand on ceremony.

467
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:28,670
Get up.

468
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:30,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

469
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:45,950
Uncle.

470
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:48,190
What's wrong with Mu Zhuohua?

471
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,910
She ignores me.

472
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:51,629
If she had responded to you just now,

473
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,789
she might become

474
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:57,270
the common enemy of all noble ladies
tomorrow.

475
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,910
Chen.

476
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:20,750
Grandmother organized this banquet

477
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:22,789
to select a consort for you.

478
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:25,430
Please don't disappoint her.

479
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:27,069
Chen.

480
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,109
All of the noble ladies who are at
their marriageable age are here.

481
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:31,829
Do pick carefully.

482
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,750
Chen has matured a lot

483
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:40,069
after the Jiangnan trip.

484
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,910
Where's Yunyun?

485
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:02,589
I don't see Yunyun here.

486
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:03,869
Yunyun?

487
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,869
Is she the eldest daughter
of the Sun clan?

488
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,710
When did she return from Jiangzhou?

489
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:10,829
No idea.

490
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:17,510
Please pardon my late arrival,
Your Majesty.

491
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,030
Greetings to Dowager Empress, Lord Ding,

492
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,829
First Prince, Second Prince,

493
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,750
Third Prince, and Princess Roujia.

494
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,030
Yunyun, go ahead and take your seat.

495
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:43,869
Yes.

496
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:58,389
(Isn't she the silly moneybag
I saw in Qingyin Music Shop?)

497
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,789
(So, she's Sun's sister.)

498
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,389
(The most prominent noble lady,)

499
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,109
(Sun Yunyun.)

500
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,270
Since everyone's here,

501
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:09,869
don't be reserved.

502
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:11,430
Let's celebrate this festival

503
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:14,430
the way it should be celebrated.

504
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,309
I'm going over there.

505
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:18,470
I'm leaving.

506
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:19,389
I'm quite nervous.

507
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,230
Do my clothes look good?

508
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,750
My Lord.

509
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,190
Who are you?

510
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,389
My Lord.

511
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,789
Don't you remember me?

512
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,149
I'm Sun Yunyun.

513
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:57,750
You forgot me?

514
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:00,829
Back then...

515
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,190
Miss Sun.

516
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:04,589
I don't have time

517
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,389
to revisit the past with you.

518
00:31:07,069 --> 00:31:08,629
Please leave, Miss Sun.

519
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,190
My Lord.

520
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:13,470
I've prepared

521
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,069
a special gift for you.

522
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,789
This flute is called Lingxi.

523
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,470
Please have a look, My Lord.

524
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,230
It's Lingxi.

525
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:24,750
This flute is worth a big fortune.

526
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,069
As expected of the trueborn daughter
of the Sun clan in Jiangzhuo.

527
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,349
She's even gifting His Lordship
an exceptional musical instrument.

528
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,589
Ah! I'm envious of her.

529
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,109
Thank you for your kindness.

530
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,309
But I don't accept gifts.

531
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:48,869
It's a festival gift for you.

532
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:50,670
Thank you, Miss Mu.

533
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,670
Here you go, a festival gift.

534
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,470
I made this lotus pastry myself.

535
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,309
Take this.

536
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,349
Hello.

537
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,789
It's a festival gift for you.

538
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:06,670
Thank you, Miss Mu.

539
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,789
Thank you, Miss Mu.

540
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,549
Mu Zhuohua.

541
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:13,270
Your Highness.

542
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:17,750
Finally, those noble ladies let you go?

543
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,190
Stop mocking me.

544
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:21,976
It wasn't easy for me to slip off.

545
00:32:22,463 --> 00:32:24,342
They gave me
lots of handkerchiefs and pouches

546
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:26,549
with mandarin ducks
or lotus pairs on them.

547
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,149
I thought noble ladies should be demure.

548
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,829
But they were not at all.

549
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:34,589
What's with that look?

550
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:36,910
I slipped off to look for you.

551
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:37,910
Me?

552
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,149
What's the matter, Your Highness?

553
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:48,869
Take this.

554
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,030
What's this?

555
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:53,109
Your gift

556
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,510
for the Tongxin Festival.

557
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,389
Thank you, Your Highness.
I didn't expect that.

558
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,789
Your gift is very useful.

559
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:11,149
Certainly.

560
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:12,990
I always have good taste.

561
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,710
That's a lot.

562
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,510
Thank you, Your Highness.

563
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,549
Where's my gift?

564
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,030
I...

565
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,069
Don't tell me you didn't prepare one.

566
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,230
I did.

567
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:32,309
Of course, I did.

568
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:34,430
A moment.

569
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,670
Lotus pastry?

570
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:50,829
You made this yourself?

571
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,589
Yes. Have a taste.

572
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,190
How is it?

573
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,910
This tastes so good.

574
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:05,190
Uncle.

575
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:08,749
My Lord.

576
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,629
Look.

577
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,470
Mu Zhuohua gave me this.

578
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:20,709
Hey, I want more.

579
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:22,069
Your Highness.

580
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:24,069
Gifts aren't meant to be many, though.

581
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:25,030
One is enough.

582
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,950
Your little pouch

583
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,669
is just half the size of mine.

584
00:34:29,189 --> 00:34:29,990
How about this?

585
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,470
Give me back some silver.

586
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:36,350
Never mind.

587
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:37,790
Just take it.

588
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,149
Uncle.

589
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,950
Why are you taking her side?

590
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:44,629
Your Highness,
you can't take back the gift

591
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,350
once it's given.

592
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,870
Run now.

593
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:55,950
I'm not insisting. Why are you running?

594
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:56,870
What's wrong with her?

595
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,189
Yes, it's him.

596
00:35:02,189 --> 00:35:07,069
First Prince.

597
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,910
My Lord, here's your gift.

598
00:35:15,629 --> 00:35:16,669
Is it the same dessert?

599
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,669
Of course not.

600
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,069
This is a unique gift.

601
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,069
I won this with my talent.

602
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:24,870
Talent?

603
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:28,830
The store owner approves of my talent.

604
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,990
So, he traded this

605
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,350
with my poem without taking any money.

606
00:35:34,189 --> 00:35:35,470
This store owner

607
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,950
has quite a unique taste.

608
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,629
Open it.

609
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,990
My Lord.

610
00:35:50,229 --> 00:35:51,069
Do you like it?

611
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,269
Yes, I do.

612
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,390
I'm glad that you like it.

613
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,709
What's wrong?

614
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,310
My Lord,

615
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,790
today is the Tongxin Festival.

616
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:22,629
I know.

617
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,310
First Prince

618
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,870
gave me a gift just now.

619
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,549
I saw it.

620
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,589
Then...

621
00:36:36,189 --> 00:36:37,109
My Lord.

622
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,589
Well...

623
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,549
Don't you have anything for me?

624
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,790
Well...

625
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,589
I never celebrate festivals.

626
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,269
It's my mistake.

627
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,470
I didn't prepare a gift for you.

628
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:07,069
It's all right.

629
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:12,229
I know you don't celebrate festivals.

630
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,910
I'll take my leave.

631
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,430
Lord Ding.

632
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,669
I made this embroidered pouch for you.

633
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,390
I hope you'll like it.

634
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,109
I don't accept gifts.

635
00:37:42,669 --> 00:37:43,910
Have you given out your gift?

636
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,549
Yes.

637
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,350
I received two gifts.

638
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,229
From whom?

639
00:37:59,629 --> 00:38:01,390
The lotus pastry made by Mu Zhuohua
tastes really good.

640
00:38:03,189 --> 00:38:04,390
It's better than those
from the Imperial Kitchen.

641
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,390
You have that too?

642
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,470
Why do you look so surprised?

643
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:15,589
Ms. Mu is very generous.

644
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:06,990
The dancing is graceful.

645
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:09,350
It's pleasing to the eye.

646
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:10,310
Indeed.

647
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,510
Especially the noble lady
who led the dance.

648
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:15,269
She's beautiful.

649
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:18,950
Just average.

650
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,430
Chen.

651
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,149
All noble ladies here
are well known for their talents.

652
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:35,669
You're picky, aren't you?

653
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:36,990
Chen.

654
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,189
You can't make random comments

655
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,229
if you know nothing about music.

656
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,229
If you want to hear something nice,

657
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:51,470
Yunyun has picked up her guqin skills

658
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,549
from the great master.

659
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,069
Her guqin playing was once
the talk of the capital.

660
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,470
I wonder

661
00:39:59,749 --> 00:40:02,030
if I have the pleasure

662
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,910
to hear you play, Yunyun.

663
00:40:12,669 --> 00:40:13,709
You flatter me,

664
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,030
Your Majesty.

665
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:17,903
It's my honor to perform for you.

666
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,229
Don't be humble, Yunyun.

667
00:40:21,749 --> 00:40:23,229
As the old saying goes,

668
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,709
"Good things come in pairs."

669
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,549
Guqin always goes well with the flute.

670
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,390
Lord Ding is renowned

671
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,749
for his flute playing.

672
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:36,269
Why don't you

673
00:40:36,549 --> 00:40:38,709
have a duet with Yunyun?

674
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,510
It must be marvelous.
