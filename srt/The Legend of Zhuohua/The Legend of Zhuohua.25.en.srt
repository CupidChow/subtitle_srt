No, thanks. Shen.

29
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,145
I have plans.

30
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:07,626

Princess Roujia.

38
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:13,425
You shouldn't get jealous of him.

39

109
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,786
how painful it is deep inside me.

110
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:58,346
But will it work
just by forcing him to love you?

I've been waiting for you.

118
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:35,586
Have you found any clues

119
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:37,106
about the Snow Dust Pill?

120
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:39,786
That's right.

121
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:42,185
I spent the entire day
in the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

122
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,505
I found it.

123
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,825
There's one more Snow Dust Pill left.

124
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:49,346
Where's it?

125
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:50,625
It's with Princess Roujia.

126
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,666
When His Majesty was the Crown Prince,

127
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,546
he felt sorry for Princess Roujia
as she lost her mother

128
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:58,825
and was afraid staying in the capital
would remind her of the loss.

129
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:00,786
So Princess Roujia was sent

130
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:03,146
to be raised by Border Defender Princess,
the First Princess.

131
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:04,586
Afterwards,

132
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:06,032
before Princess Roujia got married,

133
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:08,106
the First Princess

134
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:12,065
gave Princess Roujia
the only Snow Dust Pill she had

135
00:08:13,146 --> 00:08:15,065
as the dowry.

136
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:16,865
All right.

137
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:18,146
I'll go to see Princess Roujia now.

138
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,106
What brings you here?

139
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:30,185
Shen, how fortuitous.

140
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:30,906
Yes.

141
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,785
But we have to start to purchase

142
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:34,986
and hoard winter garments.

143
00:08:34,986 --> 00:08:35,426
Let's go in.

144
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:37,466
We need to get this done
before the temperature drops.

145
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:38,986
Understood.

146
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:41,505
Please leave this to me, Your Highness.

147
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:42,986
You should go back and rest.

00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:44,106
I'm fine.

00:08:45,346 --> 00:08:46,385
The cold hurt your lungs.

150
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:47,745
The treatment is merely

151
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:50,505
an expedient method.

152
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,106
You should follow the medical advice

153
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:54,505

154
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:57,785

155
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:00,226
a trouble now.

156
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:02,025
I'd like to seek your help.

157
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:04,066
What's it?

158
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,905
I'll do anything for you in my power.

159
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:09,066
Feel free to tell me

160
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:09,946
if I can be of help.

161
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:11,826
Thank you, Your Highness.

162
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:13,066
Thank you, Shen.

163
00:09:14,706 --> 00:09:15,545
Your Highness.

164
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:16,905
I'd like to ask

165
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:19,505
for the Snow Dust Pill from you

166
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:20,706

167
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,106
Snow Dust Pill?

168
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,905
It's been years.

169
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:30,986
I've already forgotten it

170
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:32,545
when you mention this.

171
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:34,785
But

172
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:36,426
what has happened to your friend?

173
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:38,346
Severely injured?

174
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,665
Well, my friend...

175
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:43,545
It's not my friend, actually.

176
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:45,905
This person is badly injured.

177
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:48,106
Only Snow Dust Pill can save his life.

178
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:50,665
Besides,

179
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,306
if he awakes,

180
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:55,785
it might be

181
00:09:56,706 --> 00:09:58,186
a pleasant surprise.

182
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:06,586
If a life can be saved,

183
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:08,745
the Snow Dust Pill

184
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:10,226
isn't a big deal.

185
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:12,385
Thank you, Your Highness.

186
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:43,426
My Lord.

187
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:45,986
The Snow Dust Pill from Princess Roujia

188
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:47,346
is truly effective.

189
00:10:50,145 --> 00:10:52,306
As soon as General Xue took it,

190
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:53,545
it started to take effect.

191
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,586
Do you like it here?

192
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:00,346
Of course I do.

193
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:05,986
From now on,

194
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:10,025
this mansion is yours.

195
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:14,946
This is the key.

196
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:20,226
Afterward,

197
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:23,505
you can manage this mansion
however you wish.

198
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:27,265
Are the people in this mansion

199
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:32,145
under my charge too?

200
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:41,545
Whatever you like.

201
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,838
(Fu's Acupuncture Guide)

202
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:28,665
My Lord.

203
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:31,265
This belongs to my maternal grandfather.

204
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:33,706
I didn't expect

205
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,066
to have books left

206
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:37,745
after my maternal grandfather's residence
was confiscated.

207
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,066
Good for you.

208
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,426
Back then,

209
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:45,426
he was promoted to Director
of the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

210
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:47,025
He was the most skilled physician.

211
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:50,586
Words have it that your grandfather
had plenty of unique healing skills.

212
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,346
Maybe you can find them in the book.

213
00:12:58,385 --> 00:12:59,665
Apricot blossoms...

214
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:12,186
I'm returning this to you.

215
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:19,106
This is my mother's handkerchief.

216
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:33,865
My mother

217
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:38,466
might have drawn this on it
when she was little.

218
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:42,385
My grandfather held her so dearly

219
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,785
that he allowed her
to scribble on his books.

220
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:53,106
No.

221
00:13:55,706 --> 00:13:56,826
That handkerchief.

222
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,986
What's wrong with this handkerchief?

223
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:09,505
Not the handkerchief.

224
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,346
It's the apricot blossoms on it.

225
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:25,785
Qi.

226
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,545
Come here.

227
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:27,946
What are you doing?

228
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:29,025
It's dangerous.

229
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:30,186
Mother,

230
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,186
I dropped
your most cherished handkerchief

231
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:33,706
into the water.

232
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:34,905
Silly dear.

233
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:36,826
It's not as important as you.

234
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:38,385
Mother,

235
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:40,145
isn't this handkerchief

236
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,865
the precious gift
given to you by Grandfather?

237
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:44,586
Qi, you're the most precious gift

238
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:46,466
to me.

239
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:49,785
Give it to me.

240
00:14:58,785 --> 00:14:59,466
Mother.

241
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:02,745
The drawing on this handkerchief
didn't fade

242
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:04,625
after soaking in the water for long.

243
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:05,665
Because

244
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:07,545
it was painted with a solution.

245
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:09,025
It won't wear off.

246
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:11,145
That's great.

247
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:13,385
Mother, can you make this solution?

248
00:15:13,385 --> 00:15:14,265
I want it.

249
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,706
I could.

250
00:15:17,665 --> 00:15:20,306
But I no longer remember how to do it.

251
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:25,025
It's nice, right?

252
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:29,946
My Lord, you said

253
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:32,625
my grandfather's residence was seized

254
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,986
because someone exploited
the death of Consort Yun

255
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:36,986
to hide the evidence.

256
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:43,785
The apricot blossoms
on this handkerchief aren't finely drawn.

257
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:46,186
It must be done in haste.

258
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:47,625
Besides,

259
00:15:48,306 --> 00:15:50,625
it was drawn with an insoluble solution

260
00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:52,785
for preserving purposes.

261
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:57,025
My mother didn't remember much

262
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,946
about her past,

263
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:02,826
but she had a deep impression
of the apricot blossoms.

264
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:05,385
Are you suggesting

265
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,306
that your grandfather
drew these apricot blossoms

266
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,466
on this handkerchief in a rush

267
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:10,306
to leave a hint

268
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:13,265
before the residence was seized?

269
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:17,226
And he asked your mother
to keep it properly.

270
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:18,826
That's right.

271
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:22,466
My mother cherished this handkerchief

272
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,426
and had a deep impression
of the apricot blossom tree.

273
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:28,346
I think

274
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:31,306
my grandfather must have

275
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,905
emphasized something to her.

276
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:51,826
My Lord.

277
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:06,946
It's the goatskin wrap
used to wrap acupuncture needles.

278
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:09,305
It must have been left by my grandfather.

279
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:13,585
Look at this, My Lord.

280
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,426
(I, Fu, formulated the Revival Powder)

281
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,585
(to treat patients.)

282
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:25,706
(However, the effects of this medicine
are overly intense)

283
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:27,025
(and not as intended.)

284
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:29,986
(I wanted to destroy the formula,)

285
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:32,345
(but Empress Zhou halted me.)

286
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:35,426
(Later, Consort Yun suffered
from bleeding during labor.)

287
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:37,866
(I was tasked to save Her Highness.)

288
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:41,226
(I discovered her condition
was caused by the Revival Powder.)

289
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,585
(Knowing a serious accusation
would befall me,)

290
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:46,105
(I am leaving this message,)

291
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:48,265
(hoping that the truth)

292
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:50,505
(would come to light one day.)

293
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:57,785
I used to think

294
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:01,626
she wanted to take my life

295
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:04,426
out of fear
that my overwhelmed reputation

296
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:06,466
would threaten His Majesty's throne.

297
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:09,706
Now, it seems

298
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:12,505
she has never regarded me

299
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:17,193
as her son.

300
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:19,626
It has been

301
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:25,105
just her showmanship all the while.

302
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:31,466
My Lord.

303
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:38,226
My mother,

304
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:42,666
the 30,000 soldiers of the Cangwu Army,

305
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:44,626
Yun Xiangyue,

306
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,105
you,

307
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:49,906
the people,

308
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:52,065
and the entire nation of Southern Chen.

309
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:54,265
She pegs all of you a plaything

310
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:56,545
she can kill as she wishes.

311
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:00,745
If it weren't for this letter...

312
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:02,345
Fine.

313
00:19:03,505 --> 00:19:07,226
I have completely lost trust in her.

314
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:09,585
My trust is dead.

315
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:11,946
My Lord.

316
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:18,866
Evil will never get its way.

317
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:22,265
All mistakes committed

318
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:24,305
and false accusations

319
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:27,505
will return to us

320
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:29,305
in various forms eventually.

321
00:19:30,706 --> 00:19:32,305
Your investigation
of the war at the Juma River

322
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:35,065
will come to a desirable end.

323
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,545
Xue Xiaotang.

324
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:12,666
General Xue.

325
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:16,825
Looks like you recognize me.

326
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:24,025
What happened

327
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:26,426
at the Juma River

328
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:29,105
five years ago?

329
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:35,545
General Xue.

330
00:20:37,906 --> 00:20:39,706
Stop evading.

331
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:44,186
Yes, you can turn a blind eye.

332
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:46,265
But what about later?

333
00:20:46,265 --> 00:20:48,265
Do you want
to spend all your life in hiding

334
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:51,146
and looking over your shoulder?

335
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:52,386
Do you never wish

336
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:54,946
to see Princess Roujia again?

337
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:02,025
Jiao.

338
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:06,065
You can't take your eyes off the view.

339
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:07,545
Greetings, Father.

340
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:10,866
Just two of us,

341
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:11,825
no need to stand on ceremony.

342
00:21:14,226 --> 00:21:16,226
Father, it's windy here.

343
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:18,146
Let's go inside.

344
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:20,146
I rarely have a chance

345
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,626
to get fresh air outside.

346
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:23,105
Don't force me to go inside.

347
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:26,105
I'll stay with you here
for a while, then.

348
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:28,545
Girl.

349
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:30,265
You don't have to come
to the temporary imperial residence

350
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:32,505
for my sake.

351
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:35,825
Father, you always skip your medicine.

352
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:42,345
Are you under the weather?

353
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:43,866
No, I'm not.

354
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:45,226
You're holding a snuff bottle.

355
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,105
It was used

356
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:50,706
to store the Snow Dust Pill before.

357
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:51,946
Snow Dust Pill?

358
00:21:53,785 --> 00:21:56,305
Your uncle has taken that
to save his life before.

359
00:21:57,626 --> 00:21:59,305
I remember it's the last pill.

360
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:00,585
Who will you give it to?

361
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:06,626
I have no idea either.

362
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,265
It's a friend of Ms. Mu.

363
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:10,345
Mu Zhuohua?

364
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:13,585
You sure are generous.

365
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:17,426
I regard her as my dear friend.

366
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:19,706
She asked me for this pill.

367
00:22:20,345 --> 00:22:22,585
Naturally, I should help her.

368
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:25,706
You're a kind child.

369
00:22:26,906 --> 00:22:28,666
Just like your mother.

370
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:32,305
Father.

371
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:36,466
You did a good thing.

372
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:37,986
Despite its preciousness,

373
00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:39,545
the medicine is considered worthless

374
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:40,825
if it doesn't save lives.

375
00:22:42,025 --> 00:22:42,745
Exactly.

376
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:45,505
I wish Heaven could show its mercy

377
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,065
and save the person.

378
00:22:50,545 --> 00:22:52,505
My kindness won't be let down.

379
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:54,825
General Xue.

380
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:59,426
Do you know who gave you
this Snow Dust Pill

381
00:22:59,585 --> 00:23:00,585
that saved your life?

382
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:03,745
Who?

383
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:06,785
Princess Roujia.

384
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:09,585
She asked me

385
00:23:10,386 --> 00:23:11,585
to save your life no matter what,

386
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:14,186
even though

387
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:17,025
she didn't know it was you.

388
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:18,706
Besides, she said

389
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:21,265
that her fiance

390
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:23,466
would be glad to see this.

391
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:28,186
General Xue, do you know?

392
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:31,706
Princess Roujia fell very ill

393
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:33,386
when she thought you had died.

394
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:37,025
If you were to continue
to hide yourself,

395
00:23:37,545 --> 00:23:39,666
she would be living in pain
for the rest of her life.

396
00:23:49,265 --> 00:23:50,585
Do you really not want

397
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,825
to walk to her without hiding?

398
00:23:58,505 --> 00:23:59,466
I'll tell you everything.

399
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:10,386
Five years ago,

400
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:15,986
before the army set off,

401
00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:21,666
the Dowager Empress suddenly
summoned me for a secret meeting.

402
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:30,626
You're soon becoming my grandson-in-law.

403
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:32,785
Before you leave,

404
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,745
I have something to tell you.

405
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:39,186
Yes, please.

406
00:24:40,426 --> 00:24:42,666
Lord Ding isn't my own son.

407
00:24:43,946 --> 00:24:45,666
He exploited his achievement

408
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:49,946
to take the Cangwu Army as his own.

409
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:54,745
He even breaks faith with the Emperor.

410
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:57,545
How could Lord Ding do that?

411
00:24:58,146 --> 00:24:59,105
I believe

412
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:01,946
it must be a misunderstanding.

413
00:25:03,065 --> 00:25:04,265
Whether or not it's a misunderstanding,

414
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,466
I have my own judgment.

415
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:09,986
What you need to do

416
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:16,666
is uproot traitors
from the imperial court.

417
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:20,745
Keep him on the battlefield for good.

418
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:26,946
By that time, you'll return decorated

419
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:30,706
and marry Roujia.

420
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:58,305
As your command, Your Majesty.

421
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:11,025
With this token,

422
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:15,706
the Zhou family will be
at your beck and call.

423
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:26,025
After that,

424
00:26:28,265 --> 00:26:29,785
I went to Yuan Chengming.

425
00:26:35,626 --> 00:26:37,666
I asked him
for your military route plan.

426
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:41,745
Deputy General Yuan was loyal.

427
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:45,666
Did you threaten him?

428
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:52,745
I threatened him

429
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,906
with his wife and daughter's lives.

430
00:26:56,946 --> 00:26:58,146
Hence, he agreed.

431
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:03,906
I thought

432
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:06,345
I could return to the capital

433
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:09,025
to marry Princess Roujia

434
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:13,706
and spend the rest of my life with her.

435
00:27:15,146 --> 00:27:16,505
But it backfired.

436
00:27:22,785 --> 00:27:25,025
I almost died.

437
00:27:29,226 --> 00:27:30,585
Under the order of Dowager Empress,

438
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:34,545
I led the Zhou family
to hunt Yuan Chengming down.

439
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:36,986
To avoid our trace from being revealed,

440
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:40,146
I brought along

441
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,626
the special weapon of Northern Liang,
the hawk claw hook.

442
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:45,105
Just as we could kill him,

443
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:46,986
out of expectation,

444
00:27:49,146 --> 00:27:50,866
Imperial Shadow Guards turned up.

445
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,105
You were attacked by Wandering Needle.

446
00:27:58,706 --> 00:27:59,986
To save yourself,

447
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:02,426
you cut your arm off.

448
00:28:03,226 --> 00:28:03,946
Yes.

449
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:06,706
Because of the Wandering Needle,

450
00:28:07,226 --> 00:28:09,065
all the men I brought

451
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,065
died from its toxicity.

452
00:28:13,745 --> 00:28:15,345
Those Imperial Shadow Guards...

453
00:28:16,305 --> 00:28:17,265
His Majesty sent them over.

454
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:25,105
If it were Dowager Empress,

455
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:29,505
the Zhou's men wouldn't be killed.

456
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:37,825
They hold each other dearly.

457
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:40,146
As the son,

458
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:43,986
he would clean up after his mother.

459
00:28:47,146 --> 00:28:48,906
Not only does he want
to protect Dowager Empress,

460
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:51,785
but he also wants to protect me.

461
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:54,386
My brother

462
00:28:55,745 --> 00:28:57,666
wishes I could let this go

463
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:01,585
to avoid confrontations between me
and Dowager Empress

464
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:02,785
that'll never end.

465
00:29:19,505 --> 00:29:21,105
My Lord, someone from the palace is here.

466
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:23,946
What perfect timing.

467
00:29:52,545 --> 00:29:54,866
The food is ready, Your Lordship.

468
00:29:54,946 --> 00:29:56,986
Her Majesty sends me to show you in.

469
00:30:02,226 --> 00:30:03,666
Come inside with me

470
00:30:03,706 --> 00:30:04,785
and wait at the side chamber.

471
00:30:05,745 --> 00:30:06,226
Yes.

472
00:30:11,014 --> 00:30:14,236
(Ciming Hall)

473
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:33,866
Greetings, Your Majesty.

474
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:35,785
You're here, Yan.

475
00:30:37,345 --> 00:30:38,105
Take a seat.

476
00:30:39,025 --> 00:30:39,986
Thank you.

477
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,186
Your complexion doesn't look good.

478
00:30:49,626 --> 00:30:52,025
Are you feeling unwell lately?

479
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:57,745
You should eat more.

480
00:30:58,386 --> 00:30:59,666
These are your favorite dishes.

481
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,065
Thank you.

482
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:09,105
The last time

483
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:11,986
we had a meal alone

484
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:14,946
was a dozen years ago, I suppose.

485
00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:18,265
How time flies.

486
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:20,745
I can still remember

487
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:24,986
when you were first brought
to my palace.

488
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:28,745
You were so little

489
00:31:29,226 --> 00:31:30,626
in the swaddling clothes.

490
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:33,626
You were this big.

491
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:37,226
Even though you looked tiny,

492
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:40,146
you cried really loudly.

493
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:43,426
Three wet nurses were looking after you,

494
00:31:44,426 --> 00:31:46,666
but you kept bawling
and refused to sleep.

495
00:31:47,146 --> 00:31:48,545
I had no choice

496
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:52,065
but to carry you at night.

497
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:55,426
And you stopped crying.

498
00:31:57,906 --> 00:31:58,946
I was told

499
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:01,825
that I couldn't sleep well at night
when I was little.

500
00:32:02,946 --> 00:32:06,585
It was you who stayed up all night
to soothe me.

501
00:32:08,265 --> 00:32:09,706
Hence,

502
00:32:10,906 --> 00:32:12,386
you were worn and gaunt

503
00:32:13,505 --> 00:32:15,025
back then.

504
00:32:17,706 --> 00:32:19,986
Your mother passed away
when you were born.

505
00:32:21,025 --> 00:32:23,265
I felt sorry for you.

506
00:32:29,165 --> 00:32:30,785
I'll never forget your kindness

507
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:33,226
for raising me.

508
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:34,105
My goodness.

509
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:38,906
My child.

510
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:40,466
Why do you bow

511
00:32:40,706 --> 00:32:42,626
all of a sudden?

512
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:49,025
Being parents is never easy,

513
00:32:49,305 --> 00:32:50,105
let alone

514
00:32:50,706 --> 00:32:52,426
the fact that I'm not
your biological son.

515
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:55,105
I'll keep your kindness

516
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:58,505
in my heart.

517
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:01,305
Glad to know that.

518
00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:04,146
I know you're a filial child.

519
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:14,505
My condition never shows improvement

520
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:15,986
after taking the medicine for years.

521
00:33:18,186 --> 00:33:20,025
Father, please take some candied fruit.

522
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:29,785
Your candied fruit

523
00:33:30,126 --> 00:33:31,686
always has a better taste.

524
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:45,626
Jiao.

525
00:33:46,386 --> 00:33:47,386
Is there anything on your mind?

526
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:51,186
I was thinking of Grandmother.

527
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:53,745
Will she feel lonely

528
00:33:54,025 --> 00:33:55,265
in the palace?

529
00:33:58,305 --> 00:33:59,785
Mother said she was old

530
00:34:00,226 --> 00:34:01,065
and couldn't bear the bumpy journey.

531
00:34:01,345 --> 00:34:02,466
I couldn't persuade her to come.

532
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:05,025
Don't worry, Father.

533
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:06,866
Uncle stays in the capital, too.

534
00:34:07,305 --> 00:34:08,986
He can take care of Grandmother.

535
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:10,505
You're right.

536
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:21,025
Father?

537
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:22,585
Nothing.

538
00:34:23,826 --> 00:34:24,946
I'm just

539
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:28,906
worried about your uncle's health.

540
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:32,466
Why do you eat so little?

541
00:34:33,545 --> 00:34:36,746
The cooking skills of the kitchen here
seem to have regressed.

542
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:40,145
I've been taking medicine

543
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,545
these days.

544
00:34:42,426 --> 00:34:43,906
So, I don't have much appetite.

545
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:46,225
Oh, dear.

546
00:34:47,145 --> 00:34:49,786
You need someone to take care of you.

547
00:34:50,665 --> 00:34:52,266
I can only rest assured

548
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:53,786
after you settle down in your fief.

549
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:54,986
Your Majesty,

550
00:34:56,145 --> 00:34:57,786
you want me to go to the fief?

551
00:34:58,426 --> 00:35:00,986
You're interested in Mu Zhuohua,
aren't you?

552
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:04,185
She's from Jiangnan,

553
00:35:05,545 --> 00:35:07,145
which is in your fief.

554
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:11,225
After you get married
and settle down in Jiangnan,

555
00:35:12,145 --> 00:35:13,946
you can enjoy your time as you wish.

556
00:35:17,746 --> 00:35:18,466
Yan.

557
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:21,505
Do I treat you well?

558
00:35:23,346 --> 00:35:24,866
Your Majesty, you treat me

559
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:26,665
like your own son.

560
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:29,545
How does the Emperor treat you?

561
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:34,185
His Majesty sees me
as his biological brother.

562
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:39,145
I know you're always a grateful child.

563
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,986
You're leaving tomorrow.

564
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:46,065
So today,

565
00:35:47,906 --> 00:35:49,826
I'll give you a send-off.

566
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:25,386
Men.

567
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:31,705
Yes, Your Majesty.

568
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:33,105
Get ready with the carriage.

569
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:34,786
I'm returning to the palace.

570
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:36,585
Your Majesty.

571
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:37,386
Now!

572
00:36:38,145 --> 00:36:39,065
Yes, Your Majesty.

573
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:44,826
Father.

574
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:48,986
I'm worried about your health.

575
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:51,025
Please allow me to go with you.

576
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,266
All right.

577
00:36:56,065 --> 00:36:57,065
You may come with me.

578
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:25,786
Yan, do you not accept my offer?

579
00:37:26,225 --> 00:37:27,065
I daren't.

580
00:37:29,225 --> 00:37:30,145
It's just

581
00:37:32,185 --> 00:37:34,306
that I smell something strange

582
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:35,665
in this liquor.

583
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:37,585
Is that so?

584
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,346
How come I didn't notice that?

585
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:50,866
Maybe

586
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:52,906
I made a mistake.

587
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:56,426
However,

588
00:37:57,665 --> 00:37:59,946
have you heard

589
00:38:00,826 --> 00:38:02,665
of a secret medicine,
the Revival Powder?

590
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:06,346
It cures all sickness

591
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:08,346
and brings the dead back to life.

592
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:12,346
I have never heard

593
00:38:13,225 --> 00:38:15,826
of such a panacea.

594
00:38:17,705 --> 00:38:19,346
No?

595
00:38:20,786 --> 00:38:21,746
It can't be.

596
00:38:22,906 --> 00:38:25,426
The medicine is
from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

597
00:38:38,218 --> 00:38:40,847
(Revival Powder)

598
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:45,946
Perhaps

599
00:38:46,946 --> 00:38:48,346
you've come across it.

600
00:38:55,695 --> 00:38:58,218
(Ciming Hall)

601
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:21,746
It seems you're telling the truth.

602
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:25,826
But how did my birth mother,

603
00:39:27,025 --> 00:39:27,826
Consort Yun,

604
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:30,145
die?

605
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:33,986
Yan, what a strange question that is.

606
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,545
Consort Yun died in childbirth

607
00:39:36,545 --> 00:39:38,906
when she was giving birth to you.

608
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:44,266
But it's different
from what Fu Shengru wrote

609
00:39:44,505 --> 00:39:45,705
in his final letter.

610
00:39:46,346 --> 00:39:47,906
Final letter?

611
00:39:49,065 --> 00:39:51,545
Can it be verified?

612
00:39:53,145 --> 00:39:54,946
What about the defeat

613
00:39:55,705 --> 00:39:56,866
of the war at the Juma River?

614
00:39:58,665 --> 00:40:00,505
Yan, what's wrong with you?

615
00:40:01,386 --> 00:40:03,065
You fought the war back then,

616
00:40:03,105 --> 00:40:04,426
not me.

617
00:40:05,665 --> 00:40:07,185
Your men

618
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,946
colluded with the enemy
and betrayed Southern Chen.

619
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:14,225
Yet, the Emperor and I
didn't hold you accountable

620
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:16,306
for mismanaging your subordinates.

621
00:40:16,306 --> 00:40:17,746
We are generous to you.

622
00:40:19,065 --> 00:40:21,386
How could you question me on that now?

623
00:40:27,185 --> 00:40:27,986
Looks like

624
00:40:29,545 --> 00:40:32,505
you're not going to admit it.

625
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:36,145
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

626
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:44,025
You believe that the dead
will stay silent forever.

627
00:40:44,906 --> 00:40:45,986
In that case,

628
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:47,466
why don't we hear from someone

629
00:40:47,466 --> 00:40:48,386
who's still alive?

630
00:40:59,786 --> 00:41:01,266
How dare you come in uninvited?

631
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:04,665
Your Majesty.

632
00:41:06,906 --> 00:41:07,665
Well,

633
00:41:08,145 --> 00:41:09,665
this is an old acquaintance of yours.

634
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:14,346
Do you not remember him?

635
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:21,986
Who are you?

636
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:26,185
I, Xue Xiaotang, offer my greetings,
Your Majesty.

637
00:41:28,145 --> 00:41:28,786
Your Majesty,

638
00:41:30,386 --> 00:41:31,866
you haven't forgotten

639
00:41:33,386 --> 00:41:34,826
this name, have you?

640
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:38,585
Xue Xiaotang was once engaged to Roujia.

641
00:41:38,946 --> 00:41:40,466
I remember him.

642
00:41:41,386 --> 00:41:43,346
But he died five years ago.

643
00:41:44,386 --> 00:41:45,585
If not for your secret edict

644
00:41:46,665 --> 00:41:48,946
to eliminate Lord Ding
and the Cangwu Army

645
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:50,185
five years ago,

646
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:55,505
I wouldn't have risked my life.

647
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,625
Does it jog your memory

648
00:41:58,386 --> 00:42:01,065
about what you did back then?

649
00:42:02,346 --> 00:42:03,306
Liu Yan.

650
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:07,705
I've been tolerating you all along,

651
00:42:08,545 --> 00:42:10,746
and yet you crossed the line.

652
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:13,466
How could you

653
00:42:13,466 --> 00:42:16,505
find such a disfigured man

654
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:18,786
to slander me here?

655
00:42:22,346 --> 00:42:23,025
Guards.

656
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:25,306
I want you

657
00:42:25,306 --> 00:42:27,826
to take the two rebellious traitors down!

658
00:42:28,906 --> 00:42:30,306
Your Majesty, you might as well

659
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:32,185
take a guess

660
00:42:33,105 --> 00:42:34,426
whose men are coming in next.

661
00:42:37,145 --> 00:42:37,866
