He actually sends
that female provincial graduate here.

58
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:09,131
Could it be that something
is going on between them?

59
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,490
(Sun Yunqian, the legitimate son)
If it's true,

60
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,971
(of the Sun family)
he wouldn't do this before the public.

61
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,170
Lord Ding is one
of the chief examiners this year.

62
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:17,331
Makes sense.

63
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,331
Young Lady, you made it here.
And you got here earlier.

64
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,130
Are you all right?

65
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:20,891
Don't worry, I'm fine.

66
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,730
Thank you, My Lord.

67
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,211
No need.

68
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,050
I just don't want to feel indebted.

69
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,290
My Lord, I have something
to tell you, actually.

70
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,451
Come with me.

71
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,771
My Lord.

72
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,891
You're not young anymore.

73
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:44,331
When my father was your age,

74
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,690
he had already had many children.

75
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:48,170
I'm a physician

76
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,730
and I'm kind of skilled.

77
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:51,690
You know this well.

78
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,411
To me, you're a heroic figure

79
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:58,211
and you respect talents.

80
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,610
I always have the urge

81
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,170
to do something for you.

82
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:03,851
The Mu family,

83
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,490
well, my father,

84
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,490
has a lot of secretive
aphrodisiac prescriptions.

85
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:18,130
If you need this,

86
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,050
I can give you a treatment
at a cheap price.

87
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,331
Young Lady.

88
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,531
This is my first time
showing my kind gesture

89
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:45,690
because Lord Ding is a decent man.

90
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,050
I wanted

91
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:48,170
to help him

92
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,490
with his coital difficulty.

93
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:51,490
And yet it ticks him off.

94
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:55,050
Maybe because

95
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,771
you offered that at a low price?

96
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,651
What?

97
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,411
Does he want it for free?

98
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,851
He's the mighty Lord Ding.

99
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,730
Can't he even afford this chicken feed?

100
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:14,170
Good, stop.

101
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,250
Stand in the line.

102
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,170
Did Lord Ding send you here just now?

103
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,170
Mr. Jinghong.

104
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,730
I'm Mu Zhuohua from Yanzhou.

105
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:37,091
I barely missed the examination.

106
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:39,451
Thanks to the generous Lord Ding,

107
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:40,610
I made it here on time.

108
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,411
There's only one female
provincial graduate whose surname is Mu.

109
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,490
You must be exceptional

110
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,011
to deserve praise from Princess Roujia.

111
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:49,810
I doubt if it's a praise

112
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:51,370
I warrant from Her Highness.

113
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,971
Her Highness
has a good judgment of people.

114
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,250
I wish you success in advance.

115
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:57,810
Thank you, Mr. Jinghong.

116
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:06,730
Who exactly is that woman?

117
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:10,170
At first, Lord Ding
sent her here himself,

118
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:14,290
and now, Mr. Jinghong approaches her.

119
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,331
Is she a daughter of a noble clan?

120
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:20,331
Didn't you hear
what Mr. Jinghong just said?

121
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:23,250
Princess Roujia praised her.

122
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:24,490
She must be great.

123
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:40,015

00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:24,553

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,650
Your Majesty.

126
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,571
Aside from nursing

127
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:17,250
the relapse,

128
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:18,971
His Lordship is all right.

129
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:20,331
You ought to diagnose him carefully.

130
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,171
You mustn't leave left out
any hidden sicknesses.

131
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:24,490
Your Majesty.

132
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,530
Imperial Physician Zhao is skillful.

133
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:29,650
He won't make any mistakes
on pulse taking.

134
00:09:34,931 --> 00:09:35,571
Yes.

135
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,130
Shadow Guards have reported

136
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,851
Wandering Needle to me.

137
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,971
I have tasked Du Chong

138
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,451
to sort out all the name lists

139
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:54,051
of Shadow Guards
from the past three years

140
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,451
and hand them to you.

141
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:57,890
Thank you, Your Majesty.

142
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,250
I couldn't believe

143
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,770
there were spies in Shadow Guards.

144
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,331
Your Majesty.

145
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:06,451
Calm down, Your Majesty.

146
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:07,890
Don't hurt your health.

147
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:09,530
I'm fine.

148
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:13,931
When you told me you wanted to
go to Tiantong Mountain the other day,

149
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:14,811
and for some reason,

150
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:16,091
I was worried about you.

151
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,250
Fortunately, my men went there on time.

152
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,091
Otherwise...

153
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:23,211
In this chaotic world,

154
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:27,451
Northern Liang has painted us
as a target.

155
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:32,211
Many people want to kill me.

156
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,971
I won't let the hiding evil

157
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,971
off the hook.

158
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,291
Anyway, don't be anxious.

159
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,571
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

160
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,530
I'd want to live a longer life.

161
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:50,971
Glad to hear that.

162
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,691
I rest assured

163
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:54,931
as long as you're safe.

164
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,571
Your Majesty.

165
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:03,291
Is the Dowager Empress
doing well lately?

166
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:08,410
I haven't told her

167
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,250
about your incident.

168
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,130
Please don't make Mother worried.

169
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:19,650
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

170
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,890
I won't disturb the Dowager Empress, then.

171
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,091
By the way,

172
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:27,971
you should go
to the examination hall now.

173
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:30,211
You're the invigilator.

174
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:34,451
Yes, Your Majesty.

175
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:39,811
(If Dowager Empress is associated
with the war at Juma River,)

176
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,730
(I should gather solid evidence
to prove that.)

177
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,730
(I mustn't upset His Majesty.)

178
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,770
(Yuan Chengming has been dead
for five years.)

179
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:49,650
(However, the empty grave
on the islet in the middle of the lake)

180
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,451
(is newly dug.)

181
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,730
(Also, why did Yun Xiangyue)

182
00:11:54,451 --> 00:11:55,250
(not use her real name)

183
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:58,211
(to erect the tombstone
for her own father?)

184
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,250
(The alias is traceable.)

185
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,211
(It must be from
someone's scheme and guide.)

186
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,130
Zhijian.

187
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:10,730
Send someone to investigate
Yuan Chengming's tomb.

188
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:14,091
I need to know everything about it.

189
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:15,890
Yes.

190
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,811
The metropolitan examination begins!

191
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,770
The first session is
a compulsory subject.

192
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:55,051
The "Benevolence" chapter
in the Record of Sage.

193
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:21,730
Are you ready for this, Young Lady?

194
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:25,130
I... I think so.

195
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,530
Let me see.

196
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,931
The compulsory subject
in the first session,

197
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,530
it's under my control.

198
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,890
I have memorized all Classics

199
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,811
and they're at my fingertips.

200
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:53,610
Chen.

201
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,811
You're finally here, Uncle.

202
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:57,171
But you're late.

203
00:13:57,811 --> 00:14:00,051
You're already here.
Can't I take a rest?

204
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,571
Of course, you can.

205
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,091
I didn't send someone to urge, right?

206
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:06,691
You can come at any time you want.

207
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,410
Speaking of which,

208
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:14,331
the female candidates

209
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:16,650
are mainly from a noble origin,

210
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,370
but it's a pioneering attempt, anyway.

211
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,811
Thanks to you, Uncle.

212
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,490
It's just that

213
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,010
given the resourceful prestigious clans,

214
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,490
it should be an easy task

215
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,890
to groom female provincial graduates.

216
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:35,890
But not many of them

217
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,410
could pass the metropolitan examination.

218
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,650
I always agree with anything you do.

219
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,331
But I don't really understand
why you allowed females to take part

220
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:47,770
in the imperial examination.

221
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,211
What do you not understand?

222
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:52,010
Even though women candidates
pass the palace examination,

223
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:53,890
they still have to

224
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,130
return to family life eventually.

225
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:59,010
What's the meaning

226
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,610
of them studying so hard?

227
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,571
They couldn't help in state affairs.

228
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,091
Isn't it best to spend their time

229
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,451
on learning women's morality?

230
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,691
The results have been the same

231
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:12,291
since this practice started
during the reign of Empress Yuanguang.

232
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,530
It's because of the ethos
of Southern Chen.

233
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,051
Even though this isn't a path
for everyone,

234
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,931
giving them an alternate path
and shutting them out of it

235
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:27,730
is different.

236
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,890
Everyone has their own aspiration.

237
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,571
Knowledge will only do us good.

238
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,051
For the same peach tree,

239
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,890
some ignore it,

240
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:38,171
some are enlightened by it,

241
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,010
some empathize with its delicateness,

242
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,211
while some appreciate its niceties.

243
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,890
Whether they will become officials

244
00:15:44,171 --> 00:15:45,490
or be someone's wife and mother

245
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:47,171
after studying,

246
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:48,851
after all, they harvest

247
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:51,091
what they've contributed.

248
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,331
Uncle, what does the peach tree

249
00:15:58,931 --> 00:16:00,130
mean to you?

250
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:01,890
It reminds me of a verse.

251
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:08,010
Peach blossoms
bloom in graceful brilliance.

00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,400

Uncle.

259
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:42,211
When will you give me that jade pendant?

260
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:44,291
I've asked you for it several times.

261
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,010
Do you really need this?

262
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:52,900

Stop writing.

272
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,650
Turn in your answer sheet.

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,280

Well done.

279
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,210
Very well done.

280
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,851
I have a sheet here

281
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:58,650
with perfect answers.

282
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:00,571
Perfect answer?

283
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:02,731
Take a look at it.

284
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:03,811
Take a look at it.

285
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:05,210
Am I right?

286
00:18:07,571 --> 00:18:08,210
Read this.

287
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:10,690
It must be Shen Jinghong.

288
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,771
Don't you believe him?

289
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:15,491
Let's make a bet.

290
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,531
The answer sheet belongs
to Shen Jinghong, no doubt.

291
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:19,930
What are we betting on?

292
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:28,811
The fine brew in your residence,

293
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,170
Shiduanxiang.

294
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:33,531
Or maybe

295
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,650
your jade pendant?

296
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,851
It seems

297
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,491
that you've been coveting
my jade pendant.

298
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,051
Please take a look at it, Your Highness.

299
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:48,690
Sure.

300
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,011
It isn't Shen Jinghong's writing.

301
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,170
I have another perfect answer here too.

302
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,690
- One more?
- I see.

303
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,731
I heard that there are
several tricky questions

304
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:08,771
in Classics.

305
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:12,370
Anyway, it's good to have
more competent candidates.

306
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:14,690
Please read this, My Lord.

307
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:21,930
Uncle.

308
00:19:22,731 --> 00:19:24,051
Shen Jinghong writes this.

309
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:25,970
Yes, it is.

310
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,170
It's a shame

311
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:31,051
that you lost.

312
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,890
Because the answer sheet we bet on

313
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:36,051
should be this one.

314
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:43,571
To my surprise,

315
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,091
we have another candidate
who's on par with Shen Jinghong.

316
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,130
There are many talents in this world.
No need to be surprised.

317
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,731
This candidate may have a good memory.

318
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:56,051
But the two following sessions

319
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:59,170
are the real test of their strength.

320
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:56,690
Qi, keep this in mind.

321
00:20:57,331 --> 00:20:59,331
Women should study more

322
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,370
and have our own pursuits.

323
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:04,130
Even if you're confined
in your maiden chamber,

324
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,930
you mustn't be

325
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,051
a tractable girl.

326
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,811
You must remember this.

327
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:13,851
Never hand over your destiny

328
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,650
to someone's hand.

329
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:18,130
All right, my child?

330
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:34,130
The second session is poetry.
"Yellow Flowers Scatter Like Gold."

331
00:21:49,011 --> 00:21:51,531
(The second session is poetry,
which I'm not good at.)

332
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,890
But Tutor Shang told me

333
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,610
to try to stay on-topic,

334
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:55,690
maintain a rhymed flow,

335
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,450
and keep the verse neat.

336
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:11,811
Ridiculous. This is ridiculous.

337
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,210
More than half of them went off topic.

338
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:20,970
The title is
"Yellow Flowers Scatter Like Gold".

339
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:22,491
This question seems simple,

340
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,051
and yet it filters so many out.

341
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,130
Most of them take the yellow flowers
as chrysanthemums.

342
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,170
They're not aware

343
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:31,771
that it's from the verse,

344
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:34,851
"The green branches remain as verdant,
but yellow flowers scatter like gold."

345
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,410
It wrote about the scenery
of Grain Rain around the Spring Equinox.

346
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,610
The yellow flower here refers
to rapeseed flowers.

347
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:44,970
If the candidates mistook it
as chrysanthemums of the autumn,

348
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,690
they're eliminated.

349
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:49,170
This candidate didn't go off topic.

350
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:50,491
However,

351
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:51,531
it doesn't rhyme

352
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,650
and is poorly written.

353
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:55,531
Rapeseed flowers in the village.

354
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,650
Day after day,

355
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,571
they are busy extracting oil
from the rapeseed.

356
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:01,771
No one cares about poor peasants.

357
00:23:57,851 --> 00:23:59,731
This is a set of writing tools
from a literati in Qingzhou.

358
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:01,091
It's for you.

359
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,170
Wish you good luck.

360
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,690
The third session is
political discourse.

361
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,170
Discourse on subduing border intruders
and pacifying the residents.

362
00:25:00,251 --> 00:25:02,130
(Discourse on subduing border intruders
and pacifying the residents?)

363
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,811
But the political discourse
in the third session...

364
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,771
Tutor Shang approves
of your article, right?

365
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,650
He said your idea is unconventional
and amb...

366
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,531
Ambitious and bold.

367
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:28,811
Yes, he did say

368
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,930
my article is ambitious and bold.

369
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,291
However,

370
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:34,970
he also said my idea was wild

371
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,970
and might be shocking.

372
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:37,890
So,

373
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:42,051
if a rigid and conservative examiner
reviews my article,

374
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,051
he might give me the lowest grade.

375
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,811
That's bad.

376
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,210
(Here's what I'm going to do.)

377
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:52,690
In the first session,
I'll do what I know.

378
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,410
In the second session,
I'll do what I can.

379
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:55,811
And in the third session,

380
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,291
I think I have to pray to the deity.

381
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,650
Time's up.

382
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:17,170
Stop writing.

383
00:26:17,491 --> 00:26:18,890
Turn in your answer sheet.

384
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,291
They're out.

385
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,051
Son.

386
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,690
Young Lady.

387
00:26:58,771 --> 00:26:59,571
Daughter.

388
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,450
Young Lady.

389
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,091
Juli.

390
00:27:02,091 --> 00:27:03,370
You're finally out.

391
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,531
Father.

392
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:08,771
What's wrong?

393
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:10,491
Young Lady,

394
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:12,091
you smell.

395
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,650
That hurts.

396
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:17,251
I didn't mean to do it.

397
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,851
I'm worried sick about you.

398
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:20,731
Juli, you know what?

399
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,170
I had a fever three days before I entered
the examination hall.

400
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,091
This metropolitan examination
gives me a hard time.

401
00:27:26,331 --> 00:27:28,450
Young Lady, did you do well
in your exam?

402
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:30,450
I don't know.

403
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,251
I've done my very best.

404
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,771
By the way, Juli,

405
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,851
let me tell you this.

406
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,170
The political discourse...

407
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:45,291
Forget it. Let's not talk about it.

408
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,650
I want delicious food now.

409
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,650
Do we have any good food at home?

410
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,251
Of course, the food is ready.

411
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,410
There are many delicious food.

412
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,130
What do we have?

413
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:52,410
Crispy pork knuckles.

414
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,571
Wow.

415
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:55,170
I thought you made it steamed.

416
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:57,491
This is deviant.

417
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,930
This question is about
how to subdue border intruders.

418
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,170
And yet, this discourse

419
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,170
wrote about the nurture
of enemies on the border.

420
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:07,811
But I find it sensible

421
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,930
after reading it, though.

422
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,650
Sensible? This is ridiculous.

423
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,851
What's with the noise?

424
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,091
Where's your manner?

425
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,450
Your Highness.

426
00:28:21,731 --> 00:28:23,571
We come across a political discourse

427
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:25,610
and we have a debate

428
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,410
over it.

429
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,731
Bring me the sheet.

430
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,210
My uncle and I will read

431
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,610
what's written on it.

432
00:28:36,491 --> 00:28:37,811
Please read this, Uncle.

433
00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:44,930
(Mu Zhuohua)

434
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:46,571
(is bold to write this.)

435
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:49,130
(But it does make some sense.)

436
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,491
(It's right that war brings harm
to people, and the expenses are high.)

437
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,690
(This method might be feasible.)

438
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,851
Is this candidate from Northern Liang
or Eastern Xia?

439
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,571
This person actually takes
the outsider's side.

440
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,851
Southern Chen should employ
Confucian teachings

441
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:04,450
to enlighten foreign clans

442
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,011
and set it as the national religion,

443
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:08,130
like the Western Regions do.

444
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:11,251
If this is a feasible way,

445
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,610
Uncle,

446
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,650
what's the meaning

447
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,851
of us waging wars all along?

448
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:19,011
For the opportunity

449
00:29:20,331 --> 00:29:21,690
to have a say over them.

450
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,811
I think I've seen

451
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,610
this handwriting before.

452
00:29:28,091 --> 00:29:32,410
It's similar to the perfect answer
of the first session.

453
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:36,251
This candidate wrote
the poor verse yesterday.

454
00:29:36,491 --> 00:29:39,450
This candidate might have a good memory
and is insightful.

455
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,571
Could be a compatible rival
against Shen Jinghong.

456
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,450
I think

457
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:46,610
this person is just average.

458
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,130
We mustn't let this person
pass the examination.

459
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:53,757
(Ciming Hall)

460
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:02,731
Your Highness.

461
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,130
Was it Mu Zhuohua?

462
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:06,410
Yes.

463
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,650
Lord Ding sent her
to the examination hall himself.

464
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,690
All the way from Yanzhou.

465
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:13,690
Your Majesty.

466
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,210
Is she the daughter
of one of the deceased warriors

467
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,690
like Yun Xiangyue?

468
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,410
The Emperor halted my action
against Yan.

469
00:30:23,491 --> 00:30:26,771
I can't sit by and wait
till his lead points to me.

470
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:32,970
I need to know everything about her.

471
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:34,210
The more detailed, the better.

472
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:36,011
Start investigating.

473
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:36,890
Yes.

474
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:45,410
Merciful deity.

475
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,690
I did nothing wrong.

476
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,410
Everything I've done

477
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,650
is for the sake of Ju and Chen.

478
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,930
Sadly, they always take Yan's side.

479
00:30:55,011 --> 00:30:56,410
That truly upsets me.

480
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:58,890
As of now, I have to protect myself too.

481
00:31:00,051 --> 00:31:01,650
Things are getting more difficult
for me.

482
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:05,291
Merciful deity, please.

483
00:31:10,508 --> 00:31:12,975
(Flower Alley)

484
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:23,851
Young Lady!

485
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,051
Young Lady.

486
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,930
Young Lady, I returned from outside
and was told

487
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:32,491
that the results announcement is today.

488
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,011
Is that so?

489
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:38,051
Young Lady, why aren't you
anxious about it?

490
00:31:38,091 --> 00:31:39,331
Everyone is waiting
for the announcement.

491
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:40,890
We should go there now.

492
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,970
No, this is beneath me!

493
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,970
The principal graduate wouldn't
check for their rank by themselves.

494
00:31:46,491 --> 00:31:48,450
They always stay composed

495
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,811
and wait for the good news at home.

496
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:52,091
Wait for good news at home?

497
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:52,851
Yeah.

498
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,210
That makes sense.

499
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,890
You're surely the principal graduate.

500
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:56,851
Young Lady.

501
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,011
You must stay here and go nowhere.

502
00:31:58,011 --> 00:31:58,650
Wait for your word of success.

503
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,851
I won't go anywhere. Go ahead.

504
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:11,690
I mustn't go. No, I can't.

505
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:13,970
If I fail the examination,

506
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:15,450
I'll be a laughingstock

507
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:16,731
under the announcement board.

508
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:19,170
Oh, my.

509
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,170
What was wrong with me?

510
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,410
It's apparent that both Lord Ding
and First Prince

511
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,571
support wars.

512
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:28,051
Why did I write nonsense like such?

513
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:29,851
Wait.

514
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,690
Had I written an ingratiating answer

515
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:34,410
that defied my own will,

516
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,091
it wouldn't have been a good answer.

517
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:41,731
Forget it.

518
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,450
Just let it be.

519
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:46,531
I'm going

520
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,251
to pack the luggage

521
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,130
and seek another place to stay.

522
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,531
I will study for another three years
and resit

523
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,410
for the metropolitan examination.

524
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:57,011
I can't really ask Lord Ding

525
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,210
to support me for three years.

526
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,331
Is she back already?

527
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:14,851
Miss... Miss Song.

528
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,331
Why are you here?

529
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,650
Are you feeling unwell?

530
00:33:21,811 --> 00:33:22,531
No, I'm good.

531
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,650
Can't I come here

532
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,610
to pay you a visit?

533
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,410
Of course, you can.

534
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:29,930
Miss Song, come on in.

535
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,410
Zhuohua.

536
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,531
All of the ladies
like the scented sachets

537
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,130
you gave them.

538
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:45,210
They'd like to order a dozen from you.

539
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,011
And yet you're leaving soon.

540
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,690
Actually,

541
00:33:51,011 --> 00:33:52,450
you can stand on your own feet

542
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:54,851
in the capital

543
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:57,051
with your healing skill

544
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,410
other than fixating on the examination.

545
00:33:59,731 --> 00:34:02,051
Miss Song, the capital is too lively

546
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,571
to be a place to study.

547
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:07,170
Becoming an official
is my life's pursuit.

548
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,010
And I work as a physician

549
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:11,251
just to feed myself.

550
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,611
By the way, Miss Song,

551
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:16,251
I will give you the formula

552
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:17,050
for the scented sachet later.

553
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,450
The imperial examination
is a tough journey.

554
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:23,530
So,

555
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,291
don't get upset

556
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:26,811
if you fail it.

557
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:30,771
Zhuohua, your courage in trying it

558
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,171
has already set you apart

559
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,370
from the rest of the women in this era.

560
00:34:35,651 --> 00:34:36,530
Think about it.

561
00:34:36,651 --> 00:34:38,370
Not many people in this world

562
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,570
dare put all their eggs in one basket.

563
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:42,530
It's tough for women

564
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:45,611
to live in the current society.

565
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:46,970
So,

566
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,050
I hope

567
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:51,570
you will live your life,
come what may. All right?

568
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,570
I will, Miss Song.

569
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,490
Young Lady!

570
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,570
You made it!

571
00:35:02,131 --> 00:35:03,090
Me?

572
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,211
I made it?

573
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,731
Am I the principal graduate?

574
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:10,291
You're overconfident, Young Lady.

575
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,010
The principal graduate
can only be Mr. Jinghong.

576
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:14,970
What about me?

577
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:15,930
My rank?

578
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,890
You won 17th place.

579
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,211
17th place?

580
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:22,970
Blimey! 17th is a good rank too.

581
00:35:23,131 --> 00:35:25,131
Great! You really made the cut!

582
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,090
This is what I'm going to do.

583
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,370
I'll bring the good news
to all the ladies.

584
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,370
That's great, Young Lady.

585
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,651
17th? Did you get it right?

586
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:33,090
Yes, you won 17th place.

587
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,890
I made it! Hurrah!

588
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:36,890
This is indeed a great surprise.

589
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,050
Miss Mu made the cut!

590
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:38,970
She's the 17th.

591
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,291
- 17th? That's great.
- Exactly.

592
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:40,930
17th place?

593
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,611
Yes.

594
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,731
Come here.

595
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:45,651
She made it. She won 17th place.

596
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:46,570
What?

597
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,851
I've been looking for you, Madam Lu.

598
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,651
Zhuohua made the cut.

599
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:51,211
Really?

600
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:51,811
Yes.

601
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,771
Ladies, gather here.

602
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,450
Zhuohua made the cut!

603
00:35:57,651 --> 00:35:58,731
I told you.

604
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,211
I told you this early.

605
00:36:00,251 --> 00:36:02,450
People who rent my house
come out as great literati.

606
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,090
Rightfully so.

607
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,090
The former was a poet

608
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,331
and now is a metropolitan graduate.

609
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,370
Miss Mu won 17th place.

610
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:09,211
Miss Mu won 17th place.

611
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,651
Come over.

612
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:11,970
She won 17th place! She made the cut!

613
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,050
Miss Mu won 17th place.

614
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:14,211
Zhuohua.

615
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:15,890
Miss Mu.

616
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:16,930
Miss Song, Madam Lu.

617
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,291
I gathered everyone here
to congratulate you.

618
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:19,131
You're all here?

619
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:20,450
I'm so glad for you.

620
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,010
Thank you, Miss Song. Thank you so much.

621
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:22,611
Clap!

622
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:23,291
Thank you so much, ladies.

623
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:24,570
Thank you so much, ladies.

624
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:26,050
Thank you.

625
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:30,731
A woman?

626
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,331
The candidate who wrote about nurturing
enemies on the border was a woman?

627
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,851
The candidate who's been on par
with Shen Jinghong

628
00:36:36,851 --> 00:36:38,010
is actually a woman?

629
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:41,490
Yes, so it seems.

630
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,410
Mu Zhuohua.

631
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:47,890
Mu Zhuohua?

632
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,450
This name rings a bell.

633
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,131
Think harder.

634
00:36:58,251 --> 00:36:58,970
I can't recall anything.

635
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,090
But I must find a chance

636
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:01,970
to meet her in person

637
00:37:02,771 --> 00:37:03,530
to vent...

638
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,050
To vent my anger.

639
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,131
She actually wrote nonsense.

640
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,450
How could she win 17th place?

641
00:37:24,223 --> 00:37:26,057
(Memorial Tablet
of Empress Yuanguang, Liu Huan)

642
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,410
We've been separated for five years.

643
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:46,370
This is your first time

644
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,731
paying respect to the ancestors
after coming back.

645
00:37:49,331 --> 00:37:51,050
I'm to blame
for not staying in the capital

646
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:52,490
to do my duty as a daughter.

647
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:56,131
It's fine. Your great-grandmother
is always kind to her children.

648
00:37:56,731 --> 00:37:58,050
She won't blame you.

649
00:38:02,268 --> 00:38:03,611
(Empress Yuanguang)

650
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:06,450
Great-grandmother is
the only woman monarch in the dynasty.

651
00:38:07,331 --> 00:38:10,050
I heard that during her reign,

652
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,890
she first allowed females
to take part in the imperial exam.

653
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:12,890
Yes, she did.

654
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,050
I'm just following in her footsteps.

655
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:21,970
Father, your decision

656
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,410
is the greatest grace for all women.

657
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:27,611
If I weren't a princess,

658
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,530
I'd like to partake
in the imperial examinations

659
00:38:29,811 --> 00:38:31,171
as a commoner.

660
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:32,731
Perhaps

661
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:34,771
I could realize my ambitions

662
00:38:35,611 --> 00:38:36,691
like Great-grandmother did.

663
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,851
Instead,

664
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,211
I would prefer you to lead a happy life.

665
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,490
Among my children,

666
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:45,450
you're my favorite.

667
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,211
Also, I feel so sorry for you

668
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:50,050
in particular.

669
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:53,090
Why did you say so, Father?

670
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:56,851
You lost your mother when you were little
and had been staying in Jiangnan.

671
00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:58,331
Of all my children,

672
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,890
you're the only one
who didn't stay with me.

673
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,811
And when your husband was chosen,

674
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,490
Xue Xiaotang died
in the war at Juma River.

675
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:09,691
Come to think of it,

676
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:11,291
you've been alone all these years

677
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:13,490
and moving around.

678
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,211
I owe you

679
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:17,651
too much.

680
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,530
Please don't say that, Father.

681
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:23,171
Though I've been living
in Jiangnan alone,

682
00:39:23,851 --> 00:39:27,131
I keep receiving care
from Great-grandaunt

683
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:29,291
and you.

684
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:31,851
I never feel lonely.

685
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,050
From now on,

686
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,410
I want to stay by your side

687
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:39,211
and never leave again, Father.

688
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:40,450
Sure.

689
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,410
It's my eager intention

690
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:44,410
to have you with me.

691
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:49,010
By the way,

692
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:51,570
back then, Xue Xiaotang
passed away unexpectedly

693
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:53,171
and you insisted on
being in mourning for him.

694
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:55,291
Now that the five-year mourning
is up soon,

695
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,570
