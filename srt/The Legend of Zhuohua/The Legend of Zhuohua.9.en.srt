(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 9=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,109
Why did I end up here?

21
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:09,389
My Lord.

22
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,829
What… What brings you here?

23
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,950
Are you

24
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:17,869
digging up flowers?

25
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,389
No, I am repotting them.

26
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,190
Why?

27
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,269
Look at this, My Lord.

28
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:28,630
The flower pot Her Highness gifted me

29
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,950
is too valuable.

30
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,190
I have to put it away properly.

31
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,790
Do you know?

32
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:36,549
This pot could fetch
hundreds of taels.

33
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,589
But it is a very meaningful gift.

34
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:39,950
I dare not sell it,

35
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:40,910
let alone

36
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,750
casually leave it in the yard.

37
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:44,510
What if someone steals it?

38
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,109
So, I had an idea.

39
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,389
I will move the peony

40
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,589
into my earthenware pot

41
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,269
and store the pot Her Highness gave me

42
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,669
in a safe place.

43
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:59,589
My Lord,

44
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,109
is there a reason

45
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,790
you came here so late at night?

46
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:09,350
I have questions for you.

47
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,669
You played tricks

48
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,269
at the Floral Poetry Gathering today.

49
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,029
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

50
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,510
My Lord.

51
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,990
I was just about to thank you.

52
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:25,789
Elaborate.

53
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,229
Take it easy, My Lord.

54
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:34,110
Be careful, My Lord.

55
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,389
I admit

56
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,589
that I deliberately misled them

57
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:46,389
into thinking

58
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,070
that you wrote the poem.

59
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,789
But I didn't think

60
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,029
you'd be so cooperative.

61
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:55,589
You even spilled the cup of tea
on purpose to get their attention,

62
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,909
and that's how I ended up
getting the top prize.

63
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,149
Are you saying
I shouldn't have been so cooperative?

64
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,990
My Lord,

65
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:09,190
you always say you wouldn't help me.

66
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,510
However,

67
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,349
your words are harsh,
but your heart is soft.

68
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,990
You are kind and handsome.

69
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,229
I am most grateful to you.

70
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,589
I chose the right master.

71
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,589
I did not help you for free.

72
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:26,829
I spilled that cup of tea

73
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:27,829
and soiled my clothes.

74
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,190
The clothes I wore

75
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,110
cost over a hundred taels.

76
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,870
A hundred…

77
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,709
Why don't you

78
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,310
give me this pot as compensation?

79
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:41,029
Your Lordship,

80
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,349
why don't I give you
this flower instead?

81
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,670
A peony of this species will sell

82
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,630
for at least hundreds of taels
per blossom.

83
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,310
Such a prestigious flower
is most suitable

84
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:56,670
for a noble figure
such as Your Lordship.

85
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,750
Please accept the flower, Your Lordship.

86
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,070
Furthermore,

87
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,389
I owe more than half

88
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,670
of the credit to Your Lordship
for today's win.

89
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:10,750
After all,

90
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:13,310
you helped me.

91
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,630
So splitting the reward

92
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,589
would be most fortunate.

93
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:21,909
The palace examination takes place
two days later.

94
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,349
Yet, you still have the time and mood
to tend to flowers.

95
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,430
Her Highness's pot.

96
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,990
Your Lordship's jade pendant.

97
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:32,670
Both of them will be mine.

98
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,149
I am confident

99
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,829
I can do well in the palace examination.

100
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:56,430
My Lord.

101
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:02,029
Did you buy this flower?

102
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,310
It was a gift.

103
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,430
What?

104
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,709
Someone actually gifted you flowers?

105
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,110
My Lord.

106
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,029
Dowager Empress
looked up Mu's background

107
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:28,789
but found nothing suspicious.

108
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,589
Thankfully,
Your Lordship was wise and foresightful.

109
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:33,909
You sent the Falcon Squad
to Jiangnan ahead of time

110
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,029
and erased all traces
of Mu Zhuohua's change of birthplace.

111
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,709
Juli. Juli.

112
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,709
The exam basket.

113
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,430
Let's check the exam basket again.

114
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,389
Young Lady,

115
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:03,870
you are not allowed to bring anything
into the exam hall of the palace exam.

116
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:05,870
Right.

117
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:08,070
I can't bring anything
into the exam hall of the palace exam.

118
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,670
What about my clothes?

119
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,829
The clothes
I'm supposed to wear tomorrow.

120
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:11,950
Check them again.

121
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:13,149
I've checked them…

122
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:18,789
Five times.

123
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:21,550
- Young Lady.
- You've checked them.

124
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,029
Are you nervous?

125
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,349
What?

126
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,389
Are you nervous?

127
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:27,990
Yes.

128
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,269
I… I am a little nervous.

129
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:34,509
Young Lady, come.

130
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,950
Follow me.

131
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:47,070
Third Madam.

132
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,270
Young Lady has done what you said.

133
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:52,310
Every day, she studies diligently

134
00:08:52,469 --> 00:08:53,989
until late every day.

135
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,629
She works very hard.

136
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,109
Third Madam, please watch over

137
00:08:58,109 --> 00:08:59,469
and bless Young Lady

138
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:01,469
for her success
in tomorrow's palace examination.

139
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:02,790
May she achieve top honors.

140
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,390
Mother.

141
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,260
(Memorial Tablet of Mother, Gu Yixiao)
I have ingrained your teachings

142
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,310
in my heart.

143
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,629
For over a decade,

144
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,869
I have studied diligently.

145
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,950
I am most fortunate.

146
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,749
Females are finally

147
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:18,589
allowed to attend the imperial exam.

148
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:20,070
Tomorrow,

149
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,310
I will be taking the palace examination.

150
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,790
I am sure

151
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:26,869
you must be proud of me.

152
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:31,150
Rest assured, Mother.

153
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,270
I am sure I will pass the exam.

154
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:37,229
Please await good news.

155
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:51,869
(The palace examination begins now.)

156
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,910
(Xuanzheng Hall)
(The candidates will now enter the hall.)

157
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,790
This year's examination topic is

158
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,190
"Govern by Inaction."

159
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:48,670
"Govern by Inaction."

160
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,270
(This topic assesses
both the candidate's)

161
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:52,709
(talent and ability)

162
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,109
(to comprehend
His Majesty's intentions.)

163
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:58,349
(It has been 24 years
since His Majesty succeeded the throne.)

164
00:10:58,349 --> 00:10:59,109
(His Majesty has adopted
many benevolent policies,)

165
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:00,229
(allowing the state
to rest and flourish.)

166
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:01,869
(From this perspective,)

167
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,790
(many will focus on "inaction".)

168
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,790
(Inaction.)

169
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,550
(Inaction itself is a form of action.)

170
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,509
(Half a piece of paper left.)

171
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,150
(Half an hour.)

172
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:43,709
(What can I write?)

173
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,469
She is unlucky.

174
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,550
It looks like she will come in last.

175
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,670
She probably saw Father,

176
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,270
panicked,

177
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,109
and spilled the ink.

178
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:01,790
Father is merciful.

179
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,030
I'm sure he won't hold her responsible.

180
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,070
(That's not true.)

181
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,349
(The inkstone fell over by itself.)

182
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:11,910
(I didn't touch it.)

183
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,589
(Who did this?)

184
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,190
(Who did I offend this time?)

185
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:33,109
(What should I do?)

186
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,550
(Young Mu Ba)
Is she still studying?

187
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:48,910
Mu Xiaoqi always has her nose
in those books.

188
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:50,950
Wait for me!

189
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,790
What's the matter?

190
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,430
Still upset about what happened
during the day?

191
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,989
Don't mind what they say.

192
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,469
But, Mother,

193
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:10,190
they were insulting me.

194
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:11,390
What do they know?

195
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,670
Remember this, my child.

196
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:16,829
Women, too, must study

197
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,989
and seek their own pursuits.

198
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,270
Even if she is locked
within her chambers,

199
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,070
she cannot let herself

200
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,229
become a canary at the mercy of others.

201
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:30,509
You must remember my words.

202
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,910
Don't entrust your fate

203
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,790
to others.

204
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,270
Do you remember, my child?

205
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:38,910
Read.

206
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:43,229
(My sisters always
fought over clothes, fabric,)

207
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:44,509
(cosmetics, and jewelry.)

208
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,550
(I didn't want any of those.)

209
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,070
(All I wanted were endless books,)

210
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,550
(peace, and quiet.)

211
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,310
(If possible,)

212
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,709
(a lamp that never goes out)

213
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:57,030
(so I could read in the dark.)

214
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,629
(I still have
half a piece of paper left.)

215
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,349
(Things were tougher,)

216
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,790
(but I never thought about giving up.)

217
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:19,150
(Not to mention)

218
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,109
(I've come this far.)

219
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,229
Why is she still writing?

220
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:29,709
She might as well just give up.

221
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:31,869
She only has half a piece of paper left.

222
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,030
There's not much she can write.

223
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:37,829
A futile struggle.

224
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:00,869
She was the only one

225
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,190
who behaved improperly
in the entire exam hall.

226
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,310
With such demeanor,
it must've been a stroke of luck

227
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,030
that she got 17th place
in the metropolitan examination.

228
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:11,070
You're right.

229
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,550
If she drops out of 17th place,

230
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,229
that means we'll move up
in the rankings.

231
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,790
It's a good thing for us.

232
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,670
Right.

233
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:22,030
Did you continue to answer afterward?

234
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,989
Don't worry.

235
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:27,030
You had an accident,

236
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:28,629
but if you put your heart
into your answers,

237
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,829
I'm sure His Majesty will not blame you.

238
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,390
I think I did well.

239
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:41,509
You're still this positive

240
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:43,030
in the face of such an accident.

241
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,629
As expected of you.

242
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,709
We proceed to the second round
of the palace examination.

243
00:16:01,469 --> 00:16:03,349
All the candidates
will wait outside the hall

244
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:06,030
while His Majesty summons
and questions the candidates.

245
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,390
Shen Jinghong has been summoned.

246
00:16:37,469 --> 00:16:41,709
Mu Zhuohua has been summoned.

247
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,870
I, Mu Zhuohua, greet Your Majesty.

248
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,390
At ease.

249
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:14,350
Not bad. You are young,
yet your composure is extraordinary.

250
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:16,749
I thought you would have
burst into tears on the spot.

251
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,190
Never give up

252
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,789
until you're at the end of your rope.

253
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:22,910
Even when you're at your wit's end,

254
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:25,069
face life and death with a smile.

255
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:26,150
Oh?

256
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,789
Is this what you meant with your answer?

257
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:31,190
"Do one's best
and leave the rest to Heaven's will"?

258
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,950
Your Majesty is wise.

259
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,110
In a few words,

260
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,630
you've described
both the ways of humanity

261
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,309
and the truths of Heaven.

262
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:42,269
Good.

263
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,269
You are young,

264
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:49,630
yet you have achieved
a deep understanding of life.

265
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:50,709
This is impressive.

266
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,789
Thank you, Your Majesty.

267
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,029
But you tainted your exam paper
during the palace examination today.

268
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:55,989
That is a serious offense.

269
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,430
You managed to submit
these few lines in the end,

270
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,150
but it is difficult
to convince everyone.

271
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,309
So I will give you another chance.

272
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,590
Use the notion
of "Govern by Inaction"

273
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,590
to expound on a strategy
for border defense.

274
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,549
Yes, Your Majesty.

275
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,269
Do nothing

276
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,709
to accomplish everything.

277
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:20,029
Rule with peace, and the land prospers.

278
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,190
Alleviating concerns at the borders
by adapting to the circumstances.

279
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,630
Following the desires of the people

280
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:27,029
ensures success in all endeavors,

281
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,590
benefiting the populace
and spreading blessings to all.

282
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:32,469
In this way, the people remain loyal.

283
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,989
(By promoting education widely)

284
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,029
(and aligning the hearts of the people,)

285
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:37,110
(the nation attains clarity
in all matters.)

286
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,350
(When officials act righteously,
the people remain loyal,)

287
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,229
and the country will be united.

288
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:47,275
That is what I think.

289
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,269
Good.

290
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,269
So, are you implying

291
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:57,830
that we can unite the country
without waging war?

292
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:01,469
Wars are still inevitable.

293
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:04,670
Education builds
a strong and prosperous nation.

294
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,190
A strong nation is one that wins wars.

295
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,950
The purpose of educating them
is to prevent war.

296
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:10,150
War

297
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:11,830
is to make them listen

298
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,709
to reason.

299
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,029
Oh, you.

300
00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:18,309
You've said everything.

301
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,950
(She passed this test)

302
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,709
(beautifully.)

303
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,830
Your Majesty,

304
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,989
will you summon the next candidate?

305
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,069
That won't be necessary.

306
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,469
I have decided.

307
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:36,309
Yan.

308
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,549
Your Majesty.

309
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:44,390
What do you think?

310
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:46,749
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

311
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,830
Southern Chen is blessed
with many outstanding talents.

312
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,029
(I finally made it over that hurdle.)

313
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,110
(But that was hard.)

314
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,430
(Really hard.)

315
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:30,950
The palace examination
of the 24th year of Zhaoming.

316
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,910
First place in the first rank.

317
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,029
Shen Jinghong.

318
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:38,749
Conferred the title of Jinshi.

319
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,390
Second place in the first rank.

320
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,870
Sun Yunqian.

321
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,469
Conferred the title of Jinshi.

322
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,830
Third place in the first rank.

323
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:21,469
Mu Zhuohua.

324
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,709
Conferred the title of Jinshi.

325
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,590
Me?

326
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:32,870
Mu Zhuohua.

327
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,190
Aren't you going to thank His Majesty?

328
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:48,190
(Third place… I got Tanhua.)

329
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:50,989
His Majesty has declared a banquet
to be held at Xuanzheng Hall.

330
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,830
Congratulations to all the successful
candidates in the imperial examination.

331
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,469
Long live His Majesty,
for ten thousand years and beyond.

332
00:22:12,469 --> 00:22:15,269
All of you are the future pillars
of Southern Chen.

333
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,910
In the days to come, you must always put

334
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,630
the state and the people first.

335
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:25,390
We will heed Your Majesty's teachings.

336
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:30,830
Everyone.

337
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:33,469
I drink to all of you.

338
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,830
Father.

339
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:39,910
The imperial physician
has advised you against drinking.

340
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,029
Let me drink on your behalf.

341
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,430
Very well.

342
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:08,590
Thank you, Your Majesty.

343
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:12,110
May Your Majesty be blessed
with eternal happiness and longevity.

344
00:23:12,469 --> 00:23:15,350
May Southern Chen
be forever prosperous and peaceful.

345
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,190
Shen.

346
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:39,590
Your Majesty.

347
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:41,630
You are not yet married, correct?

348
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,958
My daughter, Princess Roujia,
is beautiful, compassionate, and virtuous.

349
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:48,069
She is always helping
the less fortunate.

350
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:51,029
It is solely to honor
her deceased betrothed,

351
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,390
Xue Xiaotang,

352
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,870
that she has remained unmarried
until now.

353
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:56,229
What do you think, Mr. Shen?

354
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,309
Is she worthy of you?

355
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,190
Father.

356
00:24:15,229 --> 00:24:16,989
Putting aside the fact
that he is a few years younger than me,

357
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:18,830
he has already declared

358
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,269
that he will not marry

359
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,670
until he becomes a first-rank official.

360
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,229
With such ambition,

361
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,950
how could he willingly

362
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,670
become a powerless consort
to a princess?

363
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,430
Shen Jinghong.

364
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:34,350
Refusing to marry
until you become a first-rank official.

365
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:36,910
Does that apply

366
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,830
to a princess as well?

367
00:24:52,469 --> 00:24:53,269
Your Majesty.

368
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:57,190
Marriage is simply
an embellishment of achievements.

369
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,590
With Your Majesty's gracious favor,

370
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,870
I became a Zhuangyuan
in the imperial examination.

371
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:01,670
I shall wholeheartedly devote myself

372
00:25:02,229 --> 00:25:04,549
to serving Your Majesty
and the people of Southern Chen

373
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:06,269
to the best of my abilities.

374
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:11,870
So be it.

375
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:15,910
I suppose
this was not a favorable match.

376
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:18,830
Roujia,

377
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:21,830
if you meet a man you favor,
let me know.

378
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:24,709
I will see to it
that your wedding is grand and splendid.

379
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,789
Shen,

380
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:07,269
do you have feelings
for Princess Roujia?

381
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:11,190
Her Highness is benevolent and kind.

382
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,190
It is only natural for us to admire her.

383
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:18,029
But admiration and marriage

384
00:26:18,715 --> 00:26:19,749
are two separate matters.

385
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,469
Do you not

386
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:25,150
admire Her Highness?

387
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,509
Admire?

388
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,910
You're right, Shen.

389
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,190
I admire Her Highness too.

390
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:50,269
Shen,

391
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,630
I have a question
and want to discuss it with you.

392
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,590
Ask away.

393
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,190
If someone doesn't seek trouble,

394
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,989
but trouble comes to them,

395
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:04,910
how should they deal with it?

396
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,229
Confront it

397
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:11,709
and resolve it.

398
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,309
Understood.

399
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:28,269
(There can be no wind in the hall.)

400
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,029
(The inkstone couldn't possibly
have knocked itself over.)

401
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:40,350
(Only someone close to me
could have done it.)

402
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:22,029
Tanhua Mu.

403
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:25,630
Lord Ding.

404
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,549
The banquet has just ended.

405
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,350
Are you leaving the palace already?

406
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:41,830
Yes.

407
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:43,309
It's late at night.

408
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:45,670
I'm afraid I'll get lost
if I return too late.

409
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,509
I am returning to my residence as well.

410
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,910
Come with me.

411
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,269
Oh?

412
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:54,989
All right.

413
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,190
I haven't had a chance
to congratulate you yet.

414
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:08,630
I should congratulate Your Lordship too.

415
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,229
Why?

416
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,069
To gain a capable assistant

417
00:29:15,469 --> 00:29:17,190
such as myself.

418
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:22,229
When did you become my assistant?

419
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,430
However,

420
00:29:26,469 --> 00:29:28,830
what happened today
could have put you in danger.

421
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,670
But you were able
to turn it into an opportunity.

422
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,630
Your courage is commendable.

423
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,350
I'm sure First Prince
would've been over the moon

424
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,870
if I hadn't been ranked.

425
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:47,069
Chen is not that kind of person.

426
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,630
Then…

427
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:54,430
What about the Second Prince
and the Third Prince?

428
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,549
They don't know you well.

429
00:29:58,789 --> 00:29:59,870
Naturally, it matters not to them

430
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:01,989
whether you are ranked or not.

431
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:09,315
In that case…

432
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,469
Your Lordship was the one
who knocked over my inkstone

433
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:18,390
during the palace examination.

434
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,390
Yes.

435
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:33,830
Your Lordship won't look at me.

436
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,509
Is that because you are feeling guilty?

437
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:41,309
If I had been
any less composed or resolute

438
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,229
during the palace examination today,

439
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:45,749
never mind attending the banquet
inside the imperial palace,

440
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,269
I would've committed a serious crime
of impropriety

441
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,110
and be banned
from taking the examination for life.

442
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:54,670
One must be able to navigate
the treacherous waters of the court.

443
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,630
It is especially difficult
for women to hold official positions.

444
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,749
I deliberately knocked over
your inkstone

445
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:02,430
to test your character.

446
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,110
If you can't overcome
even this small obstacle…

447
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,229
Small obstacle?

448
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:09,789
This matter is as light as a feather

449
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:10,950
to Your Lordship,

450
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,309
but it is as heavy as a mountain to me.

451
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:15,749
As a woman,

452
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,910
I know how difficult it is for a woman
to take the imperial examination.

453
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,269
I endured and faced all the challenges
and difficulties on this path

454
00:31:20,469 --> 00:31:22,390
only to seek freedom.

455
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,309
Beyond the realm of books
lies the vast blue sky,

456
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,590
where the sky is high,
and birds are free to fly.

457
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:27,950
This is the path that I seek.

458
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,430
You forcibly put me through
an additional test

459
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,910
simply because I am a woman.

460
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,950
Is this the fairness you spoke of

461
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:38,190
when you proposed to allow females

462
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:39,749
to attend the imperial exam?

463
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:32,150
I…

464
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,350
Your Lordship,

465
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,190
I just feel aggrieved.

466
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,830
You don't have to do this.

467
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,469
I was wrong.

468
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,150
Your Lordship.

469
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:14,430
Are you saying

470
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,430
that my future
will be like this lantern,

471
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:21,830
bright and clear?

472
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,430
On the contrary.

473
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:26,590
The path ahead of you

474
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:29,229
will not be easy.

475
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,950
What I seek

476
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:36,749
has already put me
in a great deal of danger.

477
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,709
When I first saw you,
I thought you were suspicious.

478
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,670
That was why
I tested you again and again.

479
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:43,590
I didn't expect

480
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,549
to involve you in past matters.

481
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,590
I have had my men

482
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,789
remove all traces of you changing
your birthplace for the imperial exam.

483
00:33:58,029 --> 00:33:59,789
You need not worry about it anymore.

484
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,069
From now on,

485
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:06,150
you can stay away from me,
the whirlpool of controversy.

486
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,270
As long as you speak and act
with caution

487
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,310
and uphold your integrity,

488
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:15,390
your career as an official
should be stable and secure.

489
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,109
If you still wish

490
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,910
to work for me,

491
00:34:24,549 --> 00:34:26,950
I will certainly do my utmost
to make sure you're safe.

492
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:28,830
However,

493
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,149
you should also be aware

494
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,549
that this path will not be
a ladder to success

495
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,509
but rather a steep
and challenging precipice.

496
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:54,989
I give you this jade pendant

497
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,230
as a gift for your achievements
in the imperial examination.

498
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,589
Think of it as an amulet.

499
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:02,549
May it keep you safe.

500
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,549
Did this jade pendant

501
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,629
go to war with Your Lordship?

502
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:22,069
Yes.

503
00:35:24,629 --> 00:35:25,870
This is too valuable.

504
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,350
No matter what path you take,

505
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:31,270
with a heart like yours,

506
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:35,710
you'll be able to swim
against the currents

507
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:37,549
and see the mountains from the peak.

508
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:44,149
I will remember your teachings,
Your Lordship.

I'm back, Juli.

524
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,509
Young Lady!

525
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,629
You're finally back, Young Lady.

526
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:54,870
Did His Majesty
appoint you as an official?

527
00:36:57,629 --> 00:36:58,270
Juli,

528
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:00,270
there's something I want to tell you.

529
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,549
I scolded Lord Ding today.

530
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,629
You scolded Lord Ding?

531
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:09,989
Then…

532
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:12,350
How did you come back in one piece?

533
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:12,989
You…

534
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,549
Did you come to see me one last time?

535
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,230
Oh, no…

536
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:18,469
Don't worry, Young Lady!

537
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,549
If something happens to you,
I'll never live alone!

538
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,870
Zhijian and Zhimo are outside.

539
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,750
I'll get them,
and I'll fight them until the end!

540
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,710
Calm down.

541
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,910
I was messing with you.

542
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,189
Do you really think
I would be able to make it back

543
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,189
if Lord Ding was upset at me?

544
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,390
Put away the lantern.

545
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,589
Young Lady,

546
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:50,870
you're telling me His Lordship admitted

547
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,710
he was wrong
for knocking over your inkstone,

548
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:53,350
and he apologized to you?

549
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:54,270
Yes.

550
00:37:54,549 --> 00:37:55,910
I was stunned

551
00:37:56,029 --> 00:37:57,310
when he apologized.

552
00:37:57,989 --> 00:37:59,310
A person of his noble status

553
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,870
actually bowed and apologized to me.

554
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,750
That is hard to imagine.

555
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:06,989
Not only did he apologize,

556
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:08,710
but he also gave you this jade pendant
to congratulate you.

557
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,710
Then again, Young Lady,

558
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,669
I don't think
this jade pendant is worth much.

559
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,029
His Lordship is too stingy.

560
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,029
Juli,

561
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:18,950
this is proof of His Lordship's courtesy
and kindness towards the lower-ranked.

562
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,549
This is priceless.

563
00:38:27,029 --> 00:38:28,350
He helped me settle the matter

564
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,189
of changing my birthplace
before I even asked.

565
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,350
He is so nice.

566
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,350
He is not like
the other rich and powerful at all.

567
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,549
That's true,

568
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:42,390
but His Lordship has a lot of enemies.

569
00:38:42,629 --> 00:38:43,950
It's dangerous to stay by his side.

570
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,589
Young Lady,

571
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,109
are you sure you want to keep
relying on His Lordship?

572
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:54,149
Back then, I didn't have a choice.

573
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,350
Now, he has given me a choice.

574
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,109
I can choose to stay away from him

575
00:38:59,189 --> 00:39:00,790
or join him.

576
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,189
But…

577
00:39:02,989 --> 00:39:05,790
I don't know what I should choose now.

578
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:07,149
Is it really that difficult
to make a choice?

579
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,629
You joined him to stay safe.

580
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:11,310
Of course, your safety is your priority.

581
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,069
You're right.

582
00:39:13,629 --> 00:39:14,629
It's more important to stay alive.

583
00:39:16,509 --> 00:39:17,069
That reminds me.

584
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:19,029
How's the search for a residence
on the north side of the city?

585
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,069
I found a place.

586
00:39:20,189 --> 00:39:21,230
Madam Lu said

587
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,390
we could rent the residence
next to Zhuque Street.

588
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:25,870
Lots of elder imperial physicians
live around that area.

589
00:39:27,149 --> 00:39:28,910
But the residence is too big.

590
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,069
The rent is a little high.

591
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:31,509
How much?

592
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:33,589
Fifteen guan a month.

593
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,950
It's daylight robbery.

594
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,069
That is quite expensive…

595
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,950
But we have to rent it.

596
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,870
The residence in my mother's memories

597
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,790
must be around the north of the city.

598
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,189
Juli, money is not a concern.

599
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,189
I want to find my mother's origin.

600
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,230
I can't let her stay
like a rootless water weed.

601
00:39:57,669 --> 00:39:58,069
Yes.

602
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,230
Money is not a problem.

603
00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:01,509
I'll figure something out.

604
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:16,750
(Mu Zhuohua, a Yanzhou native,)

605
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,390
(achieved third place in the first rank)

606
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,790
(in the 24th year of Zhaoming.)

607
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:22,830
This is to certify
that she has been appointed

608
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:25,830
to the position of Seven-Rank Editor
in the Hanlin Academy.

609
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,710
I thank His Majesty.

610
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,149
Congratulations, Editor Mu.

611
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:34,830
Here is a full set
of your official garment.

612
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,950
Please report for duty
at the Hanlin Academy

613
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,710
in your uniform in two days
to begin work.

614
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:45,710
Thank you. Please accept this.

615
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,549
Well…

616
00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:51,350
I have other matters to attend to.
I shall take my leave.

617
00:40:58,589 --> 00:40:59,189
