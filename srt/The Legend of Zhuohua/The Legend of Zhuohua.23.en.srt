=The Legend of Zhuohua=

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 23=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This is a work of fiction.)

20
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,320
Here we have
the noblest lady of Jiangzuo.

21
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,279
What would others think of you

22
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,040
if they were to figure out

23
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,320
the cheap ploys you've resorted to?

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,520
I did nothing.

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,680
It has nothing to do with me.

26
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,920
Miss Sun, I need to tell you

27
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,879
that I know the tea tasted strange.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,640
I didn't expose you

29
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,920
because I found it pointless.

30
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,960
However, you're getting under my skin

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,800
by doing so several times.

32
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,719
Lord Ding and I go way back

33
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,960
to our childhood.

34
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:28,680
But when I finally returned
to the capital,

35
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,240
everything changed totally.

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,680
You're in my way!

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,439
Miss Sun.

38
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,120
Let me repeat this to you.

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,920
Before this,
I didn't hold you accountable

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,999
because I'd taken

41
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,599
your jealousy lightly

42
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,960
as it wouldn't affect much.

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,520
But you keep making mischief

44
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,800
and have affected the operation
of the Ministry of Revenue.

45
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,800
Don't blame me for turning against you!

46
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,159
All right, Ms. Mu.

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,400
I promise it won't happen again.

48
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,159
You're here, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,879
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

50
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,159
I suppose Miss Sun might be having
some difficulties after arriving here.

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Besides, she has to do her duty
at the Ministry of Revenue.

52
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,839
So, I came to check on her.

53
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,039
And now I run into you here,

54
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,759
who's bullying a newcomer.

55
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,439
Ms. Mu.

56
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,240
Do you admit your fault?

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,719
(They're really meant)

58
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,080
(to be in one family. Sheesh.)

59
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,960
I do.

60
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,240
I lost control of myself

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,719
and snapped at Observer Sun just now.

62
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,120
My Lord, bad news.

63
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,719
While the Dowager Empress
was on her way to visit Observer Sun,

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,559
she caught Ms. Mu and Observer Sun

65
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,319
in a catfight.

66
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,360
Hence, Ms. Mu was punished by kneeling
for two hours.

67
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,080
How long has it been?

68
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,200
More than an hour.

69
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,959
Bring along the anti-swelling ointment.

70
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,439
Yes.

71
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,199
Sir.

72
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,959
You can send this letter to your family.

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,360
I've written everything

74
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,720
you wanted me to write.

75
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,280
All right.

76
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,759
Thank you, mister.

77
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,519
Thank you so much.

78
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,680
Man told me

79
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,800
you came to Jishan Hall
as soon as you got off work.

80
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,840
You've skipped dinner too.

81
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,559
What's this?

82
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,720
Man said you like sweet desserts.

83
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:09,720
Take a seat.

84
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,999
Princess Roujia, you're here too.

85
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,160
Jishan Hall belongs to Her Highness.

86
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,800
Naturally, she's here.

87
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,399
Well. Anyway, I'm here for you.

88
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,319
Me?

89
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,160
You...

90
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,160
You want to talk to Official Shen?

91
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,240
Yes, we do.

92
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,319
Shen Jinghong promised to teach me
poems of the Central Plains.

93
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,720
But he's too busy.

94
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,519
So I came here myself.

95
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:08,160
Great effort, Official Shen.

96
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,879
I don't mind lending the place to you.

97
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,399
Men from the Central Plains

98
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,920
stick to promises, don't they?

99
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,519
It's time for you to fulfill
your promise.

100
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,160
The Dowager Empress wants you to kneel
for two full hours,

101
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,759
not a second less.

102
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,199
Ms. Mu.

103
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,280
My family is the most prestigious clan
in Jiangzuo,

104
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,559
while I'm the legitimate eldest daughter
of the Sun clan.

105
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,120
Behind me, it's the Dowager Empress
and Consort Shu.

106
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,680
If I marry Lord Ding,

107
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,040
we're a fated couple

108
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,879
for his promising future.

109
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,639
While you,

110
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,720
no way.

111
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,199
Stop your pipe dream.

112
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,079
Frankly, it's unnecessary
to corner me like this

113
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,399
and spend so much time and effort

114
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,559
on me.

115
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,840
He doesn't like you.

116
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,879
It's not that I don't like you.

117
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,879
But you keep showing up
before me every day.

118
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,559
I almost started to believe

119
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,639
that you admired me instead.

120
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,759
Is it worth the effort?

121
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,120
If you leave,

122
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:58,519
at least...

123
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,879
At least he'll be conscious of me.

124
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,759
Miss Sun.

125
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,999
Let me repeat this to you.

126
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,480
His Lordship and I are different.

127
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,160
Whomever he chooses to marry

128
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,680
has nothing to do with me.

129
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
His Lordship said
not to reveal his name.

130
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,440
Understood.

131
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,320
Thank you.

132
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,799
Official Li.

133
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,080
I heard that you were punished
by the Dowager Empress.

134
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,720
Oh, dear.

135
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,039
You shouldn't have acted impulsively.

136
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,759
Miss Sun is from a noble family.

137
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
There's no way
you can get the upper hand

138
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,039
when you confront her.

139
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,720
Apply the ointment now.

140
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,200
It helps you

141
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,720
get the swelling down.

142
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,120
I always use this.

143
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,279
It's effective.

144
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,720
Thank you for sharing

145
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,759
this ointment with me.

146
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,279
I'll just use a little bit

147
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,480
and return the rest to you.

148
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,639
No.

149
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,200
Keep it.

150
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,919
I have a lot more.

151
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,759
If so,

152
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,960
thank you so much.

153
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Don't mention it.

154
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,679
Which one do you think has hurt him?

155
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,399
"Whomever he chooses to marry

156
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,639
has nothing to do with me."

157
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,960
Oh, that hurts.

158
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,320
My Lord.

159
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,159
Why did you ask for me?

160
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,879
From now on, send someone else

161
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,279
to deliver the document.

162
00:10:57,685 --> 00:10:59,240
(Ministry of Revenue)

163
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,039
(Are you all busy?)

164
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,600
It's an urgent document.

165
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,120
I'll deliver this, Official Li.

166
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,960
We shall give Observer Sun a chance.

167
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,320
Official Li.

168
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:41,999
Me again?

169
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,879
Yes.

170
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:43,960
Go ahead.

171
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,399
What's going on?

172
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,960
It used to be me, though.

173
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,799
Official Li.

174
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,039
Do you need me to deliver
the urgent document?

175
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,240
You've been helping a lot, Observer Sun.

176
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,560
Not at all.

177
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,799
My Lord.

178
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,759
It's scorching. Let me hold
an umbrella for you.

179
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,840
My Lord.

180
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,519
Are you all right?

181
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:47,960
Thank you.

182
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,560
Greetings, My Lord.

183
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,560
My Lord.

184
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,480
Do not get heatstroke.

185
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,999
Thank you.

186
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,840
Young Lady.

187
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:29,799
Young Lady.

188
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,240
Young Lady.

189
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,360
What happened?

190
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,200
Nothing.

191
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,840
I think I got tired

192
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,560
from walking.

193
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,440
Young Lady.

194
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,720
Look at this.

195
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,360
Spider.

196
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,759
It's an auspicious spider.

197
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,080
Young Lady, the Qiqiao Festival
is around the corner.

198
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,919
Do you remember that?

199
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,159
No.

200
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,560
It's fine.

201
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,480
I've saved the date.

202
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,840
Put this in a new chest tomorrow

203
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,919
and check it the next morning.

204
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,720
The denser the spider web,
the higher your chances of standing out.

205
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,279
Oh, right.

206
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:16,639
Look at this.

207
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,759
This is Qiaoguo.
[*Sweet and crispy pastry]

208
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,720
I can't see why I should celebrate this.

209
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,080
I don't want to celebrate
the Qiqiao Festival.

210
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,639
What has happened?

211
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:28,960
Why not?

212
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,320
We can have yummy food and lots of fun

213
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,240
during the Qiqiao Festival.

214
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,440
Juli, let me ask you this.

215
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,159
Zhimo has been giving you

216
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,720
grapes and pastries.

217
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,159
But if he suddenly gives them

218
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
to another person one day,

219
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,159
will you be upset?

220
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,360
I won't if he gives them to Zhijian.

221
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,560
(I used to think
that I wouldn't feel hurt)

222
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,159
(when he dated any women.)

223
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,240
(But it seems that it's not the case.)

224
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,120
Do not get heatstroke.

225
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,720
Thank you.

226
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,759
Young Lady.

227
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,039
Are you feeling unwell?

228
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,480
I'm fine.

229
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,120
Something came up, Official Mu.

230
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,360
Next door. Hurry.

231
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,399
All right.

232
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,480
My Lord.

233
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,120
My Lord.

234
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,399
Official Mu.

235
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,519
- Imperial Physician Lu.
- His condition is bad.

236
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,600
We need your help.

237
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,320
Why did he relapse all of a sudden?

238
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,879
The acupuncture therapy

239
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,879
can only extend his life.

240
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,320
If his sickness
were to recurrently relapse,

241
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,560
even if he didn't die,

242
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,759
he'd become foolish after waking up.

243
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,600
Acupuncture therapy won't help much

244
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,840
without Snow Dust Pill.

245
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,480
What should we do now?

246
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,360
Let's try again, Official Mu.

247
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,120
All right.

248
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Thank you, Ms. Mu.

249
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,879
It's my duty.

250
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,279
Your Highness, the lecture is over.

251
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:45,840
Ms. Mu.

252
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,519
Yes, Your Highness.

253
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,159
As the adage goes,

254
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,999
"Develop a counterattack plan
before riots erupt;

255
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,679
Stabilize the nation
before crises emerge."

256
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,240
But what should we do
if someone conceals the truth

257
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,560
from both superiors and subordinates?

258
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:58,600
Yu.

259
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,399
Have you heard the news?

260
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,879
Today, Grandmother

261
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,479
arranged a marriage
between Lord Ding and Yunyun.

262
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,959
Yunyun has loved Uncle
for seven years

263
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:10,320
and refuses to get engaged to any men
at her marriageable age.

264
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,639
Maybe Grandmother grants her wish

265
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,320
concerning her deep affection.

266
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Regarding your question

267
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,439
about the adage,

268
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,800
I'll explain it to you precisely

269
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,159
in the next lecture.

270
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,439
Sure.

271
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,840
I shall take my leave.

272
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:33,520
(Wenzheng Parlor)

273
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,159
(Your Highness.)

274
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:36,800
You called me here on short notice.

275
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,919
Is it something urgent?

276
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:42,280
Jinghong, take a seat.

277
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:01,600
Jinghong.

278
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:06,000
You're close to Ms. Mu, aren't you?

279
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:08,959
Yes.

280
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,360
Do you know what her hobby is?

281
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,199
Your Highness.

282
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,719
Why don't you ask her in person?

283
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,040
Here's the thing.

284
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:30,879
Previously,

285
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:32,760
I offended her,

286
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,919
and I feel terrible about that.

287
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,159
I'm waiting for a chance

288
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,600
to apologize to her.

289
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:42,159
So, what's her hobby?

290
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,679
Well, Ms. Mu...

291
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,000
Money.

292
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,719
Anything else besides money?

293
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:03,000
Apart from money,

294
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,159
there is none.

295
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,120
Forget it.

296
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:10,719
I'll figure this out myself.

297
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:26,800
(Have you heard the news?)

298
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,159
(Today, Grandmother)

299
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,959
(arranged a marriage
between Lord Ding and Yunyun.)

300
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:37,120
Do you want one?

301
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,800
Young Lady, you're back.

302
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,479
Juli.

303
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,199
Why are you so well dressed today?

304
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,840
Oh, Young Lady.

305
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:51,959
Did you forget that?

306
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,399
Today is the Qiqiao Festival.

307
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,080
I see.

308
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:57,439
No wonder the streets

309
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,719
have been decorated.

310
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,679
I received a bag of Qiaoguo
during lunch.

311
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,760
Young Lady,

312
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,280
you should dress up too.

313
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,800
We're hanging out later.

314
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,560
Come on.

315
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,639
Juli, I'm not going.

316
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,879
I'm not in the mood for that.

317
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,719
No, please. Young Lady.

318
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,360
It's only held once a year.

319
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,239
You should enjoy yourself.

320
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,199
Come on.

321
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:18,679
Go and get ready.

322
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,560
No, Juli.

323
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,199
Chop-chop, Young Lady.

324
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,639
There are so many sky lanterns.

325
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,919
It's crowded here.

326
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,199
Juli, look over there.

327
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,560
And there.

328
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:50,239
Look.

329
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,280
This is amazing.

330
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:01,280
How did he manage that?

331
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,295
I have no idea.

332
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,639
Come on, let's go over there.

333
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:35,520
Out of my way.

334
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:37,840
Uncle.

335
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,040
Look at this lantern.

336
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,760
It's cool, isn't it?

337
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
I solved the riddles and won it.

338
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:54,800
Juli.

339
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,280
Go and meet up with Zhimo.

340
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:57,760
I need to go somewhere.

341
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,320
Let's meet up later, Young Lady.

342
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,439
It's pretty good.

343
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:11,120
Oh, right.

344
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,879
Someone did a magic trick
for me and Young Lady.

345
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:13,919
He made a dove appear.

346
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:16,479
Oh, this is yummy.

347
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,879
Try it.

348
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,040
Nice?

349
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,479
Yes.

350
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,560
You never like sweet food.

351
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:25,879
And yet you lie

352
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,360
to please the girl.

353
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:29,800
Zhijian.

354
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,639
Do you want to join us
for the festival?

355
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
I don't celebrate the Qiqiao Festival.

356
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,120
What festival do you celebrate?

357
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:36,840
I celebrate the Ghost Festival.

358
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,080
Ignore him.

359
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,399
Wait for me, Official Shen!

360
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:43,280
You...

361
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:44,959
Princess Jing'an.

362
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,080
What's it again?

363
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,080
I was told
that people in the Central Plains

364
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,199
celebrate the Qiqiao Festival today.

365
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,840
Many couples celebrate this.

366
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:55,639
Oh, I remember something.

367
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,600
I have some tasks to attend to now.

368
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:58,959
How about this?

369
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
There will be many beautiful lanterns

370
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,360
since it's a festival today.

371
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:02,560
You should go and take a look around.

372
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:03,679
- I shall take my leave.
-Let's...

373
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,959
Let's go together...

374
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,360
Wait for me!

375
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,885
(Heaven never ages, love never dies.
The twain remain in inseparable ties.)

376
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,000
Since I've made up my mind,

377
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,000
I shouldn't regret it.

378
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,719
This lantern

379
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,199
will be the proof

380
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,439
of my past liking for Lord Ding.

381
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,679
Heaven never ages,

382
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,239
love never dies.

383
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:45,959
Since love does exist,

384
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,000
why did you give in?

385
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:55,760
My Lord.

386
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,760
You heard everything.

387
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,479
I won't deny it, then.

388
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,000
Yes.

389
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,760
My Lord.

390
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,560
I do have feelings for you.

391
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:17,679
But...

392
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:21,000
But after Miss Sun came,

393
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,040
I realize

394
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,120
that my liking

395
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,120
won't do you any good.

396
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,439
Instead, Miss Sun

397
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,439
comes from a noble origin.

398
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,760
The two of you

399
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,040
are meant for each other.

400
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,239
By the way,

401
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:47,520
I forgot to congratulate you.

402
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,040
You're expecting a wedding

403
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:53,560
with Miss Sun.

404
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,520
Take your blessing back.

405
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,560
I don't need it.

406
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,399
As you've seen,

407
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,760
the Dowager Empress has been trying
to set me up with Sun Yunyun.

408
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:11,679
But I don't want to.

409
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,959
No one can force me

410
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,320
to do something I don't want.

411
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,000
Likewise, no one can stop me

412
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,320
from something I want.

413
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,199
Are you saying

414
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:32,959
that you don't want to marry her?

415
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,239
Of course, I don't.

416
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:38,360
Your Majesty, I know

417
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,040
you attach great importance
to my marriage.

418
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:41,760
However,

419
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:44,840
I hope to decide on my marriage.

420
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,520
Miss Sun is a good choice,

421
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,679
but

422
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,320
she's in a prestigious
yet complicated position.

423
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:53,840
I know

424
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:55,560
I'm a lord,

425
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,919
and I have no freedom
to decide on my marriage.

426
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,159
In that case,

427
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:00,879
I'd rather not have it.

428
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:02,800
Do you mean

429
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
you're not marrying anyone

430
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:06,959
in this life?

431
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,879
Please grant my wish, Your Majesty.

432
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,879
Miss Sun.

433
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:19,600
I think you've visited the market

434
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,159
you want.

435
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,120
As for the rest,

436
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,800
I have already made myself clear.

437
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:29,080
I have no patience for women.

438
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,479
You should know what I mean.

439
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:34,439
Don't bring yourself disgrace

440
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:35,919
before the public.

441
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,080
My Lord.

442
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,639
I spare no effort

443
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,520
to walk towards you

444
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,719
and be seen by you.

445
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,800
I've liked you for seven years.

446
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,199
But love

447
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,199
can't be measured by time.

448
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:15,959
My Lord.

449
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,679
Thank you

450
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,800
for doing all this for me.

451
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:24,520
However,

452
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,479
I'm selfish.

453
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,879
When I escaped to the capital,

454
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,639
all I wanted was to make money

455
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,000
and become an official.

456
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:38,120
I planned to use my salary

457
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,679
to support Juli and myself
until we grow old.

458
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:47,800
I've made up my mind

459
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,719
that I didn't want

460
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:55,159
to be confined
to the identity of a wife

461
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,199
or trapped by love.

462
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,000
My Lord.

463
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,000
I have my concerns.

464
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:09,719
You know that well.

465
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:12,800
Therefore...

466
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,399
I'm so sorry.

467
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,120
I can't respond to you.

468
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:34,280
I've thought of these

469
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,479
when I was in Jiangnan.

470
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,840
At that time,

471
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,280
I made a decision.

472
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:51,360
But I was clueless
about what your plan was.

473
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:53,600
So,

474
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:56,879
I daren't make any move.

475
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,560
Before I met you,

476
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:12,959
my life was like a withered branch
dipped in the mire.

477
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,760
I merely

478
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:18,639
lived by the will

479
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,280
to find the truth.

480
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,639
I wish I could witness
a peaceful and prosperous nation

481
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:27,959
before I die.

482
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,399
I've never expected

483
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,120
that I would meet someone

484
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
I want to spend

485
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,280
my life with.

486
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,439
I'd once promised

487
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:41,439
that I wouldn't fall in love
with someone

488
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,600
or marry a woman
and have children with her

489
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,159
before the Emperor
and the Dowager Empress.

490
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,000
But it seems

491
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,959
I've broken

492
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:01,959
the first promise.

493
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,840
My Lord.

494
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,679
How am I deserving of that?

495
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:14,840
If my love for you

496
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:20,000
will force you to give up
on things you like,

497
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,639
then the love isn't genuine.

498
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:27,639
Zhuohua.

499
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,879
If you have feelings for me too,

500
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,239
please allow me to accompany you.

501
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,000
You don't marry anyone.

502
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,120
And I won't marry anyone either.

503
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,199
Let's do this for the rest of our lives.

504
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,760
All right?

505
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:53,959
We'll do this

506
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:57,080
for the rest of our lives?

507
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,879
Yes.

508
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,280
Allow me to accompany you

509
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:04,560
when you're pursuing your passion.

510
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,399
Not all companionship

511
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,320
must be in the name of marriage.

512
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,120
What do you think, Zhuohua?

513
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,080
My Lord.

514
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:22,760
Are you...

515
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,320
Are you sure?

516
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,800
Certainly.

Official Mu.

Busted, thief!

538
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:15,280
I'm so sorry.

539
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,399
You're a girl,

540
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:18,360
but you have great strength.

541
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,199
Where's Ms. Mu?

542
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,239
Young Lady?

543
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,000
She's not with me.

544
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,439
I don't know where she is.

545
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:45,840
It's for you.

546
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:49,479
What happened?

547
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,159
I accidentally hurt

548
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,760
First Prince's arm just now.

549
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,280
Will he hold me accountable?

550
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,560
Don't worry. His Lordship will help you.

551
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:58,679
I'll tell him about this.

552
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,199
Really?

553
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,199
It's sweet.

554
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,600
Isn't this

555
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,359
the broken jade pendant?

556
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,359
This is your gift
for the Tongxin Festival.

557
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,799
Half for you, and the other half for me.

558
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:29,880
Frankly, I prepared this long ago.

559
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,560
I didn't get a suitable chance
to give it to you.

560
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:37,159
All I ask is a soul mate

561
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,719
despite not marrying each other.

562
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,920
I'll take that

563
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,719
as a yes.

564
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,359
Young Lady, your congee.

565
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,199
Come on.

566
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,120
Here.

567
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:23,040
Young Lady.

568
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,480
Isn't this the jade pendant
Lord Ding gave you?

569
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,359
Young Lady.

570
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,319
Is anything bothering you?

571
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:42,319
No, nothing is bothering me.

572
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,880
Money issues?

573
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,560
You want to trade this jade pendant
for money and pay for the rental?

574
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,279
I know

575
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,440
the rental in the capital
is getting higher.

576
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:58,159
Years of the rent

577
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,639
is enough to buy a house.

578
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,040
Young Lady.

579
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,960
We should consider buying our own house.

580
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:05,000
Juli.

581
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:06,319
Look at this.

582
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,199
These are the house and land deeds

583
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,799
of this place.

584
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,040
Wait...

585
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,719
But we rent this house, don't we?

586
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,639
Lord Ding gave me

587
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,560
these deeds

588
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,440
last night.

589
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,679
He said it was a gift for me.

590
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
Last night?

591
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,359
Didn't you say that you wouldn't care
about Lord Ding anymore?

592
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,639
Did you make up?

593
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,000
Well,

594
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,799
it's more than that.

595
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:35,199
Whoa!

596
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:36,880
Lord Ding is so generous.

597
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,159
Young Lady.

598
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,480
Do you think Lord Ding
will hide you here

599
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,799
like Old Master did?

600
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:45,880
That's impossible.

601
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,960
Why not?

602
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,480
His Lordship treats you very well.

603
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,080
I can see that even if I'm dense.

604
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:53,080
Young Lady.

605
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,239
You said that you wouldn't
marry anyone before.

606
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,520
But I didn't expect

607
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,440
you would accept to be his secret lover.

608
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,279
Silly.

609
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:01,080
I'm not his secret lover.

610
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,759
He's my secret lover instead.

611
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,759
Are you saying the mighty Lord Ding
is your secret lover?

612
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,839
He said he agreed not to marry me,

613
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,639
and he would not marry one in this life

614
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,719
for my sake.

615
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,960
He wants to stay by my side

616
00:37:16,473 --> 00:37:19,312
without marriage.

617
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,799
Obviously, he's my secret lover.

618
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,480
I have to stop here.

619
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:25,440
There's a grand assembly today.

620
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,520
I need to leave now.

621
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,000
Put the deeds away.

622
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:29,759
All right.

623
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:30,359
I'm off.

624
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,960
Why do you sulk, sweetheart?

625
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,239
Here.

626
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,359
Have some honey water.

627
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,639
You can come to my room

628
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,359
to check out the new jewelry.

629
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,279
He doesn't care about me

630
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,799
or look at me.

631
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,319
What's the point

632
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:13,279
of wearing delicate jewelry?

633
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,279
My daughter is the most brilliant gem
in the entire capital.

634
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,080
How could he not care about you?

635
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,759
In his eyes,

636
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,719
Mu Zhuohua is the gem.

637
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:31,159
It makes sense.

638
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,159
She becomes a Tanhua
at such a young age

639
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:36,920
and stands out amongst all the ladies.

640
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,719
I can only be inferior to her.

641
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,880
Lord Ding is blind!

642
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,880
How could a mere merchant's daughter

643
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,920
compare to my daughter?

644
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,920
A merchant's daughter?

645
00:38:54,113 --> 00:38:55,993
Do you mean Ms. Mu?

646
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,279
Your father wanted me
to keep this secret.

647
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,359
But it's no harm telling you this.

648
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,480
A few days ago,

649
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,440
he received a letter
from Huaizhou, Jiangnan.

650
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,359
It mentions Mu Zhuohua.

651
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,239
Her real name is Mu Qi,

652
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,480
and she was born in Huaizhou.

653
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,520
She's the daughter
of the wealthiest merchant in Jiangnan.

654
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,560
Isn't she from Yanzhou?

655
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,199
She must've used some dirty ways

656
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,520
to change her birthplace.

657
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,719
How could she do that?

658
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:38,080
Are you sure, Mother?

659
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,319
Could that be a mistake?

660
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,639
I wouldn't lie to you.

661
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,319
I saw that
when I was talking to your father

662
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,839
in the study.

663
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,199
Here.

664
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,040
Finish the water.

665
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,759
Greetings, Your Majesty.

666
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,639
Last night, you promised me

667
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,880
you would take Miss Sun
to the city tower

668
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,679
to see the view of the capital.

669
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:27,000
Why did you walk away

670
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:30,440
and leave her alone there?

671
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,759
Your Majesty.

672
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:40,639
The three princes
were with her last night.

673
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,639
I think

674
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,799
I wouldn't need to stay there
all the time.

675
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:49,040
I'm afraid you left for someone else.

676
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,319
You wouldn't care to spend time on me.

677
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,239
But I heard

678
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:56,080
this person is uncouth

679
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,719
and now has become an official.

680
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,040
Besides, she's hooking up
with Lord Ding.

681
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:05,719
An uncouth official?

682
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,799
This is a serious problem.

683
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,520
Does the Emperor know about this?

684
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,480
If His Majesty were to know

685
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,239
that she's a problematic person,

686
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:20,239
I'm afraid she'll be removed.

687
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,180
