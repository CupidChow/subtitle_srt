=The Legend of Zhuohua=

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,860
(Adapted from "She Was Once
a Playful Soul" by Sui Yu Er An)

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,940
=Episode 34=

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
(This story is purely fictional.)

20
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,110
(Jishan Hall)

21
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:53,015
Did I make a mistake?

22
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:58,455
I promised Yunqian

23
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:01,455
that I would protect his family.

24
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:05,095
But who would've known?

25
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:10,214
I could not even protect him.

26
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:15,415
You're upset at me.

27
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:24,735
I just think that

28
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:27,455
if it weren't for me,

29
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:30,494
he wouldn't have died.

30
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:34,654
The Sun family deserved it.

31
00:02:36,374 --> 00:02:38,054
Sun Ru colluded with Zhuang Wenfeng

32
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:39,415
and embezzled the disaster relief fund.

33
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:41,575
This caused widespread starvation

34
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:43,814
and millions of people were left
without a home.

35
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,015
Did he not deserve to die?

36
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,614
As for your friend,

37
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:52,214
I gave him the opportunity to live.

38
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:56,054
But he chose to die.

39
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,135
Am I wrong?

40
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:15,094
Life is cruel.

41
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:16,255
Who doesn't suffer?

42
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:19,814
He was luckier than most,

43
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:21,295
yet he did not appreciate it.

44
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:25,654
It's good that he's dead.

45
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:27,415
A weak man

46
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:29,374
does not deserve to live in this world.

47
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:32,374
Your Highness.

48
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:35,934
Do you still remember
your initial goals?

49
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:36,934
Of course.

50
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:40,054
To become an Empress,

51
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:42,855
bring change to the corrupted government
of Southern Chen,

52
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:45,575
and make this country a better place.

53
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:49,575
Then, is everything that you do now

54
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:52,334
for the sake of that goal?

55
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,415
I know what you mean.

56
00:03:58,735 --> 00:03:59,695
Let me ask you.

57
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:05,415
The life of one man and one family.

58
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:07,094
Which matters more?

59
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:10,975
The life of a family and a country.

60
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:12,695
Which matters more?

61
00:04:14,614 --> 00:04:15,974
What is wrong with giving up

62
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:18,455
on a man and a family

63
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:19,974
for the sake of a country's people?

64
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:29,214
Everything comes with a price.

65
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,015
Both were black sheep,

66
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:34,654
but why must Sun Ru die

67
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,375
yet Zhou Cishan can live?

68
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,774
It's only temporary.

69
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:43,854
When the timing is right,

70
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:46,734
he will receive the penalty he deserves.

71
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:48,294
Fine.

72
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:53,055
Fine.

73
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:08,534
Such a temper.

74
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:26,575
Uncle?

75
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:35,094
I was not expecting you,
sorry for my rudeness.

76
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:37,015
I hope you forgive me.

77
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:39,895
I came uninvited.

78
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:41,615
Sorry for intruding, Your Highness.

79
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:43,935
Do you

80
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:46,214
need something from me, Uncle?

81
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:49,854
It's nothing.

82
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:53,815
I just wanted to speak with you.

83
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:56,334
Please feel free.

84
00:05:56,615 --> 00:05:58,015
I'm all ears.

85
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:08,935
Don't go too far.

86
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:13,654
What do you mean, Uncle?

87
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:19,414
The one thing your father hated most

88
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:21,414
was to see sibling rivalry
between you all.

89
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:22,935
He wished

90
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,734
for his children to live in peace.

91
00:06:27,294 --> 00:06:31,414
He wished to see you live in harmony

92
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:33,094
and care for each other.

93
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:35,895
Unfortunately.

94
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:39,214
Not everything goes
according to what you wish for.

95
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,695
It seems

96
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,534
that you don't plan to turn away
from the wrong path.

97
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,455
The wrong path?

98
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:51,055
Uncle, what do you think

99
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,214
is the right path?

100
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:57,135
The right path is your father's will.

101
00:06:57,935 --> 00:06:59,615
Since he willed for Chen
to inherit the throne,

102
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:02,135
I will protect him at all costs.

103
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,495
If anyone with ill intentions

104
00:07:05,615 --> 00:07:07,414
dares shake up
the foundation of Southern Chen,

105
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:11,255
I will not hold back.

106
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:14,534
If so,

107
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:16,734
I shall look forward to it.

108
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:25,085
(Wenzheng Parlor)

109
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:28,615
Back in the day,

110
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:32,654
you and I, along with Sun,

111
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:34,895
ranked on the honor roll together

112
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:37,255
and toured the streets on horseback.

113
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:39,974
We were so high-spirited.

114
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:42,895
But in such a short time...

115
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:50,935
But in such a short time,

116
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:55,895
he left us eternally.

117
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:12,734
Sun had a big heart

118
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:14,734
and held no prejudice.

119
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:18,895
He always took extra care of me

120
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:21,375
and I'm very grateful.

121
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:23,055
Did you know?

122
00:08:25,294 --> 00:08:27,214
Sun once told me this.

123
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:32,574
Though he is in the ancestral hall,

124
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:35,975
his heart is with the world.

125
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:41,774
His biggest wish

126
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:46,534
was to see the world
like a wild free crane.

127
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:49,135
And during his free time,

128
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:53,694
to exchange drinks with close friends

129
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:57,375
would have been paradise.

130
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,335
Indeed, he lived a solitary life.

131
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:06,454
But,

132
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:10,694
he mistrusted one man.

133
00:09:19,814 --> 00:09:21,414
I wasn't sure before,

134
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:26,255
but seeing how sad you are,

135
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:29,335
I am certain

136
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:31,814
that you did not

137
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:35,495
intentionally cause Sun's death,

138
00:09:36,814 --> 00:09:38,335
but it was the one who supported you

139
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:40,735
that led it to happen.

140
00:09:43,654 --> 00:09:44,534
Shen.

141
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:48,375
Do you really know Princess Roujia?

142
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:51,054
Did you know?

143
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:53,335
My tutor

144
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:57,095
also had an unnatural death.

145
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:00,654
And the cause

146
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:03,375
was your endorsement.

147
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:18,335
I know.

148
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:21,895
You did not intend for him to die.

149
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:25,654
It was Princess Roujia who used you

150
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:27,174
to lure me in,

151
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:29,368
then sent men to kill my tutor

152
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:31,934
before blaming it on the Sun family.

153
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,015
But Shen,

154
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:41,735
I know you may not have wanted
to be part of it.

155
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:44,615
Since you know everything so clearly,

156
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:46,454
are you sure

157
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:49,215
that you will still enable such deeds

158
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,495
for your own agenda?

159
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,095
Zhuohua?

160
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:10,975
Why are you here?

161
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:13,694
I'm so sorry

162
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:17,694
for disturbing you, Your Highness.

163
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,095
My uncle

164
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:25,414
said something similar too.

165
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:29,495
You must know why I'm here, then.

166
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:33,534
Why are you so polite with me, Zhuohua?

167
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:35,975
I believe

168
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:39,054
that you understand why, Your Highness.

169
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:46,694
You and I are like-minded

170
00:11:46,814 --> 00:11:48,174
with similar circumstances.

171
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:50,174
We have poor relationships
with our families,

172
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,454
and are both aware

173
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:54,694
of how challenging our paths are

174
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,294
as women.

175
00:11:57,454 --> 00:11:58,574
Since that is the case,

176
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:01,855
we should be of one mind

177
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:03,454
and help each other

178
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:05,294
to finish this race.

179
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:14,615
In my opinion,

180
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:17,054
you're not quite right, Your Highness.

181
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:18,975
Which part of it?

182
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,135
In the beginning,

183
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:25,814
I really thought that
we could walk together.

184
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:28,654
Later on,

185
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:33,174
I thought that we just worked differently
toward the same goal.

186
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:36,574
But now, I realize

187
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:41,135
that we are no longer
in the same direction

188
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:44,375
and have parted ways.

189
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:14,975

Why are you here?

240
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:57,615
I walked right in.

241
00:16:58,294 --> 00:16:59,294
Your door was open.

Also,

243

if I didn't save you,

245
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:05,494
But why don't you

246
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:07,135
have any servants at home?

247
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:09,335
You were in the yard all night

248
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:10,494
and nobody noticed.

249
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:14,375
I wanted to be alone

250
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:16,135
so I gave them a day off.

251
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:18,335
Since you don't have servants now,

252
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,135
all the more reason
I should stay and look after you.

253
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,694
Thank you for helping,
Princess Jing'an.

254
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:27,575

255
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,055
Please return, Princess Jing'an.

256
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:30,815
But...

00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:33,895
Don't move.

258
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,135

259
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:41,335
It's none of your business, right?

260
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:42,295

261
00:17:46,414 --> 00:17:47,174

262
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:49,815

Are you happy now?

265
00:18:20,295 --> 00:18:22,575
I'm a foreign princess,
so I can be excused for my manners.

266
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:23,974
Princess Roujia, shouldn't you

267
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:26,095
be a precious and pure being?

268
00:18:26,654 --> 00:18:27,654
How can you come to a man's home

269
00:18:27,654 --> 00:18:28,855
in the morning?

270
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:31,494
You've misunderstood, Jing'an.

271
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:33,775
I'm here to meet Official Shen

272
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:36,174
to discuss matters
regarding Jishan Hall.

273
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:37,934
Stop pretending.

274
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,535
I'm not a fool who would believe you.

275
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:42,815
Never mind.

276
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:45,135
You're young and unfiltered,

277
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:46,934
so I will not find fault with you.

278
00:18:47,454 --> 00:18:49,295
But don't go too far.

279
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:50,895

280
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:53,815
your brother is concerned about you.

281
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:18,895
Are you unwell?

282
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:33,014
Why are you here, Your Highness?

283
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,174
Please return.

284
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:36,815
Why?

285
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,095
My humble abode

286
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:42,815
is unworthy of your presence.

287
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:35,775
What are you doing?

288

289
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:45,974
Don't worry about me, Your Highness.

290
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,855
I'm much better now.

291
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:51,575
Is that so?

292
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:54,855
I see that your ears are still red

293
00:20:55,694 --> 00:20:56,895
so I thought you still have a fever.

294
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:04,694
I know you're angry at me.

295
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:09,055
I was a little harsh that day,

296
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:12,694
but Sun Yunqian's death

297
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:14,535
was a surprise to me.

298
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,214
Of course, I knew you were friends.

299

300
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:21,535

304

305
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:49,775
Since you know Her Highness is precious,

306
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,095
then you should know

307
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:53,014

never took care of others like so.

Your Majesty,

338

my apologies for my manners
before the throne.

339
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:02,454
No need to kneel.

340
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:06,014
I was just asking.

341
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:08,934
What is wrong with you today?

342
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,535
You have been so restless.

My...

345
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:19,895
My back is slightly aching.

346
00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:22,254
I don't feel quite well.

347
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:28,014
I'm sure it's because

348
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,174
you are worn out from working
on the Talent Appreciation System.

349
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,694
Summon an imperial physician.

350
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:40,535
Your Majesty, I am afraid

351
00:24:41,895 --> 00:24:44,895
that it's just a minor discomfort.

352
00:24:45,014 --> 00:24:46,135

360
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:01,174
I don't think Official Mu is unwell.

361
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:03,934
If not, then what?

362
00:25:05,694 --> 00:25:07,895
Perhaps it's menstruation.

363
00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:18,934

Well,

367
00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:31,575
why don't I give you half a day off?

368
00:25:31,815 --> 00:25:33,254
You may go home and rest.

369
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:35,575
Thank you, Your Majesty.

370
00:25:36,095 --> 00:25:37,295

Yes.

376
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:53,734
I shall take my leave, then.

377
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:00,494
Your Majesty.

378
00:26:00,654 --> 00:26:01,974
Please excuse me for being honest.

379
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,734
(Mu's Residence)

380
00:26:04,734 --> 00:26:05,815
My greetings to you, Lord Ding.

381
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:13,014
Thank you, My Lord.

382
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:20,095
This is the palace carriage.

383
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:24,454
His Majesty knew that I was unwell

384
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:26,775
and fetched the palace carriage
to send me home.

385
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:30,254
His Majesty is so kind to you.

386
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:33,454
His Majesty is kind to you, My Lord.

387
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:34,575
I'm nothing compared to you.

388
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:39,815
Is somebody being jealous?

389
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:43,654
Oh, it's my man!

390
00:26:49,895 --> 00:26:50,734
(Grandaunt,)

391
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:52,454
can't you just stay in the capital?

392
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:55,095
You should allow me

393
00:26:55,335 --> 00:26:56,775
to show my filiality to you.

394
00:26:57,654 --> 00:26:58,494
That's right.

395
00:26:58,654 --> 00:26:59,815
It's so far and distant.

396
00:27:00,295 --> 00:27:01,095
Once you depart from here,

397
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,095
we won't know when we can meet again.

398
00:27:03,895 --> 00:27:05,454
I've lived in Jiangnan for too long.

399
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:08,135
I'm not used to the capital's climate.

400
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:14,575
Your Majesty is the Emperor

401
00:27:14,775 --> 00:27:15,934
and has many responsibilities.

402
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:18,095
I'm honored that

403
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:20,135
you are here to bid me farewell.

404
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:21,375
What do you mean?

405
00:27:22,414 --> 00:27:23,414
I am a junior.

406
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:27,135
Juniors typically
bid their elders farewell.

407
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:28,295
I'm just doing what I should be.

408
00:27:29,254 --> 00:27:30,974
Ordinary people

409
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:33,095
at your age

410
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:35,654
would have already gotten married
and had children.

411
00:27:36,414 --> 00:27:37,295
That's right.

412
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:39,815
But nothing I say will work.

413
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:43,254
His Majesty always gives excuses.

414
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:45,494
Why are we talking about this?

415
00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:51,414
Your Majesty.

416
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:54,855
Be honest with me.

417
00:27:55,295 --> 00:27:57,095
Do you have someone you like?

418
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:02,734
How is that possible?

419
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:11,454
It seems Liu Chen has feelings
for Zhuohua.

420
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:15,214
I noticed it when we were in Jiangnan.

421
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:18,295
Will he

422
00:28:19,335 --> 00:28:21,654
lose focus on this

423
00:28:22,254 --> 00:28:25,375
and fall out with Liu Yan for her sake?

424
00:28:26,694 --> 00:28:28,654
You're so sharp, Your Highness.

425
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:35,055
Speaking of which,

426
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,014
a few days ago,

427
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:39,335
I saw the female Tanhua
of Southern Chen.

428
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:41,095
She is very witty.

429
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:43,454
That's right.

430
00:28:44,654 --> 00:28:46,014
Zhuohua is talented

431
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:47,934
and not inferior to men.

432
00:28:55,615 --> 00:28:56,974
You're a young lady now.

433
00:28:57,575 --> 00:28:59,214
Why are you acting cute

434
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:01,535
like when you were younger?

435
00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:04,414
Grandaunt.

436
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,575
I would like to ask for something
from you.

437
00:29:08,295 --> 00:29:10,575
What's mine is yours.

438
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,615
Even if you wanted the stars of the sky,

439
00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:15,014
I

440
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:16,734
will try to get them for you.

441
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:19,375
Grandaunt,

442
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:21,615
can you give me the Evil-erasing Sword?

443
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:27,654
The Evil-erasing Sword
is a national weapon.

444
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:31,174
It can only appear

445
00:29:31,694 --> 00:29:32,895
when the country is in danger.

446
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:35,295
Noble families are in power.

447
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,855
Is this not a sign of a dying country?

448
00:29:40,174 --> 00:29:40,934
Jiao.

449
00:29:41,895 --> 00:29:43,055
Since when have you

450
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,694
been interested in political matters?

451
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,815
I am also of royal blood.

452
00:29:51,815 --> 00:29:53,575
It is only normal for me to be concerned

453
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,055
about the national matters
of Southern Chen.

454
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:57,974
Normal?

455
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:03,895
Jiao.

456
00:30:05,615 --> 00:30:06,414
Could it be

457
00:30:07,694 --> 00:30:09,014
that you wish to take that seat?

458
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:12,174
Grandaunt.

459
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:15,775
Did you not teach me all this knowledge

460
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:17,575
on governance for national stability?

461
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:20,494
You should know very well

462
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:22,095
that

463
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:24,014
I am more capable than Liu Chen.

464
00:30:24,974 --> 00:30:25,775
If I become the Empress,

465
00:30:26,335 --> 00:30:27,494
it will bless the people.

466
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:33,095
I taught you such things

467
00:30:33,694 --> 00:30:35,654
so that you would have a sense
of discernment.

468
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:37,494
I did not expect

469
00:30:37,815 --> 00:30:39,815
to encourage such ideas.

470
00:30:41,895 --> 00:30:44,055
What is wrong with having these ideas?

471
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:45,815
Jiao.

472
00:30:46,694 --> 00:30:49,214
That is a road of no return.

473
00:30:49,895 --> 00:30:51,575
While it seems noble and glorified,

474
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:53,575
it is actually like walking on thin ice.

475
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,615
You cannot lower your guard
for even an instance.

476
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,535
Only an incapable ruler
would walk on thin ice.

477
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:02,295
I will definitely be a wise ruler

478
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:04,095
who is loved by the country.

479
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:07,734
Jiao.

480
00:31:09,414 --> 00:31:11,295
You've had a rough childhood.

481
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:12,895
I cannot bear

482
00:31:12,895 --> 00:31:14,615
to see you take such risks.

483
00:31:16,055 --> 00:31:17,095
I just hope to see you live happily

484
00:31:17,095 --> 00:31:19,375
as the First Princess of Southern Chen.

485
00:31:30,775 --> 00:31:31,615
Grandaunt.

486
00:31:33,295 --> 00:31:35,135
But I only want that seat.

487
00:31:37,055 --> 00:31:38,494
If you really care about me,

488
00:31:39,615 --> 00:31:41,174
give me the Evil-erasing Sword.

489
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:49,494
Impossible.

490
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:53,254
Jiao.

491
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,575
Why would you have such ideas?

492
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:58,335
Just forget about it.

493
00:31:58,335 --> 00:31:59,535
This is impossible!

494
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:06,335
Grandaunt, calm down.

495
00:32:25,895 --> 00:32:27,934
Grandaunt, calm down.

496
00:32:28,575 --> 00:32:29,535
It's my fault,

497
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:31,974
don't be angry anymore.

498
00:32:48,654 --> 00:32:49,454
Jiao.

499
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,855
Return to Jiangzuo with me.

500
00:32:51,974 --> 00:32:53,295
We will live a peaceful life.

501
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:53,934
Okay?

502
00:32:55,295 --> 00:32:56,414
Listen to me.

503
00:32:56,414 --> 00:32:57,335
Grandaunt.

504
00:32:58,654 --> 00:33:00,254
I will not return to Jiangzuo with you.

505
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:03,214
I just want to tend to you
in the capital.

506
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:09,895
Why am I feeling dizzy?

507
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:20,055
Jiao.

508
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,095
You...

509
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,575
You drugged me?

510
00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:28,615
Grandaunt.

511
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:31,895
This drug is harmless.

512
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:35,974
It will only make you weak.

513
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:40,775
I would never hurt you.

514
00:33:48,096 --> 00:33:49,905
(Yingxun)

515
00:33:50,615 --> 00:33:51,335
Qi.

516
00:33:53,694 --> 00:33:55,254
Look at you.

517
00:33:55,974 --> 00:33:57,055
Those who know what happened

518
00:33:57,095 --> 00:33:59,494
would know that you requested Qi
to do the Mu family a favor.

519
00:34:00,494 --> 00:34:01,335
But those who don't

520
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:03,214
would think you're unwilling
to part with her.

521
00:34:03,214 --> 00:34:06,414
Why are you pointing it out?

522
00:34:09,295 --> 00:34:10,054
Mother.

523
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:11,335
Old Master Mu.

524
00:34:12,414 --> 00:34:14,895
Since His Majesty has made the judgment,

525
00:34:15,215 --> 00:34:16,255
it's time to wrap it up.

526
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:17,775
In the future,

527
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:20,215
if we just do as we're told,

528
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:22,534
there will be nothing to worry about.

529
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:24,454
Don't worry.

530
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:25,775
I will keep an eye on him.

531
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:29,175
Even if I can't do it myself,

532
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:31,614
I have 18 sisters to help me out.

533
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,295
Qi.

534
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:49,895
I don't mean to lecture you.

535
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:53,215
Though I'm quite the playboy,

536
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:54,454
I gave every concubine

537
00:34:54,454 --> 00:34:55,735
the acknowledgment they deserved.

538
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:57,375
They are all part of the Mu family.

539
00:34:57,855 --> 00:34:58,614
But you

540
00:34:59,534 --> 00:35:01,014
are even worse than I am.

541
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:04,054
Can't you even acknowledge him?

542
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,215
Such behavior

543
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:08,775
is really unfair.

544
00:35:10,094 --> 00:35:11,295
So, you're fair?

545
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:13,934
But our home is running out of space.

546
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:16,054
Do you think Qi cannot see

547
00:35:16,054 --> 00:35:17,655
what a player you are?

548
00:35:18,974 --> 00:35:20,974
You want to be the Prince Regent's
father-in-law, don't you?

549
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:24,375
Stop calling me out.

550
00:35:24,494 --> 00:35:26,175
Enough, let's go

551
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:27,335
or we won't reach the lodging in time.

552
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:29,134
We'll get going, then.

553
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:32,054
Qi.

554
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:34,175
You are meant to do great things.

555
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,534
The Mu family is unable to support you,

556
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,054
but don't worry, you got me.

557
00:35:39,215 --> 00:35:40,775
They will not cause you more trouble.

558
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:43,215
Just walk forward fearlessly.

559
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,695
Thank you, Mother.

560
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:13,832
♪The water hides the reflection
of the full moon♪

561
00:36:14,432 --> 00:36:16,494

After all,
you didn't come to Southern Chen

643
00:40:33,134 --> 00:40:34,855
just for sightseeing and leisure.

644
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:36,934
All right.

645
00:40:37,414 --> 00:40:38,335

that you would even give me

I am only asking
for the Evil-erasing Sword.

656
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:44,815
Why won't you give it to me?

657
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:47,974
"Only"?

658
00:41:51,414 --> 00:41:52,815
When civil unrest begins,

659
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,534

Jiao.

663

664

Grandaunt.

666
00:42:18,695 --> 00:42:20,775
I never understood that about you.

667
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:23,255
You had the capabilities,

668
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:25,614
yet you had no courage
to ascend the throne.

669
00:42:26,494 --> 00:42:29,014
Back then, you were only

670
00:42:29,335 --> 00:42:30,574
one step away from the throne.

671
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:38,175
But I am not like you.

672
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:42,175
I will not remain in a small place
like Jiangnan,

673
00:42:42,175 --> 00:42:43,215
wasting my life away.

674
00:42:49,295 --> 00:42:50,454

what you never did.

676
00:42:55,215 --> 00:42:56,574

677
